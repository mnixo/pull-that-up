poom and we're live and well I yeah a little closer a little closer all right don't worry fellow okay how you doing very nice to meet you nice to meet you too you're remarkably normal oh thanks I know people are we struck at how normal I am am i it's like wow really I think my roommate a shoe the maze I guess seeing a famous child and yeah yeah that's a very unusual maze yeah my life is unique to me that's what I like to say you know yeah and I'm almost like a peerless person like to a certain extent there's not too many people I can look left and right and we you know I I'm like we have similar experiences yes there anybody that you ever contacted like Jodie Foster or someone who's made it through and seems pretty put together not really no not really I mean it's kind of a weird cold call you know hey Jodie Foster such a small clan of people like if a comic called me that I knew you know who wanted to talk to me I would talk to them because it's such a small people I mean we do have our weekly therapy sessions yeah Jodie Foster you know yeah like we all get together and yeah we we weep you know actually we do primal screaming that's what we do I was describing when it was like I have a friend who Ricky Schroder who is you know obviously he was very famous for news young as well and one of my favorite theme songs TV theme songs and I was saying like the way you developed is not like the way the recipe calls mmm-hmm like the recipe calls for you to have a childhood and try to figure out life and then become a man and try to find yourself and then try to find your path and by the time you became a man he was already famous and the same thing with you you were already famous as you were developing and learning yeah you know yeah III don't know exactly how to like kind of even describe it because it's always the way my life has been kind of thing getting the same way that like a lot of kids like you know they go out and they you know catch bugs and play saying lot baseball or whatever like yeah just like yeah like that's the way it is like you don't really realize how unique the whole situation is until you have perspective because you have nothing to compare it to really other than I guess TV shows and movies things like that so I knew that my upbringing was unique you know I knew it was different but at the same time it kind of just it's not until you get some perspective some life experience but until you really realize that oh wait this was this was particularly weird you know I think one of the aspects is particularly worried about it is a lot of kids that grow up famous they grow up on the set yeah and they grow up constantly around people who treat them very differently than everyone else it's not just that you're famous is that you're famous and you're also the complete center of attention mm-hmm like you're the reason why we're here we're here to do this television show we're here to do this movie we're here to do this thing you're the star mm-hmm and that I think for a kid that's a very strange place to be yeah and especially like I mean I like when I was a kid like me even before I started working I always liked being like the center of attention kind of thing I was too you know I was just I was very boisterous you know but uh but in general like I never really liked being fussed over when I didn't like you know like at the hair makeup costume people like poking at you all the time and things like they actually wasn't a huge fan after a while of kind of like being that at center of attention you know it it does become a job after a while yeah yeah like early on you kind of just do what you do like that's like I was good at it and boom liked it in the same way like that you do look anything that you're like you like it's where the child labor laws don't apply to actor you do do that yeah I'm pretty well-versed in child labor laws well how's that work then it goes from state to state they can work you like let's say like in New York they can work you ten hours yeah but it stopped right there they can work you well if you can't get a job if they're eight that's what you're that's what you're kind of like that's what their limit is at the same time you have to get three hours of schooling in plus an hour of lunch so really you're only you're available window is only six hours or something like that all right day and then like that also in like in that six hours they're always like setting up the lights for the next shot and you know the hurry-up-and-wait kind of part of you know things that's why I like the second home alone it took like nearly five months to film because they can only mean virtually every scene and they can only use me X amount of hours a day kind of thing but that isn't that the only job that you can work when you're eight years old I don't know why you can't be a carpenter I mean I guess you can do modeling you know I mean but like some kind of performing arts kind of thing like there are dancers and so forth mm-hmm because I would say I was a ballet dancer before I was an actor really yeah I did ballet for a number of years I'm a classically trained ballerina right here ballerina if you're a man I call it I say I'm a ballet dancer hmm but there is a weird ballarino like that some of the Meuse and I'm like I'm not I don't think I can call myself a ballerina look I just can't it's two bros so I did that for a number of years and there's a bunch of kids like any that do that and you get paid and you do the work Wow so you know there are other I guess trades yeah it seems like it's no business though yeah yeah that's what I mean I think it's more in the performing arts kind of thing like you know you don't see a lot of kids working the coal mines anymore like that kind of thing yeah for good reason alright but some people think that my six-year-old dyeing a black lung you know there's some horrible pictures from like the early 1900s of people actually working in the coal mines when they're little tiny kids yep yep yeah I mean there are no Newsies anymore you know look yeah did you have any say in whether or not you worked when you were young not really no yeah look it was after a while it became like I said a job and it was I like I never chose the projects they were like my parents can you essentially like chose them for me so you'll news McCallie yeah exactly yeah yeah they called you in a class and like I never read any two scripts look I would I would just read like the lines for like the next day or whatever like I would like get the gist of what the movie was about but then I just kind of show up and hit my marks find my light you know you know and recite my lines so real it's kind of just like again it's what you do right like it's like in the same way that like like kids go to like school or something like that like you know you you you follow to a routine to a certain extent yeah well that's the thing about the human mind right so flexible mhm you could adopt any sort of weird scenario especially when you're a kid I mean okay you just bounce look all the time it's adapt so easy exactly exactly and I always had like a good memory and things like that like you know I liked you know I was I was big and charismatic and I like had a good memory like so I could remember my lines like that's pretty much what like if you you know like not gonna give any advice to any people about like yeah you should put your kid into this line of work but at the same time like what producers really care about is whether or not you remember your lines but they like people you know never work with kids or animals kind of thing yeah it's like yeah and they want they they really all they really care about is you remember your lines really like because apparently that's a problem like for me it never was look if I ever lost my place I would just see the script in my head and just read it look I think I kind of had a photographic memory back then oh it's faded now I'm 37 I'm about to be 38 in like two weeks feels weird doesn't it yeah you know yeah look uh my my bowels are different what's different about your bow oh yeah I know just like I like I just got a uh doing some like random checkup kind of thing and they're like oh we should scope you you know so they also you know they I did the scoping like you know in my stomach kind of thing but they also you know I got a colonoscopy so I was actually hoping like usually were put me under so I was like it didn't really matter to me but I was gonna put you under for a colonoscopy yeah yeah you know at least I had that anus coping so I think I don't know again it's down the throat I was hoping I was actually hoping they were going to use the but one first and then put it in my mouth just ass to mouth boom look at me up but no no they apparently they use different cameras yeah the probably designed different yeah all goes deep right but uh because they were like all worried I might have an ulcer oh into the veins or something yeah again kind of it's been a little iffy and so the good news is I didn't have an ulcer bad news is I have two ulcers yeah so I'm dealing with that I've had to like curtail my lifestyle in general like I'm eating less red meat you know less carbonated beverages like ibuprofen no more ibuprofen like there's no fans terrible for you good yeah exactly so look I've had to like you know I used to like eat like burgers every single day and now it's like I can have two servings of red meat a week kind of thing and what it wasn't too hard for me to curtail my lifestyle like as smoking less trying to drink less like things like that what's the logic behind red meat less I think I I'm not the doctor yeah it's like if you read the list of like yeah things that are good or bad for your alter some things that aggravate it yeah exactly so red meat like falls into that category like it was a funny microwave but chicken doesn't fish doesn't apparently not or at least you know less so weird and yeah might because my special lady friend she was like you know worried about me and stuff so she was reading up on like you know ulcers and things like that and it was like the first like it was like seven things that like that flared up and all of them were like checkmarks really exactly what I was doing in my life kind of thing like you know I had like I said red meats smoking drinking like I had just had like a neck issue so I was taking a lot of ibuprofen like you know and it was just like every single checkmark you know so yeah I've read something about ibuprofen doing it because ibuprofen disrupts gut bacteria and they believe that gut bacteria but was there was something really recent about that a real recent study they think that they found a new cause for ulcers like they've changed what they think these two thing was caused by stress which can do it like also look I just again I have also had like I've just started a new company and things like that so like I have that kind of stress like kind of thing like you know like look I said I hit a lot of the checkmarks looking when you say can do it I think what they were saying was they used to think it can do it but now they think it's all a matter of bacteria in your stomach yeah I mean I think that's a big part of also if you like cuz I did a movie in Thailand like last year and came back you know came back with a worm so you know what are those like single-cell kind of like you know when I was getting the medication for it I was like so what do i what should I expect from this he's like what do you expect you to get better I go yeah but like you know what's like sit am I gonna shit a worm am I gonna shit out and they're like no no no one of those single-cell ones but it made me more susceptible to like getting ulcers you know so is this because the antibiotics that you had to take for the worm or I mean I think it just it messes with your stomach chemistry kind of thing so after that is when you got the old yeah exactly exactly so you know dealing with it like it's actually it's actually not so bad look you know like so how's it do do how does it what does it alter do you know sometimes you kind of get a little pain things like then um yeah like I mean at one point I was like shitting like 10 times a day kind of thing you know what I mean like it was kind of just like kind of loosened your stool a little bit yeah yeah couldn't get some mucus II like I mean I can go in go into it that's what I mean you're asking me yeah I find this stuff fascinating like what just came out of me right when you can't see what's going on it's like behind a door yeah that's happening to it yeah I was like what was that was that chicken I don't know like which meal was that one like you know a guy I'm experimenting with my stomach seeing what it comes out the other end kind of thinking again did you experiment at all with probiotics did you do anything to try to yeah this is a fairly recent thing this has only been like the last like not even two months looking last like him yeah like eight weeks or so so like I am just kind of easing into this thing I have a list I made a little list or like things that are good for me looking or like to eat it things like that like you know make sure I get some yogurt like lots of leafy greens you know ribbon on you jacket you have pinned to the safety pin it's a participation badge participate in life look at me yeah I mean I I mean I went to a UH it was a camp like a summer camp themed wedding back in like almost a year ago some like that and so like they were giving out participation badges like kind of thing because if you participated in things but ya know everyone always asked me about the ribbon like yeah I kind of just a safety pin yeah yeah kind of just you know I mean I wear like all kinds of things but for some reason everyone's like what is that what's that look no I'm participating in life here I am aren't I look here I'm on your podcast you are participating I am participating you seem really healthy like you seem like a like a together person oh yeah I know that it's really stuck in a shocker for people I guess so look you know I'm actually usually for the most part I'm pretty put together look at yeah look I I got a good life now I got have a special lady friend we have a dog and a cat oh yeah yeah it's for a family yeah exactly like there's one thing to like exchange keys it's another to get a cat you know so we we had as you can get a cat together cuz cat can kind of go anywhere yeah get a dog together that's it that's a big one it's a certain yeah she already had the dog but it's like it's a it's a it's a girl and she's a what is she but you knew oh yeah door but looks like a stuffed animal kind of thing and then we have a cheese black and then we got a big fluffy white cat it's like boy girl dog cat like you know yeah like you know yeah like it's they're really really and they're adorable look I've seen dogs and cats play with each other before and it's kind of cute and these guys play all the time it's actually like it's a very special little relationship that they have so oh yeah no we never turn on the television licking our house just watch just watch like the dog and the cat and stuff you know yeah do you do you plan on making people oh yeah yeah no I want I want I'm gonna make some babies you know all that kind of stuff so get this one so this one's a good one so you know I'm probably gonna put some babies in her looking a little bit you know I mean we definitely been practicing but yeah but but yeah no yeah no this wasn't again gonna have a gonna have some pretty babies she's a she's Asian so I'm gonna have like yeah I'm gonna have little tiny little Asian babies yeah it's nice yeah it's it's gonna be adorable look at that door a bunch a bunch of Shawn linens running around the house that's what I'm looking for because it's funny like you know like I I'm like it's almost like I feel entitled to make like Asian jokes because I have an Asian girlfriend kind of thing okay you're loud I don't think I'm well I do it with her like all the time but like I don't do anybody know yeah it's like it's like oh it's like a baby you're my Yoko like you know just like you know like it's like you you're gonna be my downfall you're the most hated person in all of music yeah exactly exactly used to be able to if you were married to an Asian woman 10-15 years ago I think if I I think if I have Asian babies I'd be allowed to think so man I don't even think so because you know I I'd had to deal with it every kind of like day kind of thing it's like oh well like I can you know I understand the struggle kind of things you know I'm trying to shield my kids white male wealthy white male who's famous you don't have a chance I guess I know right privileged blond-haired Aryan male who grew up famous yeah exactly they're just warming their fingers up right there probably write a blog about you thinking that you can make Asian trip I know I know I know well that was one of the things that like you know one of the things I really loved about her like was I remember when I made my first like Asian crack look and I just wanted this and she could have like stopped and then she was like laughs she was like I can't believe you said that like what was it I said I said you know how I know you're Asian she goes why I said this is shape your eyes it's dead giveaway she could stop that's funny you're allowed to say that yeah I can't say because the way you drive bitch yeah I know exactly yeah you have to have a really like good sense of humor to accept that yeah exactly yeah but you know have a special relationship where you guys talk to each other it's like baby you are such a good driver like just you know like just like you know she's like shut up would you stop with the Asian stuff like oh yeah cuz you actually eat she is an excellent driver so well you could tell her you're a really good driver for you know no why that's weird forget I even brought it up I'm like so not racist I don't even understand what exactly like believe me I'm pretty relentless but her family like they also like their they're down with like yeah it's it's I wouldn't even call it a teasing it's just like you're just telling jokes kind of thing looking yeah because I'm the only time cuz I'm the only white boy like you know whenever we visit the family I got yeah it's the foot brand evasion its Ty Lee Ocean oh wow yeah yeah I know I know the ocean yeah yeah I just got back from Thailand oh yeah yeah first time ever that's where I caught my worm yeah yeah so what is this worm like did you fight it was it under your skin was I didn't know I mean look I single-celled kind of when it's in your stomach Oh was in your stomach yeah yeah how did you know you had it I had a lot of fatigue and again like just like my movements weren't all that great like things like that and I remember waking up after about like a good like week or so of it we had just wrapped up like we were like there for like five six weeks or something so I was back in the States and it was just I was sleeping like 20 hours a day and like only like waking up to like yeah like you know just like just shit pretty much and then and then ya know I actually I remember waking up one of those days and I said I'm pretty sure I have a worm looking actually just popped in my head I go like this is probably what a worm feels like it was almost kind of a mono s kind of like you know fatigue like that kind of thing so ya know went there and some like heavy-duty antibiotics for like 10 days how do they think you caught it I'm not sure look oh you were on heavy-duty antibiotics ten days that's probably what caused your ulcer yeah exactly you know I mean like the worm doesn't help and then the heavy duty antibiotics and like all that stuff it's just kind of look at him you know and also again like lifestyle like kind of things you know like you're just like yeah like you know like I can't pound bourbon like I used to kind of thing look even like that's kind of the idea right so um but ya know it was so I think I caught it from a cat because there was actually like a we were in a it was Co PP we that that island and that's like Cat Island stuff and yeah we had these little bungalows and I remember I was like we were just kind of checking in and I pulled my bag up and this a little like kind of kitten just like walked up and just like hey can I come in look yeah sure come on in look I've had a lot of cats in my life and stuff so yeah that little that little sucker like like spent a lot of time and things like that and that's probably exactly like we'd sleep in the bed together and so like that I like sherbert you know like you know tested for Toxoplasma toxoplasmosis I've actually had that before we don't have it then yeah you have for life yeah exactly no I went through the symptoms I caught it from an undercooked piece of lamb actually yeah yeah it's one of the four ways you can get it kind of thing no kidding yeah you can get it from yet from cats you can get it from undercooked lamb you can get it through a blood transfusion and I think the other one is a mother can transfer it to its bitty to the to their baby well yeah believe me I I went to the whole CDC website and everything like I mean and that was like mono kind of thing like a lot of people catch it but they like they just have the antibodies for it and I was a little rundown I was doing a play in London for like ten months and also like kind of going out at night and things like that so I think my body was kind of just like not its strongest and boom and hit me like a ton of bricks like it was that was like mono kind of thing and I was totally run down its I got better after about like three months or so but I didn't get a hundred percent better for about a year there was a crazy article just written about talk so that it had some sort of impact on people who are who start up businesses that they're launched from more entrepreneurs have toxoplasmosis it's a it radically affects behavior apparently oh yeah I mean I don't know hey I got it when I was like 20 so I'm gonna yeah so makes you more risk-taking more more makes you more there yeah parasite found in cat poo has been linked to higher likelihood of entrepreneurial behavior in people who get infected yeah well I just launched my own website recently kind of stuff you know yeah so there you go yeah III blame the toxoplasmosis have you read up on it a lot I mean many of Robert Sapolsky stuff no no no not in a while like you know I mean like I said I caught this like in like 2000 2001 Roberts and Paul skis he's a professor at Stanford and he's a biologist and he's he specializes in toxoplasmosis and primate behavior and a lot of other different he's biologists right so this is a discipline yeah but anyway he he's got some amazing talks on it you really should listen to it since you have it yeah yeah it's fascinating stuff they found a disproportionate number of motorcycle victims people motorcycle crashes taking okay that's what you're saying yeah that's actually that's fascinating yeah it you know how it works at the it only can only reproduce inside the cat's gut mm-hmm and it rewires the sexual reward system of a rat so it makes a rat horny it smells cat piss oh so it completely changes the cat's sexual reward system yeah no that makes sense the the evolutionary advantage you know not to have it absolution air advantage it's it's it actually tricks the the cat into killing the rap and tricks the rat into being horny you'll examine a to come around exactly that's what I mean there's an evolutionary advantage to the man because like yet look if you if you're a cat and you have toxoplasmosis like it's going to you know it's going to attract your prey to you well it actually doesn't no it doesn't work that way um the rat has to be infected when the rats infected then it smells cat urine and gets horny when the cats infected it doesn't do anything to the cat yeah it seems to have no change in the behavior of the cat but then it gets to people yeah so it only affects really the behavior people and rats yeah it's weird yeah but ya know I I caught it I got they got the antibodies for it or whatever yeah it's one of those like forever kind of things but it doesn't affect me like at all like you mean like there's no how would you oh yes I mean look at no it's look at it's just it's a it was one of those things were like yeah I got sick for for a couple of months and then like I said it was like mono I think the disproportionate number of successful soccer teams that come from countries that are of high rates of Toxoplasma infection I should get into soccer well it's just one of those things it's just it changes the way people behave make some make it a little Wilder so you're saying you're you're interested in some toxoplasmosis and you have it yeah top so you're tuk-tuk so Gandhi or whatever is looking in mmm-hmm walks with Madison was this movie in Thailand is my buddy a Seth Green was he wrote and directed a movie and so he asked me to do something in it and you know like I don't really pursue acting I got all kind of thing you know and I'm not saying it was a favor anything at the same time it was like yeah it sounds like fun so at school cast it's like him he's in it brick admires and it brings a song me so do you just like do whatever you want these days and just occasionally act when it comes up yeah if it comes up like you know if it's a cool like neat little gig or something that like yeah sure but like I said I don't pursue it in any kind of like any way like I don't have agents anymore and things like that is that because you're just not interested yeah I don't really like the the pursuit of it you know like yeah like what yeah exactly I just like I don't like being on the circuit kind of thing looking yeah so but yeah I know I am you know I write a lot I paint a lot like I just kind of always have like some kind of projects and then also like I said we got the website bunny ears um kind of thing and what is that that is it's a comedy website it's pretty much like like you know how all these celebrity especially like ladies they have those lifestyle websites all of them well a lot of them do you know look at like goop you know is there other ones oh yeah yeah no it's okay it's a goop ones the most egregious though yeah that's that well that's the thing is that so this is this is like goop meets the onion soup is like goop meets the onion yeah I know well yeah but accidentally you put Jade balls up your vagina I know believe me we had a lot of years yeah we have a beach in a hole does it just do that thing Oh annoying yeah yeah I'd have sex on a beach in a hot tub and other things that seemed fun as a virgin mm-hmm and it's Hannah Hannah you know Michael he's a Hana she's a fantastic writer you have a little scroll and things like so you have a podcast as well yeah we do a podcast also um and we're we have so we're revving up some more like video content and things but uh yeah so this is just a fun project yeah it's it's got a lot of really great writers like comedy writers and stuff and you know it's kind of just like oh look

living in your vagina now it's like I mean we're kind of like taking the piss out of like you know some of these kind of like lifestyle websites you know it's like um it's like you know they'll have articles a gun coupe about like oh the best Cabernet is like for like $200 or something that and it's like ours is like the best Bourbons under you know $20 but then like a turn the spelling gets worse and worse and then it turns into a rant about your ex-girlfriend so like like that it's it's it's some really good stuff like I said we have a really really great team of people and yeah it's it's kind of like I said taking the piss out of things so you just decided to do this just for fun yeah I kind of had this idea with kind like kicking it around and so forth and then I felt like I kind of accumulated enough ideas and then uh yeah then I start kind of Voltron ting it like just grab it and assembling you know like this this this you know this this project this giant giant robot you know yeah so there you go it's it's a lot of fun it's and it's it is funny like we have to like I said there's actually look those articles are really well-written like we have one about do you see infinity war yeah the Avengers no okay yeah oh it's fantastic it's fantastic but maybe like we made our own Infinity Gauntlet and what happens is like I know spoiler alert is I got a lot of the people to kind of just vanish like they kind of just died like you know they turn into dust in the movie in the movie at the end so like when you start reading the article eight all of a sudden just all the words just start vanishing it's like you know and then you have to go back and again it's like yeah even like the letters like we actually had a um we did one where it was a ransom letter one of our writers she her father is actually the therapist for a group like the extra like psychiatrist the official one so we do pass their own therapist yeah you know yes but is it like a weekly advice

look you don't I mean like yeah like how many times am I like I couldn't do that now but I could do it back then kind of thing right so I was like yeah like no I should just fuck it look I'm I'm good I'm gonna live in Paris now you know yeah and it was it was great it was a lot of people have done that Johnny Depp lived there for a little while I know really there for a while no it's a special place and what's special about it I mean again food mines fantastic like the girls are pretty look it's the leisurely kind of like lifestyle a little bit like I like I like their eating habits you know like it's like a light breakfast and kind of gets heavier as you kind of go along in the day you kind of eat later which is kind of like you know like like oh you're American you must want to eat dinner at like 8:00 I like 10:00 you know again p.m. yeah about 10:00 p.m. is like a you know kind of a you know an ideal like dinner kind of time they don't like to work hard either right I mean no I mean they I mean they work I mean I think you know but I like to take their time and yeah everything is like yeah it's a you know I'll set up a card game for like 3:30 like in 3:30 means like 5:00 you know again that's just the way like everyone's kind of always late but it's no big deal that's the thing I remember one time kind of like oh gosh like you know just like where are they and then I realize I'm like wait what is the hurry look for real like what is the hurry like it's like I have other plans my plan is to hang out like you know with you guys and so and all of a sudden like stress would just kind of just melt away I'm like yeah like look you can just be more leisurely and stuff about things out there and everyone's again like I said it's really cool they like Americans out there that's a misconception if they don't like they don't like the loud obnoxious Americans with the you know Mickey Mouse t-shirt we don't need if ya know you do we say fanny packs how dare you and I did yeah nice like leather one you I use inside pockets I got I got inside oh that's my purse hmm well that works too I also have a satchel that I travel around so look at look at this purse yeah yeah exactly yeah you know what it's actually I do call it my purse like you know and day to day kind of thing because it's like someone's like oh it's a satchel or it's a murse I'm like no no it's a purse look you know no illusions here isn't it funny that what you would be insulted or more positive about it if had a different sound coming out of your mouth yeah right it's like no no no it's it's exact same thing it's a purse yeah so um what happened there why did men how come we can't a purses right no one's gonna do that like me it's a few bold souls that will put on a fanny pack and walk out into public yeah but it's not a lot of people that will just actually just call yourself bold an actual person purse yeah you know I mean I'm secure enough in myself and like everything like yeah I can pull off the purse look I mean I wear fingernail polish and you know I have a participation badge look I've got like I'm like you have like fingernail stripes yeah yeah polish but like a little bit yeah actually I almost I actually do do it on purpose look it's like they do make my fingers a little too feminine if it's done perfectly and so but I'm actually really good when I did that movie party monster I learned a lot of like just fun makeup II kind of things and ways to make your fingers look like they're like you're like like they're two weeks old when really like you know yeah like you know technically I mean I could have like painted easily yesterday and they would look like this kind of thing mm-hmm but uh you know he's always just liked nail polish what can I say yeah but you know I'm secure enough to like like wear a purse or something like that like you know I want to shoe with that yeah a backpack though that's where it's weird what's this Mickey Rourke yeah he's got what's called a clutch clutch yeah but he's so eccentric I met him this past weekend he had a crazy cowboy that's we're looking at a picture of Mickey Rourke he had a crazy cowboy hat on and he's just yeah he seems like a kook I mean you can see that again here like that belt buckle like really like that was you know that's something looking at like good on him yeah and he's just an odd duck around yeah yeah I assume so it reminds me it was an old onion article and there's one of my favorite headlines and it was Johnny Depp bound to be 90 percent scarfs yeah he got like waist garfi after the whole pirate movie yeah yeah it went straight scarf like we're the rest of his life kind of things like yeah he really he really committed to that scarf thing listen when you're a beautiful man like that it's an odd transition meeting like a 55 year old I think he's like what's up with Johnny Depp lately not good things I know it's it's really strange actually they just this morning they delayed or like actually like or cancelled he is a notorious b.i.g movie what kind of that he's in with Forest Whitaker and he was posed to come out next month and they just pulled it from the schedule and they haven't like even said that it's ever gonna come out or something and it's like and even just like looking at pictures of him like it kind of just like there's something off about him he used to be really great he's an up what you do to him you fuck Doug Stanhope one of the best stand-up comedians ever there you go he's more of a stephen wright fan myself me too yeah I know right but I think I think Johnny's just he hit that weird spot where you're just too fucking famous you can't go anywhere where you were when you were little I'm sure again but you can coast now right you just go places yeah look how rich is rich enough like dude like Brian look yeah like that's what it means not just that we heap spends he owns 14 houses he owns an island millions and millions of dollars didn't spend like five billion dollars shooting a hunter as Thompson's yeah ashes the cannon yeah did you spend a million dollars no of course not I spent three million dollars I think that's they asked him about his wine habit they said your attorney said that your wine habit is $30,000 a month and he goes that's an insult it's far more far far more than that no I mean look how I look at all right cool like I guess he has to maintain you know that lifestyle well that's what he wants for himself that's what he's doing that's his life his life is spending all that money yeah like his whole life is doing movie that this is the people though also when they're involved in laborious projects that they're not really interested in mm-hmm you know when you're when you're doing something all day and I say this is a guy who hosted Fear Factor really enjoy doing while you're doing it you're like okay time to go to work I mean it was very thankful to have the job don't get me wrong but the reality is it was not enjoy it wasn't a fruitful endeavor it wasn't like working for the UFC or doing stand-up comedy or even doing apart yeah it wasn't a passion project exactly so when you do something like that like people on bad sitcoms in particular yeah they spend all their fucking money they go crazy yeah because the only thing that they look forward to is what am I gonna do with this money what's the reward in a buy a Ferrari yeah buy a mansion and that's I think that's what Johnny got into yeah I I couldn't see myself like doing like a sitcom or a television show kind of thing like that was not a good super good one I do like News Radio is a fantastic show look at that must have been that that must have been like a fruitful what's endeavor reason why I never did another one yeah yeah exactly don't want to ruin that experience every other one that came along was like this is shit oh they pursued me forever me for a Big Bang Theory oh and I said like no I said like nah cuz it was kind of like the way that pitch was was kind of just like alright these two like astrophysicist nerds and then a pretty girl lives with them yikes like you know and that was the pitch like yeah it was like yeah and they're like oh we're gonna get some real like physicist to like you don't do the Matt and I should look at no I said I'm cool like thanks and then they came back at me again and I said no no like I'm like again flattered but like no and then like then they came back at me again and like even my manager was like twisting my arm come on I want a piece but listen I'd have hundreds of millions of dollars right now if I did that gig at the same time I be bashing my head against the wall that's the thing yeah I think that's what Johnny Depp's doing and we can't really be into those pirate movies ya know he's just he's interested and that's the thing is that like he wasn't always like that look now it's like all about the money well this is the thing I read an article with an interview with him that was about two decades ago and he was talking about you know he was in his 30s and he was doing a lot of weird obscure movies like he was that movie dead man that boy yes yeah did a lot of weird shit and he said this is kind of what I really like and I don't I'm not blockbuster boy what yeah I said no it's so ironic it's just so ironic they doesn't vote fuckin blockbuster boy ya know he goes yeah if I ever like if you're if I'm ever part of the guy franchise like just shoot me or something I'm just like yeah they're put up he's weird like old quotes it was a it's a good George Lucas like when he he testified before Congress about the colorization of movies mm-hmm I'm talking about how movies are part of our heritage and you know they shouldn't be tampered with or any anything he goes better he looks like 25 years later he's going back and redoing his movies like yeah it's like ya know like once you put art out there letting it alone leave it alone no it's not yours anymore yeah like that's the thing like once you show like your paintings like that's not yours anymore that's the world's that's an interesting way of looking at it I mean I don't think it's theirs anymore imagine imagine or DaVinci like like just all of a sudden came back into existence right now and he wants to change the Mona be so she's fat yeah I didn't get the smile right it's all pulled back and shit I want to say so should he be able to change it I want to give her some fucking jewelry I never finished the eyebrows push them together come on come on it's my fucking painting yeah exactly I met Wiener DaVinci as a moderate a yeah big tits would fucking glitter it's like he's like it living on like Mulberry Street and like the little fake lips give me some claims casino fucking broad look at her proposed that who's talking about that theory that some people believe that Leonardo da Vinci that Mona Lisa was him in drag yeah that it was a self-portrait who was it talent said that when I was bringing up that's right Carolyn said that the other day yeah I've seen those things what is it pull up a picture of him we just what we never did we only pulled up a picture of the photo we never pulled up a picture of him and the photo that's that's fascinating if that really was the case if he just I did - mm-hmm paint himself and dry well they found all kinds of things in that painting like like in her like like her iris of her eyes there's actually like like letters in there instead of like really really tiny looking extremely naughty fuckin demon comes right out of there yeah ground you know I had a dream that demons were real last night I just remembered it I understand a I had a dream where I was stupid about them Steve almost 51 years old dreams of dreams you know yeah that's a weak fucking thought I had a dream the other day where I was the biggest dick in the world like I was actually just being really rude to everybody here's the there's the drawing of him wow it's like looking in a mirror yeah guys that's Oh hmm yeah you know you can kind of size anything into anything yeah well I don't know about that one yeah the head's a little tall it might have gotten confused with that you know the drawing of the man in the circle and the square yeah well you know maybe just imagined yourself as a woman I mean that's not necessarily him and drag like I I've imagined that before what would happen if I was born a girl that same well I just stare at myself naked in the mirror every day look what I got a dress I could do just a fuck look at my duty easily with Michelangelo he I always used to get them confused Leonardo da Vinci Leonardo da Vinci was the one that invented a bunch of shit though yeah he was he was the Renaissance man ya know he was also kind of an engineer and he actually made like or at least like you know like it was like like a tank or anything like lame as well he actually designed but he designed like weapons of war also like it wasn't just like airplanes or at least gliders and helicopters and so forth but ya know he McGahey yeah look at all the different shit that he came up with yeah that just tanked Wow so you see a ship and you can see like there's like kind of like like holes for like guns all around it and it's like wheels I'm not sure I'm not sure they actually built it or not that's like I kill everybody tank they're so nondescript with where those bullets are going they're going to 360 degrees mmm spitting that thing around but ya know he made like yeah he or she like designed weapons up but no those were canons it must have been right probably that's what kind of didn't have really guns back there yeah there there's in that design yeah mm-hmm wow that is crazy yeah no he was freaked he was a he was red man what keep me hanging out with that guy Yeah right just you know try me like one of your french girls Oh weird no yeah yeah no yeah Michelangelo it's the Sistine Chapel and he's actually more of a sculptor than a painter funny that crossbow you invented yeah but it's like a giant one yeah looking at yeah like one of the ones that they killed the smile worth yeah look at that one doesn't the multi gun the key almost kind of invented like a machine gun like the one just left of that yeah it's a bunch of guns yeah it's a bunch of gun barrels and it was like almost like a like I mean it's like the first design for a machine gun essentially shoots in multiple directions looking again yeah I I would really love talk to an extraordinary person from back then it must have been so different hey give me some clams Casino Lee look at this fucking guy this airplane thing yeah okay like a glider yeah like to talk to Picasso or to talk to DaVinci or any any of these people from exceptional people from Ilocos it was like my favorite Leachman comes to these paintings and stuff but you know I I heard it wasn't necessarily like you know the the like coolest person to be around kind of thing you ever see the they were saying was the deal with them I think I think he was an artist he was very aware that he was Picasso look you know like he was yeah he was already like the most famous painter in the world and he knew it kind of thing hey he actually used to walk around he didn't carry money or a wallet he just carried like a pad so if he want to get like a pack of cigarettes he could just like it and there you go like that's so he'd ever had to like pay for anything because he was miserable shit yeah yeah he comes in and and listen would you accept that trade a pack of cigarettes for a Picasso like yeah I'd take that trade so are those around yeah he actually has a lot of like little sketches like all around they're actually quite affordable at least when in terms of owning a Picasso the key was you know he was very prolific and just look a lot of like ink drawings and so forth I mean there was the SNL sketch it was like Lovitz was playing Picasso and it's like but like he kind of I think you went around kind of just doing anything he wanted and he's like he's great because I'm Picasso like you know and he was just like just being in church everybody you mentioned love it's doing that impression he was on news radio for a whole season oh yeah yeah yeah after Phil yeah he's good guy yeah I've always look out whatever - my blood bumped into him okay very very nice person yeah really really sweet I ran into him at I'm going to the with my buddy Seth Green we went to the pee-wee Herman Broadway show they had a bunch of years back and yeah I ran into love it's like they're backstage so it's like yeah just like me Seth Green pee-wee Herman and Jon Lovitz I'm like this is quite a quite a little well get together this is great this is a great table doing stand-up for a while I don't think he's doing it anymore because I don't see him anymore but a few years back he was doing a lot of stand-up like he was he he was like Bob he bought that John Lovitz comedy club and Universal Universal is the worst comedy club design of all time well you know it's it's weird that he was actually able to find a club that was already named after him he was what are the odds he bought used to the House of Blues it was B beat no it was BB King's club was BB King's Blues Club and he turned it into the Jon Lovitz thing and he was wow that was really interesting I'm remembering that I saw Sean Penn had that older brother that big brother has died crisp ended I saw that guy there play the harmonica hammered went on stage and played look at me I'm Chris been some weird Hollywood thing and I was like wow imagine that he's so famous you just jump on stage and a blues club and play the harmonica and everything happier there I'm not weird yeah but I was hoping he was maybe like Sean Penn jumped up there and did like his type 5 but you would be on Mayer does stand-up I've heard that very strange you know if you're on stage here BB King's place like if this is a stage there would be a balcony but it would be above you like way up there like right above you and so like you'd have to look up to see the people there what so they're basically looking straight down on the top of your head the worst idea for yeah design mm-hmm yeah it's yeah it isn't when you're seeing music you know you don't necessarily have to be as connected to the person's face I've been - I've been to a place where I feel like you were literally right over like the band and I was gonna neat like watching the drummer from overhead like it's kind of neat yeah but ya know just like just watching somebody with a bald spot on their head that's really close yeah yeah I imagined it was taller than that that's interesting my memory is not that good yeah you're getting older yeah yes yeah well it's just it's just getting weird because it's got too much shit in there my brain has too much information she tell you running at a room oh for sure space on my hard drive for new things yeah in like seventh grade I went to seventh grade seventh grade I need that anymore who needs cursive am i right I wonder why I stopped doing stand-up cuz he was actually pretty funny and he was it was weird because he was already famous and yeah one of the things was like I I had tried to encourage Phil Hartman to do stand-up several times because he would do stand-up where he would warm up for the you know the crowd would be there for the show yeah and in between scenes there was always some downtime and Phil would take the warm-ups microphone and do bishhh riff do like his Bill Clinton impression this was during the whole Monica Lewinsky scandal yeah he had like all this material about Bill Clinton and Monica mean his impressions were amazing yeah yeah no he's like he's one of my favorites of all time on that show yeah he was amazing and so he was thinking about what is this Huntsville doing stand up look at that fuck look at those glasses is great get 14 likes Hey I'm Jon Lovitz look at my legs yeah so he's still doing it yeah good for him good for him I said I've always liked them great when I did SNL I think was the first season where he had just left I think because I did it pretty much probably if I had to pick a season I would have been that would have been that one I did because he still had Carvey and he still had you know Hartman and Victoria Jackson like the whole kind of group but forgot about Victoria Jackson yeah she was fucking hilarious yeah yeah what happened to her she's a hardcore conservative now what yeah huge like right right winger she's put on a little weight you know but I haven't we all and yeah yeah no she's actually a hardcore conservative now like she shouts it from the mountaintops what was she like when you met her she was fine I mean listen was she conservative back I was I was busy doing the show kind of thing like that because it's a lot of work and in the tour that I had I hate to do it without cue cards because my father didn't wanted to use KU cards so I'd like to memorize all that stuff plus block plus plus the skits I didn't even make him to the show so I like I had to memorize like skits that didn't even end up in it yeah she is that dad yeah you know I like I said I had a good memory and he didn't want me reading you know because it you can see it you can see when people are reading oh yeah and he didn't want me doing that soon Wow so new cue card but also that means the other actors don't you card for them either yeah of course not you know oh they had like yeah no I'm sure my father made a lot of friends looking and like you know that that weekend well that's fucked up like how can he dictate whether or not the other actors get cue cards I don't know good because he could apparently he could Victoria Jackson's a hardcore conservative so she said she shouts it from the from the mountaintops looking again active mmm yeah so she was like you know so it was that whole kind of group that kind of late 80s group but then also it was a it was Mike Myers second season I think you know it was in the it was like you know Schneider Sandler Chris Rock you know so it was like that kind of overlap year so I actually got like a really kind of like really good group that lingo so that was it's always weird when someone from like a TV show gets really political ya know well like Chuck Woolery from the love oh I know that guy is he's so fuckin crazy conservative oh really nuts yeah his Twitter feed I go to Twitter feed every now and then just to see what crazy old men conservatives are really interested yeah how often does he use the term big news you know yeah the Lib Dems yeah yeah the Dems and the libs they all trait yeah he's guarantee he's got a like a radio show like some like like all what we make sense and one of those things you know no nonsense blunt force true what force truth true yeah you damn liberals he's kind of more like that sounds like a like a band from Brooklyn look at it our concern for crime but criminals would do bad things no matter what find out more by listening to blunt force truth look at that it's hashtag BFT Wow he's a he's pushing that you should listen to some of that just for he he isn't hot yeah I know right you should also for James Woods old dudes who want to put up giant gates so they're gonna make in solar too what happened actor Peter Fonda he's super conservative to know isn't he I don't know they're just Democrats to commit voter fraud oh the opposite I think it's the opposite yeah he's super super Democrat turns feud with Trump into activism bitter rosy all caps Trump rallies his supporters are paid for truth blunt force truth just look at yeah look at that some some journalistic integrity from Chuck Woolery that's his whole thing his whole thing is that now I think he lives in Texas or something think he escaped California and all the crazy libs

not a real person I know I'm just saying I am I'm just making conversation fucking dream you just shattered mock my dream no I was just shit I was asking a question as a legit question like you know like yeah do people aspire to be game show host yeah for sure I know in the UK like host is a thing that people aspire to be lacrosse okay ask somebody what do you do is I host I'm like was that team that they get they usually got panelist on like a show television presenter yeah presenter exactly yes yes apresenta that song actually gave them that was so are so much of a hit that they were a one-hit wonder then and he had to become a truck driver a simplement supplement his income he then signed on as a solo artist had five more songs on his own didn't obviously work out that well then he became the first host wheel of fortune in 1975 it's great so how long did he do it for six years wheel of fortune for six years geez what you're doing start 75 so it was a year after that after that thing we just watched so was it one year later I hope you still had that hair that mean of hair does I think and those yeah and there's the salt pepper yeah there's a little like the sideburns the mutton chops old-school ones go done your job Valerie dispute and then go straight to say Jack imagine a fucking turns it on still on the area shit that's the blunt force I have regrets that's that truth maybe you didn't want to do it anymore maybe that's what it was contract negotiations but anyone straighten to like the dating game or whatever show get to see chicks I guess so they're trying to get laid yeah I guess some said you got you got chicks and dudes trying to get laid yeah your facilitators and putting love together I mean you know got the most action was richard dawson family feud oh yeah he always kissed every lady on the list even like the ones that were underage did you ever see that movie with uh think of speech is he gonna richard dawson the guy who was in Hogan's Heroes with him what was that fucking movie Oh like the music's about that gets nuts super 8 or one of those it's not that the movie were whoo what was that guy's name I don't know okay he was apparently he was the guy was the star of Hogan's Heroes and they just became the freak of the week he's got a mop which homemade porno whore all the time that's all he did that's all he did yeah yeah they think the guy he did porn with killed him is I believe his murder was never saw but there was some sort of extenuating circumstances that connected his his porn buddy the guy was in the movie I think they maybe that was what they implied in the movie I think that was what it was well if it was in a movie it has to be true uh-huh yeah you know it they don't ever lie man true crime that's the thing about movies when they do a story about your life they don't change shit and hit but no they literally get every word right otherwise they would lose credibility mmhmm yeah yeah this there's movies where they change shit you're like why did you change that mm-hmm like they just decide like his historical things because I always say oh it's creative license or like we have to condense things because a person's life is like you know so long and things like that do you remember that movie about the movie with it was with what's-his-name from the office well yes Steve Carell he played that yeah we're both thinking the same thing I was just waiting to get the description I was gonna say exact now that that movie is based on two very famous wrestlers Dave Schultz and Mark Schultz and in the movie they put a ton of bullshit in there yeah and don't mean a lot of it mark was furious when the mat remember reading that yeah and you know you want a crazy wild Twitter storm but then after that like the end of the movie he there's a historic moment in that in that movie that they just completely made up like he fought this guy named Big Daddy Goodrich in the UFC I mean it's it sports history it sounds like that sounds like a WWE wrestler I know it does could have been a WWE wrestler but uh Big Daddy Goodrich who's you know really a pioneer in MMA fighting was this big fucking Jack black guy who wore aggie he wore like a traditional karate gear into the Octagon in the movie they have him fighting a white guy a Russian guy whitewashing they just decided they don't want to see why guys yes America we have we had to fight the Russians I was like why would you change the race and the name of the guy he fought yeah that seems like weird and like petty almost no you know it's just weird it's just greasy producers who think they're smart you've been around them you know those fucks I have no idea what you're talking about tell me more they you know they just decide they're smarter than everybody and they know better they know how to change history and make it make it a better show yeah you know we were it was the 80s ole I guess it has to be against a Russian kind of thing wasn't Haiti's well I'm saying it takes place isn't it please no Jews in the 90s noise yeah it was I think you fought in 1995 I know when Kurt Angle like I know trained in that facility the the Fox catcher he's talking about that how crazy that guy was just decided to set up some wrestling things so you get like weird with these dudes yeah exactly when a bunch of some strong sweaty men like rubbing up against each other it's I bet you those Rhett loos like wrestlers like when they're training I bet you whoever they're training with knows their body better than their wives you know it's a really intimate thing I mean like how could you they know every curve of their trainee grip around your waist it is an intimate sport yeah remember when he was like in the movie Steve Carell was so good in that movie I loved him in that yeah not he played that creep so well he played it like a guy who's like a loose cannon yeah creepy weird he lives can small ya know the way he kind of like his movements and his speech like it was it was good it was good remember when he was well liked he decided he was gonna coach coach the wrestlers and show them how to do certain moves and everybody just sort of tolerated and yeah let him have this one no strain but what a great scene but here's the thing like that that scene was so good but now I know you lied at the end so I know you lied at the end of the movie so now I go well did you make up that scene it starts losing credibility when I did watch I did watch a doc about that I think there's a 34:30 about the Foxcatcher Institute yeah whatever it was there was a lot of footage on that guy in corral yeah fuckin nailed yeah yep on that on Department yeah yeah yeah what a strange strange guy that guy was em hmm mr. DuPont it's just that's an unfortunate thing about those wrestlers like there's no real professional venue other than fighting if they want to go into MMA and he was a coach at Brigham Young Mark Schultz was and he just he fought one time in the UFC and then just stayed they I don't think they wanted him doing it I think that was a part of the dispute is his coach up believe it was Brigham Young his uh the school that he was coaching for was like listen you want a coach here you can't be caged right especially like early like MMA was not respected at all you know I remember John McCain trying to like in again like it was a blood sport and he you know what that was about that was about Budweiser because Budweiser sponsored boxing and MMA was doing very well with pay-per-view back then and they wanted to stop it in his tracks and Budweiser was a big part of that and Budweiser who sort of got behind him yeah that's all greasy yeah I mean the boxing world is so greasy cuz I'm a fight fan at least like boxing I was kind of like always kind of raised that way like I do follow it I've only recently kind of gotten into like the MMA and kind of stuff look I've gone to some shows they're going to see any sporting event is always great live looking in you go to live boxing matches so I haven't in a while but yeah especially I used to look I used to go to like I saw Holyfield more one vision oh yeah I saw Holyfield bo1 like things like that like yeah during that kind of peak you know yeah like that was that 90s era boys yeah did a lot of those but uh those were great but that stuff is so greasy you know I remember the first Holyfield Lewis like that how then in a draw so they could you double up their money and stuff remember that fight I don't remember how I feel versus Lois at all yeah they fell twice did Lois win the first time no draw one draw the for the shitty of one yeah yeah yeah you know losers it was it was a great leg boxer but at the same time I just remember being driven nuts like where he was like where is like belt I'm up to here like it was like way past his belly button he's 40 he's already like six six already and it's kind of like yeah like he's he's wearing that thing too high look you know like he's getting away with murder yeah yeah it should have you know yeah I'm surprised you got away with that you know that that equipment but both most referees will tell you you can hit him here yeah yeah but you know like I said it was kind of just it felt like an unfair advantage especially for a guy who was like like I said six six we're good against already enormous yeah exactly like you know he's so it's even higher than normal and that would be a big target for somebody who's like only legs you know so you follow boxing today though yeah yeah I'm really looking forward I want to see wilder versus Joshua look that's what I want to see yeah take some fury though like he's kind of back in the ring like I said fewer might fuck them all up that's a problem - they're all big guys today are big guys but Tyson Fury looks fucking fantastic there's some footage on his Instagram of him doing pad work you know and he's fighting really soon he just bought like a warm-up kind of like you know some journeyman but it's got about coming up well Tyson does I think I think it just happened like here or somebody or does he have another one coming think he's got it I'm pretty sure he's got another one I'm a big Deontay Wilder fan I am - yeah like it just is wild man yeah exit unorthodox and like man the way he fucking slugs look Jesus Christ this is vicious power oh yeah yeah I watch the highlight reels and just like yeah I mean it's give that guy a seizure there was that one where the boom the guy's glancing just like he's like a flopping around like a fish there's like Jesus Christ he heads fucking hard because he's like six seven he's a big dude he is long to like create leverage smashes right boom yeah that the recent one yeah yeah that was AK from like was losing that fight I stopped Ortiz I thought it showed out like yeah it showed that like he's got like he's got heart he's got a pretty okay chin you know like that he knows how to recover who's your favorite fighter to watch right now and yeah I said I really do love watching Wilder like right now triple G's good yeah yeah yeah yeah he's he's he's look at like he's might be like an old-timer kind of thing yeah look how good this guy looks six foot nine give me some volume on this I could hear this he's thick too but he's he's like showing how slick he is cuz yes he's not just big he's big and long but here he toys he toyed with Klitschko yeah man dude he's fucking good and he gives people fits yeah the new rumors is supposed to be wilder versus fury like now the Joshua like stalks him like you know not happening well yeah Tyson Fury could fuck up that whole thing man so it's the 18th of August and they're both a little unorthodox too so would be actually interesting to see like him square off with Wilder fuck yeah yeah both super-long yeah that would be very interesting but I only be like the first time leathers fighting somebody is bigger than him not just bigger but super-slick he's gonna give him fits yep yep I mean look Wilder can knock out anybody but Tyson Fury he he'll give you fits mmm guys cuz while there is like what like 3700 with 36 knockouts just once it's crazy it's a crazy record yep it's it's Tyson esque like young Tyson hasn't but they're completely different fighters yeah young Jason was just so tight and like you know like and while there's he puts his hands down yeah he wants to counterpunch like you know that's his whole thing what's interesting is people still don't believe in him like I had heard that the Joshua fight like I would think that that would be like a pretty evenly matched fight people like no no like Joshua's heads you know heads above everybody else it's like you know I'm not so sure look you know you take out some good challenges though I mean like Joshua can go he's amazing yeah don't get me wrong but he got knocked down by Klitschko Tyson Fury toured with clich guy putting his hands behind his back and maybe it was not the same as prepared a Klitschko you know miters are different for everybody and clutch goes like yet like aging obviously yes at that point yeah but I just think that that style that Tyson Fury style avoid that shit like measles mmm-hmm get away ya know the reason why Joshua doesn't want to fight while their fury yeah good because also he is the top draw right now look he can sell out like you know like forty fifty thousand in his home country whereas like Wilder like in his home state you fights a lot in Alabama like it's like ten thousand or something like that like you know so Josh was a bigger draw well he's becoming I think Wilders becoming a bigger draw nationally mmm-hmm now but it's it I think that's also one of the things with boxing is like they're always trying to figure out like when do we make this fight do we make it now or do we wait a couple of months let me see two undefeated champions my teacher like that doesn't really happen that often especially in the heavyweight division like something that's like really special someone could fuck up and lose yeah exactly exactly as made me whether Pacquiao all over again where it's like it happened but it happened too late right exactly so stay the fuck away from Tyson Fury kids what do you think about the the mcgregor mayweather like fight it went he would did much better than I thought he's gonna get me to but I think that Mayweather was probably wanting to wear him out and so allowed him to express but he did catch Mayweather with a very clean left he was rapid punching the whole trend that was driving me insane just kept on just punching the back of his head like you don't surprise those hammerfist yes exactly look you can't do that look you know I'm surprised like the ref like let him get away with murder but trade him I think you wanted to frustrate me weather and get Mayweather to try to start open up yeah cuz that because like Mayweather his defense is like super tight and like no he came in there like Mayweather fought a perfect kind of fight he's like just I'm gonna let this guy gas himself out and that's exactly what he did well because when a knockout artist but he knocked him out you know he definitely stopped him but Conor's not known for his cardio yeah he's a fast twitch guy yeah I think it was when they opened up the books for that fight it was a thousand to one from McGregor to win by decision I almost put a grand on that just anyway just on principle I just want I just want a million dollars you know one but I could just sit there and I turn to my friends like I think I just want a million dollars do you know crazy that would be to win a million dollars we're putting down a thousand dollar bet some crazy but those those bets are nuts like will it make it out of the first round well yeah yeah by decision they even have like disqualification bets yeah yeah like exactly like yeah I used to play a lot of cards and I love prop bets just like you know like look in that moment it's like I bet you like I can guess within you know a hundred dollars how many chips are in front of you right now like you know like that kind of stuff for like you know or it's like all right like you know give me you know give me a you know one in ten chance you pull out a dollar bill from your pocket and whatever the last number is like if I get it right you know you can pay me ten to one oh just like weird prop bets like people like like big like players like kind of go nuts with that kind of stuff well gambling junkies do right yeah exam look I remember us playing cards at this one Club and this guy just was sports betting like crazy even but now it's like you know like 2:00 in the morning 3:00 in the morning and he's looking down he goes does anyone know anything about cricket I was like that was the only game that was going on there's a cricket game in India and he was like yeah I'm gonna like late I'm like dude you actually have a problem like that's like you know yeah like you have to like like that's a problem you're betting on cricket it's 2:00 in the morning anyone know anything about cricket well that's the crazy thing about those sports book so you look up and watch that shit yeah like here's a bunch of horses yeah who's gonna win I've actually I have a buddy who does a like Italy's into the races and some like that and like he streams it from my calling it is kind of fun listen yeah it's kind of like but you kind of just range mele like just like oh sure number eight like it was like you know come on eight I knew a guy who got banned for life from chariot races for trying to rig a race because he was his his horses winning and his horse wasn't supposed to win this is literally standing up pulling back on the reins as his horse was winning shit off his name was George the Greek that supposed to call Wow guy from a pool hall in White Plains New York yeah the Greek is like a tiny there's because it was Jimmy the Greek back in the day yeah he was always trying to like he was telling us was it's a little vape he was always telling us that uh he was gonna win the lawsuit I got Kunstler yeah counselor was his lawyer I got consular working on the case got this fucking thing I got him locked down Chariot Racing how do you get into chariot racing duel again I mean obviously you need like you know okay look if you're if it's a swirl okay but like how do you like do you like like fall into how do you fall into that line of work or again like when you're a kid you are going I grow up I want to be a chariot racer out of that movie with Kirk Douglas in the chair yeah exactly just look at you imagine himself with a bow and arrow in the back you know yeah those crazy wrist plates exactly listen Greaves you know yeah crazy movie because if you look at the difference do you like Spartacus and 300 right yeah you look at Spartacus they had like normal bodies like you guys that just ate toast and you know he didn't work out back in like the Roman days like I would I was I'd be considered tall I'm 5 7 like you know like a lot of those soldiers like you know like likes in Spartans and Roman food they were like 5 5 because they probably know food yeah there was like there was a lot of you know like yeah I was gonna say malnutrition but that was kinda like it wasn't straight malnutrition it just wasn't good nutrition like anything a lot of like a like salt pork yeah you know like that could I think a lot of like weird flatbreads you know not a lot of not a lot of green there not a lot of greens you know a lot of just grain and salted beef it was probably really hard to get good food back then like as you're as you're growing up you probably were always mounted nourished and no one was fat either right it's very rare people yeah people were rarely fat well that's why it's like a like a fat lady like was considered like really really sexy because it showed that she was well that she's got some cash exactly yeah that's like the Aphrodite like in Suffolk that it's all very very curvy yeah yeah they went through a whole era where those rubenesque women yeah every desk yeah that was the thing that's what everybody wanted yeah yeah want to give me a big guy yeah man some some cushion for the pushing now we're in danger right now we're treading in dangerous waters even talking about that I know take me to Kirk Douglas find Kirk Douglas and Spartacus comparing them sporadic sporadic sporadic 'it's when you were in Paris did you know this oh there is yeah look at that Doug's a guy who's literally never swung a sword yeah he looks he looks here he only looks old there oh yeah he was well I bet he was probably in his 30s because people back then just aged worse yeah they just I don't know what the fuck it was going on that just a didn't age good it is a is that is the liquor and you know mm-hmm yeah but you smoke cigarettes and you look fantastic you look great I agree what is it yeah let's take a guess let's take guess how old he was during Spartacus it was I think he was a hair under 40 hmm I think you're right I would go 37 what is he 44 kind of looks like 44 yeah not at today's 44 yeah like Daniel Craig's jacked his fuck he's probably like 44 mm-hm how old's Daniel Craig right now James Bond doesn't he have like some like crow's feet or whatever 50/50 jacked really just 50 right motherfucker oh look at that it's looking good how old are you 50 look at you look at you you're big dude look at that jacked mm-hmm you're a big dude but I could take you whoa that looks like fucking James Bond me not all these other pussies he's my all-time favorite James Bond like far that's a real James Bond yeah I know I like his like yeah a lot is steely resolve my other favorite James Bond is a potential James Bond adavi the James Bond yet it's Idris Elba address Elba and because white people are mad yeah it's like fantastic for moving they got like maybe Jordan it's like everyone just calm down look at that right there oh good lord let his body look at that barf look at that he's already kind of got a little little look he's got the beginning of man tits yeah I mean he's not bad it's better than my fat he doesn't look like a guy who fought with a fucking sword for a living yeah but that's how they that's probably close er like more accurate to what you know what actual like Romans and you know not if they were actual gladiator there an actual gladiator they had to swing swords around look at that arm come on then arm ain't carrying no swords just lean muscles lean muscle guys got some veins coming out bro he's jacked but yeah this is Kubrick people who people always forget yes confirm that but yeah that's a man yeah I apparently hated it too like you yeah he hated the movie yeah it's probably one of those things you had to do yeah 60 yeah geez god I loved his movies yeah yeah no this is actually one of the weaker ones really you ever read The Shining no it's really interesting different Stephen King did not like it yeah not like the movie because they did the TV movie yes like in the early 2000s even weddings Steven Weber yeah and he just decided that you know like Kubrick had made Jack Nicholson crazy already yeah and he didn't like that yeah and he wanted a guy that was turned crazy by the house yeah yeah yeah but how the fuck you gonna do that in a two-hour movie you know what's not scary hedges you know there's a thing is like it probably like you know I bet you if you know you read it or whatever it's probably seems creepy like when he's like talking about how the hedges are moving when he's not looking in something that but when you physically see it it's not scary at all you don't I mean like yeah like it's just like things like that like just the thing to really translate but it worked in the book the books amazing the books really it's a big-ass book - it's a Stephen King I mean I think it's a big-ass book yeah there's a Mesa confusing it was a The Dark Tower series there's also the stand is really thick yeah that's a dictionary paperweight he was I mean it still is but so fucking pearl if there's a thing with the at the mazes it's like yeah like the mesas keeps on kind of like changing like the one the one that you see in the model there and the one that exists and there's also a map on the outside of it all three of those are different bushes and get a look from the top I think it's like kind of more like stems I don't think they're like thick branches just hack your way through just walk straight yeah that's true spirit of bushes what are you scared of the moisture come on well the hedges that are moving you know yeah in the book so monsters mm-hmm yeah they're it's kind of like you know these like like Edward Scissorhands esque like kind of like you know it's a kid yeah it's like and then it's like oh it's moving when you're not looking like oh that's an adorable cat hedge that um that place that wood that's supposed to be the esses park is that what it's supposed to be that area was supposed to be somewhere in Colorado that's like that yeah I mean I think that's where they filmed it or at least the you know the outdoor some of it and I think they filmed some of it also in upstate New York yeah yeah like yeah but it look in and then get like a studio I think I think was from London usually Kubrick worked in out of London but yeah the Overlook Hotel there we go yes yeah it actually is like it's not called the Overlook in real life but yeah it's in Colorado yeah that was a fucking great movie yeah so creepy and weird so many of him her eyes wide shut that was another one yeah that's and that's his last movie yeah a lot of people didn't like that one I thought that was fast yeah I you know I'm a little soft on it I released when it comes to like I mean it's still great right I put it lower on my Kubrick yeah Clockwork Orange 2001 I mean like it again you name it you know it during his spare time he used to do complex mathematics that sounds about right yeah it was like genius yeah he's a archives in I think it's in London but there's actually disdaining Kubrick like library and you can kind of go through his scripts and his notes and all kind of stuff look you know there's some you know like a whole like archive but it supposed to be kind of pretty neat you self over making movies like producing or directing maybe writing if it's you know piques my fancy kind of thing if it piques my fancy mm-hmm I'd be open to doing so make that you know like a matter of what kind of the right kind of thing run timing and so forth yeah like right now wouldn't be ideal but like you know a year from now like yeah I probably might be a little freer like that kind of thing you know yeah like you know hopefully the company will be moving on it so and buy that kind of thing okay here's something I want to ask you about Paris this is one thing that I was only there for a short period of time but one things I was shocked stuck shocked by shocked is that all those people are eating a bread and they're all eating cheese and wine and no one's fat yeah what the fuck is that again it's kind of the way that you couldn't eat how you kind of thought you know you have a light breakfast but a heavy dinner I think that has to do with it and also you can't call yourself a boulangerie like a bakery unless you make everything from scratch like so everything's made from scratch and like the thing is is that like you're like baguette will be stale in 24 hours same thing with the croissants like there's no preservatives and anything let's think like all out in general out there like all your food spoils faster lucky in your fridge not because like yeah it's it's you know like it's fresh there's no hormones and things roads he was an oncologist from Paris and he lived in America and he went back to France and brought back cheese because the cheese that he could get over there was not homogenized or pasteurized and literally illegal here yeah so he would have to tuck it in his carry-on or in his checked luggage and just hope that no one would check the wheel of cheese excuse me sir when he served it to us it was like precious yeah this precious cheese I mean they make raw cheese in American now but it's like specific and like yeah like you have to like you know it's like it's Tiki kind of thing very boutique you know niche kind of thing ya know see thing would they like their eggs if they don't refrigerate their eggs over there because it's done in a different kind of process like I think I forget what it is that I get from my chickens you don't I don't refer yeah you know after a while no you can wash them but I think in America it's I think we like I think it's like we I think we like like like hit him with it like super hot water there's a different process than they have in Europe so in general you're not supposed to refrigerator eggs there we're in the States you are supposed to hmm and just a different it's a different process of how things are done yeah the preservative thing makes a lot of sense yes our lives and I think there's also there's also different shit that's in in wheat and there's different kinds of wheat they have heirloom wheat with it's like older wheat before you know we started messing with it yeah and they also they're their cattle and things like that it's a grass-fed whereas in the states it's corn-fed right and also I just noticed like in general out there like I was eating less red meat you have a lot more chicken and a lot of pig lots of ham but you know that kind of thing ham is a very lucky man well it's dried or whatever looking at yeah and just cured legs yeah I just take that thin slice I'm actually going they're going back in a couple of days so yeah you know really Nancy because I'm going out to Berlin I'm doing this thing it's called the people festival look out there and so I'm gonna do something like hang out with some friends I know like a good label fest it's called the people festival it means a music fest and I know like a good like twelve or twenty like of the acts girl I couldn't like they're like my friends and stuff you know so get to like go to Berlin and I'm gonna be like the roving reporter pretty much yeah I found myself you know something to do what about there yeah it's gonna be like podcasting and so forth because there's a lot of like yeah there's a lot of like cool musicians doing it so oh that's cool so yeah it's a so good like I'm kind of like fine from LA to New York spending the night because I hate taking like super long flights and then New York to Paris yeah and then you then you know Paris to Berlin you know even when you do that yes I travel at my whim I should have a Manhattan in my hand like haha Oh shall we book you a straight flight to Europe no no of course yeah that's too much time in the air I like to puddle jump I want to go to New York I'll go to New York perhaps I'll shop perhaps a shop in Paris in power II go to a cafe mm-hmm maybe I'll take the the channel to London just for a day trip I've arrived a fantastic t-shirt shop and I love now one of the things that people were in America that don't go to Paris or worried about it's like people hear horror stories about the immigration nightmare in Paris and that Paris is somehow another turning into this criminal cesspool because of all these immigrants and it's very dangerous there now hence those shootings that you heard about and the you know it is actually one of the most ethnically diverse cities in all of like Europe like I was actually like you know um you know you you see more like black people and like the first five minutes of being there than you do in the whole of like Oslo or lik Berlin or something like that ya know it's it is like kind of its culturally and ethnically like diverse you know when it comes to all this like shootings and things like that they're guilty of being landlocked you know the UK can kind of control the the you know the flow of traffic you know people kind of coming in and out because they're an island nation where it's like with the kind of open borders but that you can you know you can buy a gun in Greece and take the train you know like all the way over look you know especially when it comes like the old uh was the like the Balkans or whatever like you know there's a lot of leftover soviet-era like coalition of coughs that's why they always have like a these Russian made like guns and so forth and yeah like that's what I mean if it's easier for so you know somewhere like the UK to like lock off the reporters or at least have like you know where is France it's like they said it's guilty of being landlocked essentially the you know these more difficult to secure is that the blunt-force truth yes blood force truth PFT and that's the BFT yeah they people should start using that the PFT has the hashtag PFT PFT PFT coming your way it's like delicious but they the the the big fear like the one thing that people were terrified of was that this was going to happen to the rest of Europe that like what's happened to Paris in Paris is falling apart and you can go through the ghetto areas in Paris and you know there was a someone filmed something where a Jewish man walked through these Muslim ghettos and they're screaming out I'm all these anti-semitic things and I have not seen that but you know my neighborhoods are only a couple blocks away from like the Jewish kind of neighborhoods that's good spot to live it was good to live near the Jewish folk together yeah I'm gonna New Yorker so I'm like I'm already half Jewish you know house in New York recently we were in Brooklyn and I was with Ari my friend Ari who grew up Orthodox Jew and he took us through this neighborhood where they have like the crazy frisbee fur hats on the curls and the pace mmm in the the fucking the yarn hanging off their belt yeah we're chin and you know who's basically saying like these people like they are here but they're not here like they don't know what the fuck is going on they have no idea who Kim Kardashian is yeah they don't listen to any of the music they all stick together they intermarry the Marian cider community if they get married young in the cab yeah and it's so interesting seeing them all walk and they've sang through the sheets you know that some of them do right yeah citic though yes just a whole way so I think just throw a sheet over and just you know just perfectly frame the vagina right there I'll take care of it from here they don't want to touch naked women right is up their ideas yeah I think it's a modesty kind of thing no we're kind of like tradition okay I do that at home just for fun yeah honey why are these where their holes in other sheets gosh she just wants this Jesus was a Jew it's okay okay so like this this community that we were driving through is massive like Brooklyn yeah I was gonna say Brooklyn like kind of in the southern kind of a massive community yeah I didn't know how big Brooklyn was yeah it's it's big it's fucking huge it really is yeah it's kind of like you're talking about the neighborhood that kind of like north of Red Hook but right there on the river because I but I walked from my place and low Manhattan all the way down to like Red Hook like one day and it was a long it'd take like maybe about an hour an hour ish but it yeah I'm I work I walk at a New York pace you must have been sprinting yeah I'm uh I walk into New York base Walker that choice if you run seven miles an hour that's like a fairly good clip it's gotta be more than seven miles um no no no it's not look you're just understand the whole of Manhattan is I think it's like 14 miles it's a 14 by 4 and I'm already living like in the southern part yeah yeah it's probably I don't know like about 3 3 miles yeah that 3 miles I walk in about 3 to 4 miles an hour one of the guys that was there with us the guy who was driving us was telling us how Brooklyn is just overwhelmed with building construction apartment buildings now and everyone's moving out of Manhattan and into Brooklyn yeah it's it's because the thing about Manhattan is that it's finite right look you know so the only way like hey you can build upwards but you can only do that so much and so it a lot of people are getting like displaced like you have to have enough money just to stay on the island of Manhattan and even people like that are getting displaced then like yeah they it's Brooklyn Queens etcetera Hoboken the people that I know that live in Manhattan always have this thought in their head that one day they might live in LA yeah even Bourdain was saying sometimes I think about it I think about the weather and I know there's a lot of good things about LA a lot of nice places LA I lived here for the better part of eight years like my early 20s and stuff and it's a you know I mean it makes you soft I mean like it because it yeah I think just like with the weather and things like that and it's also like yeah that leisurely kind of like kind of thing like there's not a lot of drinking it's a lot more smoking we've just because like everyone has to drive you know some nobody like you know so everyone's just like um it would buy so fast because there's no seasons right it's all the same so I blinked it was like wait I've been living here for five years look I'm from New York it's like we have we have lucky summer winter winters long it's one of the few like major cities like where you have a hundred degree weather shift in one year it could be a hundred degrees and later that you can be zero degrees yeah that's true that's interesting so it's kind of like it's kind of a harsh kind of climate a little bit in the summer is there like suck cuz it's just the humidity it just sticks to you and it's smelly look at me I'm not a huge fan of New York in the summer yeah it gets very pissed like yes yes it's sticky at 60 your hair like I've never lived in the city though you know and I might have missed my shot because you know now I'm married and kids and the whole deal and I'm so sorry and a stand-up comedian it's a lot of the the only thing that we could possibly make me live there was that like I could do stand-up there very easy yeah yeah you know there's a lot of like yeah well I think the island of Manhattan only has like six of them technically it's like five or six six wha comedy clubs I couldn't think it's not for sex yeah there's got to be more than that I don't know look it's because I have a buddy who's the seller has two clubs there's danger fields there's Caroline's there's uh Eastvale comedy club this my buddy opened up one in like 2010 oh we're ready at 7:00 yeah well he opened up one like in about like 2010 or something done he was talking about he goes actually there's not yeah I mean he was actually you said like yeah it goes when I opened up there was only like six you know like he was like the seventh one or some like that really it's surprising at least on the island of Manhattan itself there's not as many comedy clubs as you'd think do you know even though it's a mecca in the turn of the century night the 19th to the 18th to the 19th to the 20th century there was a thousand or close to a thousand billiard halls Manhattan oh geez yeah yeah no no that's what men did before video games and pretty much and that's like when men didn't want to have families they the match bachelor life would they would live in these pool play billiards yeah gamble mm-hmm and a smoky smoky pool hall no there's I just play a lot of pool of its voice oh yeah there's actually not a lot of billiard clubs there anymore look at you I mean I'm saying they do exist but like you know there's like only us like I had a smattering of them this bowling alley is like there's only yes yeah yeah I think even like Bowman were like moved like kind of thing look into that was the trendy spot this is gonna be like croquet someday yeah my god we'll play some badminton yeah forgotten arrow games yeah let's play some squash but do you do you are you enjoying it out here now yeah I mean I have a good life out here like a really pretty little family you know I got a pretty girl pretty dog pretty cat no it's tough yeah we're gonna move we're gonna like you were doing a house thing a house yeah well she well she is and I'm just gonna hit right he's yeah more more my ship in or just Rhonda it sits on her like she was already looking and so like yeah so I think she's in escrow like right now essentially it just started like today but if it goes south she could just fucking boot you just get yep yep just again get my stuff yeah yeah I'm my place in New York - I bought I bought like in like the 90s oh I'm doing okay yeah bought a proper loft like I I said I big syndrome I saw the movie big and like that's what I want so the elevator opens up to like a big room and look at me yeah look I've uh I have more mannequins than like you would like think like we used to have an American Apparel downstairs and I was walking like out one day and there was just a pile of mannequin parts I was like oh my god look if you get these look in his eye then I told her I told my super or like you know cuz it's in the same kind of building complex I said listen they're ever to get rid of like any mannequin things like tell them to come to me first what's a fucking clothes down and like yet like I got like I have so many mannequins it's ridiculous just these mannequin parts I have no idea what to do with them either I know I give them away like it's like presents like here's a leg you know we'll be talking about all the different little cars that you bought yeah yeah but you'll again every time I go to the pharmacy have to buy a toy car and now it's like I tried to double up on things so it's like only one ambulance only one firetruck only one Corvette ya know it's like now it's getting ridiculous but I for some reason I caught I like I hoard think and I collect things like you know and at the same time like I'll figure out what this is for kind of thing like you know I'll do something with those mannequins at some point somebody like those are gonna pay off I swear that's the kind of shit that drives women great raise late ladies and gentlemen I'm going to say invest in mannequins it's a it's a growth industry it's it there's a high ceiling on mannequins I'm telling you kids I think that's a freedom thing where you do whatever you want so you're like fucking I'm just gonna buy a man again yeah yeah yeah mmm so yeah I when they closed down it was like yeah I got like 20 mannequins do you get him for free no so they were gonna like sell them and it was something like there was like oh we have like 16 of them well some to you for $500 and I said listen I said I could do that or I could pay you you know or I can give you $40 I can give you $200 for them and then give you $200 because the place is closing down so you know the store gets the $200 but then there's another 200 in your pocket kind of thing because the store is closing down anyway well cuz they're because they're not going like they don't have a job starting next week so they really don't care so look yeah so I got him for cheaper like just by pretty much bribing the dude hmm you should
