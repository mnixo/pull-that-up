ready um four three two one boom and we're live you would just tell me you just tell me how your son is getting into Bruce Lee because we're looking at this shout out to how you pronounce his name correctly Bruce Lee no plasti sell the plastic cell dude I'd only seen it written when shefte to actually maybe buddy I passed a cell I believe his name no but but I mean how do you pronounce the artists name I think mr. Fong I'm Tran yeah shout out the phone this thing is the shit his art is amazing these little plastic sell things Rory MacDonald how great is that yeah the whole lineups amazing yeah I mean those are he come off nothing but legend today but yeah um you know I wanted how old's your son now he's six now and you hear these stories um constantly about people remembering the first time they saw a Bruce Lee movie it's so epic I'll never forget my dad took me to the theater blew my mind everyone's got a storage always got his the first time he saw Bruce Lee so I wanted to make sure I didn't do that too early because then he would forget you know cuz if he forgets special last moments we had together for like three years ago Mike you don't remember that you know it's only five right maybe six he's six imagine how quick your brain is growing and you forgot a lot of shit you know but anyways so I thought maybe I'm gonna hit him with the I'm gonna sit him down and and and put on Enter the Dragon and blow his fucking mind but I don't want to do it when do I do it I'm thinking maybe I I could even wait to least ten or eight or whatever you know but he's been doing karate since he was three so about three years now he's been doing karate and he took a nunchuck workshop class at the head so he's got his little you know those padded nunchucks he fucking loves those things man and I thought shit he's getting into the nunchucks it might be a time to drop Bruce Lee on it you know what I mean I don't want him to get twisted we known to me because he starts he starts talking about Jackie Chan and shit like that and I'm like Oh has he seen anybody do it on video or only learning from this is what happened so he's all ndon and chucks he's beating me up with them all the time he loves nunchucks and I and I said oh then I wore one of those roots of fight shirts and it was Bruce Lee with nunchucks right and he looked at my shirt and he said daddy it was the guy with the nunchucks and I thought okay it's time it's time son sit down so you know kids are so easily brainwashed I can get my kid into Satan as yeah yeah he's amazing he's amazing outfit a jumpsuit he's amazing and he's got he's got the game of death sequence down it says the video is my son and in parentheses 5 year old acting Bruce Lee's nunchaku scene yeah yeah he reenact the whole thing no four-note I think he was on like America's Got Talent or some shit too so I sat him down and I and I explained to him I go the master of the nunchucks the number 1 guy you know cuz like like I was like I was saying earlier you could get kids to believe in anything you get brain I could I could get my son into Satan easily he'd be all I'm all about Lucifer oh I got him into the ground towards kids you know yeah totally he's he's so into the Dodgers because his grandpa is into the Dodger so he's all about the Dodgers and I got him into the Browns he's all in the Browns not too because I mean I could get him into anything so I sat him down and I say you were but I'm gonna sit you down and I'm gonna show you the master of the nunchucks and it's Bruce Lee he's number 1 he's dead he's the greatest martial artist of all time I broke him and I sat him down and put him in front of the TV I did you fell the whole thing he filmed you saying it to him no I didn't film that but I filmed it I filmed him watching Bruce Lee first I showed him the greatest nunchuck scenes of all time with Bruce Lee the eel on YouTube and you can get there's there's compilations they put the one from the stuffin in the dragon the stuff in Chinese connection way of the Dragon and will return of the dragon and so I sat him down and goes I'm gonna blitz him with this shit I'm gonna make sure that whenever he thinks about fucking nunchucks he knows that Bruce Lee's the master right so he's just completely blown away then after I showed him other nunchuck scenes we I sat him down and I wanted to show him the greatest fight scene of all time Bruce Lee versus Chuck fucking Norris come on man so I just wanted to leave that just in his DNA and I film that I filmed him watching Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee and he always wants to know he loves he loved Bruce Lee instantly and he he needs to know who wins the fight so fake daddy does Bruce Lee when I go he always win son he always wins and but my natural reaction cuz he's constantly asking questions he's constant does he win my natural reaction would be just watch watch you gotta watch this cuz it's gonna be sweeter if you watch it and you go through the ups and downs and it goes no daddy you need to tell me now and I couldn't know you're gonna like it more if you just watch it you got no daddy does Bruce Lee win he wants to fucking no he don't want to be disappointed yeah so he's got years old yeah he got completely blown away so a week later a week later I got today you're gonna watch the greatest martial arts movie of all time Enter the Dragon visits Bruce Lee dad isn't it yes so he sat him down we put on four and he can't stop asking fucking questions about every guy there K daddy who are the good guys and who were the bad guys is he a bad guy is he a good guy so we got it down the three main good guys you know Bruce Lee is the main good guy Williams I was um his name escapes me the black famous martial artists Jim Kelly Jim Jim Kelly's awesome and he did die in the movie which I mean they were doing that shit back then you know what I mean and then Roper John Saxon he was the third good guys yes it was Roper will you and Bruce Lee and they were all they were the good guys and the bad guys do you remember the bad guys names no han was the the dude on the top left he's the he's the guy with the claws former Shaolin monk who went bad and started selling heroin on this island and and and and prostitution rings and all that I completely forgot the plot of this movie are you kidding me yeah it's the greatest fucking watching it but it it's you know I didn't take it seriously I always thought it was fun I was always looked at it not like holy shit we're gonna see this wild action movie I always thought of it is because by the time I watched it it was kind of campy I'm sure watch um when I was a little kid yeah II don't remember yeah you got to go back and watch the whole thing cuz everyone you know that's that's most people's common reaction like you just remember you remember the the scene with Han with the razor hand that's all I remember he had a razor head he had a claw hand you remember bolo yeung and they're fighting outside in the tournament you know you remember all that shit you remember Williams getting killed they hung them you're you remember Williams fighting Han there's certain scenes everyone will remember and you just you forget about the little scenes and the plot so I sit down my son I set down my son and we're watching this and my mom or his mom's like it's appropriate for a six-year-old right it's not gonna get too crazy I go it's fine it's just a bunch of karate no it's it's fine so she's all like honey so we're sitting there and he can't stop asking goddamn questions he can't stop asking God to have questions the bad guys are Hans the main guy ohhara Bob wall remember him everybody remembers he had the scar on his face and they everyone remembers that he was him and his gang were chasing Bruce Lee's sister in the movie and they cornered her and she had to kill herself she just killed herself before they could like rape her or whatever people people remember that that's a another classic scene but you don't remember you don't think about all the the shit in between man cuz the plot the plot of the story is Hahn lives on an island and he has he does a lot of illegal shit he runs heroin and prostitution through his Island right and he has a tournament like once a year and he invites all the greatest martial artists on earth and he tries to recruit them he sits them all down and he shows them his uh like underground operation going on you know what I mean so he tried a Tong Roper into it he tried to talk Williams into an array and Roper almost went for because he was a kind of he's a good guy but he was like a gambler you know what I mean he's kind of shady but at the end he's like fuck this I'm gonna do this shit so that's what he doesn't and he called him Bruce Lee - and he was gonna try to recruit Bruce Lee but the CIA got ahold of Bruce Lee first the Bruce Lee and they sit him down in a dark room and they're playing a projector and they're showing you know they want Bruce Lee to go in there undercover to uncover all the garage rights the crime and all the stuff that was they doing selling drugs yes drugs and prostitution and and doing mind control on so what so I'm sitting there watching it he wants to know who the bad guys are bolo bolo is a bad guy O'Hara who's Bob walls a bad guy and then Hans the main bad guy so he's constantly asking questions and then boom you forget about the scenes where Han Wood has like a Madame and he's got all these hookers there's a hooker scene you forget about the hooker scene they send like five girls to Williams who's a good guy in Roper to try to corrupt them you know what I mean and boom is soon it they're all in their gowns and in robes and Williams like in are in a robe and I grabbed a remote and just started hitting fast-forward and my sons all ooh what's going on here what's going on here dad why are you fast where I'm God nothing's going on what are they doing they're getting ready to go to sleep just forget about that same poem you you forget that there's a is this the same there it is right there and there's titties and everything but um yeah he got he was blown away and a mission accomplished he's Bruce Lee number one in to him and but I'd made a mistake next week I made him sit down and watch return of the Dragon which the end scene was a great scene with Chuck Norris and the old Rome Coliseum but the whole movie before that is so bad it's so bad and Bruce Lee he directed it and and wrote it and it was it's atrocious it's for the end but it's like high school kids put together that man's terror I gotta have to go back a while you know we should do it we should do a fight companion and watch any of the Dragons that would be fucking great dude are you kidding come on man a fight companion so there it's takes place in Italy his one of his like think his uncle or or just somebody knows has a Chinese restaurant in Italy and the Italian mob these guys these are the goons they're trying to run them out of business and and control their business or pay off to take the building or something in there they're resisting in Italy so they send Bruce Lee from Hong Kong to handle the mob to Italy so it's just partying too much doing a little blow having a good time out in the town beat a big Hollywood star put together this movie and you just got a little crazy with it you know what this is before he blew up though this is because he did this movie he did Big Boss Chinese connection and this one was his third one and then after this is when Warner Brothers came in and signed him that's when they did Enter the Dragon that was his last one and of the Dragon was had a budget this isn't really any budget this is a like just cheap Chinese production you know it's crazy when you think that there was really no one like him before him look there's Chuck Norris waiting you know when when you think about there was no movies like this before this this fight seemed greatest fight scene worst movie how about the grab of the chest hair pulls a chunk of it out yeah do that Oh a chest hair bitch I mean it's it's funny watching it with no volume to because it's so corny it looks and it's all over Dublin and it's it's god-awful but dude his martial arts technique especially when you think about that the fact this was what 1974 so that was like 71 71 it was probably released in 76 but he died in 73 he had incredible technique like really good technique like his kicking technique especially for back then yeah I think because of the YouTube and shit there's there's so many guys out there that they're doing like these jumps spinning 360 wheel kicks there was some guy that Winkeljohn Jackson had on his the Instagram page and it's a Korean gentleman doing some fucking ridiculous shit just like jumping 360-degree wheel kicks and like a series of them cartwheels flying through the air and doing all these things like none of this was ever in the movies before you know - like when like maybe Jet Li I guess no ombak right because they're next level in terms of like athleticism I mean there's that Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon right I mean that's all I mystical yeah that's magic this guy is actually doing this this is just a video of him he starts out normal throws like a bunch of front kicks throws a bunch of side kicks and then he starts doing jumping wheel kicks 360 wheel kicks tornado kicks he's just fucking flying through the air and flipping through the air aerial cartwheel kicks you know like whoa people can do shit now and they do stuff in like in martial arts films the techniques just way better they're just way better you got better at it can you put that that fight scene back up but Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris see if you can sign that video first while you're looking forward to most the one the one thing about Bruce Lee all the pads and he flies no no no no it's just a guy throwing kicks in the air he's just throwing kicks in the air it's on the Jackson wink yeah it's Jackson Winkeljohn and I just looked at Instagram page oh this guy's doing an MMA no no he's doing in the air I was doing in the air which of their pages is he planning to use it in them never make one Jackson wink him imagine that one check that one out there's a Korean dude if you keep going down I don't know if he's planning on using an MMA hmm maybe they were commenting on it fuck somebody had it up sorry anyway but with Bruce Lee fight scenes what I like about him is you could see him although you know him beating up 50 guys at a time you know that you know how real can that be but he does went on one-on-one fights he does a lot of fainting he'll do boxing stuff he'll do wrestling he'll do jujitsu you see him mix it up and he's trying to make it a lot more realistic like but you know then you have your classic come food theater type movies where Bruce Lee will dance around he'll throw a jab feint kick you in the leg fake logo high knock you out he does that against uh the Chuck Norris and in in way of the Dragon and if you go back to 1970 like that kind of martial art technique I mean he was he was amazing he was also the first guy that figured out how to put a bunch of martial arts together and just forget about judo your karate forget about that just just just use everything that works everything from everywhere that was heresy back then I mean he might have been he may have been the first guy to do that really I mean what up there sure went out for sure yeah he's without a doubt like I think there's two arguably to the most important figures ever in martial arts I think he might be number one and the other one is a Leo Gracie you really think about it it's one guy tries to figure out how to beat men who are bigger than him has a bunch of kids they all turn out to be fucking savage killer yeah I mean what are the odds that's the craziest family of all time craziest family of all time and if you think about it a crazy in a good way crazy or in the best way possible with a hundred percent respect I mean Hicks said hoist Hoyle or Helsing you know what the fuck and there was different sides and the Gracie's had you know conflict within each other it's all race asin's yeah a family of boys who's another I mean it's almost like hoist although it came from a Leo he's almost as important if he doesn't win that first Ultimate Fighting Championship we we don't get the same impact yeah he has to win imagine if he would have lost the first fight what if he got a head kicked you know what if he got in there with some guy was done this before and he gets head kicked Patrick Smith could have fucked amok yeah yeah fucked about that we could have been the lineups were different are you kidding the hoist Gracie Louie and it ends after UFC two it ends the Patrick Smith that's the perfect ending right there did he fought Patrick Smith didn't - choke choke - Murray on a second time they were in the UFC together no was the first one yeah now it was UFC - choice was on one side of the bracket Pat Smith is on the other side you know black you know killer Muay Thai guy fucking like what he did to scott morris a ninja guy yeah UFC 2 is a goddamn movie well Patrick Smith was a real legit top-level kickboxer accused a real dangerous kickboxer you watch his striking I mean that guy was explosive super powerful and ruthless man what he got on top of that dude was elbowing him Oh Bolivian lean back they didn't know exactly when to stop a fight I think John was like the guys still alive yeah yeah but but Hoyt the point is a hoist did win he didn't get kicked took the guys down choked him ah and all of us were like what and then it's almost if you go to martial arts you look at like the whole history of martial arts and then you hit 1993 and it goes like this yeah it's like it would be the craziest rise in the stock market you could ever see you doesn't investigate the fuck happened here such an explosion it was UFC to UFC one no one really watched they didn't have any b-roll I remember seeing a preview for it and I would watch all boxing events no matter what the boxing fanatic I didn't miss any of those big fights ever even the small Tuesday night fights like I recorded that on my VCR always taped boxing events never missed them but I didn't I didn't watch that ago you know what I thought it looks like it might be fake I thought it may be like a fight zone remember fight zone a little WWE but try to make it look you know more martial arts oriented but so I didn't watch it and then you end up you know you end up hearing shit that that was real and I'll never forget my roommate came home from Guitar Center and he said man that you have seat thing that UFC challenge that shit's for real man I don't really and I was doing karate at the time and I go to was there a karate guy in there it goes yeah but he got beat by some I think he was Iranian man he was just a joke in everybody out he would just go he was choking everybody out wouldn't mean he would just grab that door goes dude yeah he would just grab the fucking throat some Iranian guy and he would choke he choked everybody out that's what the guys don't make Guitar Center like holy shit karate too I'm like fuck maybe I'm doing the wrong style and then the you have seat UFC 2 came out and I remember I told my same roommate he was staying home was on the weekend and I was going out on the town and I remember calling him say hey dude that UFC to that UFC challenge thing is aren't taping cuz he was gonna stay home with his girlfriend he taped it I got home watched that motherfucker on tape I I couldn't stand host Gracie that first at first half of the show I just wanted him to lose so bad when he fought man okey Jara he was a karate guy to me that was my hero i mean i was doing karate for six months man you know what I mean I was all about karate I didn't want hoist to beat him but then Hawk but by the time we got to the finals I was a gigantic boys fan I know you know what I got to learn this jujitsu and I just quit karate and and found the Machado's in the valley it is really crazy when you think about what would have happened if that didn't take place like what would happen if Horan never put together the first Ultimate Fighter right it was partly his idea in art Davies yeah what if would happen if that didn't happen where would martial arts be would it be inevitable would somebody figure it out would you Panna figured it out we would have figured it out eventually because maybe yeah cuz the jujitsu would eventually grew out of Brazil there's no way you could have stopped the it the way it grew yeah and that was a huge explosion but it would have got out eventually but with maybe I'm for sure not with the same impact yeah but see like forever wrestlers were like when you think about MMA right now wrestling is a giant skill right a Mark Coleman type wrestler a big powerful wrestle you take you down and beat you up from the top that's giant that was always the case but we didn't think of that like when you thought of like boxing versus wrestling or karate versus wrestling nobody thought like wrestlers have a giant advantage nobody thought that you would think all the crying guys probably fuck him up yeah I catch what a karate chop kneel on the way in or something like that I wrestle that I never thought wrestling was a martial art at all to me it was one-on-one football right I had never looked at it but and I would use it to cheat in fights because I'd get in a fight in high school I would just I would double leg him dude and just fucking get psyche twister side control and push him on stomach and tongue yeah so I but I you know I think that was cheating but I didn't care it's I mean it is not a martial art in that it has finishing holds of its own because most of it is just taking people down and holding them down and getting back up but if you can master that that is like one of the most important aspects of martial arts I mean and we never thought about it that way it took forever it's almost like it took the UFC to show that yeah took the UFC to show that over over again and I really worry or wonder rather what would have happened if the UFC in 93 had never been invented because if there was never any kind of a tournament like that - through all these fighters together in a real organized way and he got real top-level guys from each discipline eventually making their way into the UFC what the fuck man martial arts would be still back in the 1980s yeah we'd have some idea what worked is some idea would what you know in don't try this but in Japan they were doing Pancrase right they're doing like sure you don't they start doing Pancrase I think that we're doing it at you know early 90s so it's a box rootin Frank Shamrock Ken Shamrock days Matt Hume was in it back then what years were those it's that's hard as when was paying Crais won first aired on 293 found it and what month does it say 93 damn cuz that was the first UFC to November of 93 was the first UFC so it all basically happened around the same time so maybe i'm ii n-- is it possible that in november of 93 they see the UFC and then immediately Pancrase don't I took a few weeks later and it's still 93 it was established on May 16th 1993 and their first event was promoted September 21st so and then in September and what was the UFC in 93 November November crazy so right before the UFC so neither one of them had been on air when they both started or they were both putting it together so maybe like the idea was in the air believe in that the ideas just out there in the air that is pretty crazy but the fighters and Pancrase they didn't have the jiu-jitsu that the Brazilians had no it was a big difference there's a lot of light locks going on back then remember yeah but is that Ken shamrocks influence or was that there's a lot of Japan Japan like catch wrestling influence right look from Karl Gotch and yeah Japan's always been in the leg locks really Robinson yeah they've always been like like this ah robber style that's very catch oriented right yes yes for those who don't know we're talking about cash catch-as-catch-can but make no mistake about it the the ground fighting was just on another level you could say whatever the hell you want but when you watch Allen goes fighting pancrase against Frank Shamrock man you see the difference in jujitsu back then there was a big big difference Malan goes was all over Frank Shamrock Frank sham was a bad motherfucker yeah we don't you know you'd only been training for a copy yeah he just crazy yeah he was fighting against guys like bas Rutten when he had been training for like a couple years yeah yeah oh man well Jack they were like Jesus anytime it resists Vito's anytime a Brazilian would would go against that your average pancreas guy yeah there's a clear difference in the ground fighting your difference and three paint gray defends before that first UFC was in all four events and what would you say it all wasn't all of them interesting BAM it says that that the pancreas thing came out of a wrestling organization in Japan or they had like they were having problems with predetermined outcomes decided to have actual fights Funaki interesting yeah and then you look at Hickson versus Funaki crazy amid fucking difference in grappling oh you know what I mean it's big as it gets yeah so you could see that so what the UFC did that Pancrase didn't do and mainly because nobody in the Western Hemisphere even knew what the fuck it was it was a Japanese thing so it's gonna be hard to change the world when you're you know only televised in Japan and back then you know you got to get like someone someone had to mail you a VHS tape you know what I mean you know weird Japanese stores and and and see that so but the UFC made it clear that the Brazilians were doing a form of ground fighting that was beyond and more sophisticated than what we're seeing in Japan or anywhere else in the world you know nobody anybody knew nobody in half the shit they were doing no Zombo add it down Samba has some good shit and judo yes judo most if not all Brazilian jiu-jitsu moves I mean have been done in judo and they're actually they came from judo we know that the Japanese know that but a lot of American judo guys don't they can't they can't seem to grasp AK they're like you know the Gracie's ripped off a new aza it's all about nuance at least you know there was a you know sect of judo where they did focus on the ground but and that's all true but the major difference is the Brazilians they wanted to do a style where there wasn't a time limit on the ground in judo you could only fight on the ground for I don't know 30 seconds it's a it's limited it's not that much time so when you don't have that much time there's a lot of shit you don't need to waste your time drilling because you're only gonna be down there for 30 seconds you need to focus on the moves that work in 30 seconds and that's it you don't have time to set shit up and be patient and relax you can't clinch and catch your breath you got it it's gotta you got to go into it so what the Brazilians did is just allowed the fight to unfold on the ground and and not have any stand-ups and just let them fight on the ground and when that happens there's a lot there's so much more you can do when there's no time limit on the ground not like no time I mean you know they're not gonna stay without stand-ups where you could just most of the matches take is takes place on the ground the game just evolves so quickly and so rapidly and and that you can't compare like Japanese guys come down in Brazil they'd been doing judo their whole life and they get smoked by Brazilians that always happens in the World Championships the Brazilians are just on the ground all day you know and the guys that do judo they're on the ground a little bit they're never gonna be able to compete in a sport where there's no stand-ups you know so to say that Brazilian Jujitsu is just judo it's that you got to think about it it's silly there's so many silly connections that people have to arts you know I mean there's there's people that legitimately think that why people shouldn't be able to teach karate because it's cultural appropriation because it's a Japanese art there's people that think that's stupid you know this I think all of its martial arts now I mean I think the roots and the bases are very important to recognize that you know hey you know Brazil did do a crazy thing with jiu-jitsu hey the Thais did do a crazy thing with leg kicks and elbows knees there's really some some people that have contribute to martial arts and its really insane way and the people that highlight those disciplines like the elite of the elites like the bull cows and the Sancho's and the Marcelo Garcia's and the Jacare is like all these people that highlight it on in each art they're all like super super important but overall it all comes into one thing and that's that's martial arts I think martial arts it's really at this point it's really I mean ultimately it's one thing now ultimately Eltham ultimately like when you even think about UFC when you think about just Bruce Lee movies what is it like fight how what's the best way to fight it's all together now it's all combined because the best way is not just wrestling it's wrestling with ferocious striking it's wrestling with leg kick defense it's wrestling with submission holds it's all these different things you have to have all these things you can't just be one thing anymore it's interesting to be from one discipline but it's like what if your kid is coming up right now and he's like your son's age and he starts to learn martial arts techniques I think by the time he gets to be our age it's just gonna be martial arts we were just gonna be taking martial arts I don't think there's gonna be as many specialists in the future and I think that's probably a shame like but know who's gonna want from a guy who did Taekwondo his whole life who's gonna want to do that now yeah but when you talk about jiu-jitsu most people that do jiu-jitsu are not doing it or they don't stay in it for the long haul and make it a lifestyle for the self-defense aspects right they don't they go in there cuz they're playing a video game and they're staying in shape right they're playing a game of death virtual reality video game trying to get taps try not to get tap that much you know so do most of the guys in you know that most of my students they're just like you know super nice sweetheart computer geeks just just the nicest guys they're not in there and they're just at play yeah well there's a big difference between we've talked about this before but the big difference between guys who train together which would you tune versus guys train together with like kickboxing as the kickboxing people they fucking hurt each other all the time like bad like they're beating each other up they're kicking each other punching each other and shit just two guys tap each other out and then like I'm gonna get you back bitch yeah and it's but it's okay everybody's okay he's gonna percent not me that's the beauty of it yeah we get to the reason why do Jitsu is it's I mean opening up a jujitsu school like in in in society today is like one of the safest bets out there ever it gets so addicting you can't download jujitsu you can't pirate jujitsu you know your sparring round you know you you can't you have to go to a place and you have to go to a place where there's a bunch of different and the more people there are the better the more variety of roles you can get because you don't to just roll with the same guy all the time you want to mix it up mix your style with that guy style go with the new guy who doesn't know your secret moves and you know you're like going and new dudes where your setups work because the guys that you've been rolling with for a while they smell out all your setups and now you got to come up with new setups and you got to figure out a different way around this problem it's just um it's just too much fun man it's it's so addicting and it has nothing to do with not I wouldn't say nothing but you know you do enjoy the [Music] the self-defense aspects like if anything went down at you it makes you feel better in certain situations like you're not as worried about things as you might be if you didn't know if you don't know martial arts you know the one thing that I'm gonna start doing once I'm totally healed again so I'm gonna start kickboxing yeah yeah cuz I just see too many Instagram videos of dudes getting fucking lit up I'm like you know what it's a good idea once a week you know and I'm not gonna make a big deal out of it maybe once a week tops to go in there and just you would you see that video I put up on Instagram today from Draca it's like I think it's Drock underscore jr. is the Instagram account it's a crazy Russian account and it's two on one Russian fighting a giant dude and to like normal-sized guys yeah look at this give me some volume jaehwi this is crazy both these guys are they do about 160 and the other guy looks like he's about 300 fucking pounds guys ragdoll on these dudes oh yeah those knees fuck this guy's giant man he's so much bigger than these two dudes oh he's a beast holy shit got good cardio too for a giant fucking dude in the white Kimbo yeah look is a good leg kick checking he's got technique he's not just a giant dude they're not faking it right now man they're beating the fuck out of each other look he's he's hitting this fucking guy hard Oh we'll kick this is crazy I mean this is not a smart thing for the little dudes because the problem is they don't have the horsepower yeah they're not gonna be able to take them so many videos on Instagram or dudes are getting lit up you got to have yeah it's you got to have the ability to knock somebody out if you had to in not do jujitsu there's many situations where in a real-life altercation getting on the ground is not the best idea and being able to light someone up or like three dudes no way you're gonna be three dudes with jujitsu you know and it happens you see on videos it's like a myth it's like a mythical thing you can't beat multiple attackers yes you fucking can like you could with they're striking if there was three dudes and they were starting shit you're like okay I'm knock this motherfucker out first and then hopefully one dude will start running and then I'll fucking clean up the second guy you know or whatever but to have your level of striking is important it's important you know it's important it's important if you think that someone might be hitting you like if you think someone this motherfucker looks like he's gonna swing on me like I've got a feeling like he's gonna swing on me yeah I need there's there's that that moment when you're in a heightened sense of danger if you don't understand space like that's a real big thing one of the things about sparring that's really important is that you you know when you're safe and when you're not safe and you like a lot of people don't know they don't know when they can hit someone when someone can hit them yeah and if if someone thinks if you think someone's gonna hit you and you can't get some space between them you have to be ready and you have to understand like you have to have someone have swung on you before so as you're seeing shit coming you gotta be with all his back legs going okay I see his weight dip in all the right hands coming in you know like there's a there's you have to know certain patterns otherwise you lock up that's the scariest thing you ever seen a fight is dudes like things start swinging and they just lock up because they don't know what they don't know where it's coming from they don't know what's happening that's the most dangerous it's almost more important for defense than it is for anything because half the time if you were ever in a fight with someone and they starts just swinging at you if you have good defense you just you stand there with your hands up and you wait you just wait let him swing don't swing keep moving you wait you wait how long you gonna be able to do this well you got 30 seconds and you yeah oh yeah you just wait you just wait and then all sudden you see a little of this you're like oh oh oh oh now you're tired you don't really know how to fight you just wanted to hit me well now we're gonna fight and now you're tired someone didn't do a sprint well not just that you don't know what to do you lock up and you people think that they can do that to people people that don't know how to fight below their load they just blow their wad if you you ever like if a guy like Joe shelling isn't a street fight that would be like the most terrifying thing in the world like we if you don't know and you fuck up he got in some crazy street fight after one of his kick boxing fights recently no she's some other country but a guy like that first of all he can fuck you up before you can fuck him up but second of all if he decides to just take his time with you well you're gonna get into this place of doom this place of doom where you're exhausted and you've been trying to hurt him so he has all everything within his right to crush you and you know that and now you're tired yeah but uh well the one thing that you notice in all these fight videos and and scuffles on Instagram is that a lot of times it just seems like you got you got time to throw a couple punches and you got to get the fuck out especially yeah when it's multiple attackers you got to figure out which dude you get a hit first there's gonna be another one and usually that third guy runs it looks like he's like oh shit he's out but if he stays down it's one-on-one now you just knocked two dudes out now it's one-on-one and if you got Joe showing type skills boom that's where it all comes in right now but it's almost better to just have wrestling and boxing in a street fight you don't really want that's what Bruce Leeds was preaching after all the shit after everything he all the kung-fu he grew up with he got to the states and he realized holy shit this Wing Chun isn't working on his tall white boy so he learned real quick a fight in the street the close quarters I mean maybe you'd be able throw a kick me through and he said in 1959 he said a dude has been wrestling and boxing for one year can beat a lifelong martial artist it's true yeah it's true in a lot of ways if the guy doesn't know takedown defense and the guy doesn't know how to actually box dude I remember when I first started doing first started learning boxing and kickboxing from all my years of doing Taekwondo and I threw punches in Taekwondo but I had a crazy distorted perception of my ability with my hands like I thought I'd be able I think I know how to strike but is it not Astra I just knew how to do Taekwondo I was good at that and when I started kickboxing dude I was getting lit up especially when you're in a train can't go anywhere trapped in this ring does Taekwondo have a reverse punch yeah it's got reverse punch Scott you know it's got all these it's got hand techniques but when you fight in tournaments everything is below the neck for punches so everything is below here it's it's just the body for punches and you can kick to the head and kick to the body you can't kick to the legs so all it does is make you really good at kicking that's what it really does but the the distance is all fucked up and then I realized that like once I started doing kickboxing all my distance is so fucked up because when I think I'm safe I could still get punched in the face and if they crowd me they get punch to the face and I can't kick I'm like my distance is all messed up and then it's also way easier to punch me than I thought it was so I had to learn and in learning it was fucking super humbling man super humbling cuz I went from being someone who I considered myself like an elite striker that goes on a national level for a Taekwondo I I fought in a lot of national tournaments I kid I fought like a bunch of guys were really good and I hung in there with them I thought it was really good it's just regular kick boxers with beating the fuck out of me just beating my ass just kiddin me in the corner jab and me be thinking off the jab right hand I'm like oh no this is terrible isn't it isn't it weird for sure Taekwondo has got the best spinning kicks and all that shit yeah it's got some really good kicks the side kick is the best kick for sure best uh you know the best version of the side kicks the techno isn't weird that the heads of the Taekwondo Association would whatever it's called they they can't and they can't admit that their hands suck you know they can't admit it you would think that the heads would say you know what shit maybe we should do maybe we should add Western boxing to this shit you know them do I'm sure some of them do so he's the heads don't like you would think it's so traditional like they won't change it it's still clear it's crystal clear yeah that the best hands are Western boxing hands it's crystal clear yeah the world knows this but at the top like you don't like even in the karate associations or kung-fu associations they they won't alter the style right right well you know one thing that is interesting is karate at least emphasizes the idea of punching things without gloves on because there is a difference there's a pretty big difference Chi punching things with gloves on without gloves on and one of the things that karate figured out a long time ago so you got to condition your knuckles condition your hands and condition your knuckles they never had that even I mean I guess maybe some people had it in that window but it was never anything in my organization where they had like a mock awara which is like if you don't know what I'm we're talking about there's a board with rope wrapped around it's hard rope and they just fucking smack just punch that rope until their knuckles became like ballast my friend John Lee who I told you about he's the guy that I saw kicked the bag for the first time and bend it in half yeah national champion who's a monster he had one hand where he only had one knuckle his first two knuckles were just one it was one giant knot it wasn't it wasn't like my hand looks like with two distinct knuckles it was just all a boulder over there leading off from punching bricks you just break bricks with his knuckles and he works so that shit works oh yeah shit is so not good to just beat on a joint until you forget that yeah this is what I heard maybe that's a maybe that's a fake broom or two but a lot of those guys that that did that they would practice on maca Juarez and on bricks and just constantly be punching bricks and yeah so John had hands where he could like legitimately punch someone very hard and not worry about it with a bare-knuckle wears a lot of people in your hand your hand is way week you think about what your hand is like move your hand around like this think about all these little parts this is the worst thing you want to hit somebody with that's why this elbows are so much better those are so much better your palms even better yeah this is crazy this thing articulates and it move this is for piano it's not for Hulk smash oh shit thoughts of money wars other guys arthritis from using the makiwara there was a style his knuckles Jesus crying oh my god nice there was a style that did address weaknesses in a bunch of styles and just do you remember and then I forget who formed it but he formed a style that had the best of what he thought of like five systems Kajukenbo remember that hmm Kajukenbo who is karate Jew maybe jujitsu or judo Kaju camp and then Kempo karate as a part veil and bow no and bow for boxing so was boxing karate judo and Kempo karate do you remember Bart Vail yeah dude behind me I was another guy who was like a pioneer of MMA that people seem to forgot about Kajukenbo I can't believe I just remembered him oh look at that oh you know what a little bit of wing chun a little bit of sidekick in yeah Google Bart Vail he was one of the early guys man I fucking completely forgot about him he was a big giant dude - there's a shoot fighter yeah he fought that's right he fought fucking kam shamrock and pancrase look at this yeah and this is before the UFC - yeah these guys used to they had the open slap was interesting - right they weren't allowed to punch each other they but they were allowed to open slap like how weird is that so strange watching these old old fight so cus big fuckin Bart Vail is compared to Ken Shamrock it was a big fuckin dude man he always had American flag shorts on right the one thing we failed to mention that that we should bring up is whether or not Horry and Gracie or art Davy were influenced by pancreas or not like what came out first a few months what in Brazil they were doing that shit since like the 20s and 30s and 40s Yeah right so really it probably all started in Brazil if you break it down like that I mean hello Gracie was fighting what in the 40s or the 50s or something yeah you know Carlson Gracie took over like in the 60s it was huge in Brazil mm-hmm so not only did Brazil not only is Brazil responsible for the level of grappling in the world today it's it's for sure the Brazilians gotta have all the credit for that for sure come on yeah I mean when but you also also MMA that we're doing Valley to toe Valley to toe is old-school there were the Brazilians for some reason I don't know what did what it was but they figured out a lot of good shit right that Hickson Gracie match news 18 against Sulu to figure it out acai are you kidding me you go to batula right there on Ventura you ever go there no that's the kind of because all these little pussy-ass little juice shops try to have acai they don't do it right the way ooh but Touba does it is exactly the way you get it in Brazil so goddamn what is this 1920s fighting sideshows called Valley tudo became popular in Brazilian circuses during the 1920s Jesus Christ so they were doing this before they found jiu-jitsu and jiu-jitsu they just figured it like the made them see the the last piece of the puzzle they were already doing it before 1920 adelio started her I think hey Leo was doing jiu-jitsu in the twenty fourteen or something when did my a to come to Brazil that's a good question when did I thought that was in the what year did Helio Gracie because Carlos Gracie learned first what year did Carlos Gracie first learn jujitsu count my ADA right it was count my ADA when did he first meet Carlos Gracie it's amazing man again think about the billions of people on the planet these two people don't meet if one guy doesn't teach another guy judo the whole world is different yeah fucking crazy yeah fucking crazy yeah really crazy and then what country did he go to you know did he go to Norway or did he go to Germany did he go no no he went to this place where they're already doing this he comes to town to teaches of judo at a place where they're already getting wild they're already having these wild ass fights and he figures out how to get it to the craziest family or the best way possible or maybe I mean there's about 15 sort of in 1917 yes so maybe they learned jiu-jitsu and mainly certain fights exactly maybe ballet judo who invented valley tudo was it the Gracie's how crazy who first started doing valley to toe in Brazil that's what that's what I wanted what had to been influenced by the initial learning of Brazilian jiu-jitsu from three years ago so it was like or maybe it's just a bunch of dudes who were terrible at jiu-jitsu just like in Japan well when I came into the UFC was 97 so it's basically the same amount of time afterwards right so think about if like jiu-jitsu is introduced to Brazil three years before they start doing these valley tudo things when I first got into the UFC was 97 and you and I went to one in 97 remember yep and those days it was everything was like it was like it had to be probably how like how they were on a larger scale because I was on cable but how they were looking at it like oh here's this new thing everybody's figured out this new thing this is the new thing okay what try this new thing we're gonna have these fights I'm gonna put these fights together real similar timeline but the Brazilians were how many years earlier nineteen twenty seventy yeah with anybody doing that before the nineteen twenties really crazy who really invented valor Tito or maybe it was like maybe you know what maybe them catch wrestling no-holds-barred fights they would do it in circuses there was a little yeah maybe that I think that was in the 1800s yeah some says that in my Aetas wikipedia that at nine 1879 ulysses s grant former president at the time visited japan and while in tokyo at 10:02 jiu jitsu presentation whoa interesting 1879 1879 but japanese gets he's different than Brazilian Jujitsu well didn't die was it Teddy Roosevelt one of them way different studied judo some one of them one of the former president studied judo hurry Singh right to that Abraham Lincoln before he was president used to travel around and rest challenged wrestler yeah yeah he's a big old tall dude see I think there's a lot of those guys that would do that just for money they would travel around and then there was people that would take on all comers and you know local towns it was a way to make money yeah but the rules matter like if you're doing challenge matches because in catch wrestling in the sport you're not allowed to put someone in full guard I don't think I don't know like in wrestle the rules I can in wrestling and just regular the wrestling you can't put anybody in your garden work your garden so it's similar that's wrestling you can win by pin too right is that true I think so it's it's um that's like what it's it's a wrestling based art but you could also get a guy in a Kimora yes or an Americana yeah it truly is I think so submission wrestling yet the problem and the big problem with catch wrestling and has a lot of wonderful things for sure a lot like you know the Kimora there's a lot of great shit and catch wrestling but the fact that you can't put you can't work from your full guard means that not only does the system have no guard work really or super limited guard work like someone's gonna send me a picture look a picture of some old catch wrestler in the guard or something yes yes yes I get it it existed but I'm talking about a sport where you're allowed to work from the guard with without being stood up or without being penalized you know what I mean y'all's didn't have that so what what mean what that means is the guard passing was non-existent as well if you don't around a lot of plate guard why would you bother learning and drilling all these different past combos it's a lot of time so that's that's what the ket catch wrestling was missing was the guard and the guard passing but they had all the submissions and it's a beautiful thing but it was like that in Japan in a lot of ways too that when you watch old Pancras no one's working from the guard there's no tech there's no technical half guard stuff there's it's just wide open basic movements off your back and that's one of the that's the biggest thing that the Brazilians brought to the game is guard passing which means on the flip side you got to have you know a super hard guard to pass you know and that changes everything I changed everything in and and trying to figure out a way to do real fights you know that's why they had a fake a lot of fights because there was so much missing that fights would you know when you put two white belts together on the ground there's not gonna be a submission going on it's gonna be it's not gonna be entertaining to watch two people on the ground in a position like the guard or whatever were you just don't spend a lot of time and it gets really boring so that's why you'd have to fake it you're like you know what if we're gonna let me buy fake it like Pro Wrestling like Pro Wrestling the origins of Pro Wrestling I mean if you look to think about Pro Wrestling Pro Wrestling is just a fake UFC because they're on the ground they do uh you know they do leg locks and shit and they do they'll do Google+ now but gravedigger now fuck the Undertaker yeah only because they would've did it before if they would have known one was possible they just didn't spend enough time on the ground without stand-ups and without penalties to figure out there's so much you could do on the ground and that's that's what changed everything that's what made it so that you don't have to fake fights anymore although there are fake fights you know especially I think that's why they started faking fights I think they just wanted to make it more entertaining and they want to be able to do it every night well yes Road no no that's what I'm saying they want to make it more entertaining if it's real it's not entertaining because you you want to be able to do it every night you want you wanna be able to travel on the road oh no coach I don't know their schedule I don't know yeah maybe they went out once every six months maybe they went out every once a month I'm not too of the frequency of their fights but a hundred percent you go you take a time machine back to 1860 and you go to a carnival and you watch these dude - got dudes grapple you're not gonna see hi-tech guard work what I mean you're not gonna see hi-tech guard passing it's not gonna sit and exist it's this in judo but not that much because yeah unless you're doing new aza - aza was a judo style that spent more time on the ground but still they didn't make an impact like like the Gracie's did well when you watch someone who's a really good guard expert on their back and you know you watch someone trapped in that web you know it's it's really it's very interesting and now you know I didn't exist before the UFC yeah that thought that a guy on his back could be like super dangerous that was a totally new concept Dan Severn hoist grace yeah that was the one yeah a fight like that wouldn't exist I mean he was on his back and he had damn seven in his guard I don't know like 15 minutes or something like that it's a long time that was the longest match hoist benin and he ended up triangle him you know you you know when you when there are no stand-ups a lot more patience is involved and setups and and there's so much more it's like a whole nother dimension opens up when there's no stand-ups so this weekend is darren till versus wonder or excuse me versus tyron woodley why I savor is wonderful what kind of flip was that you know why because it was reading a article of this really interesting article about Wonder Boy in his last three fights the two fights with tyron woodley that were super duper close and then one fight with Darren till that was also really close and they were talking about like how if you looked at it on paper the people from outside I think they were they were saying that global scorecard I think that's how they're describing it meaning how people scored it like on average around the world more people gave it to Wonder Boy then gave it to Darren Till and the same thing happened with the tyron woodley fights I feel like the decisions were right in all those fights I feel like in the would-be fights in particular would Lee hurt wonder boy wonder boy didn't really hurt Woodley I think that counts for more it just does Woodley tyron woodley had him out I mean he had him really hurt and wonderboy never had tyrant in that kind of trouble in either one of those fights so I would I would give that advantage clearly the tire and I would think that if he lost that fight that wouldn't make any sense because fights are supposed to be about who does the most damage who's more effective I mean Wonder Boy was effective for more time but that's just like movement and sticking and hitting hitting him with small shots but Tyron put him on you know unconsciousness his door he was like right there it was very dangerous it was way different and plus you got a temper right yeah well I'm not sure I believe that I think you know if someone really wins a decision they really want a decision but it's just what's most important is damage if you guys are basically in a striking exchange we're not talking about like submission attempts versus striking exchanges like which one's better he almost had him choked out with that triangle well he almost had him knocked out that left hook we're not talking about that because it was basically just a striking match and in just a plain old striking match Woodley was the one who landed the bigger shots in my mind we've got to figure out a way to quantify that it just doesn't make any sense well you could see a guy having a guy fucked up and almost out so I think the same way about the Robert Whittaker Yoel Romero fight there's two rounds in that fight where Yoel Romero is landing bombs on Whitaker and Whitaker's hurt bad how does he lose that fight I don't understand that it doesn't make it to me even if it makes sense in the current scoring system that scoring system is fucking flawed that shit doesn't make any sense like logically when you're looking at what is the what's the ultimate goal of fighting but if you look at those three fights just at least on paper Wonderboys like right up there and Darren Till with one fight with cowboy one fight with him those two fights with their most high-profile fights of his career boom already got a title shot what's really interesting that's how that's how talented Darren Tillis people are so interested in him 17 to know 25 years old they're like fuck a chance the real battle for this guy almost is not just the fight which is going to be of course a battle but making 170 and how much longer does he do that he's I mean he fucking he is hurting to get down to 170 apparently he was at 182 yes he's giant dude giant you see how much bigger ISM Woodley is the video at the press conference we stand next to each other and how tall is he he'll puts his hands over his head I can't tell it says inches he's got to be six too but he said a big giant six to six foot even that's just six foot even yes 72 inches that's right it is he seems way taller than that yeah watch the go to the video of them that's crazy why don't I think he was six to anyway just still we're talking 170 he is clearly taller he's a big fucker - it's not just tall he's thick you know he's uh he's a big fucking guy and he has a hard time making that weight look how fucking big E is dude seriously that looks like more than three inches unless we wearing some crazy cowboy boots I don't know but look it's gonna be hard to do anything that would Lehmann very hard well there's a bunch of things which would the first of all the fucking speed you're dealing with speed that you probably haven't seen before exactly and the his level of wrestling these two guys isn't done there's no submitting the till I mean he knows jujitsu for sure he lived in Brazil for a few years he actually speaks speaks Portuguese oh shit okay yeah he got stabbed in London and then went to Brazil to fucking recoup and hi and hang out and lived there for a while I don't know the full story of it but he speaks perfect Portuguese yeah I wonder after one of his fights in Brazil he addressed the crowd in Portuguese very crazy I haven't heard any trash talking from Connor as if I have I missed it he's not doing any press he's not oh shit he's not doing anything figured it out you figured out the promotion on your own what account now yes what about a countdown ship 8 I think he basically said listen man I'm gonna fight and that's it that's what's gonna happen October 6 I'm gonna fight and that's it I might even like for the promotion I'd like to think he's done man no he's hit that plate first of all he just won a hundred million dollars he probably thinks you could suck all the dicks I'm here right now if you want me I want to fight that's what I want to do I don't want to do any year bullshit I want to fight so on October 6 I'm gonna show up and fight figure out all the rest on October 5th I'll be there to make weight in his accent though I wish I could I'd have to listen to him a few more times if he dies he dies then it says hold I go back down you know if he dies he dies then I'm paid twice 1.3 million like what does that mean yeah it's a lot of likes yeah he's trying to stay relevant he's trying to put some words out there look sexy probably got someone to doing it for him some little assistant and you know he's probably concentrate on the fight and they said Connors is good and he's like yeah that's fucking good put it up I'll tell you what man I can't fucking wait for that fight and you know you know if one of them drop out mmm you know tell me Hardison yeah 20 Ferguson's ready to go ready to go and he's on the card anyway and the undercard against Pettis right yeah so they would definitely do Ferguson in our Pettis uh I think so I'm not sure I think did they offer Norma Chamitoff to Pettis when all that shit was going down in New York in Brooklyn I know they offered it to they were gonna have it yes uh but chiesa got cut right and they wouldn't they didn't let Paul Felder because Paul Felder wasn't ranked high enough which is crazy yeah they let al Iaquinta do it the news I think they offered the report was Pettis and Felder were both denied mmm interesting edison Felder both denied well you know Pettis just beat chiesa by triangle he looked good he looked like he's back that I know I selfishly hope that uh no one drops out because first of all I want to see that fight but two I really want to see Tony versus yeah that's a that's a really interesting fight man yeah Tony's looking good ma'am a Betty is looking good it's amazing how quick he came back from that surgery it's amazing man it's amazing he's looking really good he's breakdancing I watched him breakdance when this guy just blew his knee look he's heat ligaments off his bones quit drinking no more drinking he's clean as fuck his diets and he looks great right now it looks great yeah he's in he's in tremendous shape how much was he's in for the best shape of his life uh a couple beers here in there you know no mean no big deal but he's uh but he said fuck none of that oh dude that injury just changed everything for him that injuries like it just made him reevaluate his life and now he's coming back stronger than ever man well when something like that happens you realize like whoa one of these that's really this catastrophic could be the end of my career yeah yeah it's possible and it's so possible that Connor or kabhi could drop out that's so so possible so far so back-up plan pedis and tony is the back-up plan well what are we at now we're still a month away yeah today's the sixth yep we have a whole month yep dude the world can fall apart in a month yeah in a month yeah and if that weekend is gonna be fucking insane cuz that's that's in Vegas on on that Saturday the Friday before is quintet three that's gonna be insane what's up if you've seen quintet yet team Jiu Jitsu teams only Jiu Jitsu what sakuraba show oh my god okay okay okay I'm confused I thought you meant team like four guys against four guys attacking each other all at once no no no no no no I was watching that video the Russian guys yelling my head oh no no no no quintet is sakuraba show I did I saw the boogie choked out sakarov oh yeah the crazy that was the craziest experience I've ever been in my life as far as jujitsu goes it's so different in every I've never done this yeah teen jujitsu it's fucking insane there was so many ups and downs and it was in sane why was Gio grappling against a guy that was so big well this is the way they do it okay so there's four teams it's a four-man bracket right and you know the winner of these two teams fights the winner of these two teams and then they have in the finals so it's five on five nine hundred and fifty pound weight limit so you could hold back for the whole five you get to divvy it however you want you get to Mom's for series two monsters but then you gotta have like little or guys here so um and one ends up happening we had to we had Adam sack enough and Amir Alam are two giant guys that are like both like 220 and then we had geo pj and boogie made up the rest of the team so we had two big guys a couple medium guys and then geo is the small guy geo the smallest guy but he's like Gio's like 140 145 he does when he fights 135 walks around like 140 at 140 so you every team has to submit the order they want their fighters to go but without knowing your opponent's order so you you just line them up however you want and then pull them they just ban this is the matchup like oh shit you know um you could have Giants against little dudes you know it's all mixed up you just ban does anybody have to agree No so who gets to put the guy out first like when you're making the decision no this is what happens you have to be every team has to submit the order they want their fighters are glad so I had it's random so I say Eddie you go out first Jamie goes out second write it down submit it and they got sin you don't know how your your opponent's the the other team's gonna line them up so boom when they line up when they when you see how it lined up you're like oh shit so the craziest thing was we you know we had to beat the first team we went against was a she's team is she is the biggest best built Japanese of all time of all times like 250 pounds Japanese like six foot three six foot four built like Ray Lewis is a she the gold medalist who's gold medalist and

were like holy shit am plus that shooooow assists which is a big-ass Brazilian he's like 210 pounds one of the best Brazilian Jiu Jitsu guys out there these little Japanese he's on each team so Alice's big high-level world champion Abu Dhabi champion he want Abu Dhabi one stalk and easy and then they have three other guys right so we ought to go against them first but but the first two teams

this is the guy right here no no no no no no the guy he's gonna fight yes check out check out this guy chill yeah and Hasim reader he just goes after legs and rips he's tall dude he fucks people up so we're we're backstage watching this dude tear through that team totally this is so crazy yeah yeah this is like looks like a hundred and fifty pound guy versus a 205 er yeah and the way the way it is right so if you in the first matchup right if there if there's not a submission its submission only if there's not a submission and time runs out both those fighters are out its whoever has the last fighter standing wins right so shit he goes right for the legs and just rips him off dude so dangerous let it go so anyways we're backstage watching this guy he tapped out like three dudes from this guy Kenya may be in Ghana Ghana and he trains over in no no no he lives in Japan he trains with somebody in Japan with Sakuraba they've got much bigger you that's so crazy guys a normal guy so he didn't hurt him so so if you win that first match you gotta understand this this is how it goes okay if you if you win you stay and you fight their second guy if you beat him again you stay and you fight their third guy we want to do the second or third guy already fight do they fight already like you're not fighting a guy who hasn't fought are you fighting a guy no worse yes no no what happens is you win by one plus five on five all right this is the first matchup right here right this guy wins okay so that guy's out this guy stays in we still got five guys now they got four and this guy fights this guy he wins again he taps him he stays and these guys haven't even fought yet and then this guy is gonna fight the third guy that people are listening here you've got your fingers and yeah yes so so but if you tied let's say you're in a matchup and you tie both you guys are out and then the next fighter comes in so it's the last man standing and interested so it's a good idea like go1 against ichi our smallest guy went against the biggest guy on the tournament judo Olympic Kimura of hell so the strategy was there was just survive against this dude and knock him out don't let him win cuz that the beats Gio then he's gonna fight again he's gonna keep fighting until he loses or get he coins how does it work there's no points no submission only submission only and how much time do you have it's I think it's eight minutes for regular matches but if it's a if there's a weight difference that's like 40 pounds or more then it's a shorter match okay now when it's four minutes it's 100 when against a she yes but on G over she she he she wasn't able to tap them which is incredible when you really think about how much bigger he is I mean he's in north if that's the one after this one it's this the one after this fight I saw I saw Sakuraba in Ritchie who we keep calling boogie and this is Ritchie right here against our sis yeah this is Ritchie he both these guys they got DQ'd because there was no taps boogie had rubber guard all over him dude it looks scary so two or three times you got he got DQ'd as well they both got open yeah they both get DQ'd if there's no submission which is beautiful it's a beautiful makes people go after both you guys are out it's whoever has the last fighter when they're standing when I saw that Sakuraba was tapped out I was like who the fuck tapped out Sakuraba and then as he got off him I saw it was Ritchie I texted him I was like what the fuck so this is it look at this Avicii and Gio right here so crazy at this shit so it's all about Gio's trying to attack him say Gio went for a Kimura of his own cuz he's really good at Kimora's so he was like fucking I'm gonna try to tap this guy out but it got to a point where he was just too big and he was he put a Kimura on Gio and was just trying to rip his arm off dude he had Gio's arm behind his back yeah I saw it I saw I talked to Gio after the fact Gio and Ritchie came to see me in Temecula when I did the casino down there hunga yeah I talked to him about it afterwards one two that is he said you didn't help me I'm like that's crazy it's crazy he couldn't tap you he's so much bigger and when I saw him yanking on his arm it's terrifying to watch think about all the damage it's doing to that elbow and that shoulder yep and he's trying to pass his guard and put a camoron you know he's got four minutes to do it so we're all thinking it would be great if Gio could tap this guy but at the very least knock him out you know what I mean just survive his who knows he could have cleaned it get it cleaned out the whole team look at this animal crazy this guy's a fucking monster yeah I mean he keeps yank you know - it's just amazing Geo's it gets crazy right here we're watching it right at the bone look at that look at that most people would have tapped right yeah yeah he was waiting for the tapped look at that shit look at that boom now he's good he got the hand down on the mat luckily he's so good at Kimora's that he's created so many Chamorro monsters down there to school that he has to deal with chemours all times so that's why he was able to survive hmm look how he's getting his knees in see how he just created space tucking in again yeah amazing people who have never practiced you just who probably wouldn't appreciate how interesting this technique that if he has it all again so dangerous for him to do this to be stuck in the situation and the see Ishii give up on it that's what's even more crazy cuz he she is literally a hundred pounds but he's gonna go back to it he's gonna go back to it let him he gave up on him right there though yeah I mean he's so much bigger than I'm it's really it's the same so because the fact there was no tap in this one both guys get knocked out exactly so that we win there you know what I mean we took out a monster about the big gorilla yeah so we win the first round and then we end up going against a Carabas team in the finals because they beat Tiger Muay Thai team so now how seen frida a boogie taps out Sakuraba he puts Sakuraba in it the dark sad arse and then he goes against he stays cuz he wins so he stays and he goes against Frieda and free that taps out book what he judge him with he got him with an armbar and right there Gio's next now right here here it is yeah this is it this is where he gets buggin but boom so now he stays in Gio's next and he's just on fire he's ripping through everybody and within a minute and how big is he so just let it roll through here let this roll how big is he now it's look at Gia he's about like 6-3 6-4 the fuck to 2210 in that area so now look at this is geo against so I told GL I said I looked at him I said dude of avenge your brother's loss I went fuckin come here because I'm losing my mind I'm like oh shit and and geo is the final match no no no this is like right in the middle now it's like there's three guys left each I don't understand there's this whole thing works but it's kind of confusing but once you once you stay in until you either lose or get or at the draw if it you lose or it's a draw you're both out but if you win with the submission you stay and you fight there next guy one guy could could take out a whole team and a you know um the winning team might have chose the DD attack like he's attacking check it doesn't last long so he's so tall he Gio's got one of the best guillotines in the system here look boom he gets him right there before he stood up there was no way he would have been able to catch that front headlock and that's exactly where talking about once you have a front headlock boom look at this he goes Marcel a teen on him boom all Marcelo right here check this out boom BAM right there Marcela's incredible man that is amazing that is amazing that a 140-pound dude look at you tap out an elite high level 210 pound dude like that that's incredible maybe more than 210 yeah that's amazing yeah so on the side lose in my mind in my head almost exploded that's incredible so now Gio stays different look at that size different guillotine apathy yeah and if he watches the only way he was he could guillotine him was by almost sweeping him getting him on his butt and before he could stand up Gio's he jumped on that head and arm boom and he sprawled them down snapped him down and turned it into a Marcel a team insane in sailors too it's like that's one of the more interesting things about Jiu Jitsu at Jiu Jitsu is an art where a smaller person with technique really can beat a bigger person it's just marcella teens are giant killers that's why it's in the we warm up with that shit dude we don't fuck around I mean I I don't know how many times you need to see marcelo garcia rip people apart with those things you know before you put it into your your own system that's amazing so when is this event gonna happen again so we won this one it was super fucking crazy we won this one and that was quintet two quintet three we're returning and we're that's gonna be in Vegas the Friday before Connor vs. Kebede oh you know so it's gonna be a crazy weekend so they won the first quintet and they got Craig Jones they got Marcin held that team Polaris I mean Craig Jones is one of the best grapplers in the world right now and that's it quintet re I've watched his match with who some are paja res your I favor got a team now oh there's Geo mmm interesting now Craig Jones that's fuckin teen Polaris's quintet one winner dude it's really nice to see more people paying attention to submission grappling maybe this is the way to do it this is you this is dude this is lighting the world on the grappling world on fire everyone starting their own wind quintet rules is a new thing now they've already been that happened to a month and a half ago and they've already been tournaments quit blue belt quintet tournament like we're having a quintet tournament at the 10th planet eclipse which is we all get together a once a year and have a party and and you know and do business stuff like a business summit meeting wait a minute is founded by Josh Barnett is that were you saying isn't it Janet's in it he had he was in the first one but it's a sundry know the clean tech free card will feature Sakuraba himself in action along with fellow UFC Hall of Famer you I favor former UFC heavyweight champion Josh Barnett and elite grappling champions including three-time EBI winner Gio motherfucking Martinez and reigning polar yeah I guess Josh Byrne had win this one Craig Jones that's awesome that maybe he's maybe maybe he's on shots of Rob esteem or something well you know what man he's like real ambivalent about is not ambivalent but you know he's just trying to figure out what he's gonna do with his career he's been released by the UFC you know he had that whole you sada thing where it was a they flagged him for is it a tainted supplement he went over the whole story on the podcast he was a tainted supplement that proved it was a tainted supplement they released him but it took a long time to do so and he was very frustrated by it and now he's not sure what he's gonna do so for him to do something like this you know especially like at this stage of his career like josh is still an elite grappler absolutely won their worlds in the key tap Dean Lister out remember that tap Dean list her out with a Kant was it can opener no no was a scarf old scarf old chef forget I forget yeah it was like one of them judo side headlock chokes yeah tapped out here on Grayson I mean he had a lot of he had a lot of weight on him but still he still got him the Dean Lister was you both of them are incredibly impressive but the Dean Lister is a big guy you know Dean Lister and him are of similar size yeah so he got him in he got him inside control and then he went to like one of those remember when Mark Coleman tapped out Dan Severn yeah the front of that it's like a just a regular hold just a headlock I got put in a headlock once as a kid for being an asshole I couldn't get out I couldn't get out man you realize how fucking good Josh is though when you see them control a guy like Dean Lister I mean that's how goddamn good just going to be Quarter Nelson look at this pop up these shameless pop-ups these are swats someone it's someone screen recorded this video someone screen quite not those a shameless pop all right what good guys fucking interesting who else is on the card this weekend pull up the a UFC card this weekend so it's Darren till vs. tyron woodley I'm very excited by that fight we dare until is a really really high level striker like the way he moves what he sets things up the strategies he does fight with his chin up in the air though and he does fight with his hands down low but it's to invite in brawls so who else we got we got oh Montano and Valentina Shevchenko the beat is fighting holy shit well was supposed to be fighting Yaya Rodriguez but Yaya Rodriguez got injured so Brandon Davis took it on real short notice I think like less than three weeks notice mm-hmm that's gonna be a good father yeah Jessica and Roddy probably had the biggest arms and the women's division she reached yeah do those arms incredible yeah I'm really excited about telling Woodley that's the fight that's most interesting to me that one to me it's like huh I watched that the Woodley till highlights and I'm like I don't know man I'm real interested about this because what what till brings to the game is size and height and distance and striking but what tyron woodley term Woodley also his wrestling also his championship experience been there done that tills favorite 145 to 125 I never understood that how can they both be slightly above 100 the money yeah I know but it means still like wait a minute so if you know one of them's you will eat a bet a hundred you win one and a half but the other one is also favored now 125 I mean 125 yeah so that you it's oh okay so what it is is Darren tail's favored by 145 like if you bet a hundred you wouldn't 145 I mean you have to pay a hundred right you have to pay 145 to win a hundred where if you bet a hundred you win 125 on Woodley who's the champion correct that's really just like if you bet now cuz this will change probably by all the way up to time the fight starts normally I don't understand you smoke too much pot before this show but the thing that's interesting to me is that he he doesn't I don't understand why they would have him a favorite unless there's a lot of money coming in from Liverpool earlier just what it is it's just a good it's not like this isn't right sorry I wonder what the like there should be an expert line I don't wonder what the expert line would be because like I said if I didn't work for the UFC if I'm standing here and you say what do you who do you think wins his fight I'd have to step back if I was like working for a casino if they hired me as a consultant I'd say this is a pic I'm fight anything can happen in this fight there's no way I know what's gonna happen in this fight like The Vow here's a fight Valentina Shevchenko and Nico Montana that that fight should be like twelve hundred to one is it sixteen hundred okay well I'm being conservative another one is under the beat is minus twelve hundred yeah that makes sense to those two makes sense see this one to me is like hmm I don't know I really do not know that that is very much like pick'em territory mm-hmm you could even have it like it could be plus 110 plus so this could vary depending upon like well late Woodleigh money could come in or late til money could shift it even higher I don't know depending on how much is really on it someone could change that part like a $10,000 bet they could flip it or something like that depends on how much is currently riding it's a it's a very interesting fight I think one factor is gonna be kicks and I think you what you're gonna see is till doing a lot of what he did in the wonderboy fight which is attacked that lead leg with a front leg side kick he does that a lot and it's a it's an awful kick if you get hit with it hyperextends your knee and he does it really well it's a real controversial kick I mean I don't know really that it should be if it's legal to grab your leg in a heel hook and rip it apart why isn't it legal the side kick your leg I mean I don't think it's dirty at all the thing is that you can't the idea is that you can't tap from it Darren till a Bravo back from the pisser Darren till is he's known for this in the wooden the wonderboy fight he threw these hard front leg side kicks to the knee just like Robert Whittaker did to yell Romero and just like you'll Romero did to him in the previous fight like that front leg side kick to the knee has become a big kick and tells really good I think that's gonna be a big factor in this fight his distance like if till can keep his distance and uses reach you know cuz it says that the same reach but that doesn't make any sense but doesn't one of them's taller you mean it's just like yeah maybe the arm distance is the same but there's Woodley generally counter fight is a general kind of stepping back I mean is he gonna want a lot of that he does a lot of that he's really good at countering he lets himself almost get pushed back to the cage and then he launches forward if you watched like when he ko Josh Koscheck would he would let he almost let's guys press him up against the cage and they expose themselves in the need tax back Rory MacDonald figured out a way to nullify that he was the like but that was also a different tyron woodley because I was tired Willie before Duke Rufus see most people don't realize that even though Tyrone really was like world-class one of the best welterweights on the planet he was really kind of training himself he was working with different people all over the country but he didn't have a main head coach he didn't get one until he start training with two groupers so from Duke Rufus on it's like you're looking at a different fighter he's much better at like relaxing conserving his energy he doesn't get tired in the later rounds anymore he's much more effective and he also knows not to get sucked in by the crowd like in the wonderboy fights in particular like people were saying it's boring but you have to fight wonderboy that way you can't charge Adam if you charge it wonderful you get lit up you get lit up with these crazy counter strikes you got to wait for wonder boy to lead and wonder boy was leading and tiring still again Wonder Boy landed more shots but Tyron hurt him way more how did the Kelvin Gastelum fight go with Woodley it was a split decision make Calvin by a decision it was you know that pretty pretty close fight but Calvin that was the fight where Calvin didn't make weight he was all fucked up coming into that fight but Woodley won but that was also I want to say that was like right when he started with Duke or maybe start with Duke after that either way you look a little like the Robbie Lawler fight is a good example what he can do what Woodley can do is put the best guys in the world out with one shot guys when nobody puts out who the fuck puts out Robbie Lawler Robbie Lawler gets hit with bombs and survives and tyron woodley put one on him knocked him out I mean he can do that to anybody and he could do that to dare until too I mean if Darren Till doesn't think that coming into this fight because he's the more accomplished striker it's a very dangerous fight for him Woodley so fucking but then again Daren till can find his rhythm establish his distance and start using those kicks in particular that front leg side kick man he fucks your leg up with that and then his leg kicks and then his leg kicks with combinations and he also he's real creative with his striking there's a lot of hand movement there's a lot to distract you maybe woodleigh's best strategy would be to just take him down over and over again and try to mount him and try to take his backhand and try to do some ground and pair them to take down I don't know it's a good question and how how is he on his back that's good question - you know what we know about him is he likes a strike big tall dude likes a strike nasty striker you know one of the more impressive things that he did is not the knock out of cowboy but when he hit him with that elbow he hit him with his step in elbow where I was like Jesus the speed of it man it's like the the smoothness of his closing the distance and the speed of landing that elbow like he showed cowboy different distances and then he he'd like he left this opening for that elbow and he slides in and cracks him with it and you're like oh Jesus Ike hears him against cowboy like see how's his hands are down low he's got a lot of movement of his hands but the like that jab comes from the bottom comes from like underneath you don't know like until it's too late whether he's just probing you or whether he's punching you there's a lot of that see a lot of that with the hands and it keeps his chin straight up in the air but he also was really good at moving his head back he's also really used to high-level sparring and high level fighting he's an elite guy man and a dangerous kind of weird style in a lot of ways there's a lot to see all that hand movement and shit like he does a lot of that shit that you saw him Bruce Lee movies yeah yeah watch it look at this boom to the body I mean that's that's nasty right like you start thinking it's coming over the top and it comes to the body have you heard how not the L'Orange is impersonation of until Blair no honey those fucking talented God man he's a talented guy the the the MMA world is lucky that we have him fucking I was talking about like hilarious inside shit in the world of jiu-jitsu and MMA like his fake feud with Vinny Magalhaes is hilarious that's a real feud man they hate each other trust me we're on we're on a group text meet Vinny and her not and they're just constantly fucking tearing each other apart constantly hilarious they hate each other that's so funny man Vinny Magalhaes doing good not great he what is that beautiful yeah watching that yeah I watched his fight and won by head kick knockout yeah oh shit all of a sudden you got to worry about his head kick because I think that may be his third head kick knockout well you definitely have to worry about it and there's jujitsu top of the food chains and now he's like really into it and wanting to throw it and wanting to serve us more there's Bing Bing he hits him with that left hand watch this boom and then as he closes in watch this elbow he's closing right there oh that's so nasty that is a fucking hard elbow man does he remind you of Conor a little bit the way it kind of stands it seems like they kind of have that same style well they have a similar style and that they have their hands spread apart and you know and constantly fainting a lot of bouncing up and down and back and forth a lot of movement yeah he's not like a plotting guy what did he do so light on his feet did he do karate growing up or something a lot of my time since he was a kid very young I'd have to ask Vinny Sherman the full full background of them but you know Vinny Vinny was one of the ones who told me about him like a long time ago and told me about him when he's first fighting in the UFC he's like you got to watch this guy he's fucking special and he said you know in his Liverpool accent cuz Finn he's from Liverpool too he said when the cowboy fight was going on he's like look cowboy doesn't know what he's in for like he thinks he's just gonna go in there and fight this guy and doesn't need to watch tape on I'm like you have no idea what you're dealing with what's with cowboy 100% and that fight did he have some weight cutting issues anything like 170 that was 170 didn't train pearline for that fight I mean I assumed he did he's not saying oh no I don't know you know it's just I think cowboy honestly is a 155 or or a 165 or you know I think there's a lot of Fighters that are like that I mean I think cowboy can beat real top guys like Matt Brown and we beat Matt Brown at 170 he could beat guys at 170 no doubt but I just think the realistically these guys at 170 are so fucking big that Cowboys more of a 155 or yeah but I think that even 155 hurts him hurts him to get down there so he's a tweener you know at Diego Sanchez has always been kind of a tweener you know it's like too small for 170 too big for 155 you know but Diego made it down to 145 1 so that's great yeah that's not iron will son in bj2 he did own 7155 145 did heavyweight cheat it was like 205 and BJ just ate whatever the fuck you wanted any would step on a scale be chased back he's gonna fight Ryan Hall that's gonna be interesting that's all right yeah that's good fight because Ryan Hall although he's got good kicks and he's good at keeping guys on the outside he's very smart at using his kicks to set up his jujitsu yeah you know people who like criticized him for his guard a lot - yeah he does that's an interesting fight that's that that you know you don't want to see like the yard Regas one was tough to watch yeah cuz you're watching BJ fight a young guy who has a specialty that's like not in BJ's wheelhouse like BJ's never been really a kicker you know like he kicked Diego Sanchez in the head remember opened up that big cut it was like one of the only head kicks you ever saw BJ throw and his whole career you know BJ has been more punching and wrestling in jiu-jitsu but he's fun ya hear like your ear is like him and his I beat like that those tall guys with crazy kicks yeah fuck those are so hard to deal with man and BJ just it was really the wrong fight for him just not a good fight didn't make any sense it's hard to watch watch watching him get 360 roundhouse kicked in the head you like for Oh yeah yeah ears striking is just that's why I'm so bummed out that he got hurt yo year versus a beat would have been crazy that would have been crazy that's the probably the craziest striking matchup I mean well real mean one of those crazier strikes than yah here nobody so I'm beat yeah but yeah you're just yeah no he's just clown shot yep consistently mm-hmm at a high frequency just keeps throwing them yeah it's incredible the thing about him though was that like when you watch the Frankie Edgar fight like mmm okay that can be shut down like that can be really shut down he didn't have an answer when it was shut down so he's which means in my mind that his game is so heavily favored that looseness openness and kick ness kicking crazy you know while kicking that it's it's imbalanced right in the sense that he's got to put almost the same amount of effort to fighting off of his back if he put if he developed a unbelievable guard game to match his unbelievable kicking game holy shit and then you'd have an incredible bow he's messing around rubber going better yeah yeah look it makes sense when you the best the best kickers like like that's one of things that Pettis is realizing now Pettis has kind of stopped concentrating so much on wrestling and he said what I got to get back to doing is fighting and when I'm at my best he was saying is using his striking and then when he goes to the ground trying to submit people don't trying to stop takedowns don't try to take people down forget all that so he's going back to what got him there you think about like his Benson Henderson fight won by armbar I mean Gilbert Melendez fight wins by guillotine takes takes his time on the feet does all his creative shit on the feet but if someone takes him down he tries to submit him immediately he jumps on shit I think that's the that's an interesting combination you know that's why I'm so interesting that fight with him and Tony because Tony so wild yeah Tony does the same thing yeah the one thing you got to watch watch out with Tony's he has so much firepower from so many different angles on the ground but I mean he knows he knows a lot a lot there's so much he could tap you with but his Darce game is so high level and he could get it from so many angles that really I think the most dangerous thing would be you know our guys that are just focused on one thing and especially since he hits those Darcis from every goddamn angle you know if he came out and just said whatever happens we're always looking for the Darce he was in trouble in that land over not a fight mm-hmm he just put him in a darson that saved the day you know what I mean so there's a there's a lot of different ways Tony could make you tap on the ground mmm trust me he'd know so much but man if he just stuck with his Darce game man that that's probably the most dangerous way to go on the ground it's an interesting five-man interesting fight you know Pettis is nasty kicker there's a lot of great things in that fight yeah yeah that's on that card then on that card is that on the same card it's on copy hard oh yeah yeah yeah what else is on that card pull up that Conner khabib card who else is fighting on that card do you know it's only a month away I don't know yeah I like Sean O'Malley he's a fun dude man had him in here we got barbecued Oh Darryl Derrick Lewis Alexander Volkov ooh that's an interesting fight that Volkov guy might be the dark horse he might be the guy in the heavyweight division waiting in the wings you know karate hottie versus Felice is gonna be good mm-hmm yeah that's a good one yeah yeah I'm I'm interested in the Ferguson fight for sure the pedestal fight but I tell Louis volkov fight man that one I'm like huh that Volkoff guy did you see what he did for a reason for Doom when you watch that fight you go oh Jesus Christ if that guy could do that he stopped for Breezy over doom he beat the shit out of me before you stopped him who's the Russian guy who puts dudes in Ezekiel chokes while he's being mounted who's that Billy Nick right back guys Lexi oliynyk yeah gets mounted and Ezekiel's dudes from everyone from jean-jacques does that too that is so crazy but to do that in MMA with the gloves on it's like unheard of unbelievable yeah while being mounted putting people to sleep that's just like do you think you ever gonna see that again I think he has the ability to do it no but I mean from other people do you think that would be something that you just are adopting if fighters put the time in you know all submissions are possible you just got to put a lot of time at it you got to get obsessed with it Wow what are the odds of that one working a lot one guy's been able to pull it off who else has been he does it multiple team do it twice yeah twice I've seen I haven't seen the third one but I've seen two of them so who got a standing guillotine this is a five-minute compilation I don't know there's a lot of them standing guillotine yeah but this is not what we're talking about though we're talking about it's called an Ezekiel mounted Ezekiel Jamie just may have some missions over here is equal easy Zeke eazy-e i ke L isn't Ezekiel the dude from the Bible it is the guy from the Bible to saw the UFO yeah that was the first-ever one in the UFC that one in the UFC yes but but Ezekiel chokes in MMA just google Ezekiel chokes in MMA what's the guy's name maybe that's the only one that's at the top five videos or just him doing it oh he's done more than how many times he's done it all him oh the same fight other one fight play it just we watch it again it's pretty crazy it's crazy that someone can figure out a way to do something that no one has ever done before in 2018 so he's gets the headlock that and then he's just holding on and then he slides it in deeper and then this dude's fucked look at this happened that it's so crazy yeah that is so crazy he just clinches on your head that dude looks so disappointed he's like ever fuck did I get taxed yet he just clinches on that neck and then slips it in yeah thought he had this one in the back mm-hmm full mount sorry I got this motherfucker full mouth yeah he's gonna be he's thinking about the after party and everything yeah Aleksey oliynyk that's a bad motherfucker it's interesting how many people that we're seeing right now from Russia you know from the former Soviet Union Eastern Bloc countries it's really amazing I mean it's a beat normally got met off you know you can keep going down the line there's so many of these guys that are coming up it's really what a hotbed of talent especially Dagestan and how many bad motherfuckers come out of Dagestan yeah oh it's a beef versus I mean um Habib versus Connor like holy shit is that fight interesting what the fuck is gonna happen yeah it really happens you know you don't think is gonna happen don't say that son of a bitch I'll get him there who I mean how weird is it looking at Conor with no belt could be with the belt I mean forever Kabhi was trying to get a shot at that belt and the way he wanted crazy shit setting up this fight this fight is a fucking interesting fight man because if Connor can't stop that takedown does he go the way of everybody else does he get mauled the way everybody else got mauled does he get mauled the way Michael Johnson got mauled does he get mauled the way Gaston Hills stole Sanyo Scott mauled Chandler or not Chandler Johnson Michael Johnson yeah we were said John so you did ittsan barbozza yeah he got mauled the way Barbosa got mauled was scary because like halfway into the first round khabib 'he's taking him down and you see Barbosa just taking a deep breath like this I like realize like oh no yeah like what in the fuck is all this about it's worse than I imagined yeah this is just a completely different really I mean no doubt Connor probably has the heaviest hands in the game pound pound no doubt but takedown defense and fighting off your back that has nothing to do with the power it's not it doesn't translate and also what is it gonna look like is his takedown defense better than Michael Johnson's is this takedown defense better than Edson Barboza or Atalaya Quinta who's a wrestler yeah I mean I'll stuff does takedowns a couple times in the first round yeah but you know the persistence I was a really good wrestler yeah and how good is Connors it's good question man what if he gets what he gets tired what if it gets taken down easier than all those other guys you don't know right you know what I mean he's got Dillon Danis in his corner Dillon is I think he wrestled in high school and um I'm not too sure he brought in some Olympic caliber wrestler for his camp who did Connor brought in some some super high level wrestler first camp a famous one hmm you know Jamie's gonna find it a UFC fighter I don't believe he's a UFC fighter say it again does it say that does he offer to help him I don't know if that's how I really brought it I don't know who he brought in but I know that there's some talk about him bringing in some super high level wrestling says that Jordan burrows is not working with Conor which is that maybe you're talking about good being good well that would be one who you would want to worry that would be someone who you would ask but Jordan burrows is probably fucking busy and has he expressed an interest in fighting an MMA because if he does there's a lot of people that are fucked he tweeted out on the 13th of August I'm not working with Conor I'm attempting to win a World Championship of my own in October doesn't say wrestling yet didn't say yeah okay yeah so yeah that's what I was thinking like he probably does have time to help someone with a camp like that especially at this point in his you know he's taking off right now if he ever decides to go into MMA yikes yeah yeah I wonder what's gonna happen in that fight I managed don't know whether or not Coby was gonna be able to close the distance about getting hit where the Conners gonna be able to stay on the outside long enough where the curbs gonna come out him like with reckless abandon the way he did with Edson Barboza and he just stormed after Barbosa just walked into yeah what is he gonna be able to do that with Connor or is he gonna be a clip coming in I mean is he gonna be able to to fade that left hand is gonna be able to stop that and if Connor could just keep him from taking him down a couple of times in the first round just a couple of times just enough to put a little bit of doubt get a little bit of that shit-talking going and land a couple of good punches or does khabib just grab them early ragdoll boom side control elbows punch knee on belly punch punch punch elbow punch do we just see a mauling it's interesting you know it's it could go either way like I see both this this is one of those weird fights where I don't know what the fuck's gonna happen but I don't think we're gonna see like some crazy drawn-out five-round fight I definitely could be wrong but I think we're gonna see like one person dominate whether it's whoever figures out how to impose their game whether it's Connor can dominate on the feed or khabib can dominate on the ground you think that'll be the biggest pay-per-view ever it's gonna be huge it's gonna be so big thank you how could it not be the biggest one it'll be giant it honors the biggest star right the only thing that's gonna hold it back as mainstream knowledge of it because there's not a lot of press because Connors not doing a lot of stuff it's not like in the news a lot like how many of these regular people know that Connor is gonna fight yeah you never see it on Instagram you know any it involves you have C pages if you and I see it you and I see it before MMA pages but POC man it's khabib doing interviews is he talking I have no idea that means no man if you don't know yeah I don't know shit I haven't seen much may have seen some video footage of him training at aka the whole thing's crazy man so so I mean I'm just I'm crossing toes I'll crossing everything just please let this one go down please someone getting injured I wouldn't mind if someone got injured I'll be so sad what you wouldn't because Tony but jump in right and it's still gonna be a great fight either way fine either way they're guaranteed there's gonna be some serious shit either Tony versus khabib Tony versus Connor or Connor versus Coby I think Tony is one of the more dangerous fights for Conor because first of all his durability isn't Ernst is crazy his ability to fight from anywhere can he fights real good standing up he puts a pace on you doesn't mind getting hit always walk walk walk important walking people down if you hit him you can hit him and hurt him doesn't matter he survives he survives finds ways to survive and one little scramble clinch on the ground and there's a Darsh right there I don't know if the landowner vinod a fight is totally fair coz I you know I mean people look at that and I go it is fair but I mean I think that was a last minute fight am i right he didn't really have a training camp for that one I don't know if it was because it was a last minute fight or he just believed it was last minute he was I'm not too sure I know I know I don't know what happened in the night training camp but it wasn't a legit training camp for Tony but I'm not making excuses but that's that's what happened also what else was one of the reasons why I don't know if you could look at that if it was like people are looking at the right way because I think Londo is way more talented than people give him credit for exactly I think so too yeah I think in in moments in his fights he's just brilliant yeah and I think then he gets tired sometimes and he has moments where he fades off and then moments where he's in these crazy wild slugfests like the Bobby Green fights a great example that that the in the you've watched the first round the first round he looks smooth as silk man I mean he just looks fantastic he looks like a world beater but he tapers off he fades a little bit and I don't know what that is you know I'm not I'm not sure what's causing him to fade but I think that at his best when he hits those real high notes like he did in the Tony fight he's fucking dangerous man yeah anybody who sleeps on Lando is in real trouble he's super athletic he does wild shit he's real creative you know knocked out John Makdessi with a fucking wheel kick I mean whoa he do he does wild shit man and he moves good dude he's got an interesting time way of moving and he's not afraid to scrap and that that not being afraid to scrap makes him dangerous but also makes him vulnerable which I think has cost him a little bit but I think the big one is the endurance you know there's some there's some people out there like the guy that's working with TJ Dillashaw um what is his name the guy down in Southern California down near San Diego calivita is that his name what does he teach strengthing addition curls okay what's his name I don't know I'll text TJ see just googled TJ Dillashaw new strength conditioning program these guys that like the Nick curse ons and the Sam calivita Sam calivita that guy was he if you watched the preparation videos for TJ getting ready for Kota Dillashaw you see him doing all his wild shit man everyone's doing on these explosive crazy movements just like back when we saw when we saw when BJ was at his best when Marinovich was training up yeah and you know curse not come from that's cool too you know that learning under the Marinovich s but that kind of crazy plyometric training all this explosive shit that they're doing box jumps and crazy things with medicine balls and slamming things and chop back and forth and back and forth these guys getting phenomenal shape man yeah and I think that's imperative today I think today it's almost like it's not when when guys are getting ready for a fighting this is one thing that Nick curse on has said it's you already know how to fight like literally everything should be focused on your gas tank like you only have six weeks if you don't know how to fight you're not gonna learn in six weeks you know how to fight six weeks should be just crazy gas tank work yeah and when he gets guys like like dos Anjos when he fought cowboy when he gets ahold of guys and and you see that style like when dos Anjos Falls Pettis when he's got that incredible kind of cardio that's so hard to fuck with man yeah you know the pommel horse is that I say the pommel horse and right pommel one of the settings well it in order to to do that you have to do this exercise when you put your feet there's like a like a chain hang in and it's got like a weightlifting belt and you put your feet in here ankles and you start doing it on that and it just spins like wow and Tony is obsessed with it nobody can do it like Jeremiah Jeremy chai I bring in a bunch of ten planner black belts and no one can even kinda do it but you do it seems like gee oh no he hasn't come to Tony's camp he's he's two hours away it's it's too hard for him but those guys because they're break dancing background yeah yeah yeah that's that's what he's he's really getting into gymnastics right now Tony he's trying to take his fighting well that was giant for Georges st. Pierre yeah well GSP started getting into gymnastics you know and watching my daughter do it and watching like the amount of physical strength it takes to do like handsprings backflips and all that stuff all that it's all explosion yeah you know being able to control yourself on the bars and the Rings the amount of physical strength that you have to have to be able to do that yeah that applies directly to jiu-jitsu you thinking about maybe some gymnastics equipment up I got rings already oh really a rings in the battle shit you think Iron Man or what sakhaa Iron Cross [Laughter] but it's great it's great too like for rotation like as you're doing a chin up you know about grabbing it like this and then as you're as you're doing a chin up rotating in so I rotate my arms with the Rings as I'm doing chin-ups I like that a lot I feel like it gives me more of a range of motion than just a bar I like doing chin-ups on the bar too but I think that especially like as I get older like range of motion is very important to not lose that I see a lot of people they lose their range of motion because they're not working on their stretching they're not working on do it did you do a lot of meathead shit and they don't work on keeping their mobility at a high level you know that's why another thing that I like is stretching out in the sauna you ever stretch out in the sauna man I haven't done a sauna thing in a while anytime you want some come back we'll have some fun conversations in the sauna but getting in the sauna man and just you get super heated up and then just start stretching out like everything's loose and warmed up you can just pull things into better positions and just give everything like a stretch you're still doing hot yoga all the time I love it I got to get back into it now now now that my shoulders I think my shoulder could hang with yoga right now just don't put any pressure on it you want to go with me come with me to my class let's do it let's do it what days do you go didn't go to depends yeah I do like what's early I don't want to say I'll tell you don't tell me that 6 a.m. show up 5 a.m. oh no I'm in the dark dude that's what's up which is that Kundalini fuck that way the place where Dennis go that Kundalini you know get that DMT trip yeah the headband you see them head-banging I've heard about it yeah yeah like serious head banging like Metallica style headbangin there's too many people that say that you could trip balls yeah for it to knock you're trying to shake how the DMT demons yeah it Dean was that oh we should get out of here anything else anything else going on ABI September 29th in it and in three weeks stampy in Toronto at the mussel farm HQ in Burbank it's gonna be the first 16 man Twitter permanently bands Alex Jones and Infowars accounts Tom Tom it counts violated the company's abusive behavior policies Twitter sent in a series of tweets the ban comes weeks after Jones was banished suspended well anyways September 29th is a sixteen sixteen man combat jujitsu so EBI just turning into this is down religion no no this is a muscle form HQ in Burbank Oh beautiful facility that's an amazing place oh yeah oh yeah it's did Jesse Taylor's in it from the UFC mmm three-time black belt world champion Philippe Fogle Lin is in it what am i one of the fastest-rising 10th planet stars John Thor blank is in it Kyle chambers who's also one of the best cunt planet guys coming up it's it's gonna be a slap fast man slap fest Jitsu if you haven't seen it is Eddie Bravo's invention and it's fucked it's the the best gap between grappling and MMA training as far as I'm concerned thank you man my man fun times thanks for doing this today thank you we'll have Daniel Cormier on eventually he fucked up can i plug a couple comedy gates yeah yeah Niagara Falls tinfoil hat comedy in Niagara Falls September 14 15 and then Philly October 12 Syracuse October 14 and Houston November 3rd Austin just tell me go to forget this at Eddie Bravo 10p on Instagram thank you and Toronto were moving that a venue it was supposed to be the Ricoh Coliseum now it's gonna be the Scotiabank arena because both of you in it's because of a union dispute we talked about this before I'm not crossing in the union picket lines so we moved to a new venue is a new venue is also yeah it's bigger but it's also a union venue it's just that they don't have a problem with their contract or that it's not you know not the same dispute so I think it's the same Union in fact but when we go when everybody from the old tickets gets their new tickets then we'll sell there's 1,200 more tickets for this new place so that'll be within the next couple days I'm hoping alright Joe Rogan calm for all that shit bye thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
