three-two-one champ what's up how are you what's up Joe hey I'm good how good life is good life is good it's good stressful but it's good well I mean it has to be stressful you're the king of the hill yes yes and there's a lot of things they don't tell you do not bury up there Matt Hughes when he lost a BJ Penn I was interviewing him in the Octagon he said something like really honest and very shocking he said honestly he goes into relief he goes like being the champ and the stress of it all he goes I'm real relief to have been lost like first of all to lose it's very like the fact that he had the balls to say that like just admit it like hey it's a relief like you know he just choked me out but I'm happy I'm happy that it is for guys like that that have reached that status it is the Anderson Silva yeah the Georges st. Pierre those guys it is a relief because you know and I'm just I'm starting to see a little bit why because as soon as I walk out of there defending your title as soon as you just beat this kid up fans can't wait to say oh no this is the guy that's gonna be gone that's the guy that's gonna beat you so there's there's really no calm down you know let me take a vacation let me do this no because fans are on it they want a guy to step in there with you tomorrow to beat you that's always gonna happen yeah you know but everybody anybody who's a champ yeah but that that's not imagine doing that five six seven times over and over like these guys George st. Pierre that case have done over it just gets overwhelming because it's like nothing's ever good enough for you guys you know I can't go out there put on a flawless performance win and just have you guys say you know what he's the best no it's like you were good but yeah this guy is gonna beat you this guy this is good enough well there's always going to be a certain percentage of people that are not happy with anything I saw people that are tweet and talking shit about Conor after he just won flawless victory 42nd knockout of Donald Cerrone and they were like that doesn't prove shit you know he's gonna fall apart if he fights anybody good as soon as he gets in there with a wrestler this and that blah blah blah it's like some people are just negative absolutely you can't fix them you just accept them the way they are just like I know and it wasn't one of the advice to ever shot gave me early on is uh make friends with this make friends with uh because I you know you get worked up before a fire you know he's like nah make friends with that feeling because that that's a good feeling you know or your backstage before your fight you're super nervous you want to take a shit you know you want a pu p like 50 times you barely drinking water but somehow there's some kind of pee coming out and he's like no make friends with that feeling you know the moment you accept that feeling it's not that big of a burden anymore Rashad's a wise man supervising that's a very that's a very wise piece of advice because you can really change your perception based on how you approach something and just decided yeah this all right this is a part of the process this is what's up big for me right now yeah very very big for me because I am a creature of a routine I love having a routine and and it's a fine line between routine and obsessive compulsive mmm and it's a very very fine line yeah because and he started on for me early on when I when I started to succeed in wrestling I was I okay this is my routine okay I'm looking at the okay I'm 10 matches out so that means I need to get up and I need to warm up my warm up was the same okay I'm gonna jog back and forth twice before I skipped back and forth twice before I I do my lunges back and forth twice before I do my stance and motion back and forth twice like it was it was that routine I had to do it at that time oh no I'm going to the restroom I need to pee before I go for this match but I'm gonna go into the same bathroom I'm going to the same stall mmm you know I'm gonna pee and I'm gonna come out and use the same sink to wash my hand get one or two paper towels throw it away go back out like it got to a point where it's like that's my routine and then I go out there and I perform and I win and I get that's why that's why I'm performed so it's like OCD it becomes there's a fine line so I had to realize that that's a fine line because it's not necessarily OCD because when you when it becomes obsessive compulsive is when for me what is when you feel like you can't succeed unless you do those things right so it's like dang I forgot to do that well I'm gonna lose I'm gonna lose no it's I had to learn how to control it early because it's like my that's my routine but even if I I didn't do that I didn't have enough time to do that because sometimes you'll have enough time to do it right think you know something goes out of whack matches and early but and you don't have enough time to to get your routine and so it's I had to be able to adjust my mind okay we still go out there and perform we still go out especially in the fight game you know you go out there quick - quick knockouts boom boom boom you thinking you've got 30 minutes to warm up it's up like no you got that coming back you got ten minutes it's like oh I got ten minutes I can't get my whole routine in how much time do you need like say if you're in the locker room and you like before you walk out for the fight how much time do you need to get everything loosened up what do you like I mean I'm older now my joints make noises now so I'm not too crazy because I work out that morning before the fight I work and that's when I really get the hard work out it you have a hard workout the day of the fight yeah the day of the fight I work at holy Shannon all my coaches you know my training partners everybody we going and we get a good sweat I like to blow it all out because the night before I don't because that's that's the day of Wayne's so you just cut that Thursday night you cut a lot you cut away dehydrated you weigh in that morning out of that Friday morning so that Friday is dedicated to just rehydrating in evening how much do you cut I don't get that that that last fight was uh probably one of the biggest I stayed throughout and I think I was up to about maybe 197 and but when I start really full-fledged going to days in camp I try to keep my weight around 190 to 191 because that's why I feel strong you know but not my fastest because I've seen you walk around in between fights I'm like how the fuck does that one side just it's it's it's fake it's just you know III do a couple of no air in those muscles I've got a back and I know I am I do a couple of you know freaking curls and my arms just swell up just you swell up but but 197 if you're getting up to 197 you're cutting twenty-seven pounds yeah how much does that take out of you well like I said I'm a creature of a routine and and and I like to get into that routine so I'm dieting well eating well so by when I'm down to about three percent I think you should probably some of the leanest I've been - yeah when I'm down to this from calipers or from from from calipers is that caliper things not totally not I mean yeah of course it's not gonna be completely accurate right you know but around that area because I just have nothing I'm just extremely lean and at that point I'm 180 I want to say 84 85 pounds so you're just cutting 15 pounds of water yeah but about I would say 12 anywhere from 12 to is as water but you know I have an amazing team behind me you know amazing strength and conditioning coach amazing you know nutritionist I work with Clint up at the P I know is he the one who hooks up the weight kind of me well yeah they help with it you know because he lives in Vegas and I'm in South Florida so me me and Clint we stay in contact you know and uh and one thing that I liked about Clinton is the fact that he gave me the time to say hey you know let's let's really test your body look at all this and that you know you're the kind of athlete you carry a lot of muscle and and you know there's that stigma that if you have a lot of muscle you run out of gas really really fast but will you work we got to make sure that you're eating the right way to make sure you sustain that and of course my strength and conditioning coach dr. Cory peacock I mean PhD and you know the associate professor over at Nova University you know in exercise physiology I mean smart brilliant guy you know I've been working with them since my first fight in the UFC and you have particular needs because you've got problems with your knee so you can't run exactly like that's why I started working with it is is before that I was working with Jake Bonacci and Jake it amazing you know Jake was like Xtreme Couture for a long long time and Jake knew what he was doing but Jake you know the thing with Jake is Jake was a mastermind with the you know if you're an athlete you got you know all your body parts work so like this is what we need to do to get you tip-top state shape and then when Cory came in was after I had that injury because I had a microfracture surgery and then I had to fight the finale like three and a half months after that so microfracture surgery is that shit they do to try to rebuild cartilage in your knee so one of those yeah that night now some doctors like oh yeah that's from the Stone Age you don't do that anymore really but it's they going when they go in and I guess they create tiny little fracture right and whether it's the you know for mine was the knee so either it's the femur come out with the I forget what the bones called but this right to tibia you know they try to I guess let it bleed in and create you know the cartilage you know and work at all no didn't work and I think it actually set me back a big we tell me that's where we talked about that the last time yeah but you know whoever done stem cells yeah I get your advice I'm winded stem cells and do it in Panama no I didn't go to Panama but that doctor did it for me in Dallas dr. Neil Reardon yeah yeah they can do some crazy shit in Panama a lot of guys I sent my mom down there twice yeah they told my mom she needed knee replacement and I was like before we do this let's let's just see what happens and it took you know my mom's in her 70s so it took a while but about eight months in the pain went away and then I sent her down for a second time and looks even more improv what's really crazy is I saw her over Christmas and she looked younger well yeah so I mean I'm sure it has a lot of different effects a lot of different ways that that that thing can help out but in my case the the thing about it is I'm so active that it's very very hard to sit back and you say oh man that worked because I'm still kicking every day I still feel that pain kicking every day I still feel that pain of bouncing on my knees taking which I really wanted to heal up you know you got to take time off but that's you that I can afford but what about just swimming like could you do that for a couple months just swim only for strength and conditioning and just do that I do swim you know I don't really run a lot you know that's the thing with Cory peacock is uh when he came in was adjusting me to not being so hard on my knees you know working away from that because I haven't really done a back squat since maybe 2014 is that something that's particularly rough on your knees oh yeah imagine carrying all that load and scrying right that was bad and you know the Russian split squats and all that all those were were killing my knees and those are the things that you know we're taught to do for strength right yeah I need to be strong and explosive so I need to squat I need to do all these things but you know Cory came in and really kind of helped you know mold the way that I work and not necessarily killing all those we still squat well you know we'll switch it up we'll do the you know the kettlebell front squats or wool you know we'll do a bunch of different squats but he he really came in and helped kind of shape the way that I went about it so you know my strand that's the thing that I always do here around is I try not to slip a my strength and conditioning because I know I have a lot of muscles and at the same time I gotta keep keep that's also a part of your style right your stuff yes you push a pace yeah I got to push that pace and and a lot of guys are strong right away like the one that hit you and insight oh man that guy's strong but what about the guy that hits you and then keeps going because guys can't a lot of guys can't maintain that and Susanna and that's where I like to think I have an edge over everybody and so this strength and conditioning coach that you've been working with from the beginning or give us like a what it was a regular routine for you like what kind of shit does you have you do doctor peak okay so we just we started getting back in there literally last week so you took a little time off how's your hand that's the thing I free I went and I know the doctors gonna hate me for this I had a cast on so then I go to Vegas and um and I talked to the doctors you know the UFC doc and those guys in Vegas and you know it's not broken you know it's just an issue with the ligaments you can see see this right hand right here at the bottom of the thumb you could clearly see the ligaments we're all working in but then here there's that bump in between so they don't come out as much and that's causing me I don't have I didn't have I don't have the strength like you know being able to pull and this is a big part of my game is if I get around you I get a body lock I don't care what you're doing you just not getting me off guys I just I've spent years just working on that grip to where you just not you not letting me off until I let off right and so now I'm not being able to do that but it's healing fast and I was in Vegas and the doctors like we can just cut the cast off and make you a hard removable one that I can take off on and off so I can shower because that was the thing you're stuck in this cast for four weeks you can't really shower with it you got a shower with your arm up in the air on your hand stands out any hitches and you gotta stick stuff in there yeah and psychological I started getting a little anxiety with the two cuz it's like can't get this thing off my head sometimes I was laying there I'm just like I want it off my hand and I can't get it all so it was a ligament tear is that um it's not a tear they they they thought it was a tear at the bottom but you know strength is coming back so slowly so brain yeah it was like a really bad strand that and that a bumpy still there for some reason so we're working on it I'm doing everything but no fry and no fracture which is good news so I don't have to be out for too long yeah because you send me the tape of like when you hurt in training yeah see it like so it was one of those things where you you hit with the thumb I cuz you know when you got those big gloves on you know you can't really make a full fist right you know so especially when you have wraps so your hands kind of in there like this so you throw a punch the wrong way or somebody comes into your wrong way it's like boom you heard yeah so I heard it at one of my gosh what am I gonna do now you know so now everything's going through my head I got this guy's been talking shit for years and and everybody in the world is telling me you have to kill this guy you can't be that you can't lose to him so now I'm going through all this in my mind though I can't be that guy I can't lose to that guy I can't lose to that guy and then it's like then I'm like okay no it feels a little better I'm going I'm gonna spar hard so I starts pouring boom right away heard it again and out a couple of times almost cry and you're getting it taped up more times so getting it taped up but it isn't so it's still hurting but then he gets to a point where I'm just like shit got to block it out you know five to five I got to block it out so I'm gonna dressing-room a train everything's okay I block it out I'm not even thinking about it I'm thinking about going to work then I get in there in first round I don't even remember I just remember throwing it boom something's wrong oh and I'm just like okay play it off play it off and then prosecco be like you know he comes on and he's you know he's doing his job he's fighting me he's in there landing strikes and I'm like okay you know but at some point I never thought I'm gonna lose this fight cuz I never think like that it's like oh I'm not gonna lose this fight even if something's not going my way I just I'm gonna adapt he funny wasn't it but like on the what the scorecards at the end of the fight we were very close yeah I I knew it was close I would cause it for the first time ever I asked my coaches did I win that round hmm I've never in my career done that I'm the type of guy even when I was resting I'm the red type of wrestler who I like to run up the scoreboard I don't like the live and leave any doubt that I won that round I'm gonna dominate that run I'm gonna make sure I won so in my head I don't know I don't need to ask hmm for the first time in my career I went back my I went that round that went that round but I even by me asking that I never thought oh I'm not gonna finish this fight I always knew I was gonna finish the fight but I just was like I was did I win that there one that you know I don't know why I don't know how or what what was going on in my head but for some reason I asked I was asking so I knew the fight was close it was a good fucking fight man it was a good fight the thing about Kobe is he tricks you into thinking he sucks cuz he's got a goofy suit on and he talks crazy and you know he wears the maggot hat and all that stuff but but then if you didn't see any of that if you just watched him fight you liked that motherfucker puts up pace on people yeah allowed he did a Robbie Lawler I was like good lord like nobody does add to robbie lawler like he put a fuck and pace on him just stayed on him like guys have wrestled him before Robbie you know like got a hold of them dragged him down tried to make it a you know a state you know try to stall him out that's not what Colby did Colby just stuck on him like glue and just put that pace on him yeah I mean he really he really that he really showed you know like how good he is and I mean III give respect or respect to I'm no I'm no hater you know I know this kid could fight I know he was good I knew he was tough and I knew he's a competitor as well he's always been a competitor I knew guys that weren't wrestling teams with this guy you know besides Jon Jones I knew other guys you know that I'm good friends with that wrestled with him so I've always known that he was a competitor that he was gonna come out and tried to compete you know but I like I said I just mentally I think I'm just on a different level than these guys just because everything that I've been through that I've done in my life has shaped me into the man that I am so mentally I'm just on a different level than him well you have to have that attitude right yeah yeah and I judge I just I felt it I knew it and I felt it even and now so more so than ever because now you've got all the fans but you know on what he's got his fans you've got everyone has fans that are gonna talk shit to you well the first time that you had a close fight yeah you have saying yeah which is kind of crazy I mean think about your career it's pretty fucking nuts I mean you win the title over one of the best welterweights of all time at tyron woodley and you just dominate him right you think about all the other guys dos Anjos all those guys you smashed and why I mean that's you had a crazy run-up to the title and then a crazy title winning effort and then this was the first time we saw you in like a very close fight yeah I mean attest to him to like he's a tough guy at the end of the day you know to make fantastic fights you gotta have the right dance partner yes yeah and Fraser needed Olly yeah I need each other and he was the right dance partner and to be honest with you you know if I didn't take too much out of him because each fight takes something from you you know internally so if I didn't take too much from him I think I might see him again to be honest because like it's clear that we are the two best guys in the division and so yeah I mean I look forward to seeing them again I think you guys will see each other again I do I'm really interested to see what happens with Tyron and Leon Edwards you know they're fighting next that's a big fight very hard fight it is us it is it's a it's a hard fight for both guys but in it stylistically matches up well from those guys because Tyron has a lot of successes with which southpaw guys mm-hmm that right hand yeah he's got that that cannon his right hand and and Tyron is very very good when guys don't completely dominate and control what's going on and Leon Edwards has done better at that with guys that he feels like he can keep up with but with the guy like tyron woodley that that can wrestle like tyron woodley that's got power like him I wonder how he's going to do but I feel like Leon gets the least amount of attention when it comes to lightly top-flight world-class fighters he's a top-flight world-class fighter but he gets the least amount of attention out of those guys for whatever weird reason yeah it's I mean it's the era that we live in I mean this this is the first fight like if you really think about this is the first fight you were actually starting to hear his voice I write like it's like who is Leon Scott or Edward whatever well the biggest thing with him was when he had a fistfight with Maz Vidal like when they went ahead it wasn't a fistfight like Moscow I'll just work with whatever that guy whatever his name is you know I mean you know he openly said it you have one of the best sucker punches in the game and I'm the best 40-yard dash so you go in there you sucker punch somebody backstage and you run out of there and they rush you out of London before it Brits can get ahold of you for the London boys came back you know so I mean yeah that that's kind of unfortunately for Leon that's good but it's not crazy too because when you're in a foreign country and you commit assault usually they lock you the fuck up they got him out of it let's just they got him out of there him out of there but it's weird like no charges no nothing they got it but in that kind of because this video it's not like we don't know what happened yeah and the crazy thing is that the he gets praised for that yes famous for that night man I do that over there or imagine anybody else to anybody else doing that in London it's how do you do it it's weird like how did Moss it all get away with it it is with the forces that be UFC is very uh they're very good at what they do and let's just say they got him I think let's just say let's just say yeah yeah he's been talking crazy shit yeah that might be your next fight what do you think do you think that's gonna be your next fight I hope so because of uh because of the way that I think I'm the type of guy to wear anything you say can and will be used against you inside that octagon oh you're a court of law exactly exactly I'm the judge the jury and the executioner in there and and that that's how I approach it you know cuz some guys you just sign the contract to go fight the guys right but I I get obsessed with the fact that I want them to say something I'm waiting for them to say something it's a little tougher than the guys that don't really have to say anything else have anything negative to say it's a little tougher to go in there and you know and get and get angry to fight them and I'm I look at I want them to say something they do an interview that pops up my Google Alerts on you know my someone from my team of Tony boom someone did this interview but this check it out if I have time I watch it all he said that okay you know and in this guy it's you know what it's it's funny to see the way it's shifted like the curry his career shifted is God has been known for a long long time a long time yeah and he was at running the milk I would win some lose some win some lose some I mean you know not that long ago he was losing you know but and the credit to his team as well you know they've done a good job at picking the right fights to really get him to where he is now but you know what actually happened you know there's his story he went he went on a South American game show well yeah he was 300 pounds before he went and did that was he he was really fat brah look at piggy fine-looking pictures really what this bad dislike post wonderboy wasn't it yeah somewhere around then I guess somewhere around there I think is post wonderboy right that's better but he got fat really bad fat not when I fought was I fought Wonder Boy no when I fought Demian Maia I think that was like the tail end of the of the huskiness on his part but it was at some point like listen like everyone's buying into the height this is what I'm saying that they've done a good job at creating this hype by picking the fights to where one fight was a gamble the Ben Askren fight was a gamble you know you win that fight you take all that hype that this guy has which this guy didn't belong in there in the first place but previously in this career early on his career you could make the argument that yes but at that point in his career he didn't belong in there but he goes out there let's say Ben Askren just take him down and does what Ben Askren does you wouldn't be having this conversation right now hmm so he goes that's a gamble on their part and the gamble paid off he went and they took all that height from Ben then who's the next guy the guy that you know another guy that went some lose some but has a ton of high because he just fought Connor goes in there and fights Nate now that fight turns out the way did you get all this hype now you got all these people thinking oh my god this guy's a killer where has he been this and that it's the same guy that was 300 pounds not too long ago it's not three above north oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah never saw him fast yeah you should look at pictures oh yeah but you know hats off to him he got the weight off and you know he went over and did his thing and I'm no hater I give credit where credit is due yeah but but don't he was always that guy that said you know what I'm not I'm not this cliche I'm not playing this character I'm not doing this you know I'm just a real fighter in this but they're you showing up at fucking press conferences is looking like the knockoff of Scarface yeah but don't you think that that's wise like no it is what very smart is what it is but say it like it is don't sit here and say oh these guys are being the gimmick these guys are doing there's this guy's he's doing that you're doing the same damn thing and then look at what he did that last fight oh my god he took the biggest L of that night like that was corny you want to wear the robe you want to stand there you say he was holding that silver belt like he they actually think this is a real belt the BM FL what did you think about that BM l felt strange the video girl they didn't need a BM l felt for this last fight with Connor and cowboy they just needed a good match up yeah right so why what is why does the BM f bellick is that a one time it was yeah it was it was something they created to kind of hide it hide that fight they they needed they I mean I really need ammo did they need a man always ate dinner but you know if they get loud enough and Dana hears them and Dana sees that Dana is a very smart man greatest promoter you've ever seen you know and to jump on that like you know what shit like let's make a mess that motherfucker make a nice little silver bell you know this little silver it's like is that a gold yeah it's like a purplish color picture of it it's beautiful what does beautiful but you have seatbelts beautiful that's more beautiful that's more it's like saying life you know I mean you look at a new Corvette you go that's a beautiful car and then you look at a Ferrari oh that's a better looking car oh yeah that's a better okay Oh or at Bentley yes yeah it's another level but it's yeah but this one's like the Bentley and then the Honda Civic silver was that like copper no that's not copper I kind of Sterlings in some it mean it seems like the lighting no it's sterling silver it's like that I kind of think it's gold no it's not cool no no not gold it's not go wrong yeah it's like brother bronze it's not even silver is not if you second versus brawn I mean this is like honestly this is like a participation medal you know how when you do this they give you the participation medals they're like yeah you go kid you did a great job and that's what this is well if you beat him do you get that belt ooh I want that shit want it people just deal with it if you had it would you wear both of them no what did you do with it just put it aside but in my closet I put it in my closet but it's like there's not there's no what that means nothing it was just something to hyper fie but they ran that his team has ran with it like yeah was marvelous when they called it when they showed the video of him when they went to the camera turned to him during the last pay-per-view the fucking pop was gigantic everybody went crazy when they saw him yeah I mean height is real yeah the hype is real it's a lot you know big people like I love him you know but that's the thing is people love you until they really see what you are you know Darren till had a lot of hype and shout out to Darren - I mean you know he's still you know growing in this in the sport but he had a lot of hype to her people were selling and this guy's gonna beat Woodley right like even a song boy I was like yo he might get Woodley really I was like he might get Willie and you can see that's like really disrespectful various work that they were making him the favor in that fight I'm like you guys are crazy you're crazy I mean this guy's already fought one of the best strikers twice in wonder boy and beat him both times not just that he was the only one that hurt him yeah like he hurt wonderboy bad in both of those fights wonderboy never heard him so you got the guy who's arguably one of the best strikers to ever do it in the welterweight division me wonder boy was a fantastic kick balls yeah Oh Tywin see gosh Tim you saw a wonder boy did - Mouse with all yeah yeah I pointed him yeah good fight I mean he dropped him like several times did he drop him yeah a couple times well Darren dropped him to a chair until dropped mas Fadel - but yeah mas with all starched him yeah and you know I give credit where credit is due you know but um like like I'm saying back to that like yeah everyone but I was almost almost like a you saw wooden like that so I'm sure Willie was a little afraid in that fight because it's like do you think so yeah yeah you have to be I think he was also the hype they were putting behind them you have to be because at some point as a chant and that's what makes you sane as a champion is that little fears like wow they're really saying is this kid really good enough he's the favorite is he good enough I thought that was so crazy keep this yeah sometimes there's odds and I'm like this is just this doesn't make any sense at all to me I agree you know there's certain odds where I'm like you guys who's making these odds yeah I'm beats me especially these rankings too I'm Mike they've got this kid at number three he hasn't fought before hasn't fought number one number two he hasn't fought number five hadn't fought number six and I hope in the hell you see number monster dolls number three who it makes the rankings rankings rockin we I don't yeah we are who makes it rankings sometimes a guy will beat a guy and then he'll be below that guy in the rank ass like what wonder boy wonder boy put on a clinic versus it wonder boy I think is is even top 10 on the water boys I think he might be like nine or something like that which i think is insane well the Vicente Luque fight which was his last fight yeah that was um I think I think he was like ranked I want to say 11 or something yeah that's that's a sentence the percentage is tough tough guy maybe two tough fighter yeah like a lot of people gonna have their hands full with Vicente oh he's an animal you know there's a couple of guys in division right now and I see these guys you know Jeff Neil's nothing oh he's the one guys the dark whore and and I'm not taking my eyes off none of these guys I see all these guys which is why I can't afford to take five months off yeah let my knee feel this some type of way like Neil's the most promising to me i watch that moving I'm like a Jesus Christ he's talented yeah you know he was waiting tables just like a year ago man that's that's a struggle yeah his last fight against Mike Perry I believed that was his first camp where he didn't have a job I'm pretty sure I'm sorry if I'm incorrect and Big John an expert in big respected he's fucking today respect to that because you know a lot of guys are afraid to even do that mmm-hmm you know and then you got you get some of the guys that they get in the UFC like all my problems to solve I'm good I'm good now but they're still struggling even when you first get in you're still making less than minimum wage you've boil it down you you're making less than minimum weight that's crazy yeah but it's also like you gotta have good food right I've gotta have you got to be able to afford massage you gotta be able to afford some things hey honey yeah you're in a hardcore training camp and maybe it is better to have like a little bit of a job and I think Jeff was waiting tables yeah it's to me it's crazy like it just seems like where is the money going like how much money is a cage fight worth it should be worth I'll watch you fighting on TV the whole lot that should be all you need to do yet now let me see my first fight in the UFC let's say I'm a 10 and 10 Jesus Christ that's crazy to me so boom I go in the fight $20,000 but Mike I got 20 grand alright now first and foremost 20% comes up manager and run gym boom off the top ten taxes gone taxes you know boom off the top yeah and then it's like oh yeah my daughter just turned one her birthday party's gonna totally cost $2,500 oh because it's one you got no big yeah boom off the top gone my car you know they've been letting me you know kind of pile up that car payment for a while now so I need to pay that in the insurance everything that's backed up so that's like 3200 boom off money's all gone everything's gone within two weeks I sat at home still living with Rashad like I got $3,200 left I fought like two and a half weeks ago what that's crazy what just happened it's gotta last year and it's because that's your source of in cats it yeah you know thank God I got that the the performance bonus in that fight how much does performance bonus I was fifty they used to give locker room bonuses right is that a thing of the past it's but I think you know it depends on who that if you're the right guy and you go out there and do something special certainly night I mean I think Dana is still generous enough depending on his mood how he's feeling it's still generous enough to maybe say you know what take care of you because I miss you see now he'll just send a couple of guys extra he's like man these guys did great and I'm gonna I'm gonna send them bonuses too so he'll just bonus these guys that's very cool yeah yeah it's not enough funny it's not funny for fighting you know it's interesting cuz a boxing match some other people would say well that's what boxers get I don't think boxing is as rough on you if you're doing a six round boxing match and you're only making a couple thousand dollars like I kind of get you're moving up the ladder and that's just how it goes but the camps that you guys go through when it comes to wrestling when it comes to submissions when it comes to kickboxing there's so much more potential for damage on your body it's just so much harder it's just getting your legs kicked and just takedowns just those two factors like there's so much more beating on your back boxers are obviously tough as shit and they obviously have a very difficult job it's not notes don't saying boxing is easy but no comparatively physically on your body like a six round you know pro boxing match you're in the preliminaries yeah as opposed to a UFC fight Oh UFC a three round UFC if I can be fucking KO yeah well the only making 10 grand it's uh imagine losing the fight then you only get ten you only get ten then you go home now take all the stuff that I just mentioned you're in the hole yeah well now imagine you're fighting not even for the UFC your frame for Bellator right yeah I get even less than that less than that it's and I have friends at that fight for Bellator I have friends that fight for you know other promotions and my little brothers fighting too and so he's making his way up to it and you know the one thing about him is I have to keep him somewhat grounded because you know he can't use a big foot big time football player and you know potentially should be you know still feels like he should be in the NFL you know but that the thing about that is keeping his mind in where it should be that hey this is why it's gonna feel good when you start making million-dollar paychecks it's okay to make one in one now it's okay to make two thousand and two thousand now how long has he been five guys did finally I want to say a year-and-a-half how long he's been training a year and a half oh shit yeah so he's just getting into it yeah just gotta be crazy your brothers and champion of the world and you're just kind of getting your wheels greased up and see and I try to honestly I try to make it not not weird friend because it's uh you know we're a family to where we like we're very very close family but imagine boys that we're all competitive boys like if your brother's doing this good and like you want to do it better yeah you know and I'm imagining how it is for him you know to have a brother that's the champion to where now you're in the sport that your brother was a champion in yeah like how is that and I I don't ever want to make it weird for him I want to make it as easy as possible for him because I wanted for you man I want him to be bigger than because he's a heavyweight now once he give you this yeah once he gets dizzy I think he's like 6 to 255 260 jeez I mean he's a freak she's my brother's diesel big big dude and if it's uh when he gets that striking down and really starts sitting on punches because he wrestled in high school - he was a high school state runner-up when he starts sitting on punches and really putting his he just got his first standing knockout his last fight so when he starts putting these guys to sleep I think he's gonna be a humongous star sport and that how old is he he is 30 that's a weird time to start though isn't it yes but he's so frickin athletic it's it's oh my god yeah look if you guys go online go to his Instagram at you Muhammad 97 like look at some of him and his strength coach are the most outrageous funniest like guys that you will see online I mean if you it's the fact that he's still a little under the radar now let him get in the UFC and get to where I'm at the Lord you just put them on it right now right now every video would be over millions of views really they do the most outrageous things but it works right there that's him right - but it works jack it works for him oh my god you watch him training let me see some of those misses this is him learn counter see he's a big fella a huge it's crazy that he's only been doing it a year and a half only be doing a year and so what made him decide to put football side and start fighting it was just he was caught in that transition of trying to get get into the NFL or trying to get back in and as a free agent and because the NFL man you got thousands of guys I come out for the same position every year and there of course NFL wants to newer fresher younger guy that they can get for cheaper yeah and you know and so the longer you were out it makes it so much harder to get back in I can also imagine when you're getting close to 30 yeah these kids are 20 to 21 full of piss and vinegar he still thinks he's 20 he's still my brother still acts like he still got the energy of her of a 21 year old I mean he is uh he's the whole definition in my mind of what it is to be have a little you know he's always lit always did he come to you and say hey come on I'm thinking about fighting did he did you have a conversation oh that's that's the way that's the way this thing about it is uh see I know my brother so well to where uh at some point he's and he's very prideful too you know at some point he didn't wanna not gonna say I've kind of like roundabouts I can tell when he's getting into it cuz I brought him me he went my first ever fight you know I brought him to Nebraska with me and so he goes to all my fights and I could tell that he was flirting with it really cuz he you know it kind of started you know training a little bit and uh and I heard him tell a coach like yeah yeah I think I'm you start fighting you know but and not I tried to have that conversation but it's kind of weird with him it's kind of a weird dynamic you know but I love him to death and uh but then when I found out that he was kind of really serious about it I'm like okay this is let's lay the plan out for you because I want you to get there faster than I did I want you to get to have an easier time than I did to get to the top you know so he's working his way I've got great coaches that he's working with right now where's he training straight out of Dallas he goes on training through it that safe where you know Jeff Neil trains it well he's got a striking coaches you know Stephen Stephen right Danny who worked with Johny Hendricks oh and so yeah he's learning he's learning fast and of course his strength coach out there and you train with him at all nah I'm not really not a lot we haven't really trained a lot together because I'm in Florida and I'm traveling so much right to wear but I'm in the process to where I'm gonna start getting him to Florida more and more now because now he's you know he's learning more now he knows the ground a little bit you know now he's striking is starting to pick up because the worst thing I want to do is bring him into a camp full of killers like in our gym and have them discourage him right you know and you I would hate to do that yeah because he's so talented he's so athletic I don't want to stun that so early but now it's getting to the point where now is it's I can bring him in for tests months at a time where you know to see how where he's at because I mean he's really well he thinks he can fly tomorrow hmm you know but you know I want him to walk that's such an important factor of not discouraging a guy but also testing him like this it's a fine fine line right yes very very fine line because you you have to be tested because if you've never really tested the worst place that you want to get tested inside right that case I'm firm believer that there's nothing worse than being locked in the cage getting this shit bit out of beat out of you and there's nothing you can do about yeah you know so I I would hate for that to happen to him yeah and like it happened to me in practice before I got there I I don't forget the moment at all and so I don't want that to happen to him inside that cage mm-hmm yeah it's got to be strange seeing your brother just getting the ball rolling and just getting into it it's a good feeling though it's a really good feeling seeing them kind of pick it up how many fights you had no thank you six and one now oh wow yeah five and one or six and one now and so it's so he's got off to a quick start yeah it's having quite a few fights yeah yeah but that's the thing is you know you don't wanna you know raking all this fight and be ten oh you really haven't fought into one you really haven't been tested and then you get there and then you get beat up you're like oh man you've not you're second-guessing yourself yeah that's the the difference and we were talking about this the other day the difference between the boxing way of raising a fighter versus the the UFC really you don't get a chance to pick your fights in the UFC like in a boxers career the manager would say ok let's try you with a guy who's longer who's got a good jab ok we did that let's try you with a guy who likes to stay glued to your chest let's test him with this let's get him in there with a journeyman there's a little slippery who's got some good experience and let's let's give you some seasoning the UFC is like do you want this fight yeah yeah and that's a see boxes been around so long there's so many boxers that you can pick from because that's everyone does it does that yeah you know there's long guys at journeyman's that have a lot of losses some guys that are kind of 500 you can kind of just pick the guys and then you have the promising guy that you're trying to build then you can just kind of pick guys around him but you MMA is not really like that yet because it's still so new everybody is trying to be a champion yeah so it makes it difficult to be able to pick guys and on top of it then you get to the UFC where it's like this is a fight yes or no which I have gotten a call hey you're gonna go to Brazil you're gonna fight this guy if you say no alright we're gonna extend your contract you say yes alright see there that's weird right you can't you can't negotiate like he can with a normal promoter no it's very no so we were talking about your strength and conditioning because your knees we kind of got sidetracked like what kind of stuff does he have you doing to replace running and like off to replace run like III work in the pool a lot mmm myself I run a lot in the pool and you know I swim - I'm not the best swimmer in the world but you know I get in and I get after and I get tired you know those things at GSP uses where he has like these yeah I see what's on his hands and almost feet no you like I play with those yeah what are those things um they kind of they create the resistance in the water you know so it kind of gives you the resistance pulling pushing and then you know throwing punches with him and he it just gives you that extra work that you need George loves that shit he loves it it's like his main training or in strengthening fight if I can have Muttley if I could give you a magic wand say come on you can pick Bing who you pointing that magic one yes be all that she SP all day just for the legend status yeah because um George did he went out the way you're supposed to know and he could still do it he proved it to if they came back and not just do it go up away class and get it done he can still do he's trained he's one of those guys it's not just gonna stop training he's been trained he's still training and I know he can compete still Feroz says he's still the best fucking guy he's ever seen he's like the guys still a fucking man right now in the gym training hard like nobody could touch him yeah and I like to test that you know with and I think respect to George this is no disrespect by any means but there's a reason guys like myself and and kabhi want to fight him mm-hmm is because we we want to test ourselves this is not a matter of disrespect and I want to beat this guy's ass no it's George was the best he did everything the right way and and and got to the top and walked away and he can still do it so we want to test herself against a guy like that because we we pride ourselves on being the best we've worked tirelessly to get to this point to where it's not as if hype it's not for the money like all that is good yes you know that that's great but we want to test ourselves against the best to ever do it and that's what George symbolizes and of course myself I'm using my weight um you know now I'm the king he was the king like it's interesting that you would prefer that over Conor because I think the Conor fight would be the biggest payday right absolutely I think ah you don't think so I mean I don't know red pennies night we all love red pennies I mean the last pay-per-view they're saying tract just below Connor and khabib it's a fucking they think it's more than 2 million pay-per-view bars Wow huge huge has come back yet that motherfucker has charisma absolutely and you can't take anything away from Conor make honor as put himself in that in that part in that status to be that guy and even sometimes I have to think man like that because some guys get envious of that like how did he do that like some guys did you special like that and Connor is that guy he's special like that yeah you know so he people just gravitate towards him and he you know special guy but can you imagine me fighting Connor like that wouldn't even be fair it would not be fair like I give everyone has a punches chance but he would not be fair like you saw what come even did to him at 55 and I imagine me doing that to him at 70 and I'm not just gonna take him down I'm I'm gonna march forward I'm gonna hit this guy I'm gonna beat on him I'm gonna take him down I'm going to I would do some some bad things to Connor and and not just because I it's not that I don't like the guy I mean Connors Connor do you just think that he's a natural 55 yeah and he fought at 45 and you shot both your fucking legs off to make 45 that's when they say impossible and that's absolutely am literally impossible you'd have to get a tapeworm yeah it would be it would be bad like you ever seen I you ever see me that way get down to wait yeah I look real African no no you a very fancy very thin you can tell you're sucking a lot of water but yeah you know George Lockhart says the big muscular guys like yourself that it's easier for them to cut weight because your muscles mostly water and that's yeah I'm not nesting I worked with with Cory on is we leave being able to keep more muscle on now to camp to where it makes that cut a lot easier that's it so funny because that's sort of a lot of people's eyes I'd be counterintuitive like he was talking about Yoel Romero and he's like that's the perfect body for cutting weight I'm like that is so crazy like it looks like the guy's got no weight to lose I know it's hard to like yeah yeah yes like I I hug him I hug him a couple of couple weeks ago Mike what well Luke Rockhold said when he fought him he said it feels like he's made out of Steel yeah I was like even when you hit him it hurts I can understand that because Luke kicked him Luke tore his legs yeah in that fight and and then we're in the back and I'm looking at Luke's shin it's all torn up yeah he's bleeding cut up Mike was that before the staph infection yeah is that what caused the staph infection I don't know it could have been cause I think it was at that same leg his knees I mean his shin rather so fucked up like he's had skin grafts and all kinds of shit and he still has to put a sleeve over it when he fights yeah you know it was bad you know good thing is good-looking he's a handsome devil isn't he I mean - uh no husband - handsome it's like confusing he measured a good-looking guy beat you up beaten the fuck out of you - not just beating you up you have zero chance and then kicking you in the head at the same time you wake up what happened good-looking guy beat the shit out of you beautiful world champion like that's that's not to put beautiful tall perfect bone structure world champion now you walked through every airport or every uh a mall and his face is on cologne this new leather steel blue steel that's what he's doing now right amis done he's basically done fighting right for now no you can't you know Lucas when those we're guys you can't just say oh it's over you know Luke is one of those guys I think he can wake up get up tomorrow on the couch yeah I want to go train let's take a fight really you know III think he's one of those guys and yeah I don't think it's our over for him completely I think he can still compete don't you think that he should be 185 though well here's Martha hooks a big guy he's a big guy but here's my thought this should do more weight classes period 85 to 205 is bonkers the fact there's a 20-pound gap like that that's that's 20 stakes think of 20 stakes that's a giant amount of fuckin ice you like your your you're talking about two different categories of people 10 pounds is reasonable and you know obviously boxing it's much less yeah you know they have 54 then they have 60 then they have 68 they have the weird gaps pocket boxing has some strange gaps like 47:54 as weird but I think ten is good yeah I agree with you but then you know like look at boxing you can you do even all the weight classes can you can you I don't cuz I love that much of a fan yeah I don't know the champions are and all the way clubs that's a and then it's you know that's the thing about it is is you know UFC has this mystique right now to where you you know the champions yes you know there's only a few weight classes now you start adding to that which III agree to shit be more you know does that dilute everything that's going on which I don't think it will because I I thought once you know the UFC went to change it and left fox or left this that I'm like aw man this is gonna die out you know when they did I was like man I don't know if the sports gonna gonna keep going the way it is or when they sold to W me like I don't know if this is gonna keep going and then it's just it's one of those things it's it's a original sport it doesn't matter where you're everybody speaks fighting yes well I felt like when they went to ESPN I'm like Jesus this is perfect it's gonna be bigger but I thought it was an amazing move oh yeah yeah APN it's oh yeah that right now everybody watches ESPN yes I mean it's on every fucking bar all over the country everywhere it's just too big of a network for also Fox had all sorts of other shit going on - yeah and then fighting but ESPN is all sports like there's no distraction it's like you go there looking to watch some shit either you watching a game or you're watching a fight yeah and and that's what you know Dana has came out and said that that was the plan that's that's what he wanted to get to I was worried about the ESPN Plus shit when they went all pay-per-views to ESPN plus it was like oh no disaster but it's not well I mean when you got guys like Connor yeah he's an outlier that doesn't really right you know he can still do numbers but I love it cuz I can watch it on my phone yes I love because sometimes I have to do some family shit or something like that I could sneak away if there's a big fight yeah and I could watch it I just put the headphones on watch it on my phone but it makes sense because the world the world is shifting to that streaming everything everything is true so it makes sense for them going that route initially for guys like myself it didn't make sense but you know at the end of the day you just kind of have to you mean in terms of the amount of money that yeah yes is it a significant cut well initially it's going to be because now you go from where the ravaged Joe just like oh you know what let's watch some UFC today I see that see it on my cable or just ordered boom right there order to earn now you got to get online and you got a you know order you got to buy this buy the subscription and all of that to where it made it tough because you know people are lazy we don't want to do that extra words like wow I can't find this screw it I don't care about it so of course he hit the numbers really really hard but I think eventually it's gonna level out and and you know it's gonna make sense yeah I think so too I think more people are having those Smart TVs where you can just download apps yeah and I use Apple TV which is the shit you can just get everything at the zone do ya anything ESPN ufc's too much fight pass too much it's just too much you've got Apple TV you've got Amazon TV I've got Hulu you've got Netflix you've got this I have ten different subscriptions to and I'm paying for cable so it's like this is crazy this is a circular well they're trying to battle it out right yes we want loss and then HBO's got what is HP o is called HP o Max HBO max and and now they're all like linking up with musical guys as well like Amazon's got Amazon music one of them is like with Pandora the other ones like with what is it Spotify like they're like it's it's a battle right now with all these guys yeah it's it is interesting it's it's gonna be interesting to see how this all plays out I was really shocked when HBO got out of boxing I was like I can't believe that from when I was a kid HBO boxing was the shit Jim Lampley Larry Merchant you know I mean that that's how it was back in the day it was just you you always knew George Foreman was doing commentary Roy Jones jr. was doing commentary yeah I think when it's when the change of the figureheads changed I think that makes a big difference you know the people that are calling the shots when they you know cuz HBO you see that as something that's like a generational type like that's the big boss it's not just you know yeah you be the boss now I think that's something that's passed down so when the next guy in line is not you know with boxing and they're gonna slowly pull out you know what the sports are such a tradition boxing on HBO was such a tradition yeah it was so it was a part of HBO yeah it was and I mean thing thinking back all those big big fights that Tyson era all over John Jr Jones jr. oh that was on HBO yeah and so it's Max Kellerman it's crazy how it's gone yeah you know but that's weird yeah speaking of Tyson you know I spent some time with him not too long ago did you get high as fuck I did their podcast and they the hot box in it did you get hot box I I think I did I think I got some contact I'm not gonna lie they were always smoking in there and I walked out of there feeling lighter oh yeah I felt so much liars getting high with Mike Tyson and doing a podcast was one of the weirdest moments of my life really yeah man because I idolized him as a kid and Here I am I'm sitting across from him dude when I was young and Mike Tyson was the champ he was a fucking icon it was a stiff feel that way yeah but it was back but what I'm saying is like when he was the champ it was different than any other champ people forget the heavyweight division back there it was in stagnant it was stagnant nobody cared like Larry Holmes was a phenomenal boxer but Larry Holmes had beaten Muhammad Ali and no one ever forgave him he beat the fuck out of Ali and it was when Ali was already done and everybody felt sad that now Larry Holmes was the champ and they didn't they didn't appreciate him and then the people that Larry Holmes fought they were kind of lackluster no one was really no one stood out as being this fucking God and then when Spinks beat him by decision it's like the whole division was just stagnant yeah and then Tyson came along and what you weren't even watching a fight you were watching an execution and you were watching an event like everybody wanted to wash it tight and we get mad it would only last 30 seconds like fuck yes and that's uh those guys are special yeah and which is I believe what we're witnessing with Connor you know it comes guys that are special mm-hmm who may not win all the time because towards the end is Tyson's career it didn't win all the time right but he was still that special yeah he was an iconic person and now being able to hang around him and I get that that feeling that you got your I get that feeling like I'm so nervous I you know we I sat next to a mic shoutout to those guys at the Tyson ranch Rob and all of those guys uh you know every time I spend time with with Mike I it's weird that's Mike Tyson he's right there and we talked and he gave us some me and Henry a salute oh that's a that's like my brother now we spent some time together we spent some time with Mike and he gave us some crazy advice in symptom you know important advice because we we see certain situations like now as competitors as fighters we'll be in the gym and your training partner would just beat the shit out of you one day and you will leave you feeling like I suck I'm not I'm not that good I'm not this guy I'm not that good anymore I can't like no I'm sucking cuz I'm starting to feel that more and more now because when I when I spar for these big fights I like to make them kind of like an event I want to make them feel like I'm gonna fight so I like to just I don't want music I don't want this I want it to be me and just them and not just when you're in a room and everybody spawn at the same time it's a different feel you don't really get that adrenaline feel that really you know fight-or-flight mode you know never feel that because there's so much distractions going on so many things so many different sounds that you hearing but when it's excuse me when it's just you and them it's a completely different ballgame - oh I like to make you feel like that so I will get beat up some Saturdays I will just get the shit beat out of me because I've got maybe three four different guys rotating in on me that my coach is all paid and it sucks when you get into the new guy every round and this guy's just beating on you the you know that last five guys were taking me down and holding me down and he's beating on me and I would go home thinking man I suck like I'm not good anymore like this sucks how do I deal with this like I'm gonna lose his fight this this sucks but somehow someway I you turn you always turn the corner when do you feel like the corner gets turned you have like asked you know I know you're a you're big on routine but you have it in your head that like somewhere around like six weeks since things start to turn two and a half three weeks out three weeks out three weeks out from the fight is like weeks in the training are you wouldn't you through that what's us / - I'm always training but I like to do like maybe I want to say a 10 11 week camp so for eight weeks yeah shit might be going bad yeah so you'll have like about eight weeks out I'm feeling good like you know I'm still feeling good I'm still kind of beating these guys up I'm still kind of doing what I want then six weeks your body's starting to bike man bro I've been training for a while I'm kind of tired so just even now and then you're five four weeks out and now you're just getting beat up like these guys are just beating on you your body's tired your body's like I'm done I'm done training I'm done training like you know I don't want to do this anymore and you were getting beat on and mentally you're thinking too bro I'm gonna lose this fight I saw it I'm not good hmm I suck and then you I mean you're mad I suck bad I'm cursing myself in the car bro that was trash and I'm of course I'm watching the videos recording how'd you get hit with that you got taken brother you're trash you you're bad you're gonna lose you didn't get knocked out in front of thousands of people bro and then it's like after about three weeks so how you started to come and turn the corner cuz you getting closer and closer to the fight now my mind's eye Oh bro or getting close to this fight what about the fuck this dude he start turning the corner mentally he started getting strong and I started getting stronger and stronger and then at that point I'm okay with whatever is gonna happen because my training partners just beat the crap out of me for weeks on end and I went through that and we asked Mike like Mike huh what do you think about this I he's just normal the feeling like this Mike's like yeah hell yeah that's normal and then the special way and in this voice is like there were certain times where you know you come in the room in the practice and you'd watch me practice and and you can see my turning point and just beat the kick the shit out of me you think he was the champion you know you would think he was a champion that I was just a scrub in there giving him some rounds but then you take him out there and you put him in front of under the lights put seventeen thousand twenty thousand people around him and he can't do it and he just can't do it that's what makes champions champions being able to deal and handle all the chaotic stuff that happens before after and what's happening around them and and so I you know that was just like man you know he's so right because some guys and I've watched several guys in the practice room beef doing techniques just like how is that even possible like hitting you with crazy stuff but then you put him in there and put him under the lights and it looks like he's an amateur that is one of the weird things about gyms is those guys who are gym killers yes inside the gym they are fucking killers and then for whatever reason they can't do it can't do it my thought is always like can't you teach those guys how to keep it together when it comes to a fight or is that just something that's inside it's something that's inside because I've seen guys that they know like these guys put on clinics inside the practice room but then they get out there they just find a way to lose hmm they find a way to lose they can't deal with it they can't have a pressure the pressure they can handle everything that comes with it they they just find a way to lose to where you're just like how is that possible mmm even if the guys nowhere near their level they find a way to lose yeah it's a weird psychological characteristic that these gym killers have because you would feel like they would have so much confidence because they do so well in the gym but some guys like the difference between the way they look in the gym and the way they look when they're fighting is like who are you yeah you're not even the same person yeah you drop in your hands you get tired real easy you're all nervous weird he goes to it I think because in the gym you know they're familiar with you they know how hard I'm gonna hit him yeah they know how if I'm gonna come forward or if I'm gonna back down if they hit me with this this and this you know so it makes it easier to be safer in the gym yeah but then when you got to fight a guy you don't really know how well he trained you don't know if he's coming for a war or if this guy's coming for a point fight so you don't know all of that all that anxiety plays into it and that it takes a champions mentality to be able to hone all that control and still go out there and do your job and some guys just don't have that in them yeah and some guys get really wrapped up in the fear of looking bad yes the looking bad is just like hanging over their head I'm about to get knocked out everyone's gonna laugh I mean that's very fun of me they're gonna fuck with me that's very rude can you imagine me little bit ago we covered - oh that would have been the biggest one right there's so much oh my god it was so bad man I'm telling you I'm in different cuts and I mean Abu Dhabi people run up to me in the mall man I can't wait for you to kill this guy I go I'm in Brazil oh my god I can't wait for you to kill this guy I'm in Dominican Republic they can't even speak English but they're like I can't wait for you to confess everywhere so I imagine me going out there and and what I was feeling I had to really I took advice from Rashad I had to really make friends with that feeling and accept it well I'll tell you what man at the weigh-ins when Suzy painted the Nigerian flag on your face and you're staring them down and you just had this big smile on your face you look so calm I was like that guy is ready yeah you were but you were so composed at the weigh-in I was like there's no bullshit there was no fuck you there was no no emotions you just had a big smile on your face yeah I mean I mean it's at some point you get to the word it's no longer the talking like now I get it you got to sell a fight here and there you know this and that but I try to stay as true to myself as possible like obviously I understand people want to be entertaining I'm gonna do the best that I can now of selling a fight without going too far out of myself but when that when that contract is signed and I know that I have to go in there and take care of business there's no more of that like I have to be myself I have to be real and this guy said a lot of things that were very very personal you know a lot of things about my previous manager you know a lot of things about my team my current manager you know and a lot of things about my money my family my situation as well as far as my father all of that to where it really hit home to where it's the best way for me to teach you a lesson it's not by going in there fighting and angry I have to go in there being calculated like my normal self and really teach you a lesson because anything you say can and will be used against inside that achtung what was he saying to you he was talking to I couldn't hear because it was so loud and that the arena when you were weigh-in what was he saying to you I think you saying I'll be ready if you hope you're ready tomorrow jr. I hope you're ready hope you're ready I'm um I'm coming hope you're ready tomorrow I'm coming he's sitting so calm too he had a big-ass smile but but but you know when I look at these guys I'm looking for more than just that like I'm reading his body I'm reading everything and he's looking at me the whole time and he did the best because I know he's a competitor he did the best he could to hide his fear mm you know and and I was afraid to I'm afraid every one of these fights you you gotta be afraid but I make friends with that I'm okay with being afraid I'm not I'm not worried about I am okay with that so I'm watching him and there's there's a moment if you see that way in video we just stare down when you're you know after we stare down we stare down and I watch it him I'm watching the whole time I'm just watching him and he's doing this good job he's trying to stay on me stay on me stay on me stay on me and then he looks away and I just read his body I'm just like okay I know how worried he is I know how worried isn't it weird like you know that your opponent is worried you know everyone's worried right everyone's nervous but you gotta kind of see it yes you could fuck yourself in your mind that this guy's not even scared yeah I'm scared and he's not yes you can mine fuck yourself even though you know it's not even like everyone before a cage fight has to be nervous absolutely and um and yeah it's weird but cuz I'm looking at him and I'm studying here and I'm seeing the level of fear that he has and you know I'm trying to assess the level of fear whether it's it's something I can deal with or something that shit I'm just gonna have to go in I have no choice he looked pretty fun coffee he's very confident but you know I could see where a how superior I was in there to him my level of fear and his level of fear I can see where they were at because and and you got to be mindful of his level of fear as well because you a caged animal was very dangerous animal you know and so I can I'm seeing them and that's kind of how the way he that was that went I watched that fight again the other day um I was planning in the gym while I was working I was like that is a crazy pace like you fuckers came out guns blazing I mean it in my opinion is one of the very best welterweight title fights ever I mean it was epic it was actually watching the pace there wasn't I'm watching I'm watching I'm watching I'm watching I'm watching keep it on and keep it on him I'm watching I'm watching I'm watching it boom looks away well you had to I was talking to ya I'm like I'm like oh there was just a little moment just to read his spirit I felt his spirit at that moment and I'm just like it's not the same it's not the same like I'm gonna hurt this kid it's not the same but he's gonna come on he's gonna fight but I'm gonna hurt him you know at no point in that fight that I think I wasn't gonna hurt him when you dropped him in in the the final round when you stopped the fight yeah when you dropped him you saw him go down what was going through your head I was like oh I'm hitting now I'm hitting because I you know when you when you land up you landed punch good you don't really feel it and so at that moment I was kind of clipping him I was connecting everything I clipped him with what he was feeling the power at that point hmm you know I've hurt him a few times before but everyone kept talking about his pace his pace and this man and I carry power all the way throughout that's how I train I the powers gonna be the same the way I hit mitts with my coaches Henry hooped and all these it's all the same it's not all tap tap tap tap tap here and then a little bit of power here tap tap tap tell you a little bit yes I know how to do that I know how to mix it up like boxers do they know how to put a little bit in to this distract you with this then touch it with that I know how to do that too but I carry the power all the way throughout so by the fifth round when I hit him with her I think I hit him with the body and I hit a punch I hit him with a right hand that stunned him and he stumbled back and at that point I was in I was in just in the driver's seat I'm like okay I'm feeling him and then I hit him with a left foot boom that hurt him I feel everyone they hurt him because I'm not barely feeling the punches here and then when I put that cannon on his face Bowman he went down I was like stabilize stabilize we got time you know the goal is to get him out of here I'm not gonna jump on him because I've made that mistake before I've dropped the guy now and jumped on him going crazy trying to get him out of there let me stay on him just stay relaxed and I'm gonna get a nut and at that point I was just and you get to a certain zone to where you see him coming he's like punches are going by and then I land the other one and he drops and I'm just like okay it's time to to get on him and finish him here did you recognize her something's wrong with his jaw boom there it is no I and I watch the fight over in my coat and my corner told me that his jaw was broken I didn't even hear them boom that second right in I didn't even hear that were you surprised the way they stopped the fight no no but you know and I and this is this is what I'm saying is uh I gotta say I was a little surprised when I look at this yeah I mean you you think about it like that and it's like oh man he got up right right away you know like it was might have been an early stoppage but if you if you watched that last like that 30-second before that you see the shots that he was taking like I hit him with that right hand boom he stumbled back almost fell down then I was wondering if they knew that his jaw was broken I mean that's been referee you know I but I didn't but if you see him take shots like that you just got dropped twice right and now you're holding on to a leg and now this is just an ear muff you're trying to protect yourself and I'm having no sign of stopping mm-hmm you know that's the referees job to get in there and stop you you know and I know some guys like oh well they should have let him go to terrify that you should have let him get knocked out completely or this and that you know but it's a referees not doing his job and protecting you if that it's interesting that you said every fight takes a little bit out of you yes and that's I think that's important for people to hear because I you know we've all seen fighters and you know we go to boxing and perfect examples Meldrick Taylor when he fought Julio Cesar Chavez did you ever see that fight no tremendous fight Meldrick Taylor was winning the fight but Chavez just kept the pressure on him kept the pressure on was beating his body beating his body kept a pressure on him and then finally with like literally I think the fight was stopped with four seconds to go Wow yeah Richard Steele waved it off and Meldrick Taylor stood up and he talked to him but you could tell Master Taylor was out of it and they stopped the fight Meldrick Taylor was never the same again he was never the same again Terry Norris started him after that he started slurring his words it was real bad it was like that one fight took everything out of him yeah there's uh there's something people don't really see I mean everyone's attracted to violence everybody wants to see the violence they want to see you get hit I want to see you hit someone they want to see the blood you know but people don't see what this takes away from your spirit each fight win or lose it takes something from you like only myself and Kobe Covington are gonna know what that fight did to us now could I do it I can do it again next week I have no problem doing it yet but each and every fight takes something away from you but this is a one Allenstown more so for sure if you take a beating right but if is it balanced out by hard training and recuperation till you can maintain the exact same level or is every fight you're like slightly less good than you were before but you're so much better that you still have enough leeway that know that as far as the preparation and training all of that stuff yeah that account so yeah that takes it takes it away from you but I'm saying the act of actually fighting the fight from your spirit from your energy that takes away from you so you mean like your ability to get up for it yes your your ability to to fight another man your ability to that bravado to fight another person that that spirit that killer spirit it takes away from you where any and it can add to it it changed that spirit in some shape form of fashion it absolutely does it's there's this video a while back I forget the fighter he was a wrestler to turn fighter and he's like bleached blond hair I forget his name I think the video is called unfaded glory I think USA Wrestling made it put it together and it had all these wrestlers on it but um you know Brandon slay traveled along never with my teammate a lot of different you know was on that video and I watched that while I was training for the 2012 Olympics trying to make the team and that video stays with me changed my mentality or how to think because it really put things in perspective because you go out there and you battle this hard match and you lose to this guy like Joe I've won hundreds of wrestling matches I can't remember hardly any of them the ones that I've lost though I remember most of them why is that because each one took something away from my spirit somehow I remember the one they took something away from me like I can tell you really the fights I won in many fights I can really you know I don't really care that much about I win and I move on but the one that I lost oh yeah I know exactly why I knew what happened I knew I know what happened in that fight do you remember when you had that fight with Demian Maia and early in the fight Demian Maia is kind of standing and holding on your back yes and the referee separated yeah yeah were you like thank God that fucking referee no because I wasn't gonna give that look there's no way he was I was prepared to stand there the whole round like but didn't think that that was a weird way to separate you it was uh when he did eventually separated yeah the timing wasn't very good no because at some point we stood there we were there for like almost a minute but it's hard to get to that position on a car like it it's it's very I mean that Damian people don't realize how good like in been asked and found out the hard way yeah how good this guy is and yeah I could have taken him down whenever I on it and tried to play that game but that's it that's not a game you play right it's like trying to swim with sharks and and you're you're you're a little bitty shark yourself but you're trying to swim with these mammoth sharks yeah and it just doesn't you know Demian Maia is just that guy to where I'm like why even flirt with this right why so high level it's so high levels so tricky I mean he's just done it so much and so well to where he's just he's good in certain positions the way it's like I might you know what there's no point in even going there but I was prepared to die rather than let him take me down and go down here yeah you know even though we never know I might have been able to defend down there on the ground which I worked a lot on that my defense down there like my ground McDonnell did remember Roy yeah Rory MacDonald I would prefer fully prepared to do that you know but y mas would all did as well yeah he did a good job of you know not getting submitted yeah you know like but at the end of the day you know he still took it out on that I'm just saying I know you have to say that you are you like a you in conversation with the UFC about your next fight or do you just rest up heal up and then let them know hey I'm good to go no you know if they're like hey does this date work alright if it does it does if it doesn't it doesn't but I'm not I've worked to get to the point where now I don't have to call guys out I'm not trying to pick fights or not I want that fight I want that fight I'm right well this guy I've been begging for this guy to fight me know like the belt has to move like it has to move so when the UFC says okay here this is the next fight hey that's the next fight I've never turned down a fight so you haven't had any conversation with them at all what I said hey you know when do you think you'll be ready like have you had any these kind of conversations I mean Dana we've talked yeah you know my management we've we've talked about it and yeah I've told them when you know I'll be ready like I'll be ready give me a month you know let this thing you know he allow because I mean you can see I can make a fist now you know let this thing heal out and I'm cracking and what is the conversation that they have with you did they say hey we would like you to fight ex guy like I'm fishing here well yeah I mean put no they put out the guys and let's be you know not being a hater let's be honest I if you really look at the division I've kind of beaten almost everybody there in that top you know top ten you know it's a it's a matter of who everybody really wants who they think it's next and and Dana agree to anything said what's his name George George is the next guy and you know I have no problem with that I told Dana Dana I've never turn down a fight you say when and you say who and let's get that money will you try to make it for both belts you beat him of you throwing that thing in the closet you know what you know I absolutely will do that now tell me that would be think of this so I'm gonna tell Dana Dana I need that no you know what don't even make me anyone I want his yeah take that give it back to me I want that but that's always weirded me out that you don't get that person's belt you get a new belt oh my god you make yeah what about now it may it makes sense I guess because then someone's holding on to it yeah yeah it didn't it funk all over and shit yeah I don't want the same you know I don't know what they've done with that thing Tim Sylvia when he won the heavyweight title he used to wear his belt everywhere he would go to clubs in where his fucking UFC belt I said that I would do that I said that I would do that because I guys I hear a lot of guys like Mike Tyson said he wore his I was at the WBC in word for like a week straight shower me I think there's a picture of him in a shower with it and uh and I was like yeah I'm gonna do that when I get it but then I got it and I went home like there's no fucking way it does he got a crazy do plus you can fuck up the leather right yeah they just it's so so nice I my god and my daughter like had it for like a couple days like she just laid next to it she likes it looking at it I'm sure and she's like told her friends at school damn my daddy has a gold belt how crazy is that for her like my daddy's the champion of the world yeah but she doesn't really understand I mean she under she knows that that I'm the champion she sell told me all the time no it's the cute I'm so soft for her dude when you brought her into the Octagon when you beat Tyron and you're holding her I almost cried I every time I see that you know I always said I'm not gonna be that guy cuz you know parents I have thousands of pictures on their phones of their kids I'm never gonna be that guy I have literally I looked the other day I had 4500 pictures and I guarantee that maybe 4,000 of them of my daughter of course and then I you know and I was born I'm thinking I'm like man when she grows up which is why I some guys yeah you can switch out to be an entertainer but I can't switch up too much because at some point my daughter can grow up when dancing I was that guy why did you say that you said daddy and oh man and I look at it and I just wanted uh well you could see how happy you were how proud you were yeah her she was smiling man that's an intense moment that's such an intense moment when she grows up but you know I want her to be able to look at that do you have a picture of that are you holding her like well they gave you the belt they're making me one damn that's yeah they're make him of course I'm gonna framework and I have one too I have a picture of I have a picture of that and the one that gets me the most and I think he was shot by a photographer Eric Coleman is uh I was we were training on the track and he was before I fought no he's right after I fought the finale Ultimate Fighter and I just got into the UFC and she's in a in a stroller and we came right from is Saturday morning workout we had to go to FAU track and the team guys are running I couldn't really run so I'm hitting mitts with Henry and she's in the stroller I took her straight out of bed she's in the stroller sitting there watching me and I'm hitting mitts and it shot the shot and somehow got her in the back she's just in the stroller she's like maybe two years old if that and just watching me train and that that one is the one that when I look at I can't help I can't fight those emotions because that was and the worst thing was that was the camp where I was having the most issues to where I literally a couple of times I cried physically cried because I cannot like man my career's just starting and I can't even walk upstairs like my career's already done I tell people what you told me about not being able to walk on the concrete you to walk on the grass yeah walking what is it with that bad and I come down because I go down stairs backwards and everyone's kind of like why do you do that why do you do that you still do that yeah still do that really yeah it takes pressures off from what to take pressure off my knees and so I still do it the longest sigh now it's a mental thing the longer I can preserve my knees the better you know and that's the thing too is my manager makes fun of my go to Panama yeah but my minute my manager makes fun of me he's like oh man you're heard you walk like old man but didn't you cross into that Kaizen you find like and I'm like yeah because when I crossed that barrier in my mind I turn into the Nigerian nightmare I don't give a shit what happens I'm ready to die in here I don't care I'm gonna sacrifice my body completely in here to accomplish this goal do you worry about your knees not being able to hold up because obviously your mind is strong enough that you could fight even though you're in pain not being able no one fighting yes yes uh-huh not so much no no because I mean it'sit's I've been making this decision for a long time I remember the first knee surgery I had in college and I just might think my mind was I just can't wait to get back what gets me back the fastest oh your scope just take just all right snip it out whatever gets me back to fasten because I just can't wait to compete I think as long as I have this burning desire to compete I'm okay with sacrificing my body but once this desire starts to kind of dwindle down I'm okay well when you see a guy like Michael Bisping who's Michael's like 41 maybe how old is Michael I think he's in his 40s I think and he just had a knee replacement you know when you see that does that make you think like fuck is that gonna be me yeah I mean I'm already I'm okay with that I've managed really I've made friends with the fact that I'm gonna probably to have my knees is both replace cheese on my shoulders probably done your shoulders are fucked up too happy just from I'm a wrestler just Frierson over time like my back at some point I'm gonna have to get done I have Millie I've made friends with these you know with these like I'm gonna have to do these and you don't even mind that's interesting you don't mind talking about these injuries you don't mind talking about cuz you feel like it's still not gonna save them I don't give a shit yeah it's not gonna save you like guys all these knees are bad yeah my knees are real bad before Coby my knees were real bad before Damien my rears was real bad before tyrants or the other guy doesn't matter once I cross in and I get in when I'm locked into that cage you're trying to hurt me but I'm gonna hurt you worse and no these guys right now like everybody has their time Tyron had his time you know George had his time you know right now God is just saying this is my time and I'm gonna maximize it to my ability so I don't care I'm gonna give everything in there just cuz of my knees you can know it's my knees I people kick me all the time and Kolby kicked me a few times I don't give a shit starting to save you so I gotta save these guys and then and with Colby as well I mean he you know that fight was a lot more personal than a lot of people think you know obviously with you know the whole situation with my my dad and him saying whatever he said and and I know he like people say certain things and Connor's a master at this to try to get you off your game to try to make you to rattle you make you mad enough to where you come out you just crazy you know fighting them and to where you could be the best conditioned athlete you can get in there and get an adrenaline dump you look like you have been trained it day you know and I knew that's what they would like I'm not stupid I knew what that's what these guys are trying to do anyway especially him he was trying to do but I wasn't gonna play into that you had a very steady pace it was very interesting you could see that when you're fighting like right away in the first round first of all his pace is fucking crazy I mean that guy throws a lot of Alling but you you had you could tell that you were not gonna blow your water early now you were fighting very measured very disciplined and you were throwing a lot of front kicks to the body man that front kick to the body is nasty yeah I mean I you know just looking at his style stylistically yeah and matching them up with mine like I could have came in there we would could have wrestled yeah everyone thought they just gonna wrestle each other you know but did you think that was possible but he's gonna try to wrestle with you more mm-hm you know there was a possibility of him trying to wrestle but I knew that he was worried about my wrestling because everyone Tyron was a two-time all-american tired Tyron did better than him in Division one wrestling better accolades and we saw what happened with that fight so I knew he was worried about me wrestling me taking him down because if I take you down you're not getting up unless I let you up so I knew he was worried about that but then they came a moment in the fight to where we just you just looked at each other and it was just like no not today let's do it let's do it and and I was fully aware I was fully prepared to bang it out with him it was very surprising because it really did turn out to be basically a kickboxing fight yeah I mean that was yeah we just we just looked at each other and was just like alright let's just do it mano a mano let's go you know there's not gonna be wrestling tonight so let's do it man the kid the two you guys together depending on how the rest of the division stacks up because it's just such a fucking talented division there's so much talent in that division there's so many good fighters but depending on how everything plays out you guys could have two or three fights easily we'll see yeah I mean we'll see first of all I want to see how he bounces back from that because like I said there was a lot that went into that fight he said a lot he did a lot by getting all that weight on having all that weight on his shoulders saying all the things that you said ruffling all the feathers that you ruffled and then coming out and and he took a beating from the fans after that like the backlash that he took oh yeah it was was I don't know if you even saw some of the shit that was online like he took up humongous oh I'm sure and and rightfully saw I mean you gots the game yeah that's the game that's the game you want to talk crazy shit then they're gonna I mean that the reason why they're tuning into the fight so so many of them yeah is because of all the crazy shit you've talked yeah so naturally if he loses all the people that were rooting for you like yeah I knew it yeah so I want to see how he bounces back from all that because he's never had to do it before psychologically yeah yeah he's never had to do it before he's never had to talk all that shit then go in there and get your mouth shut literally and it's literally it's gonna be interesting to see like who they match him up with you know I mean who do they I mean he's got possibilities oh yeah if I mess with all yeah for sure you know you can fight Maspeth all it used to be boys right yeah they used to be boys you should be training partners and there's videos online of them I mean you see what he was doing it mess a lot early on you know like there's videos online with with with that of and then it's like he can fight tyron woodley like Tyron wins this fight like I think they both fight for the number one contender mmm you know so it's it is what it like the possibilities are endless for him because there's so many guys that want to kick his ass yeah so many guys in the division but I don't think so a lot of guys in the division can kick his ass right you know so it's he's got he's you know he's got possibilities he can he could fight guys and it's also possible that he can learn from that fight with you and come back a better fighter that is possible so we don't know how much it's gonna take out of him but it is possible that he could come from that me that was a funk and crazy fight and that was the first really crazy fight that he's experienced other than one submission loss that he had in the UFC where he had a he had an injured rib he had to take the fight was that Worley Alvis or they out of it yeah so when you when you see him next then we'll get a we'll get an understanding or yeah but the thing though is uh there's just certain guys you can't beat I don't know what it is or why it is but there's just certain guys that you cannot be and I think I'm that guy that he's just not gonna be I will not allow myself to lose to him do you think if you have two good hands so if your hand wasn't hurt it would've been a different fight you left it I heard him thing I heard him earlier but hats off to him he's a tough guy I don't take anything away from he fought a very good fight that had to be mine the most I've ever been hit ever yeah he was hitting me he was touching me and and he was I was never really hurt bad but they were stinging shots like they stung me a couple I'm like this mother touching me right touching me but at no point that I I was like I'm gonna come forward I'm gonna hurt him he's a fucking swinger man maybe he throws a lot of shots to his volume is incredible but that had to be the most satisfying to you it was when I when I got back to the hotel and I and I sat there and just I mean it was like and I just posted by myself because I like to decompress and I'm just like we got it done I mean all this shit that this guy said even my dad was you know like it's like I'll take care of business you know and to know that I went in there and I and I did take care of business it was extremely satisfying and I didn't hurt when I freaking I mean a surplus of like celebrities well that this guy you know you attach yourself the whole mag of thing and you know there's a lot of people it'll support you because of that yeah man there's so many like if you fall down there's so many they just can't wait to piss on you and kick you oh man yeah it's such a polarizing position that he took he did but uh you know I'm friends with the chump now you were saying that you were going to visit the White House and you tell me about the Blair do it yeah I'm gonna do it I'm gonna go to the White House but you also talked about it dollars so yeah I picked up the book and uh you know initially was like okay cuz this guy tried to troll me during our press conference he was trolling me like he sat there while I was talking he was reading the book and pretending like he was reading the book yeah and and and then I'm at the airport and like oh there's the book and I'm like fuck it I've got time today and I was rolling them and I died by the book I'm like screw it I'm gonna buy this book so I actually buy the book and and I take the screen shot and I and I posted it see the reaction for fans after that it was it was views ridiculous Donald Trump jr. reach out and actually yeah yeah I actually you know messages back but yeah that is fucking hilarious message and you know and I don't know the Trump's personally so I you know I can't go out there and like oh I'm bashing them just because this idiot was attaching himself to them you know so I look forward to meeting them and you know actually talking to listen that would be a great moment for you to bring that title to the White House despite of all the bullshit yeah and just let everybody know you rise yeah I mean I who would ever imagine that I you know coming from the village in Africa that I did you know and getting to this point and actually going in there to the White House well you know we had talked about your dad and your dad being in jail and of all people man Kim Kardashian has had well I think something like 28 people wrongly accused released from prison she's all about like prison justice reform and she makes these regular trips to the White House to talk to the president about prison reform and about getting people out of jail that that got bad deals yeah and I mean that's that's a worthy cause it's amazing cause I stopped making fun of her yes anymore she's a she's doing great things she's a good person you know and I mean like I don't know that family personally so you know I could have never really speak on them but for someone to come out and actually because there's so many people that are behind bars yes because of some stuff being wrongfully accused and the fact that she a celebrity like her of her stature is really shedding light on that and actually taking the steps to to go out and actually help some of these guys it's just amazing it's amazing and then speaking of my father like I said like this is no accident that we're here like like life is this is no accident Joe but like the last time I was here you know was the first time I ever talked about it and open up about it and this attorney great touch out of South Florida actually contact that means like hey you know I would love to take a look at the case and you know look at what's going on here and so you know he's kind of been like looking into it working on it and you know sending the letters I need to be sent and making the calls I need to be made and Joe the moment I just walked in here and I'm this is no lie I just showed you the text I just walked in here and I'm in the bathroom and I get the text that says he's gonna be released soon that's incredible and it's like that's incredible you should bring them with you to the White House I would definitely true I will definitely try you know wild that would be haha man and you know the big thing to me that would mean so much to me is that my dad front and center for my fight having my dad come into the cage and put that belt around me that that would be there's these moments in life that I call it like being floored and that's just when my your heart hits the floor and I think those moments arrived and and it which is what for me when you think about the pursuit of happiness these are the definitions of that is when you can you can make your parents heart hit the floor yeah by doing something like doing something to where you recognize so much to where they're recognized for the work that they did raising you the the good work that they did you know whether it's when in the you know uh Rhodes Scholar where this one in a Nobel Peace Prize I can you imagine as a parent watching your child accomplish something great like that feeling is the feeling that I longed for yeah I'm law I want I want to make my parents feel that as many times as possible before they're called home and they passed from this earth and and I'm sure my daughter at one point is gonna want to do that and you know I think when in that title and I would have loved to see my dad's face when I won that title and just and he's just look into him and see how he felt so I can't I can't wait for him to be at the next one I can't wait for him to actually feel that how long has it been locked up for I think since 2009 shit 11 years I think yeah and my dad did miss beat - thank you go seeing my dad's the same guy well is the same guy you would think this is something I would defeat somebody that would crush them and kill him and of course I'm not with him day in and day out but my dad's still the same guide to me and so uh man hey you know I'm not gonna cry but I can't I can't wait for him I can't wait for him to actually hold my dad again if you could choose who would you like to see him caged side when you fight who would you like to be fighting when he's there for the first time if I could choose if you could choose would it be red panda me Connor can get it too but you know at the same time it's it's his choice Connor is work to get to the point where if Connor decides I want to get my ass kicked by Huisman that's his choice you know he has the right to make that decision because he put himself in that position you know but it's not a fight that I'm gonna beg for that I really want but I think someone brought it after my last fight that I'm sitting at right under George's record from most consecutive wins in the world toy division and I think I'm like one behind and so I think imagine me breaking that record fighting the guy that has the record that that would be insane I think besides Connor that's the biggest fight to actually to the other the other biggest fight to make is could be if could be decided to go up to 170 yeah I would never fight could be really yeah that's that's my brother I you know it's just it's just like a mutual respect where I I don't see myself ever I don't see myself ever fighting khabib I don't see myself ever fighting Israel you know even though a lot of people kind of be hinting towards it they're like yeah you just need to fire you guys me if I don't see myself fighting them you know there's plenty of you having to yeah plenty of people having to belts in Nigeria's better than just having one guy holding two belts yeah are we saying yes and so yeah there's no there's no desire that I mean that's that's my guy I'm a giant fan of him Oh Mike everything about everything is Alerus personality he could be a huge huge stupor the superstar globally oh he will be I think he will be he really could he really could mean he's got everything first of all his striking is some of the most intricate complex and creative striking I've ever seen just flew angles of gluon yeah just wait switch stances and sets you up and these traps and yes and I'm and I'm a fan of I'm a fan of a lot of UFC fighters almost every you like a UFC fighters I'm a fan of especially now getting into the analyst work - mm-hmm like I get to actually have to watch some of these guys that are just making their debuts and things like that so I'm a fan of a lot of these guys not just the champions and you know Israel is he's special he's buddies and I get kind of envious I'm like damn I wish I could do that shit do this with my hands around the way he does it in the way he you know throws this little that little question mark cake and the I'm I'm a fan of these guys and Israel is one of those guys that's special and st. Francis I'm a fan of Francis I want to be able to swing at somebody even if the punch doesn't land they fall over I want to be able to have power like that Francis is power is preposterous it doesn't make sense it's preposterous yes it doesn't make you know what well he's his power kind of makes sense because he's so big and you see him hit hard you know who makes no sense Deontay Wilder yeah Deonte a wild it freaks me out man that's he four heads guys black and they just go back like like they just get shut off I don't think I've ever seen a heavyweight boxer punch like that guy because you know he throw that punch yeah the way that's straight right oh my god I don't think any people was ever tonic cuz straight right it's a PowerPoint but it's not it's not really considered the powerful punch that puts you out like a hook right or a deadly uppercut he hits you in the face like anywhere in the face you go unconscious it doesn't have to get your jaw it's when Luis Ortiz is on the ground going what in the fuck and you watch that fight again you watch the punch land at Lana's forehead yeah it's crazy hey the way he set him up too it's just like which which makes it very intriguing to see this Tyson Fury - oh my god so intriguing the way he set that punch up the guy's got 42 fights 40 knockouts one draw one decision what the fuck I mean who who the fuck has that that is crazy insane in the history the heavyweight boxing division there's never been a guy like that you know who starches everybody the only one he didn't starch was Tyson Fury and that other dudes ever needs to burn her and then he fucked him up in the rematch that was bad crazy match was crazy man I mean he basically just swung on him yeah it was like he threw boxing out the window once he had him hurt all that good fight you just tried it you're just trying to get him off get him out of it Deonte song LOL he is the way he lands that punch it's it's unreal but it's heisted fury man like and I wish I wasn't a fan of Tyson Fury I wasn't I was decide cuz I come from the era of watching guys like Mike Tyson who's just there to bang it out and box him but Tyson Fury the way that he boxes makes you miss slips and rolled punches and it was just like a frag I was six nine goofy look yes he's so great he acts goofy - he's got that goofy personality but to watch him box is beautiful it's beautiful it's it's amazing and just big respect to him and that's not off the deck the 12th round I was at home work oh shit he knocked him out and he drought-like Lazarus's s yeah just up and then good wobbly yeah he's like I'm good I'm good and arguably one the rest of that round yes yes stunned him done deal it was it was crazy it was crazy to me crazy to me I can't wait to see that second fuck oh that's gonna be interesting that heavyweight boxing division is fuckin very very interesting it is those top I want to say top five guys I was very sad for aunty Ruiz though I was like you know it's one thing if Joshua came back with a great game plan and beat him but it was also like andis preparation was so bad I wasn't sad for him I was disappointed in him yeah like that's a better way I was extremely extremely disappointed yeah it's like who in your corner who in your circle is that big of an idiot that can't make you take this seriously because the only way to guarantee that you get another big payday is to go out there and win that fight yeah because now you're still the champion like big paydays got to come right but now if we're just gonna avoid anyone cares yeah yeah no one cares now people might not even fight you again because you're tough fight and they get nothing out of beating you but it's also something about like Mexican boxing is so deeply rich with tradition and Mexican fighters are so proud like if you go back and think about all the great Mexican champions when a Mexican fighter falls short or they don't show heart like look at Julio Cesar Chavez's son Julio Cesar Chavez Jr bro they shit on that guy hard yeah but when he got in that last fight I think that come I feel like he's quit in the last couple of fights yeah but I think some people just can't handle the expectations I think but upon you there's that but I think with him him I mean he might be doing it for the wrong reason exactly it's almost like you shouldn't have even been in boxing the first place he grew up rich how do you mean your dad is one of the greatest boxers of all time he's a huge superstar and you're following in his footsteps I mean Julio Cesar Chavez is a fucking savage yeah I mean there that his dad was one of the all-time greats yes and too just to fall short with that guy as your dad I mean that has got to be so it's just got me so hard to follow his footsteps but that's the thing is and I think that's where dads could do a better job of making the kids being okay with not actually having to do what I did yeah you know you don't have to be a you know a boxer world champ a boxer and I know it's it's easier said than done because as men we want to want our kids we want we want that bond with our kids yeah you know we want to say see our kids do what we did and do it better and so we can be there seat there and be proud of them but you know he didn't necessarily have to box know and and you know the worst part of that whole situation is you chose to box you know you're not all the way in we missed weight too but yeah he's done that before he I think he missed wait for the Canelo fight yeah it's really crazy because he's a good fucking puncher he's a tough guy he's a big guy but for whatever reason you know it's have you ever thought about a boxing match like you see have you really I actually thought I was going to instead of MMA I actually wanted the box really yeah cuz I was living at the Olympic Training Center and and my girlfriend at the time was an Olympic boxer and oh yeah and so I was like man this wrestling thing is not really working out because I've been hurt a few times and it's hurting my motivation to want to be Olympic champion wrestler so I can tell my motivation was starting to die down and I'm like what else can I do like I'm but I still want to compete and of course you know dating a boxer and I mean just kind of watched him now you start to be engulfed in what they're doing in the preparation and I'm deeply enriched in it now to wear and I was already a boxing fan but now I might she's starting to learn what's going on and I'm like maybe I should just come back and box for the next four years and try to make the Olympic team and go win the Olympics but then I might wait so I'm gonna throw away this skill that I just were spent 10 almost 10 years perfecting and learning just throw that away and then just start a new sport off the rip you're an idiot how old were you at the time I'm 20 23 24 so now you've been striking for many many years now yeah and so when you see something happen like with Connor and Floyd Mayweather yeah if something like that comes your way would I take it regularly absolutely know that the issue that the thing with that is a lot of people are going to say no you can't box I you can't box like these guys know this at the end of the day no I'm not conditioned to being able to box like them to be able to go 12 three-minute rounds even though yes MMA rounds of five-minute rounds might be more intense in those three-minute rounds but it's different conditioning yeah to be able to slip punches move and then throw punches and block punches be efficient efficient comfortable it's it's a it's man it's hard work to where we go MMA fight we go into boxing you do fall around you feel like you want to die hmm there were a boxer can come into you know MMA and might not even be able to get through around right you know it's just different mechanics you know just being able to work the mind and relax the mind to get the work done it's different yes I got unity I would definitely give it a I would definitely give it a try because I mean that's that's part of being a champion is taking on new challenges and going out there and giving it your best shot well a fight like that would be Canelo right because Canelo just one 175-pound tiger you should throw me to the wolves I mean that would be the big fight I mean I'm not trying to throw you to the game with you the pig that big Floyd Mayweather money to fight Canelo look if they started doing shit like that I would give it I would give it my all I I think I would take that absolutely would you really yeah I think I would take would you like one fight first though would you like a boxing match first before you cuz I think like Conor wouldn't a hunter fought Floyd Floyd I would yeah but I would of course I would spar with I get some some big-time boxes in there to spar with me and it really helped me prepare how much time would you need because what I'm saying is like Floyd was a janello he gave he gave Conor a very short window time to get ready yeah Floyd was like yeah I'll give you like 600 semester but but Floyd to master he's a mastermind yeah that's his game that's his world he knows what he's doing if you were gonna fight a real like legit boxer Canelo Jacobs someone like that Jakub six months six months yeah six months six months to be confident in my preparation to just go out there and do it I mean yeah of course I could do it in less time but but six months for me to do it right to feel confident going in there to box a boxer not and not saying that I would definitely win you know it's me I'm gonna give it my all like I'm gonna come you're not gonna just walk over me you're gonna fill me here now I'm not trying to set you up with a big fight but what I'm saying is what with Zuffa boxing right now because the UFC is getting involved in box absolutely and they do have some plans on promoting some big boxing matches and perhaps having some crossover fights like Crawford is talking about fighting he's like I'll fight you one boxing match with Conor he's like I'll fight you one boxing match and we'll fight you one MMA match I think he can do it I think Terrance could do anything I mean you see his kid his kids arrest yes yes yeah I can rest you know from Omaha you you from you know that Midwest you touch the mat a couple times you've wrestled a bit and his hands dude that guy and that guy switches up as good as anybody on the planet that's the thing I was gonna say is and you know that's a guy that I like to watch a lot to boxing even harder learn some you know there's some things from him yeah he's the way he's very good he's an orthodox fighter when he switches southpaw he's deadly he's just as good Jamie not bad yeah he can do anything and he's like a computer he's yes starts seeing where those openings find your weaknesses and then starts putting it on you and putting it on you yeah Terrence is special he's got a dog in him too yes oh yeah she loves he loves it that's something that a lot of people might not take away but when he turns on that dog you're in trouble yeah no he's special I could do it I think he could too I just don't know if he's famous enough to entice you know like not me I'm not making Floyd encounter right right I mean who knows I mean maybe Connor wants to have a bunch of it made me look Connors got probably 100 million dollars in the bank right he probably he's doing if he's doing it right now he's barely doing it for the money anyway he's doing it for the challenge and for the rise yeah it might be something that he would be interested in but he just said he wants it Billy he might get there yeah I think he did well enough could get there I mean they they posted his earnings the other day on one of the paper views that we just did and they were saying he's already made more than two hundred million dollars in his career yeah well that's that's a fifth of the way yeah yeah no I I think I definitely think he can do it up bill bill I mean I'm shooting for to 250 250 million yes too many feel like I think to fit not retire I'm do other jobs as well but 250 million I think because at that point it's generational wealth oh yeah it's something that you know my kids kids and my family is going to be able to live off of that's dynasty money yeah that's that's that's all I care about when you say you do other things like what do you think you'll do when you stop fighting I'm still passionate about I want to be a marriage counselor a marriage counselor that wasn't if I wasn't fighting that was what I'd be that is hilarious me and my wife what's your marriage can see yeah oh come on yeah he's sideline he's got a side gig he's a marriage counselor yeah I want to be a magickal why it's just something about it I'm I was always I think personally I was always very good at being able to step back from situations and what's going on keep a level head and being able to dissect what's going on and give it aside and give advice and and and I do this with my friends where my friends tell you like think of you boy tell you a story like ma'am I this happened when my daughter's mom my my mom my wife or this and that you know she she came home and she said this and that and all this in and then she take me on the house man she's wrong for this but when they're telling the story they my I don't know why but in my head how I'm taking the Denny's he's saying all she called me a bitch but what did you say before that that's that so that's I naturally that goes into my head what did you say before that and then she threw this at me why did she throw that what did you do what did you say you know so when everyone tells you a story when they say there's three sides to every story is yours hers and I literally lit like in my mind that's what goes on when someone's telling me a story but do you know how funny it is that you want to be a marriage counselor do you understand how crazy that sounds yeah it does sound weird but the UFC welterweight champ in the world you got smash people and you like cannot be a marriage counselor okay what do you think tomorrow you won't want to be a longshoreman just want to be a brain surgeon it's gonna be a fighter pilot marriage counselors obviously number 100 I'm like that's definitely not real you definitely don't wanna be a marriage counselor that's not real yeah that that marriage counselor would be there or just some counsel of some sort a counselor yeah you're helping helping shape and mold well I want to leave this when I leave this world I want to leave it better than that when I came in or when I lived through it I want to leave it it's better situation but one thing you can do you have you could have a tremendous impact on young people because of what you've accomplished where you've come from how inspirational you are and then just the physical difficulties you're dealing with while you're doing that with your injuries and all the the preparation that you have to do to fight for the title and your honesty about it when people or a young person hears your story like that it'll make them think like with hard work but anything is possible with the right mindset and the right discipline almost anything is possible yes absolutely anything is possible because um you know where everybody thinks down days all I'm limited I can't do that because it is I can't do it because and it's funny because my daughter sometimes you know will be she's when were work time her you know her she's when were there was a certain problem I'm teaching her entire shoes and she gets to a point where she can do it she's doing it she didn't doing it and this show just decide one day that she doesn't want to do it so she'll play this game like I can't daddy I can't do it I'm like why why can't you do it she's like because I'm four I can't do it because I'm only four so I don't how to do it like well you did it yesterday right you can do it no I can't do it I don't know how to do it and like she mentally she just wants to feel that she can't do it because everyone's like oh you're four years old she knows she's four years old so she wants to just I'm four so I shouldn't be able to do it I don't want to do it and I'm like no you can do anything that you want to do or she'll be outside playing soccer so I got her into soccer and she's like no I can't I'm not good I can't play I can I don't know how to do it like yeah you can do it no but I know I didn't get the ball today I don't know how to play online you can do anything you want to do if you put your mind to it baby you can do anything and it's it sounds and when I even when I say that to her I'm like she's only five but if I say it enough by the time she's ten it's gonna stick in her mind it's there and so the the fact that people let go through life like that now all I can't do it because I'm not I can't do it I'm not supposed to do it mine do people just feel like no I shouldn't be able to do it but it's the matter of putting the work in like you can't tell somebody like if they do something well enough over and over and over and over and over and over they're not gonna improve mmm even though you suck you're gonna get good at sucking at some point like you're gonna improve and so people just don't want to try something because they just like I can't do it I can't be good enough at that so I won't do it and I and I learned that lesson the hard way because when I started wrestling I used to see there was this there's just poster that uh asic put out USA wrestle and they put out this poster of the best wrestlers in the country in high school and I remember the first time I went too far I was looking at the poster and he's nerdy looking kids I mean this one there's just one kid super nerdy yeah glasses like just like I'm like you know the kind of kid that you would like I know kids picked on in my school and then I I I hear the name I see the name I read the name and I hear like oh okay I don't know that is because he's from some other state maybe like Pennsylvania or something and um and then I could hear through the loudspeaker they called it like all this kids wrestling on mat one so then I look him at one and yeah he looks goofy goofy-looking kid she walk up to the mat takes his glasses off puts him down goes out there and just whip stir shit out of these other kids like I mean he was rolling kids up I'm like what what just happened the rolling kids up and I think if he can do it and and you know that's the kind of kid that you would look at and judge my oh man I could bully this kid I'd be a bad day for a bully well how about J's you know chase move for the twenty year old kids fight in the UFC oh yeah yeah the one that dad with the curly yeah he says I'm gonna go get M&Ms afterwards didn't he who'd he call he went up to MOSFET all and said you beat up my dad he's hilarious kid funny my wife saw him she goes he looks like you at Calabasas high yeah like a kid with a backpack how's everybody doing video games it will fuck you up he's a nasty grappler - yeah it was very legit yeah and he can take it - man like he got cracked in that fight in these rolls with shit and just he's all jujitsu like his most attuned ground-and-pound yeah hey fucking twenty years old and he's so cute he's cute say it like pull up a video change cute oh my god got that teenaged chess - you know muscles aren't really good yeah I remember having that chess - Robbie in the mirror like trying to make my boobs move I like I like his approach he says good fight or two men he's a really good fighter I mean guys like these are the future of the sport and afterwards just like talking about oh I'm gonna go get some candy I think that's all clean away nobody's gonna go get candy a good fight okay gonna get mmm my daughter just told me the other day psyche daddy do you know that's the M&M store in New York New York but I guess there's like these stores these like the M&M store like they actually have a store store where they like sell all the products M&M products whether it's flasks is its clothes it's stuff like is that necessary it's like a diet coke store do we just need wanna be a coke store isn't there there's gotta be a coke store but M&M store that's also crazy yeah it's a big date night I think big okay I mean I'm a fan of eminent I like the peanut ones I used to like him it ain't not once of the shit if I'm in a hotel and they got a snack bar as peanut M&M you know what I had a little thing with those in college yes where's my baby I love peanut M&Ms yeah I used to there was a they had a little fun sighs one day be in the little vending machine yeah when I was in college I I did the I was the the laundry guy for the athletic the sports athletic team so that was my work I had a work-study job and so yes I all-american wrestler but then you know I did the laundry for all the athletes a lot of them didn't know but I would you know do you know go practice go to school whatnot and then go home and then after all the sports were done at night I would come back into the school to go do all the athletes laundry and hang them up for them to have tomorrow before they all go to practice football basketball you know soccer all the sports and so they were these eminem things that was like my treat that was like my little eye like a lose like a little snack thing that i would have even when I was cutting weight that was my little genius it had like maybe six little peanut M&Ms in there but then I got a little addicted to this I like them because they could pretend you're eating some good because there's protein in them it's the only candy that you can have that actually gives you protein makes yourself feel good are you this protein in here it's it's healthy but it is like how much protein you think is in a bag of peanut M&Ms gotta be a few grams a bag like a good sign one of the nice bags the the big bag good bag cuz I'll you know I'll fuck up a big bag of peanut M&Ms how much it has gotta be lets say a large bag 93 grams it might be more really oh no like no because that the whole bag is a serving size if it says one package contains two grams of dietary fiber five grams of protein oh whoa peanut M&Ms cuz they're rich in protein and fiber can actually help you stave off hunger cravings by leaving you feeling fuller longer did you know that sounds like an ad yeah superior nut store calm that sounds like the wrong name for something clams here yo RZA is a vegan and I had this f-bomb this is nut butter yeah and it was there and he's like nut butter it's like they need a better fucking name there's so there's a lot of products out there now that are just like putting it out there ya know what is it um mmm is it manscape or something like that yeah and they they make something they make a call ball wash wash wash your ball wash yeah we don't need to beat around the bush here literally yeah so they jeez I mean they just put it out there yeah superior nut store in the house but five grams a protein is legitimately and either by yourself that's that's like an actual amount of protein and chocolate chocolate supposed to be if it was dark chocolate so someone needs to make like a real good chocolate one like we did a good solid dark chocolate like a cow yeah you know so you actually get the antioxidants from the dark chocolate so this the regular the chocolate that's been sold the store that's not the good chocolate oh sorry it's not the worst thing for yeah like try of all the candy I bet chocolate is I mean if it really just cha just chocolate always have cacao in it I don't know does it do you know likely to people like gonna feel like that's the definition of it but yeah but like that really don't my favorite my favorite cheat dessert is dark chocolate and peanut butter just just you know cuz I remember I like Reese's peanut butter cups but I remember like you got your peanut in my chocolate you got your chocolate in my peanut butter it's delicious remember that yeah and I was like well why why fuck around why not just get a bowl of fucking peanut butter and an actual good chocolate bar and mix those two up together it's fuckin way better than a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup really oh man yeah like good like a good organic peanut butter and like a real good dark chocolate it's fucking delicious and you don't feel that guilty yes you're getting like real peanut butter and like real good dark chocolate it's kind of good for you well I mean you could kind of be at you know the testament of that because you're like weirdly like in shape like no one really says like people talk about it like people make up these fantasy matches Joe Rogan versus Cisco Road you - I'm not fighting but the thing is you don't look 50 - you're like one of those weirdly organic like in shape guy looks like I'm scared to kick someone's ass I just keep it keep it going because one day the wheels are gonna fall off like right now I could do pretty much everything yeah but I mean of one day like sometimes I work out I'll hit the bag and I'm like this is amazing I can still do this yeah cuz one day you know I'm gonna be throwing a kick I'm gonna be like ah it's just a matter of time like my back is just definitely it's a lot there's a lot fucked up in there there's a lot of disks or shrinking my disks are getting compressed and you know I do all these these stretches on these different like there's a reverse hyper machine decompresses your discs but that's the one thing as you get older particularly you've done wrestling or jujitsu your your disks get squished and so many guys have to get their disks fused yeah deceit remember DC threw out his back yeah for he threw out the day of the fight I think when he fought Derrick Lewis really I think he I remember the day of that fight in the morning it was like a Saturday morning I'm getting ready to head out and go to practice and I got a call it's from DC I'm like what is the champ gotta fight he called me for so I appeared before my yo what's up champ and he's like yo you gotta have this number I was like what Heather's the the physical therapist for the UFC they had physical therapist and I'm like yeah I got her number uh well you good he's like I just woke up I sneeze and I threw out my back world I see Mises and threw out his back and I remember laughing at him I'm like yeah cuz I thought he was joking but he's like yeah man I don't think I'm gonna I gotta fight this fighter I'm like whoa he's serious and so you know Heather works on him and he got of course he goes out there and puts on like amazing performance and went in that fight but before this last fight I woke up I've got my bags and stuff and in the morning I'm getting ready get in the car and I sneeze and I hear a little pop in my back no my back is out I'm like no I'm barely turned I'm like what just I'm like almost crying and the first thing I go to him I I'm 32 what is going on 32 I just sneeze and my back is out and I call my strength and conditioning coach I'm like yo Corey I don't know if I'll behave I'll broad you sneeze and I threw out my back bro and he's like what I was like yeah just sneeze it I threw out my back man higher because you at that point is like one thing after the other and this my hand was hurt you know not too long before that and he's just like come in you know we'll do some stretches and you know I'll stretch you and you do some certain things and then we'll try to loosen it up and it was bad for like three or four days like really bad Jesus Christ really bad to where I'm just like what is happening with the body like so what do you do when that happened you I sit you know cuz I got a train that's the thing was like I have to train right and so put heat on it because he loses everything up so you can go out and actually somewhat move it around and train so I I just I tried to stretch try to kind of you know do certain that I could do cuz I could barely get in the car at this point it's so crazy that sometimes things like that will happen like one of the worst times I ever hurt my neck was in the shower just turned to grab something like shampoo back on I had hair I turn turn for shampoo and something went pop I'm like ah didn't make any sense man and I had a drive to Vegas me and my friends went to see some kickboxing event in Vegas and I'm driving I literally couldn't do this to park yeah if I was gonna turn around I had to turn around like my whole body how to turn around like my neck was not moving yeah from just turning just turning crazy how just like just like that pop for no reason and now I see a car because I got some you know who is it that arrow Spence you know the boxer oh yeah so when I was uh I was training it there a gym when I was in town cuz I work with his coach sometimes and and I'm like um I forgot what they were saying he was like back was tight one day or something like that was like you got a good chiropractor I hear that you see you know he's like no I don't do that stuff I'll say what you mean he's like yeah my my I don't know whether is his dad has said something to him early honoree he's just uh it's I can't believe in that I think they they make you worse off therefore you went in and and I just been seeing chiropractors before that I'm like damn busy right do you know how chiropractors were invented know you ready for this chiropractors were invented in the 1800s by a magnetic healer during a séance he apparently came up with this idea that you could fix all the ailments of the body by manipulating the spine he was murdered by his son his son ran him over with a car his son was a con man and his son took over the business and his son started promoting that chiropractic healing could fix all these problem literally the whole art of chiropractic manipulation and and I'm not denying that some people do get pain relief from chiropractors and most chiropractors today really act as more as physical therapists they do a lot of deep tissue work a lot of other things but the origin of chiropractic medicine came from a fucking bullshit artist a straight-up bullshit but it happened in the 1800s so it just got grandfathered in where people took it seriously but there's a crazy article by a woman who was a guest on my podcast in the past how do you say her name you vet chiropractors are bullshit how do you say her her last name is a complicated last name but I didn't know I had no idea because I had gone to a chiropractor once I had a a bulging disc in my neck in jujitsu and I was like this just is not getting any better and he's like oh you got a muscle Pole like I'm just gonna manipulate you everything would be fine I went to him for a year and it never got any better and then finally what to a real doctor is like hey a fucking bulging disc man this is my hands were going numb I was like why is my hands going numb and he's like yeah your disc is pushing out it's pressing and then I did Regina keen and it fixed it how do you say her name you vet D untrim aunt she's very cool she was on the podcast she was she's pretty hilarious but this the article is actually prettier larious but it's basically about like how chiropractic medicine got started out yeah and they call themselves right yeah they don't go to school they're not well they have the MD don't they no no no well I know right you're like wait a minute what are you talking about no they get a doctor in chiropractic doctor like I'm a hottie I'm a doctor no stop pH no so pH no no no no no they got a chiropractor school yeah do you know what percentage of people get accepted to chiropractic school tell you yes ten percent a hundred yeah you know I will attest to that I work with some some some good ones some good guys oh yes they they didn't help me they get me right yeah you know like um I work with this doctor mangey and also dr. Davidson and they they do a good job at really Conor because I'll go on a mine retighten it pop pop up here in there and like I should just feel a little bit of relief I feel a little bit a little bit of psychological to a thing but you know yes I think - yeah the massage but I said think for me - is like I'm very aware of the whole placebo effect of certain things like because I'm I was a skeptic I'm a skeptic sometimes and so going in and actually feeling relief there's a doctor minge uh that he works with a lot a lot of football players as well and he's like you said them you know those guys yeah here just you and gets you right but he does a lot of physical yeah if you work as well that's what more they are now yeah and he really kind of helps you know some of those ailments that I have and he's helped me for a few campus as well as dr. Davidson these guys have helped me a lot in my fight so you know that's what I mean that's the thing - it's like when arrows like now I'm gonna see I don't see them you know he's kind of right yeah I know but I'm speaking off of my experiences cuz these guys not just crack crack and pop me back they're actually you know physically helped work some things out to where I'm good to go so I just I'm dodge they were doctors I did - I thought you had to go to medical school to be called the doctor you don't speaking of Eros Spence huh fuck did that guy get out of that car crash without scratch anybody chip a tooth man that is the crazy you watch that video you like he's dead one of the best boxers in the world is dead and then nothing and if he was wearing a seat belt they said he would have died yeah I think he would have died I think you uh you know and I don't know maybe he was asleep when he was thrown out of the car because you know you don't really feel much mean you're asleep you know especially yeah a few furiously your body just is there you're relaxed and but you know the conscious guy got him somebody's watching over him because that's how it's time to go I mean there was a video of him getting interviewed a couple months after after the car accident he's out of fight and they're interviewing him and there's all these wrongs like I said he was like a bruise or scratch somewhere scratches and bruises like watch play that video can you find that video the video is fucking crazy I watched about ten times every was a and it's not at 480 Ale a Ferrari so he must have been cooking I mean that is a crazy fast car those fools already can't have that car and go to speak and especially with the convertible man you know some you know gods really was someone's watch someone's somebody's watching over yeah I want to see this because you find it no yeah I heard it's like that damn boom and he goes he went flying out of it right there that is crazy how the fuck is he okay I mean if she was in that car strapped in he would probably be fucked up paralyzed or dead or brain damaged meanwhile he just sat about how many boxers have gone through his similar situation you know how many box like what uh what's his name I said Paul Paul Williams yes motors a motorcycle crash yeah things like that letter sight and who was it my buddy a Daniel Straus mm-hmm you know Daniels back - bass fuck yeah since then you know but imagine like something like that and cuz I watched Daniel kind of slowly because I would try to check up on him you know because I like that guy really liked him he was training with us at the time watching him slowly work back because he didn't have any feeling here yeah at one point and then slowly have to build it back up to the you know I don't know I think it's gonna fight ladies night and then fight and win yeah he came in here with Joe Schilling it's like while he was on his way up when it was way back rather how about indent member Diego Corrales David Corrales died from a motorcycle accident as well there's been a lot of fatalities like that like can you imagine how sad this story would have been I mean I mean Errol Spence oh my god that's the guy that's love and that man loved and I just in Dallas but all over the world well after he beat Mike Garcia everybody's like holy shit is this guy for real I mean I knew he's for real way but really for real Mikey Garcia is a very good fighter he I am down yes and he couldn't do anything to him he's he's one of those special guys yes specified her special boxer you got to get him up here I would love to I love to well Terrence could be a big fight in the future and they were thinking about him and Terence Crawford before the accident yeah you know I would love to have him in he's an interesting dude he's sponsored by on it too really yeah yeah that's right Austin Austin yeah yeah no he's there's there's a great group of like super talented boxers now like this is an amazing time yeah and the thing about him too that I like is that he's just he's been the same guy now that he that he was when he was an amateur as I met him while he was an amateur oh really I was living at the Olympic Training Center and I was dating a boxer at the time and you know all the boxers when they have national team practices they would come through before that Olympic cycle and they would all come through and do two three once all maybe a month training camp all up there at the training center so I got to kind of meet these boxers and and you know talk to and you get you know acquainted with some of them like was it Marcus brown who was a world champion raashi Warren Jamil here and I got to kind of see these guys and that's when I finally I first recognized him and then watching them all make the switch to the pros and get to where they're right now arrow Spence has been that same guy the whole time which is one thing that I love because you know I I feel like that's kind of how I am in my sport I don't have to you know turn on this charm just because it worked it works for Conor it works for this guy for him them to be just brash and out there that's gonna work that's Connors person that's him yeah that's Connor it works for him that's him like Tyson became a superstar and he had none of that in them you know he was he had a totally different way of talking very soft-spoken in a lot of ways you know yeah but Tyson's like the fighter the result and the Tyson that the just the Tyson in general is is well I would say Mike and I would say Tyson are two different people yeah and then knowing him now man it's like that guy was that guy mm-hmm it's I mean amazing man now I've been pretty jazzed up talking a lot of people on the podcast but I've never felt weirder than talking to him you're always gonna feel that way I'm sure I still feel that way I still feel it's like there's a lion sitting next to me the whole time like we just spent new years ago in New York and um and I'm he's it's me it's him and it's Henry it's a hoot oh and we're talking just and we're just getting knowledge from him the whole time there's a life you can't shake that feeling I can't shake it you can't you just you never will it's just what makes a guy like that special you know it's like if Muhammad Ali was in a room which you know I never got to ever experience with see but if Muhammad Ali was no I'm sure guys it just didn't matter and Dana said this at one point it you could have Michael Jordan the best you know or the best baseball player and you have the best football player and you have the best musicians in the world all these guys in the room but when Mike Tyson walks in the room everybody knows Mike Tyson is in a room yeah it's just something different about a fighter like that yeah they walk in a room everyone is on alert oh shit there's a lion in the room it's the pinnacle of sports is the elite fighter yeah it's the pinnacle sports and especially the elite heavyweight champion and especially a guy like Tyson who you know in his prime was just he changed everything he Chi like I said the the the vision was so lackluster before he rose to prominence and when when he did I mean I remember when he was on the cover Sports Illustrated magazine he was 19 years old and the other cover it said kid dynamite and it was him and he looks so young and that's how I found out about him I remember I saw maybe I'd seen some clips or something like that of him sending some guy flying with the left hook but then watching you know seeing the the cover of that magazine I was like this guy's 19 years old like that is crazy they're talking about being the next heavyweight champion yeah I mean and you know even now like knowing all of that and seeing all of that because I you know you kind of try to bring it on my man and talk to him now it's like he's just like huh that was such a long I loved his beard too it makes him look scholarly he's a wise old man yeah and it kind of gives him a it gives him a little uh it's kind of like a little cover you think it's that he hides him a little bit yeah a we are we had lunch in the New York and then we walk out this little like place in New York and we come out we're on the street and somehow a bus full of like tourists I kind of know if where they were they were Asian tourists like a bus somewhere somewhere from Asia like there just pulls up right in front of us we're like right there and they all get out and initially cuz he's wearing a beanie and he's wearing a big jacket it were kind of standing outside and you're doing some recreational stuff and so and so we're just kind of standing there initially and uh you know one guy walks up one got like while he's walking by and kind of just looks back and you can see it cuz you know that look you you know right like you know like when you're somewhere and people are trying to figure out if it's you right you see him kind of do the double take and they're thinking in their mind in their sad who I think it is and then he gets like halfway down the street uh-huh and at this point I people I'm seeing him and he turns around and he walks back like Mike Mike is that you and like is is freaking he's I please please get me can I get a picture please please and and then of course Mike is I is such a nice guys like yeah he's a sweetheart and might takes a picture one then one of the tourist season now it's a swarm it's a war thankfully his wife was just pulling up in the car and Mike hops in but I'm like Mike hasn't fought in how long I his last fight was what 22 15 years ago and that's how the reception he still liked people still freaked out that it's Mike Tyson it was incredible for me to see that it's like at some point that's what we we want to get to that's that's the level of respect in the level that as a fighter that you all that you want to get it's so interesting that now he's in the weed business yeah I mean and he smokes weed all day long he's one of them he's like it makes me nicer it's like it calms me down keeps me sane yeah I mean it works you know certain guys you know it depends on some guys so guys abuse it but certain guys use it as medicine but it's also like who doesn't want to get high with Mike Tyson Podcast I'm like Henry you want to pass me what else oh yeah yeah yeah so you don't get high at all no no never I have yeah yeah I am for my my 26th birthday was the first time I tried it what happened nothing nothing nothing I mean I guess I didn't know how to do I didn't know how to inhale it I didn't know how to smoke it and you know this does nothing I hit it like maybe two three times like does nothing didn't feel a thing and then that same year I had to I think it was 26 yeah I was thinking the last year I was at the training center the Olympic Training Center and I had to do I did the Ultimate Fighter season 14 I was a wrestling coach for team mayhem Miller and and me and mayhem would say oh we were in the same house and we'd would sit on the balcony at night after filming all day won't come and he would smoke and we just relaxed and he decompressed and that was a crazy thing about me I'm too smart guy I mean yeah he had a crazy path but it smart guy he just come back and sit there and relax and just think and he would say certain things and then he was like yellow you should try this you should try this I'm like no that doesn't do nothing for me man I already tried it he does nothing for his I you doing it wrong like now it doesn't do anything for me man and then he's like try this edible and it's inedible as a peanut brittle well Jesus looks like just like a fat piece on my privilege don't we doesn't do it doesn't affect me bro and this Indian for me and uh I had to add about a big piece to I'm eatin because it was like it was good was chocolate was can I'm just eating them even my ass is nothing and uh maybe like six seven minutes later I'm like I need to go get water so I opened drawn like let me go get some water inside and you walk in the balcony the sliding door you walk inside my room is our rooms are this way down the hall his room is further my rooms just to the right and the kitchens right in front so I walk in I'm like okay get some water I'm like three steps before I get to the counter but I'm just like there what's going on I never touched the water I eventually just somehow turn up to my right just stumble into my room I fell on my bed like this I woke up ten hours later like that didn't move best Rest I ever got Wow I was like no did you have crazy dreams no I just went out but it was it was a fun yeah it was a fun time it was because I was like the first time I experienced Vegas so we were shooting the show in Vegas and so that's my first time being in Vegas and uh but it was fun time and I was just like wow okay but then after that I smoked again with my friends down in Florida like years ago maybe four years ago and that was when I actually got high from smoking you know I hit it hard at first I'm like cuz I'm the same I'm like this doesn't affect me guys you know cuz I was like the reason I hit me cuz it was edible I'm never doing edibles I can never again so I already wrote that out my weed doesn't affect me guys so I hit it hard then I hold it you got hold it in I'm holding that I start coughing I call for like maybe six minutes Oh hard and coughing almost so I'm like bro this is nothing I hit it again like right away pass me that he didn't get heart coughing this is not gonna do nothing for it I hit it again hard coffee hahaha brah I told you guys this does nothing for me man and we're sitting on the couch and huh my little brother calls me and he was I think this was when he was making the transition he's leaving football he calls me he's talking to me on the fall and we're talking I'm like man everything's good man you'll be fine we'll do something else and boom I forget everything I was just talking about I was a I'll call you back so I hang up and I immediately I'm one of those guys if I don't have control and I feel like I don't have control of my body my thoughts was going on I kind of got anxiety so I kind of started going to the panic mode and so I'm sitting there on the couch and these guys they look at me and I look left in these guys I'm like guys something says something's wrong something's wrong something is wrong something's wrong I don't know what's going on I was just trying to talk to my brother and I forgot everything I was I was talking about something's wrong and they're laughing hysterically they're laughing at me bad and I'm and then now I'm like okay no I gotta be cool I gotta try to be cool out of control this be cool be cool but the biggest thing is I couldn't control what was going on the fact that I was feeling what I was feeling I couldn't shut it off that was it for me I was like yeah I can't uh-huh that's too much though like that's not what you supposed to do that happens when you cough like I don't know it gets it deeper yeah ugh I don't know if there's science behind that is there any science behind that is that real like coughing gets you more high because it is for me when I went if I'm smoking pot like off I go Oh No yeah up the door it's inside they say they say it well from what I've heard they say it makes it worse when you're coughin it gets deeper into your life I've heard that a bunch of times I've got a bunch times I don't know if it's I don't know if that's real though I may be just really high and that's why you're coughing ah you know I'm not sure maybe it's just smoke cuz I'm not used to having smoke in my lungs yeah cuz even now if I walk through casinos I'm I'm sick for a while with pot you just wanna if you're not if you're a rookie if you not a veteran you don't do it a lot you want this light ready that's it stop stop right there wait give yourself some time which reminds me um I smoked again after that oh I think a couple years ago but I it was like almost like peer pressure he didn't pressure me but it was like he was your freshman Rashad he did the pressure me but it was like I'm with Rashad as my brother if he's doing it huh I gotta try it you know so he's like he knows how to do it like for him inside medicinal night now it's like no heat so I we were at a cooler going to a comedy show the country Wayne is the comedic comedian and we're going to see him and uh funny guy so we go country when she Wayne yeah he's big following now and on the south and I don't he does his whole show I don't think he curses at all really that funny guy if you look him up very funny guy and uh so we're at the show and before the show starts and he's like let's take a walk so we're walking and no Rashad it's like me and him like the wisdom that he passes on to me it's crazy I love being around him I love spending time with her and so we're walking and then you know and then he whips it out and he's smoking I'm not sure I've always heard like you keep people things get funnier when you smoke weed like oh man it's gonna be the best comedy show ever cuz this guy's already funny I think it's funny and this is gonna make it funnier oh my gosh a good idea so I take it on but I'm like I learned from last time I'm not gonna hit it like that just like hit mm-hmm you know once maybe twice but that's it so I hit it like off a little bit but not as bad you know coffee's a little bit and I'm okay and so we're still walking and then I hate it again light you know this time I didn't call my god that should be good I should be perfect this shows gonna be phenomenal so we get in now we're sitting in we're sitting in because you know those improv comedy clubs are very very tight you know especially the big nice ones but the VIP tickets you're right there on the floor next to them so we're like maybe three seats away from the stage so we're there and it's a packed house it's everything sold out and we're watching them or watch them or watching them and I remember like now I start feeling something I'm getting I'm like paranoid so I'm I'm talking to Rashad well in my head I think I'm talking to him so I'm thinking I'm trying to whisper because I don't want to interrupt the show cuz I want the comedian because I've heard comedians would go go have to you so I'm like trying not to interrupt the show I'm like I'm thinking I'm like Rashad Rashad and and I'm and I'm one of my why is he not paying attention to me why is he Rashaad where I'm looking at him like Rashad something's wrong I'm trying to signal him I'm using my eyes I'm trying to signal him like bro I gotta get out cuz I almost I was this close to running out of of that the improv comedy club would you where would you have gone I just run out of there I didn't those cases you're better off just sitting still waiting for it to pass I know but I was I was I was like in my mom side exactly what I thought I'm like I gotta get out of shit I gotta get out of here I gotta get out of here now but then an hour in my mind and I was like no my watch stopped being apart stop being pawn you can handle this so I'm like trying to reel myself back in in my mind I might just breathe relax breathe relax watch the show breathe and I'm getting through the show them get into it but every now and again it'll creep back in you're hi bro you're a hi get out of here get out but that's it that was it for me after that one I'm like you know what he's just not for me it's just not not for me I've had those experiences a hundred times at least maybe more probably yeah like what I'm never doing this again you know we just get so high it just gets ridiculous but you still you still do it I like it I always learn something when I get that high when I get real high if something's bothering me I'm probably like well I probably have an issue I need to take care of what something's bothering me in the first place yeah yeah yeah like if if I get paranoid about something or I feel bad about something maybe I said or something I did like marijuana like if you have something that you're you're like maybe pushing in the back your head yeah marijuana is like hey hey what the fuck is that what's that let's turn a light on click put a flashlight on it it's like it makes you think like Eddie Bravo to me this once it really made a lot of sense he goes the best time to get high is when nothing's fucking with you if nothing's fucking with you and you get high it's like ah you can just enjoy it but if you if you got anything that you're putting off anything that you're half-ass and anything you're doing wrong in your life anything you're procrastinating anything were you you're not really doing your best not giving it your all if you get how you start thinking like what am i doing my life but isn't that like every body and every time like very seldom or is everything okay that's true too that's very seldom is everything okay that's true too like I can count on one hand how many times I've just sat baited everything is beautiful everything is good yeah that's true right I mean if you're doing difficult shit especially and clearly you're doing difficult shit if you're doing something difficult with your life like you're always in a state of some some kind of struggle yeah yeah it's never it's never like oh man this is perfect that's funny wonderful it's such a true thing you just said you know everything at some point something is always going to something always going on but isn't that weird that everybody wants everything to be perfect and it really never is yeah it never it constant state of that but you see people like that's what social media is all about right social media projects this image of perfect yes like you see some guy leaning on a cool car stand in front of a nice house beautiful girl with him like this fucking guy's got it made he doesn't feel any pain or suffering yeah he's just smooth sailing through - you know the point and I blame you I blame the show actually the last time I was here the last time I was here after that it just got worse know that hey I know and I just hate but now like people like oh I need help i need help with this a my uh i'm gonna get evicted just put money in my account a people were sending me requests on paypal somehow they found me on paypal put in record sent just send me money requests really bro just blessed me with a couple times just lets me that is lame that it was great bless me just bless me man hey what do you a saint bless me I don't but people were just sending requests left and right now and then you know and then some wood of course got this big story on Instagram and send me these

I have everything now Instagram they shut down my Instagram right away before he could post anything you know because that I have a lot more followers on there and it was just like I was so like just just flustered by it all to where I couldn't do anything but smile like I just does anybody ever post for you oh yeah it used to they used to yeah but I I'm I still like to have some level of control but meaning that other people besides you have your password yeah yeah yeah but it's it's it's someone that I know someone that I trust you know it's not like random no it's one purchase of one person but is it possible that one person left their phone laying around or something and someone saw the password no no because now it candy because he wasn't just my Twitter they got my bank account right that's what's crazy I mean I don't how are they connected how's the bank account and the Twitter and I from when I'm learning now is they can easy hackers can easily hack you from and I like your Starbucks Wi-Fi they can yeah that's why yeah you want a virtual private network a VPN yeah we use a expressvpn but there's a bunch of them you you could use that and the good thing about it is also you could get into accounts like you could do stuff like you know you're in other countries they lock you out of things yeah like you can't look certain parts of the web you can if you have a VPN yeah because this this was what and obviously something they were using because you know they signed when they sign in to my they tried to get into my my email they got any money when he sign in cuz now you have that two-factor authentication or whatever and when they sign it show one of them showed that they were in New York another one showed that they were in like Bali mm-hmm so they were switching up yeah yeah whoever knew what they were they knew what they were doing because they were they were getting in there saying some and it was like and of course and I saw that and and it was unfair to to my manager for people to actually say that because you know a lot of math leads everybody soon of course everyone say and then Connor said something about it too which is kind of which was very low I understand that the comments that were tweeted out we're very very disrespectful first of all that's not me I don't need to talk like of course you know and I would never say anything like that if you know as much as I want to beat him up you feed Connor wants to fight we can fight but I would never there's lines that you don't cross that's not you at all I wouldn't listen ever you saying that you're so like effing you yeah I mean don't get me wrong I'll say you know of course yeah yeah yeah you know but it was just I would never say anything about someone's new family sometimes wife someone or social I would never say that no I never thought for a second it was you and an ally is a guy that that's so into his friend would never sound okay how much he hates Connor or how much he died I thought he was just trying to stir up the pot now not yet what I didn't know the energy stand of course not I didn't know the extent of what he'd said either I didn't know people it's bad it was bad it was some of the things when they find out who did it is it their way do you know I would think so but you know it's I'm sure that's something like that's gonna be expensive mmm you know someone's got to investigate that tell do you have sea pony up but you know my mom you know is it is it worth it for them to do it if it is if it's ollie that's sure that's the only way it's worth it that's true if it's just some random crazy dude some Russian hat that's not worth it but that's what that's something in order to find out if it's worth it or not you got to do the investigation you got to pay for all that yeah but I stay away the funny thing is as soon as we get that Dana comes up in ziko initially I didn't know what he meant but he was like I was like yeah I talked to I had to talk with him like you know I made sure everything was okay and I'm thinking like gotta talk with who woody time and and this was before I really saw the tweets he's like you had to talk with Connor I'm thinking like mushy shit about Connor I got hacked were you talking about right until I saw the comments and what was sad towards him I was like oh shit okay I understand this guy's going into one of the biggest fights I mean he's this is a return fight you know with everything he's gone through and having that hanging around or someone saying of course yeah it's just first of all we're not that thirsty I'm the champion the belts gonna move I'm gonna fight somebody yeah you know so I don't really care who it is I'm gonna fight somebody as he mentioned he has mentioned your name right yeah the only reason we're even talking about Connor Connors even in the conversation because he came out and said like he wanted my belt yeah like I don't give it I don't get you shits about Connor well the idea was timed at 45 type 255 type 270 I don't really care but 70 if he could win a title at 70 I mean goddamn 45 55 and 7 that would be Barger bleed would be one of the biggest fights because because he's trying to make history no one's ever done that to go up through weight classes and get a belt in all three weight classes no one has ever done that well the UFC is campaigning for khabib and khabib 'he's like give me 100 million bucks yeah I mean he's in this position to us the fucking champ yeah and he doesn't want to fight him he's like fuck that guy know I've been there done that yeah and also he's like why am I gonna give this guy more attention and hear him say more crazy shit about me and all that stuff that he did before yeah some people don't care for that know Cleve is very honorable guy he's not in the business of talking shit he doesn't have anything to do with that but he said one of the darkest things I ever heard of a guy say before he said I want to change his face change his changes and you see the conviction in his face when he said when he looked at the camera said send me location certain location send me send me send me location I fucking love the understatement to do this new you Brooklyn knockout send me send me location yeah is no way to fight and that's that's how I feel too you know like a lot of these guys duel is talking now and do this and this whole mass with all care to do all this talking and and you know I used to I respect the mess with all a lot before you know but you know after years of years of being in the game you finally start to get a little shine and this is how are you gonna do it this is what you know now you're you're that gimmicky guy yeah but now you're not going about him you know exactly no I thought works I get his management team even though you know my management is taking care of his management team before you know that's another story but you know they've done a good job of getting him to this point where he's got this hype around him now but that's what it'll bit of a good job but knocking out Donald Cerrone he's knocking out Darren tail and putting Ben Askren into another dimension with a flying knee all that help and then fucking ups Nate Diaz and open up two vaginas on his face that is that is why he got popular right you know that yeah but you know like were those the hardest fights at that time well Darren till was thought to be a very hard for until was a good one yeah that was that was a good one he was coming off of the tire Woodley fight but still Darren till was thought to be a very good fight yes and Donald Cerrone you know Donald is real people five pounder yes yes but I'm talking about those big fight yes so Donald Cerrone Darren till and then the Ben Askren one that was no matter how you slice it that's goddamn crazy what he did to him yeah absolutely I mean to land that knee yeah that's crazy you know but what happens if to had that need not landed who knows I mean he might just I wasn't gambling up that was that that was the gamble yes I think that was the gamble fight that paid off in mm-hmm sent him well he took all that high from Ben Askren yeah you know but I understand I get it rightfully so but you know now to kind of make all this noise and say you're this and now you you're gonna do this like I've heard him gone as far as saying oh he's gonna break my face is gonna do all of this and do that but then I see you backstage and nothing was said nothing we sat in the same role and Connor's fight the same role maybe 10 people apart nothing was said you know I'm that type of guy if your gut if I say what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do something to you when I see you I'm that's it's on site I don't that's not me I don't like to talk to shit and this and that but if I feel a certain way about you when I see you I'm gonna confront you about it so you're number one pigs GSP number one is yes number was GSP for legacy for history for everything number two red panties night Conor of course absolutely very close at Manny's night number two number three is that yeah yeah that kid Maz Vidal's why does he call you owl what is our hunting out that makes perfect sense yeah who know because they went people try to bring him up yeah like he's just killing my oh come on that's hilarious both on both sides yeah I mean it is what it is that we don't let's just be honest unless they somehow cuz they're doing everything possible not to fight me right now they're bagging for a counter Friday they're begging for that fight because like I get it let's be honest his if my manager said it too if I was his manager yes why would I fight you you know I've got all this hype right now I would do everything possible on the fight you of course I want to fight Conor you fight Conor and lose guess what I still got the payday who cares giant one yeah pick giant payday who cares yeah but he firefights me he goes back down and making fifteen fifty or whatever he was making before I get all that hype is done you know so yeah why would I fight you know I have the opportunity to potentially fight Connor if Connor picks him it's real interesting right now right it's like how does this all play out we're just waiting for the UFC to pile up but listen everyone is the problem is everyone has been saying oh they they need to give him a title shot need to give him a tighter shot need to give me Tasha well guess what you just might get what you wish for but now you realize oh I don't really want the title shot I want no I want I want this money over here I want this guy to pick me so I can get that money I don't really want the title shot because we both know what's gonna happen him and I both know his management team you know everybody knows was truly gonna happen but that's the nature of the game because he's got his fans who really believe that he can beat anybody in the world that he can't be touched they decide all yeah that's the guy that's gonna beat you he's gonna knock you out he's gonna do whatever he wants to do to you no it's not gonna happen not even remotely possible right to happen being exciting fight to set up oh yeah I mean I don't care like I'll find anybody hide behind it would be gigantic revolt anybody for actually for all three of those fights all three of those fights are you're in the driver's seat which is beautiful all right you really are because everybody wants that title you have the like nobody's the the BMF titles like no one's trying to get that and it's just at home Care's cool-looking belt that he gets to carry around with them but everybody wants your belt yeah so you know at the end of the day that's you know Dana said that's the fight that he wants and and we're in the business of doing business with Dana right now so if that's the fight that Dana wants to make then we're gonna go in there woman and talk and what kind of timeline do you think you're looking at like if I wait for you well let's see April's taken already March is taken what made you live event I'm ready to fight as soon as pop after April I'm ready to fight that's gonna be in Vegas to relive July event yeah I'm really fun you know we'll see what Dana says if it makes sense for them oh yeah I want to see red pants you and him would be fuckin crazy god damn that would be huge yeah you know if it happens it happens but I I'm not going you know holding my breath I'm excited about all three of those matchups don't think they're doing everything they're good around it and you know it is what it is for that but I don't think a fight I don't think I'd be extra hyped for any of those fights I think all three of them at a hundred yeah whether it's GSP I'm at a hundred Mazda Dom at a hundred red panties night come on I'm a hundred percent pump for all three of them honestly I I you know at some point we're just looking I'm like that actually kind of makes more sense than even and obviously the mass with all being in the welterweight has been doing his thing you know but it's like this guy hasn't beat anybody in the top five I didn't fought anyone in the top five well if Connor jumps right ahead of everybody and gets a title shot like people like said people will frown upon it but at the same time at the same time they get you know he's fought he just fought at what's wait yeah you know and they'll get it because look Connor did the same thing for a lightweight mm-hmm he went straight into it fought didn't even fight a tune-up fight he just fought a tune-up fight yeah at Walter with a lightweight he didn't he just jumped right into the title and you saw what he did there yep so people are intrigued to see if Connor is really this mythical creature that can go in and win three titles dude you know like that I mean it makes sense if Connor wants that opportunity to get who am I to try to stand in the way of his opportunity to try to to be great I don't mind red panties Nigel I set it up UFC listen champ is great Avenue as a change brother thank you so much so happy to hear your father's getting out it's amazing thank you and that's it tell everybody
