earned a thousand calories is there some sort of I talked to Pat McAfee one time he said it's about explosivity it's about rape and murder my head's filled with it stopping rapists and stopping murderers and killing child molesters that's what I think about killing bad people when you work out yeah that's what I do when I get tired if I get tired I think about like saving someone I care about I think about stopping someone who's trying to murder someone I love that's what I think about I love your face I'm not kidding right I think about my second wife I think about protecting people I care about didn't you tell you tell me one time um you if it's hard you'll go up pretend like someone's trying to kill me yeah yeah so you're like pretending yeah I don't have words for that that's what you got to do because that's that's look if you think about worst-case scenario you're tired and someone's trying to kill someone you care about and you don't have enough energy to stop them but do you think you learned that switch in like Taekwon or not Taekwondo uh yeah I learned it from martial arts for sure yeah yeah sure yeah yeah because that's the scariest place you could ever be like the scariest place you could be is life and death so like just putting yourself and oh just one lose weight okay good yeah that's good but that's not you're not gonna save yourself like you got you got to put yourself in like animalistic fury that's how you get you got to put yourself you got to put yourself in this the state of just 100% effort yeah I was pegged at like a hundred and eighty hundred and seventy seven beats per minute for the last 35 35 minutes it's really that's really got to do it see I you know I that David Goggins guy got in my head with uh just embrace the suck yeah I

Louis October I think 10th through the 12th I'm doing four I think it's six shows I'll take all that money can have it right that's beautiful yeah that's a beautiful place - great place man yeah love love Utah does it does he not have medical insurance I don't know I don't think it covers it and he you know he's a broke fighter yeah as a broke fighter man and I just dude I'm so fortunate like me finding stand-up and I have so much cool stuff in the works and this Bravo show I'm like dude you just can't take take take yeah you know I give them my family and all that I'm like I have to we have to figure some out here so I saw that I'm like what the fuck man that's awesome man they think that it's because of the singular aspect of their diet and the fact they've eliminated everything else but they're not they don't do any studying of elimination diets they don't do any study of the prolonged benefits of fasting and all these different things that you're talking about which I think are there these are all factors in this really complicated thing that's going on that most likely has something to do with their gut biome and their immune system right absolutely I mean those are two major confounding factors like so major you know it's it's important it's just important to approach the like a science you know and and not like a religion like you said where you want to believe something and so you just find you know this is this study that I also see circulating a lot around that why plants are really bad to eat it's like they're there they're there means that the insect anti-nutrients or pesticides it's from my former mentor okay dr. Bruce Ames who spent his entire career like advocating micronutrients from vegetables and from me and from fish okay it's like so ironic but if you actually read the paper not only does it say it doesn't you know these these insect anti feedings like sulfur everything don't cause cancer but it also goes has a whole section on heterocyclic amines from cooked meat so if you really want to use that paper as an argument right to not eat plants then maybe read the paper and realize oh it's also talking about heterocyclic amines as well the point of the paper was like I'm getting a little emotional I like it the point of the paper was basically not to worry about like some of the amounts that you're being exposed to with some of these natural you know ants insect anti fetuses that are fountain plants and some of the cook things and meat and as well as some of the the pesticides that are found in synthetic pesticides basically that they're in such small amounts so that was kind of the point of the paper was back in the 90s and but I just think that it's a little hypocritical to use a paper you know as like and literally it's like I mean it's like proliferated everywhere that's like I see this paper all the time yes it's like well did you read the paper because it has a whole section on on the insect anti feed it's from coffee which a lot of people drink and also from meat like that didn't stick but some of them do stick you can't say retard anymore that one's sticking right like and people are realizing there's certain things you can do and certain things you can't do certain things we accept certain things we can't accept any more and we're figuring it out and we're figuring it out in real time in at a radical pace that's never existed before in human history where something that was acceptable just 10-15 years ago is completely unacceptable now that's there's never been a time like that before never been a time in the entire world since people started talking there's never been a time where is taking place at such a radical pace and you're a part of it and I'm a part of it and everyone is listening this is a part of it we're all together in this and no one knows where the fuck is going ilove that you're you're saying that the reason all this is happening right now is because we are now we're just communicating at a more rapid pace that's all it boils down to you're absolutely right it's a communication revolution yeah yeah and if so if someone says you know well hey you said it doesn't make sense like yeah yeah for sure what because gonna get it right no one's gonna get it right all the time like no one just no I'm not an Oracle most fucking human I was born in New Jersey but you are being held to that standard well we all are now usually something it would be there's good to that too okay the good is you realize like when you're responsible like if you make a mistake and where you say something incorrect or you say something mean you were just trying to be funny to came out bad the the blowback lets you know this is how people feel about that and it's disproportionate because your signals disproportionate your ability to express yourself is disproportionate so the blowback is going to be disproportionate as well so it feels awful but that's just an affirmation just letting you know okay know the fake ass isn't on you said you got to keep the spectacle alive almost you know means yeah if it's not a spectacle it's not interesting I guess I can't change anything if it's not an absolute spectacle to the vision your brain will catch on to the my favorite word fuckery yeah I love that word - it's my favorite word it's a great word it's a good way it really is like a great first of all it's a word that you can get away with no matter what it's not a word you know you know eventually you won't be able to use anymore no fuckery is just gonna be around forever and it's just it is perfect for like nonsense yeah I've been my English friends for years we're saying fuck kirino's that's the thing that's the internet it's only recently catching on over here yeah really no that's like you know 10 years I'm talking about since the eighties I've been hearing fuckery I'm trying to figure out when I started using that I started using in regards to martial arts like fake martial arts I use it in all kinds of City you can use it lightheartedly seriously yeah it works you there whirring it's as versatile it's just plain old fuck yeah yeah steve maxwell that's where I got it from I started using with Steve Maxwell he was describing some fake martial arts talking about because you know Steve's a black belt in jujitsu and he's like yes it's a lot of fuckery it's a great I just looked it up to see if there's a good definition and it says it's also definition for another word for a brothel fucker holy shit dude you just like open my brain of course they've caught it are you going to the fucker [Laughter] fucker oh that's too good that's a layer that never would have done had you not just a little vulgar slang uncountable sexual intercourse well wow that was just fucked up that which is fucked up is that which is fucked up his definition is a fuckery is hilarious [Applause]
