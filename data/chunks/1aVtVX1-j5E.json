Oh false flag five four three two yes yes ladies and gentlemen yes we're here we I'm sorry we didn't go live earlier folks in our tweeted 20 minutes ago we just said a bunch of shit we could never talk to you about Gaza a lot of it I do it digs as usual well of course my jobs on it's about dicks gotta do what you gotta do Dixon gossip speaking of dicks that fucking thing you're driving around kids toy that's so crazy mr. fuck boy toy who's that dude I was because I came straight from the airport tell me what it is it's a slingshot so it's there's you know it's uh three wheelers so it's big two wheels on the front one in the back it looks like Bruce Wayne's like yeah like Batmobile like weird toy it looks like you shouldn't be able to drive in the street you're like wait a minute how do you you could just drive that around No how's that work that's a car is that a car like what is that I don't know what it is but technically it's considered a motorcycle and you know I have the helmet I wear the helmet sometimes kids if you're listening definitely wear a helmet when you have it but I was I parked at the airport because I want to park my Porsche at there yeah I parked at the airport and then I I thought I'd have time to go home because I land this morn from San Francisco thought I'd have time to go home and change the cars out and then come here and you know take a shower but I didn't so I was like ah fuck let's drive all the way down there go on the 405 over the hill well it's lovely though the wind in my face yeah I got fucking 80s rock on this fucking I was feeling myself man I thought did I mean people are like me like that's either the coolest guy I've ever seen the biggest tool don't fucking get me with your best shot I'm just fucking flying man that's hilarious you listen to Pat Benatar just wow - shit - oh my god I love it man cuz again I would never get on a motorcycle because this thing's so big so it's a little safer little little sick it's but people can see it much like the effect that can't see it that's a big part but this thing I mean when to my face I can see like everything man like a car you're showing clothes this I love it and the stick shift like I feel like I'm one with the road oh yeah with a clutch oh yeah that's easy much better it is driving uh you feel I feel more like I said with the road I feel like a like Paul Newman or some shit like a racecar driver especially with that thing that's like the sweet spot between a motorcycle on a car exactly that's why it makes sense and the gas mileage on it is super beasty it's awesome I'll probably weighs nothing right nothing little engine and it's fast but if your ways can you pick it up I don't know we should try after that yeah we should I picked up you and I can definitely pick it up if it weighs somewhere around like like a really light light car it's supposed to be the most fun to drive let's say like a 1973 Porsche because they're not they're not that powerful but they don't really need to be it's a 1970 Porsche has like 200 horsepower it's like wow there's a fast little car cuz they way you can get them down to like nineteen hundred pounds that's insane it might my gt3 it's three thousand pounds so I think it's just not so it's very light that's why that's why when you're buying a Porsche if you get the Targa there's so much heavier last the heaviest fog yeah all that bullshit looks sick though they do look cool but I don't think they are especially the old ones I don't think they're the most rigid I don't think they had that debt like I used to have an NSX that had a target --top' what do you got here 1700 what years at though that's what you've seen Porsche Wow that's light that's like lighter than probably one of the lightest cars you here's the stickler no airbags so if some were to hit me that's no bueno I'll live life on the edge though fellas we like having no airbags how does that work I'm not sure it's both you have motorcycle it's consider motorcycle on the street but they say cops if they see without a helmet they will pull you over and pound the car hmm I just these things are so new they think I'm like some low-budget Alley Cat Bruce Wayne or something like that they thumbs up I passed seven of them I guess you don't have helmet yeah and I go in carpool I go in carpool like an asshole just blaring 80s rock we carpool because it's a motorcycle yeah I'm like well classically it's a motorcycle wow you can car you could go an HOV in that I'm not sure Joe there's really no rules I'm kind of in no-man's land right now so you get you're allowed to go in look how fun is that you're allowed to go in the carpool lane at a fucking motorcycle that's the opposite of carpooling ain't it win it's so stupid I'll give your carpooling on a motorcycle you putting somebody at risk Karev you get somebody on the back with you see every time I see a guy in a motorcycle I see one person I see like well it's dangerous but guy Norris I see two people on a motorcycle I go well this is this is like exponentially more dangerous and usually it's his girl in the back with like she has daisy dukes on or something right and how much how good are you at adjusting with that extra hundred and 25 pounds in the back yeah yeah that extra 125 pounds or whatever she weighs one let's go one for let's make a real woman says she's hundred eighty pounds so if you get a 150 pounds behind you how good are you at correcting for that if you really practice that are you good in the moment when the shit hits the fan do you make good decisions do you even know if you do I think it's one of those things where it does it matter if you're both on a motorcycle and you have daisy dukes on crash who gives a fuck meat goes everyone super meaty oh just chunks of meat hit the gravel and rip apart and that's easy to tear we would go barefoot in shorts no shirt riding a motorcycle and you could do that in Colorado you don't have to have a helmet I think Nevada has no helmet - it's a bunch of places like that Arizona no helmets I saw these dudes riding around in Harley Davidsons no helmet I was like it kind of feared though like if you're right right a motorcycle how you gonna tell him where the helmet if they briefed if they don't want to wear one who gives a fuck cuz that's the only thing that could save their life I know but if they're on a motorcycle got whatever man yeah this is how I like to live well there's a there's an argument there man for sure I don't think you should be able to tell people what to do but I think guidelines for young people are very very important because they make let's get point impulsive decisions and if you could protect more of them if you made a mandatory helmet law maybe you should say up to age 30 and over age 30 you do it over fuck that's why they do it cuz you can't have all those loopholes can you yeah private sense I think the reason why they do it is for insurance I think insurance policies don't they don't want to pay out for injuries and death and all that shit that's why they make seatbelt laws that's why they make helmet laws I don't really think it's to protect people I think protecting people is a consequence of protecting their money make sense yeah sure how gross is that I'm pretty sure that's true though that's life they realize how people how many people get injured and how much they have to pay so they factor it in and they say we'll just lobby for more protection the cars more airbags airbags mandatory seatbelts all the different stuff like a lot of that is really under the guise of protecting us it's really the protection insurance companies money it's nasty they say your your odds of getting a motorcycle accident your first year of owning a motorcycle are 99% 99% people get in some sort of they wreck it they do something their first year of driving a motorcycle Wow so you don't buy a super fancy motorcycle your first year Jesse Dean delray when he wiped no he wiped back when he's fat Dean Dean um got off sugar completely really impressive actually he was always it was never fat but he was a guy who was not taking care of himself mm-hmm sorry not going to the gym and he got real thick and he was on a motorcycle and some crazy meth-head caught him off some lady I might have been a stolen car it was something like super sketchy but she she'd crashed into him he wiped she never stopped and he just got toe up all the side his legs his arm he just got severely jacked yeah there is god damn yeah Dean Delray living life there's a there's a picture of the actual wound if he could find it he put up the actual wound on his uh especially on his back inside it's really bad I mean he fucking I mean if I'm gonna crash I want to because my my ear not some random lady not seeing me on that yeah I mean it ain't no it's not in there it's there's a picture of it oh well no worse but anyway I just white shit over his side those bandages I mean that's how big the fucking giant tear is it goes his skin is fucked up for like a good solid foot yeah how funny is this and so in the NFL NBA NHL motorcycles are illegal once you sign that contract you cannot drive a motorcycle I'm sure those guys that have them but legally it will void your contract the UFC you can win a motorcycle they give you a motorcycle that's cuz of the deal with Harley I get it isn't it weird yeah but they're also like I don't know the mean you gotta think of who was running the UFC right it was owned by two guys the fruit eaters that were independently matt very very wealthy already and very wise businessman and they were fans so they just decided fuck this let's just try it let's try to make this work try to make it real they hired Dana fucking white to be the president who's crazy yeah and it all worked it was good it's great it's great like his craziness is part of the reason why it's so appealing like when Oscar De La Hoya was talking shit about the Mayweather McGregor fight and he and he goes what he was like lol is this guy sniffing coke again I love that he didn't did he even go into the cross dressing no yeah the UFC with them whatever 10 million followers blast a picture in high heels bitch and it went out without even to him having to do it this is one thing too if it's an obvious second thing and you see the first thing and be real mild everybody else would pick up the space ooh did you see dos Brack yeah at dos bag see the graphic you made of triple G Canelo no Oscar Tahoe is in the middle as a crossdresser he did one of me with a fanny pack on it's sick Jesus Christ that's funny oh my god Oscar Oscar Oscar yeah please shut the fuck up Oscar was smart though because with the all the hype I Mayweather and McGregor he would go on and shit on it right shit on the fight just to hype up his fight they'll go to that Nate and Nick picture that's everyone's on steroids go scroll up scroll up to the top me well they might be right yeah they might be right you know what I started watching last night I don't know if you'd say it Icarus or a car was on Netflix yes it's all about doping and this this guy who is helping the Russian tea hundreds yeah there was one estimate that it was somewhere in the high 90s of Russian athletes are on performance-enhancing drugs that make sense that that's my thing with this whole Jon Jones stuff like I go back and forth I'm gonna quote our friend Eddie Bravo when you look into it when you look into it that Tran appalled like so many guys article came out today I think I'm Fox Fox Sports art came out today of this guy who was a minor league baseball player and he's Pro now and he's tested twice for positive and a third time he's waiting to see if he gets banned for life because three strikes you're out in baseball right and for life and they're saying that how many guys in baseball get test hot for this Toronto ball and they saying G and C they have 47 products at GNC that this can show up us wow I know so I saw that my god fuck yeah but wait a minute he's not supposed to be taking anything you're talking about a guy who's already lost his ability to make a living from Mexican dick pills like why would he ever just take something off the shelf at GNC well we're not giving the guy kudos because he's the smartest tool in the shed short sharp shock I say smartest tool shed wall tools are smart too I smoked a little weed you don't say like like you might have been like oh I need energy get rid of this what is that good synergy buying ground bolts out of his neck and he takes that dude the truth is I'll never do steroids I put that on my children I put that on my heavenly father he do not love how we capitalize heavenly and father cuz for sure due respect while reading you all go to hell spec spec Jono 30 is facing up man imagine if he comes back at 34 it still fucks everybody yeah but he's 260 pounds a heavyweight just merging yeah fuck all this cutting weight just just go on a power lift and rampage for the next four years keep your body in shape so still fuck everybody up at heavyweight but if you look at that tranny ball man and you see how much how many guys test hot for it and they're like why don't fuck it's not in there I can see Jones argument a little bit I know I go back and forth I'm off the dome stream but when I see that and I see how big of an issue it is in baseball and minor league baseball you sada and the Commission might be like fuck look at all these guys man we got real issue here maybe did fucked up so then I think there's no way they give him four years but I never realized the outs I haven't heard of anybody else tested positive for this stuff in the UFC of you mmm is it the same stuff Frank Mir test positive for you this is the other thing usually if a guy test hot for something out of one of those major camps other guys can test hot for the same stuff mmm unless he's getting it straight from the powerlifter guys the hours NFL brothers didn't Frank Mayer eat kangaroo this is like tainted kangaroo me bro was that the worst argument ever smartest tool in the shed some people eat kangaroo but it's not common table fare in Australia fuck no it's just in Australia doing shows there I think the King groove burger no no the venison beef eating cake yeah but didn't say what what he was flagged for is my favorite part however he was still given a maximum punishment by you sada because he claimed he listed numerous potential sources for the positive tests including eating kangaroo meat while in Australia you saw this like what that's the best you got we put a bunch of shit but that's all you got boy you know what's interesting it's like how much does it help how much like what think about like what these guys are doing it mean definitely steroids help right - steroids make you a better athlete they allow you to recover some say 10% better yeah it's hard to tell though because could John beat Daniel Cormier without that small dosage of trendabl yes he could that's what DC was saying he was like the guy doesn't need to do it he's super talented doesn't need to do it I know that's why when you look at the evidence like white this small amount of Trento ball and you see all the other guys testifies for it how much would this really help him would he risk all this to take something piss hot and it's really not helping that much and then where do we stop so right now we want to enlist I've been the fucking poster boy of making fun of John on this stuff but in all seriousness where do we say all right most guys are doing it because that there's this I heard Luke Thomas talking about it they what water right well it's not in water yeah yeah what is the big one I think in 2007 they did this survey of athletes including fires that were going overseas in competing and they they asked them as at a kind of under the radar how many guys are doing performance-enhancing drugs it was a alarming number like 78% and that's people you know I bet it would be a little higher than that yeah like you know I'm saying so we're gonna tarnish John's name and he's not the greatest of all time looks like ok but then you'll pay to watch over him fight you pay to watch Peter Bell for a fight you know like we don't know exactly who's doing what right but if Overeem becomes a champ I guarantee if he pisses hot as a champ people turn on him - no I get it but he's tested for way worse things than John has but he hasn't he tested for testosterone right didn't he it was just testosterone oh my god it elevated testosterone bane I mean the same shit when he was uber ream that's more thrust Oscar oh but he but he tested positive for that didn't he and he said a doctor gave him a shot wasn't that like the whole deal at some doctor those two shoulder cat fur I know they don't know but let's just think about what they are like so he tested positive for testosterone I believe well if you test puzzles were on that vitor belfort Nate Marquardt shit where they test you like holy fuck man how are you know it's one of the pros he's one of the first guys popped by you sada I believe he was also the one who remember he ran away oh that's right literally sprinted to his car then he god dammit you're the big man run yeah had to come back he ran to his car the Aston arcade got him after like a post or a pre-flight PR thing he's like oh shit and then ran like you know how he runs in that gun he's like doing that and so he got away and he got his car drove off yeah what happens getting serious trouble right fuck yeah someone convinced him to come back probably Dana was like what up but remember what happened when Wanderlei oh yes he's been randomly for life this is for life I don't think that was USANA though I feel like that was Nevada as the Nevada Commission the same ones who want to ban Nate for a lot of Nick for life and fuck you know told Connor he owes him like two million dollars and then he has to shoot a commercial for 150,000 and and shoot a commercial in it what fuck you I'm not fighting any marshal yeah do you know that yeah what was the commercial an anti-bullying commercial mr. bass 150,000 shoot this commercial for free why would I pay why would I do an anti-bullying commercial when you're bullying me you're bullying me into doing an anti-bullying commercial or Connor shoes for like I won cool I'll do the commercial but I'm gonna give you my rate it's about two mil to do converse right now I need about hundreds 1.7 million that's why I need so you guys don't meet that so I'll pay the fine but you owe me 1.7 do the commercial yeah there's a lady in Nevada State Athletic Commission it's very mean you know that one lady think that's your job but she mean to I forget who was uh was it John John was it Nick Diaz it might have been Nick Diaz just the scolding that she was given one of the fighters while this is all going down when they were going over some sort of a positive times like you know because they're government officials you know so they feel like they have this power and they it becomes like a tyranny they're not nice like you don't have like a personal relationship with this guy you shouldn't have personal issues like this stern-faced anger and your voice mm-hmm you're in like some sort of a competition to convict someone and to punish them it's it's no thing absolutely is it's is not like look there there can absolutely be like say what you want about the Golden Snitch right Nowitzki I like it so when I saw a snitch that's a positive 10 ohm it's a fun thing to say yeah it's great so one gave me a golden snitch toilets you know from Harry Potter no don't snitch Harry Potter carry on them um Nowitzki is never angry about it never emotional about it very factual like when he describes what a thing was not casting judgment he's not being mean he's just saying this is what we have doing his job you know he's doing his genes not sent back going guy well I can John with this trying to bullshit God I hope that happens he's not doing here I'll see I realized when they brought on Nowitzki is they were trying to paint the picture to sell for the most money possible to be taken serious so he signed this huge Reebok endorsement deal you saw it you know you started doing pumping dump it's goddamn pumping and then and then Frank and Lorenzo just sold the remaining shares to like we're really out yeah someone was just telling me about how they do that with businesses like some businesses are not operating just to try to make a profit they're operating to sell yes and I went what and then this one guy was telling me that his friend had a business that was operating that way but then it didn't sell the sell fell apart and then they have to change the business plan and then start making it a business to make money mm-hmm what the fuck you talking with the frittatas I mean you're talking straight and average incomes the business so with all all they have going on they don't need the US you do well if that doesn't help us my I mean shit right now did they look at it as a business yes all right let's take these steps well the strict test and get fuck guys down the road don't care Reebok this don't here that's not our deal this is what's gonna make it look best for buyers that's what we're doing four billion go fuck yourselves have fun fellas yes genius strategy really really but I teach it at Harvard latina then the fruit eaters did the probably teach at Harvard yeah really think about it that way in terms of like it's just a giant sum of money to be earned you know what they are they earned it too because you think about like where the business was before they came along and how they were forty plus million dollars in debt when they filmed the Ultimate Fighter they were losing so much fucking money just hand over fist losing money and they were in at one point Lorenzo had called Dana and said let's sell it try to find some buyers in the morning then he woke up in the morning to change his mind it's like fuck that to him we're gonna keep it I mean that's how much money they were losing it not a lot of people would have done that depends how much money I have in the bank yeah but even if with a lot of money in the bank you can't just keep chewing through money well your 40 million dollars in that means total years you're a hundred million dollars in you're gonna get that hundred million dollars back not very likely how about their cousin bought the Houston Rockets for 2.2 billion dollars that family is fuck you : hashtag ball it hashtag bowling I saw Charlie cadet needs a loan for - yeah Johnny Depp does need a loan if someone needs to tell Johnny doesn't need 14 dollars hey Johnny settle down and at night I mean what kind of speed are you on where you sign the mortgage for that 14th house you're like fuck just killing it but that 14th house like holy shit what do you do it though you don't do anything with them that's the problem so the ego thing look at that Johnny Depp's Kentucky horse farm fails to sell at auction I wish that bit to go 42.9 it just it just happened no matter what like look up scroll up and look at that picture of him does it just happen no matter what that after a while you almost become like a caricature you become one of the favorite characters yeah I mean you you paint yourself as the odd fellow who's you know on the outside for the longest time and then all sudden you become this blockbuster guy because Johnny Depp for the longest time used to talk about cuz he's a very respected actor hell yeah and he used to talk about how he doesn't want to be mr. blockbuster guy and then he gets on Pirates of the Caribbean he probably just thinks is a cool part but still Disney you know Disney oh fuck but it seems like a cool part mean so was Alice in Wonderland that didn't fuck his life up Alice in Wonderland was just great good movie he was a great movie and he was awesome in it amazed as the Mad Hatter I pie was the Mad Hatter for Halloween I saw that those sick but he's you know he's a legit brilliant actor and then all of a sudden he's in this bark buster that's a Disney thing so all of a sudden he becomes this like huge international just top of the food chain superstar bro he got a Jack Sparrow tattoo you here's a jack you have the sparrow on his forum he how would you feel like if I had a fear factor tattoo on my leg a big MTV sign on it right here I wasn't on MTV oh that's right but if it was on my thigh and it just said fear is not a factor for me and you pull up in that slingshot just a real dick move I would have to gold plate it yeah I feel like that slingshots missing some bling yeah I needed to be shinier yeah sometimes I don't know man with Johnny Depp he just got too into it well I just think you know when you're on something that you don't enjoy that's one thing that does happen come it's a lot of people on bad sitcoms that are making a ton of money they just start going crazy and buying all these things because they need these things to make them feel good because their work doesn't and so they say yeah at least I'm working but I'm gonna get that new Ferrari that Ferrari for whatever the fuck it is is that the newest one whatever keep going the top of the food chain a dope-ass Ferrari I mean maybe just like Ferraris but then you know maybe you just buy a yacht maybe you buy you this and maybe you buy that and then you sign a deal to do the show that you don't even want to do anymore but you have to sign that deal now cuz you got a 12 million dollar mansion in Malibu I think I think doesn't uh need ever have anyone is life go now after four house he goes you know I might chill out on the fifth one man no not really even staying the other ones this is just noise like ten bro I think we should take a break this is fourteen yeah this is just a theory but I think that one of the things about a guy like Johnny Depp is if you want and I don't know this Amber Heard lady oh he was living with it she seems nice enough to me very beautiful matter of fact I read somewhere that she was like some computer program said that she was the most beautiful person alive how does it even make sense to me right like symmetrically I guess her eyes or some I don't know yeah my computer's different my thought is she's beautiful she's cool but my thought is when you're a dude like him and you got a girl like that in like you know you're you're having a great time like one of the great things to do is probably just buy a ton of shit and just impress this girl and just take her on this journey well cool what kind of how once fourteen how this is crazy he's young well he she didn't he didn't by fourteen houses with her I'm sure he only bought a few well okay eight but he's going crazy spying all kinds of shit like mommy she loves that but this is what I think I think things just escalate I think things just escalated control yeah this get you get away from yourself next thing you know you're standing on the fucking red carpet with eyeliner on and silver chains and your shirt open your chest and you you're act like you're in some crazy indie rock band and you're 53 you become a caricature Jack Sparrow you start dressing like what you think people want to see like the instead of you and you kind of forget who you are maybe I mean I'm not just saying just him I'm not what you see Jim Carrey's latest interview yes I jump I was gonna bring that up he's playing it Oh were you he's playing he's but he's getting ready for a character who acts like that he's in character that muffin that's not Jim Carrey he's doing right he's also my favorite human being one of them but he's playing a character in that so he has a new role I forget who he's playing but the guys he just signed they announced yesterday signed a for a new show on Showtime where he's playing a comedian that's freaking out later in life or something like and that's what he's doing you know he was a part of the whole I'm dying up here thing yeah yeah so he's playing a character of a comedian who's freaking out who freaks out like that like that's a typical to that role so that's kind of what he's doing there he was supposed to play or at least as a rumor that he was supposed to play Terence Mckenna in some sort of biography the famed psychedelic adventure turret turns McKenna he'd be great on that oh I'd be amazing on it she went as Andy Dufresne I'm sorry Andy Kaufman painting - hey he's got some really cool painting that needs to be doing recently it's a real cool little piece that doesn't look recent it looks I think this has been probably two or three year time period that this got made over Gipsy his daughter cool stuff man you know he's a sick painter that thing with the neon and black go back to her for a second Jamie the thing with the neon and black that he was just that it's a Mickey super talented that's really cool-looking dude did you see his daughter when she's on American Idol the poor girls get ready to sing you know the biggest night of her life like let's go ahead and wire it into her famous father Jim Carrey Jim's all hey he's like on skype he says hey baby good luck like take it away little Carrie I'm like oh god what a shitty moment man for her like let her have her moment man bring your dad Jim Carrey that's just television man that's how they do it they go 100 percent cheese on don't go at all you know yes they want they want to peel - Joe slackjaw sitting on his easy-chair at home just like this I feel like even Joe slackjaw doesn't like that bullshit enough people that do and enough people that'll tolerate it see ratings beg to differ well they don't really have good ratings it's just a tired show well it depends what it is I think if you think about most shows like ratings are down in general but look at things wet that are more organic and real right like your show I got other podcasts like other shows on YouTube stuff like that where it's not so bullshit yeah producer telling you how to feel what opinions you should have but they're stuck in that model because they have commercials they're stuck in that model because they have to those commercials if they have to interrupt their show with like everything has to kind of wrap up every few minutes no I give how many minutes do they go without commercials on a regular Bubble Guppies let you play the full thing oh my kids obsessed they loved it when they're really little four let's find that out every seven minutes roughly so every seven minutes for a sitcom and do you think they'd do the same for an hour show the breaks are different depending on the show but it's like 12 minutes 20 minutes they're always gonna be they can't you can never get real deep what if they front-loaded it like podcasting does no one's gonna watch that part no one's watching anyway so sometimes they do that like this show is brought to you commercial free buy yeah and you don't get it but they still announced that everything that's probably the way to do it that's probably the way to do it or product placement is the way to do it just don't be gross you probably know and stuff yeah you just can't be gross about it it's like if someone is drinking a coke show a coke it's nothing wrong with that as long as you know it makes sense for the scene you know I mean like the idea that you're gonna put stuff in there that doesn't belong for product placement well that's gross but if you could figure out some way where it's organic I think they're terrible I think it's so hilarious like that yeah he's all what tough fuck Rob Lowe but um very handsome but I think they're gonna start gravitating towards more of that realness they have to well they smell bullshit now yeah but Joe slackjaw sitting in his armchair in rural Illinois sorry to pick on you Illinois it's just to pick the state yeah could say Massachusetts Montana but he's just sitting there and he's guy's mouth open and maybe that appeals to him and maybe you'll tolerate it and then there's that whole spectrum in between true of people that like this my favorite show I love it when people can't sang I fucking love it when they get up there and they try to sing in there voice cracks and you know they're embarrassed oh I made me feel so good people do I used to love it when I'd watch American Idol my favorite part was the people that saw me - no that's my friend when they get all serious that's like copy all right you're good I'm out whatever happened to that lady who was like she look that she was like in her 50s all her teeth Ralph doesn't boil that's America Got Talent it was what happened - it's that Simon Cowell guys on everything he's ridiculous I heard she got like crazy bomb those black ghosts um I heard not that that matters but um right um I heard Susan Boyle I got paid Bank than was like fuck this Fame thing whoa really it's almost like you saw my way your teeth Britain's Got Talent Britain's Got Talent so great she was - remember when they they just didn't expect it and she came out and just smashed masters I remember was like no that is crazy that she can sing that good she what hold on she just turned 15 she's my age yeah how's that possible well that's crazy that scares that fucking shit out of me you're aging like cheese she's aging like fruit Wow geesh gotta use it or lose it baby she's using her voice man yeah but surprising in here and there she doesn't like to work I know she kind of bounced out of the spotlight though well if she lives simple you know oh she made my money kind of money it's a weight loss photos oh she's 56 son was she one she was we'll see what brilliant looks like in six years yeah all those talent shows are fucking weird man you know America's Got Talent and what's the one with is jennifer lopez's on one of them now well she is a dance show right and then that country music guys on an idol right now with Katy Perry host in their pain track twenty five million bucks does some crazy amount of money to hosting he's like hell no he would Beyonce Donald Trump hates black people how about Donald Trump going hard at ESPN yeah but he's wrong he's like so leaving no the ratings are up like that's so crazy ribbons are not but they down yeah that's because of him people leaving cable and somebody said that the ratings are up though they like great recent ratings maybe maybe one I just read things and I just go with them and it fells back I mean there's enough because the summer is over but but in general they're down just in you know yes be there and all those cuts had kill a bunch of people budget cuts they cut so much talent but that was it what's your name Jim out but you Mel Hill came out was like on her granted she's an employee the ESPN put on her personal social media on Twitter she was saying he's a race stuff she said he's a white supremacist and she said he's the worst president of her lifetime and a lot of people said that it's just the fact that she's a public media figure so everybody wanted her fired and then this is like it's weird outrage culture we live in right she's entitled to her fuckin opinion now the thing is does ESPN want people on their network being all political and talking about shit like that on their social media and do they have rules about that because some companies do have rules about that whether you agree with those rules are not some companies do have rules on what you can and can't say on social media but here's the thing that I found fascinating Donald Trump didn't talk about her talked about ESPN I thought that was a chickenshit thing to do like there was a woman who works for ESPN collectin oh yes that's true that's one was saying there's a woman that works for ESPN a very specific person not ESPN you know telling lies should apologize or whatever the fuck he wrote he didn't call her al he didn't call her out I think he's like he's knows you can't do it especially not now when everybody thinks you're white supremacists can't you pick on the black lady oh he's picked on Rosie O'Donnell all day long right he'll go after everybody else call him a loser girl Miss America and her little speech slammed him - she would like set a whole bunch of shit about him and you see this John's really close does that Kirk Cameron looks like Kirk Cameron that's homeboy from Survivor who is it from survivor oh no I'm sorry not from survived some Bachelorette yeah you ever seen him get roasted and when he's accused of cheating on his girl classic anyways yeah that Miss America shit about Trump and no one's going after her necessarily she's quote unquote gaining millions of fans right now right but what's interesting is I watched someone posted something about Anthony Bourdain Anthony Bourdain was caught by TMZ at the airport okay very quick sort of silly interview they asked him a question if you had to cook for Kim jong-un and Donald Trump what would you serve and he goes hemlock and he walks away it's a joke it's a fucking one lines also funny he's a funny guy he says a one-liner and all these people are saying should he be fired from CNN for saying that he would poison Trump if he had you know good luck the Secret Service is gonna contact you and so I look at his fucking Twitter page man and it's crazy all these fucking psychos are telling the Secret Service they should investigate it CNN are you gonna fire him like you fired Raisa as long with people man outrage I'll excuse me outrage culture people are getting excited about things being outrageous instead of just going this weed has got me coughing instead of just looking at it and going well I don't agree with that fuck that guy or going well that was obviously a joke which is like the normal first would do it like affects you like not at all do you really think that Anthony Bourdain wants to fucking poison Donald Trump and they should lose our jobs because she's amazing by the way she's a racist on his culture outrage culture people just decide they can try to affect something and then things start getting ramped up the momentum kicks in all these other people jump on board and they get excited about being a part of a group that wants to get Anthony Bourdain kicked off the earth they want they want some sort of weird direction they think they're important enough where they can get these people fired and I think if they get together enough to have the power to affect that person and they could even believe they're right bunch of bitches right you.your and i kept saying you know threatening the life of POTUS I kept saying what are you talking about the king you guys are out of your mind this is a person with a terrible job saying Game of Thrones Donald Trump is a person with a job that no one wants okay that's what he is he doesn't doing a good job at it no but is anybody doing a good job at it no I think Obama was like the best president we ever had and you look at me and I know people can get mad at me for this and there's a lot a lot of things that I think that he did that I don't agree with like the way he went after the press with the way he promised to protect whistleblowers but he never did like free speech and people having to give up their sources was damaged heavily during Obama's administration the use of drones unprecedented use of drones unprecedented of civilian deaths during his administration the question is how much of that was his fault how much can one man even can you all I mean this I think it's a impossible fucking job but the way he carries himself like a person I loved more than any Specter sir the way he can enunciate clearly he's a to me he was like a good representative of what I would like to see is a calm peaceful educated American who's smart and is just he's affable he seems friendly and nice he seems like one of us he's the first president that kind of seems like one of us where he could chill them and yeah you could I could actually relate to him yes Bill Clinton White House and a Dick's I don't believe I think if I was alone with Clinton I probably wouldn't be able to jive with him I just don't think especially if you're alone there's a chick in the room I think he'd look right past you yeah you'd be like a distraction you can't the cock block with I don't know yeah I thought was not like a rooster I think Clinton's a straight-up rooster yeah yeah he just can't help himself yeah you just got that she's flinging dick I got time to talk to some fuckin old comedian oh you you're fat but you voted me great get the fuck out that was a long time ago fun face I try to get my to talk to you but I ain't got that much time if you looked at me lately motherfucker I'm dying okay I'm here for you I wonder if they still get to use it you can Secret Service to rest their lives right how they fly around they fly around commercial no although President Carter is on a trail a high-five anew I'm not training a flight high-five and everyone yeah a President Carter was a beautiful person that's why he only lasted one term you know they've negotiated with the hostages like an Iran to make sure that the hostages weren't released until after Ronald Reagan was elected president that is some shady dirty dirty shit Paul please you kept Americans imprisoned extra so that you would look good and they would be released when this fucking actor with slicked black black hair got a crack a few eggs make an omelet my man Jesus it's so dirty now that stuff surprised me when comes politics which uh none of its uh it's all business Reagan was also the first guy who used the religious groups of our country to get elected he got them on board with him do what you got to do well he brought in religion to politics in a lot of ways or made it made it popular and obvious that that was a good choice align yourself as being the per like no president today could be an atheist I don't think I disagree what really yeah what are they living for they're out there in the White House where they launched a nuclear bomb they think that the end doesn't mean anything okay I'm here for God's heavenly glory well what's my Heavenly Father I'm looking over my heavenly father right now what's the percentage of atheists in the in the United States now it's higher than ever not now but it's still low I don't think so man no way fuck sakes but I think it's like 30% yeah but you need those of you run for president because people are more concerned about the Lord than they are about anything else okay 22% of u.s. population is religiously unaffiliated atheists make up 3.1 percent agnostic up for of the US population so it says that 22% but it says they're not religious they're religiously unaffiliated those are votes for the atheist president but I don't know if that means religiously unaffiliated like they could believe in God but they just don't belong to a certain church now we get in those votes okay 214 general yeah those those votes I think would go towards a religious person if that person would go back please if the person believes in God the 214 General Social Survey reported that 21% of Americans had no religion with 3 percent being atheist and 5% agnostic that's not even as much as I thought it's not that many people member you cannot be I just don't think I shouldn't say this shouldn't say this in a blanket term because maybe it can happen but I just think it's not a good strategy if you're just trying to get into office cuz Trump was never religious and now he talks about God all the time now it's all you know God this and God that it's a strategy I mean it's like you you almost it's like words that you have to say like ma'am and sir that don't know totally make sense to you well did you I heard the I think the governor or maybe it's the mayor of Florida when the hurricane is about to hit I'm watching I'm just balls-deep in it on the hurricane stuff he's entering goes you know what you know your money's great but big singing you just pray for us just keep praying for us that's all we need we need your prayers before this thing hits I'm like dude you better figure shit out yeah like that that it sounds good and use everything just keep praying for us just pray that's all I asked everyone here pray for some like man you need more than that brother like it and I made it work bro she's going around yesterday afternoon Facebook and got in trouble after some people were digging into the advertising thing that was going around also yesterday was the algorithm some people are looking into the Russian I think someone uncovered that a hundred thousand dollars had been paid to either some Russian ad agency or something I didn't follow the exact story but huh digging into that they found this story of that Jew haters had an algorithm created this tag to people and labeled them as Jew haters and so someone could buy a targeted ad to them and what they were I guess they were assuming is that Trump people did it or they were not saying this right explain this more clearly so someone could put an ad on your page no no I can't pathetically yeah I could put out an ad if I was a buying for Hillary for instance in this situation for Trump and targeted towards people that were labeled as jus haters we're labeled only the waiters will see within Facebook okay so there's from Facebook as a category of two haters and they're saying it was done by a computer algorithm not by it excuse me by a person it just sort of happened what yeah and that's what this is it's still being uncovered right now that's just hit yesterday Jew haters was trending on Twitter and I what is going on that's my facebook advertising the best that there is like for anyone because of the algorithms yeah because you can pick out a certain demographic with if you have a show in San Francisco or in LA you can literally pick everyone in a ten-mile radius and they will see that ad but that is such a crazy idea to figure it out yeah but what a crazy thing the idea that you could reach a group of Jew how about don't allow those people to be there understand in the same vein I was gonna ask you a second ago when you said your look on that Anthony Bourdain's Twitter account you saw a bunch of hate yeah do you think that that could be bots let me let me correct that it wasn't Anthony Bourdain's Twitter account it was under the tweet by TMZ for to show the video then there was all the even that even but I'm sure they probably went this makes it even easier to do then you could specifically by by that hate for cheap 20 bucks you can buy that and but they also hire people that might be multiple what does that mean by the but by that thing you could send the messages that you want you could set up a couple keywords and 500 accounts will just start sending those messages fake accounts like fake accounts Yahoo tell how many people are gonna go look through to find out how many of those accounts are fake okay but you have to write do you have to write now the tweet for those fake it don't figure it'll fill in the words holy shit so how do you know if someone is doing that great question they're fighting that on your Facebook Twitter defining it everywhere yeah that right now how do they know well they can tell by the algorithms and the computer programmers can figure out can they fake accounts for sure and that's why I went Twitter and scam they can do a flush of all those bot accounts and so you see a lot of people's followers like Kim Kardashian she lost like three million because they're a bunch of bot accounts like fake accounts well there's so many fake I thought she lost three million people saw her real ass good lord really did you see that no it's I've seen the porno did you see that Mexican disaster no she was on the beach in Mexico and she didn't have her own photographer here's the thing do whatever you want I don't want a body shame but there yes I do but let me just explain my my position on this when she shows when she shows all these pictures of her giant perfect ass she's showing an extremely unrealistic representation of a human being so what she does is she hires a photographer to follow her everywhere and take pictures and then they photoshopped the shit out of them they cleaned away all the lumps and then she looks amazing right so well she was on the beach they were they were taking pictures of her and she didn't know they were there that is a dumper that's gross that is a is not real that is all fat that someone stuffed into your ass like a giant diaper and when they smooth it out and put it on Instagram with all the retouches and everything like that this forces women to like think that this is possible but this is normal my girl thatthe beaters buy though but it's real it's real and she's got a body that it makes sense and she makes her look like mr. burns ass if you have a giant head like and then a tiny little nose like one of them plastic surgery noses people gonna go hey right like you did something weird she's what she's doing is it's not only not hot the promise she becomes famous and then it becomes a thing that people do now here's a hold on remember when we're talking about wigs we weren't you hear when we're talking about powdered wigs was that yeah as you may have big wigs think about that these fucking guys with syphilis that were losing their hair and started wearing wigs everybody started shaving their head and wearing those goddamn cool ring with you because they looked like those guys they wanted to be cool cannot hate on Kim Kardashian or make an ass as cool my man no it's not a real ass she didn't make asses cool JLo made asses cool way before Kim Kardashian I saw her woge it was super tight that's a real ass this is a disaster this is my problem with Kim Kardashian not my problem Kim Kardashian granted she's influenced a lot of people and I would not I would not kick her out of bed look at those programs look at those pictures yeah those pictures are glorious sent to a cartoonist yeah whatever but they're not real the problem is is her sister her little sister so like my nanny's daughter is always around our house she's 12 she's in seventh grade every most girls especially in middle school high school everyone looks at kylie jenner like she's a fucking like she Sprint's diana like they think she's the shit have you seen what that bitch has gone through it's in sane no plastic surgery said yeah you're talking complete reconstruction of her face body ass titties ribs completely different person go reconstruct it's not smash shaved her chin down yes and cheekbones make her look like Kim and her ass and they cut into the bone in her jaw when she was 16 what the fuck are we doing but now all these little girls look up to her like she's this huge role model and I asked him like why do you why why do you like her like just the life and then you know she she comes out with all this stuff she has Louie Vuitton she's driving gu a Gonzales and they think like that oh that's what I that's what's gonna get to big wigs big was the same thing it's the same goddamn thing those dudes wearing wigs that everybody sees and they think they're the shit so they want to copy them that's why it's dangerous different though it is but it's not same finishes but it's it's the same theory it's the same thing that happens to people but what she's doing is bonkers it's but it doesn't matter it becomes a trend and then people get sucked into that trend and she becomes important here's why I'm mad at myself I'm not mad at stop it all that I don't want to look at these pictures stop it Jamie Jamie what come into here move beyond sir and jay-z I'll go no no James J I'm with you man the surgery did you hear the tweet naughty NJ is the air back yeah yeah get him his fucking ritalin but with her what's what I get why people are gonna go she's beautiful I'm at myself be like goddamn she's fine she's like she's hot she's not an ugly woman no no she's sexy now knowing the young daughter whoa I thought you talking about Kim Oh Kim's great I'm talking about Kylie who I think she's 21 but before you know basic white girl average - white girl then now she's this video vixen right and I'm not mad at she thinking that ass would be like a water balloon have you ever felt you know what's it like pretty glorious really a fake one no no not not if they have implants but they can take fat from their stomach or the thighs and they inject the fat my ass no different right but when they waddle over to the bathroom and you see their ass going back and forth like a waterbed doesn't that freak you out no it was a there was a video of what is that young Iggy as lately uh Iggy Azalea whatever a name right there was a video of her shaking her ass and someone sent it to me they go dude what in the fuck is this was it cool no she's wearing these skin tight pants and as she's shaking her ass it's like you ever try to fucking on water bread yeah it's a nightmare yeah I had one when I was 21 as a kid and then I swapped it out for one with baffles which is actually pretty badass a water methodists yeah baffles are it's not one giant bag it's a bunch of tubes let me say when you get in there it's pretty firm but you feel the cool the warm pot sound I bet it's pretty dope but you get and you can fuck with one of those but with the other one you get slight mesh fucking night it's like trying to fuck while you're paddleboarding it's trying to fucking on one of those fucking the only those vibrating machines it's just a night yeah yeah so that's what her ass looks like she's shaking her ass and it's going back and forth and back and forth like some crazy-ass camel thing like you're storing water in that case like this that's cannibal lady just a mom Jordan during water in it it's like there's something going on it doesn't make any sense who's this I mean I'm that's fine right there that's not the music it was any of her dancing on stage yeah I wish I didn't like that stuff pink pants yeah but this is like this is a that's a rubber tune it's negative you know but that that's the like that's the culture we live in that's what we like not we sir no you don't like big titties and guys that disaster and I don't like that I like big titties asses like CrossFit chicks I like chicks the two squads and shit I like chicks that look good they look strong and healthy that's what looks good to Mike Cowan strong healthy type of chicks Callen well can i he's not here let's leave him out of this Callen loves like the big bulky like shredded girl who if she had a dick like God makes sense ya know I'm into girls that look like girls lift too when you see their ass you know that is an earned ass that's not some fat experiment and dr. Frankenstein's lab I don't have to picture you with a tube running down your mouth to keep you alive yeah well you gotta fucking you know your nose is taped up and you're lying there with your eyes rolled back in your head while they fucking it's like a caulking gun the both at the same it's healthy they're not as vibrant I see a woman that's in shape she has some calluses like I'm sure like a man who's in shape it's the same thing to pee like people like things that are healthy it seems like you're talking about sex right well sex you don't want to have sex with someone who's sick right you don't wanna have sex someone who doesn't feel good you don't have sex with someone who's like barely making it like if you get a staph infection because someone's been pumping fat into your asshole and then all sudden you're feeling feeling sad but you still have this big-ass is that sexy no that's not fun it's not exciting like you're looking at an unhealthy person's body like you look at her body like that's not a working out body she hasn't worked out so she does crash n hard that's all easy person's body for sure first results they want and I'm not saying lazy person like mom it is a full-time job listen if you can't work out I'm not blaming you if you don't want to work out I'm not blaming you but if your fucking job is only to be confessional hot chick and that's your body bitch you better work out yeah you got to get on that horse at least you know that's what I'm talking about I like that I also love that oh I like I like a gal does some deadlifts I like how she's using those path to cover of shins there's something gross about girls scarred up shins unless they fight unless they do Muay Thai and then it's kind of even then it's hot again even then just gangster ass chick word but I feel like bodies should be earned in the gym I mean I just feel like pumping some stuff into your ass without titties then but it's a trick what about titties that's where I Vasily exactly titties that's why I let it go because you can't earn them you can earn an ass well kind of genetics yeah but I mean come on let's be just be honest but we're talking about you can do some squats and deadlifts some lunges build that asset next thing how much you could probably affect it you put you might be able to not be able to get to JLo levels but I bet you get to pretty perky levels sometimes I don't know I don't know who's doing what I don't know how they're working out I don't know if they got a good trainer I don't know if they lift heavy yeah I have to see the program yeah you'd have to see their program yes well I know what their diet is people make a lot of goddamn excuses genetics I get it like Jamie's I think is biggest fucking yo Romero it's just not in the cards 100% true right genetics do come in a factor but when you just blame genetics for everything it's like okay but did you work how hard did you work you try did you advance at all like where was your starting point where are you at now and how much effort did you put in along the way you're cool with titties because that's a real woman's ass she is so real she's 40 how old she D 85 haha she doing the good thing about that you can shoot loads and there all day long and nothing's happening all day long no one's home yep game over they're about to have a kid that's right everybody's trying to you're all practice I would try I saw that the the fighting I was like I wouldn't her right now she's probably still viable for another four or five years with her genetics and she is a straight smoke show yeah that's superior genetics she knows latina superior Jan Decker echt but also hard work she works out hard man oh yeah never see her dance routines and all the stuff that she does turn out hard what a percent yeah I mean that's she's a professional hot chick who's also a singer who's also an actress she has talent these other girls I'm not do not right but she also works hard sees who Pro that's well I think that's sexy yeah and that's what I think like if you want to aspire like if you want to be a man right you'll be built like the rock right I see the rock on the fucking Instagram in the gym every goddamn day we're out here we'll get it done you know nobody works harder alright have a good day everybody he's inspiring and shit yeah shot to the fuckin gills he looks huge right that is you clearly but that's an earned physique there's not stuff and fucking silicon plates and his muscles to puff them up he's not injecting synthol in there it would look like one of them crazy possums and other stuff though it's a four but he's working out really to get there he's working out hard I don't know what his test levels are there probably elevated but the point is even with drugs that's accessible see it's still hard work but yes and it's still a real muscle yes where I draw the line look if girls could take a steroid that made them grow an ass there wouldn't be a flat ass on the planet Earth oh yeah England do it be no girls the difference in girls in men is that because there's a lot of guys who don't want to take steroids they like fuck that I'm not gonna most them don't if steroids existed for women's asses it would be as common as Botox that would all be jammed and even more coming more you know it'd be like here die yeah yeah every girl have a fat ass if you could afford it if they could figure out a way to break like I said I was driving on the street the other day I saw sign said Botox $12 God dog that's a deal for sure don't go there you Bell's palsy stroke apparently like a very tricky process you got to know when you're shooting that stuff fuck yeah I saw a deal for LASIK eye surgery buy one get one buy in Venice but you cannot do that you cannot skimp on your eyeballs please go to a reputable laser eye surgeon I'd only get one next to the wheel you don't want a deal on a surgery or asteroids implants or tattoos did you hear about that one person that got arrested they were given people asked jobs and they were pretended to be a doctor and they weren't a doctor and they were shooting all kinds of stuff into people's asses they're shootin cement cement into the ass of these people oh my god God did was wrong with people are crazy there's a great foreign Kardashian I blame Kim Kardashian ass cuz that lady's working at Walgreens like fuck I look like Kim Kardashian grab her ass you literally feel a rock of cement in there like what do you have a tumor do cancer fucking kidney stone it didn't pass it's nuts man-made ways through your hips lodged itself but here's the thing with titties I'm all about them I'm all about implants go back to the thing you cannot earn big breasts you can't earn them so what about guys with calf implants they celebrate that no Jon Jones doesn't need them Jon Jones needs him but he doesn't need them how about that well Jon Jones has the calf of an ankle doesn't care not like a Samoan ankle here's the cap of like a white girl a by the way there's a glorious picture of Mark Hunt with a fanny pack I put on Instagram today and a whole Cogan stache yeah how about that fanny pack yeah in fact pretty gangsta so please buy support mark hunts new book is out now yeah look at that it's a fucking camo fanny pack extra points he sells gangster he's the most gangster guy ever I do love that stache you know I saw a scary gentleman an article though an interview they did with him that was a very sad and disappointed you know it's like he was not bringing no no no that was terrible tax rough see he overcame that it wasn't about that it was about his brain damage oh really what was he saying saying he's already starting to slow his words and forget things that mustache and fanny pack shows me that I look for signs that mustache on that fanny pack is glorious you can't be every day when I run do you I don't wear it to the goddamn supermart I did like a psycho I do I do they make sense though and you think about him they're awesome I just don't I just don't you should but so he was saying it I'd be done I'll give you one right thanks but he was saying that he has brain trauma yeah no shit sir yeah no shit for sure we know but he was talking about it that he's slurring his words and having trouble remembering things but he also said he was born to do this it's really supposed to do and if he dies doing this he'd be fine with that he but there's a caveat to that he said if I die in the ring like I want to die in the ring go out on my shield but it better not be from someone who's on peds yeah and that's that's a really good point for people over the last five people he fought to be the tested positive for peds or tested no I think they got there it was all peds because it was brought all of them it was allister's test positive in the past for newbies for doom and Bigfoot and JDS right now is on you but that's just a diuretic but I'm just saying as far as failing tests if you just go by failed test almost everything if you look at mark Hunt's career and he went through mm-hm and when guys have test positive you're like oh my no wonder he's infuriated he's bringing drama superior genetics like Mark Hudson etics are insane like his ability to take a punch for years was ungodly you would see him get hit you'd be like this doesn't even make sense is that he took cro cop head kicks bro what are you working at what are you showing me Wow let's just go through them cro cop silva is tested positive did ver doom test positive for something yes for doom when did he test positive um a while ago okay so that's right it's almost positive deeper is 100% legit debates as clean as they come there's Bigfoot Silva again how dare you he had a drop on them the first time he's crushed him the second time because the second time you saw it was involved and Bigfoot Silva wasn't on the Jews yeah the first time the first time Bigfoot Silva was on the Jews he tested positive not only that he tested negative before the fight and positive after the fight which means he juiced himself up before the fight and they had that incredible epic five round war remember that fight he was amazing it was so epic that Dana White had a bunch of Mark Hunt brutal fights maybe sure - they made like four - before - ever happened they printed up the jackets for two and he sent me one and I was like dude I'm Ollie and that was one of the craziest fights of all time and then a week later gay Bigfoot test positive and he's like this dumb motherfucker like this could have been like this impossible yeah I mean it was just the Joshua Klitschko style incredible incredible matchup right so he test positive and then you Saad is on his ass then they come back for the second fight and Mark Hunt just smokes him in the first round I mean just looking it went through him but you just looking so you got Bigfoot JDS is done you know he's having these issues thinking up Ben Rothwell busted what I was gonna say though is if anybody legitimately has a reason for using steroids it's Bigfoot because Bigfoot has real gigantism and he had a tumor removed from his pituitary gland like his body doesn't produce testosterone right or any hormones right this is this is a gray area because no it's not great any time mister because it's brain surgery had a tumor on his pituitary aware of that look at him with so even even if you get the MT RT you'd have to regulate so much where he doesn't have such an advantage I'm not saying you should cuz him without it is awful you can't compete I'm saying more than that maybe you shouldn't be able to compete that's what I'm saying this isn't the business for you if you have to have testosterone to compete unless you want to go to Russia or Japan cheese it's what he's getting murked out there oh he's probably done I mean he said so me crazy crazy fights but he was the first guy to TKO phaidor yeah him that shit when he mounted him no one's favorite without like ageLOC in his just giant by a finger going like this and the generator was done because Fedora in all seriousness should have been a 205 pounder he's as a tank who's just unbelievably talented and ridiculously skillful in his his execution and just figured out a way to win was lightning fast and fucked a lot of people up but god damn it could you imagine if he got himself in ferocious shape at 205 nuts man like 240 right yeah I'm probably 230 right 230 32:28 good solid twenty pounds of fat hundred percent yeah so he's really like 218 which ain't shit to cut to 205 lat to Manthey Johnson goes wide yeah if he changed his diet who knows he might literally be like 207 ya know if he lost all that weight explosive she's got a real belly and a straight-up like gosh and dad gut yeah I mean that might be 25 pounds you know I mean he literally might be like 210 here's it back to my account and this is bomb ready to get this out so he says hey I see signs of brain trauma right like I'm slurring my words speech then isn't he a main event next month yeah like at what bright does when you hear that does the UFC in the commission go oh oh let's stop let's stop this stuff yeah you you're slurring your words Ison that Russian cat like 11 right a big fight for fucking mark hunt which Russian guys did to Bora I forget that there's so many goddamn Russians now right name from russia russians are taking over the world yeah that russian got it stopped Stefan Struve that's pretty goddamn impressive yeah and he had the mole on a tattoo of stingray on his back identical mulana tattoo that the grandma big fan yeah I guess you're welcome yeah Bora that guy's a badass he's gonna do a sweet left high kick doesn't do my mom Orthodox yeah just you know I'm saying if you are hunting like I don't do at least I'm the main event Australia but well at what point do we have someone where we have a guy like to go and snitch in the UFC who's watching out for that stuff is going to end some are cunt doing everywhere he has some real issues man you know what's right someone to look out to take care of these guys is Mark cunts on a shield I don't want I don't want to watch mark hunting ten years shitting his pants and drooling and doesn't remember his fight career right I don't give a fuck if he beats that rushing guy in Australia right there's nothing he has nothing to prove yeah what's it do for him well at a certain point you really you have to have some sort of a regulation that stops people from hurting themselves when they're they've taken too much damage and they can't make good decisions anymore right but then it becomes a personal freedom issue free will right because because there's a certain amount of damage you're gonna take like there's fights that probably shouldn't get made like Francis and Ghana versus almost anybody anybody's is agreeing to getting your fucking head scrambled yeah you know I mean I want to see what happens with Alistair I want to see if Alistair can survive Alistair yeah because in Ghana Clips him once and Alistair could be in deep deep trouble also Francis has never fought a strike or a high-level strike a little long the best of all time the heavyweight division but you don't have the same chin so it doesn't it's interesting matches fast to men he's scared Alistair no Francis ancestors clearly fast too but but Francis always do touch that chin once true Francis puts people to sleep during a high-level jump on the train when I think you're capable --'tis but right when you watched it with Arlovski our last he's already down down the slope you know he's already sliding way down he's been knocked out who knows how many time he's been down the slope he's been down the slope so that was impressive it was a good test coz Arlovski still knocked out Travis Browne just a couple years ago he still can that Barbour yeah still can fuck you up you know if you make if you fuck up true I'm just saying that big foot - yeah that's true that's a while ago though Joe it was you went on that tear yeah now it's over but yeah well ste peg a guy yeah Steve and that but a guy like I think JT has to be a good test for erm Alistair Overeem be pretty good mm-hmm ya know for sure look it's a great denim on board no kids right now but to be honest we need them we need a young killer like yeah a guy to bring some life in the heavyweight division he just has everything going as far as like his ability knock guys dead his look I mean he's just jacked so Martha Billy's gonna be tough until his English is better oh I don't think so really check cards coming out the corner hey Joe he starts American people at heavy Wayne and you get a highlight reel the heavyweights TVs working people he's from Cleveland he's not a drawl he's working everybody I don't understand it is it a marketing thing 100% I got to jump on the public it's not the UFC I mean steep is doing his thing yes he's doing their thing with them but sometimes the stars don't align where you become this crossover pop-culture icon a fighter ass public there like a white guy standard whacked he's a firefighter though standard but he's knocked out everyone standard how is that standard it just people want you know it and but he's real humble and you know well-spoken and yes not rocky so they don't they were drawn to negativity were drawn to the John Jones and the Conor McGregor they want that kind of that wasn't negative he's not talks a lot shit he's hot take Steve is like me not take Brian he's working his ass off training hard to win the fight isn't that crazy that well with Conor the thing that's so sensational about him is he has both of those things he has fighting ability and he also has his crazy personality it's magmatic where steep a just has the fighting ability and just I don't know I just love his work ethic I love the fact that he still has a fight okay I love it man not had people dead it's just your heavyweight champion of the world is not a draw which is insane yeah I know even if Francis knocks out Alistair knocked out steep a there's no easy draw yeah they take you dude there's just these and I don't have the formula trust me they used to be hit me up if I did there's this weird superstar soup and you have a few ingredients your myth we don't know what the others are but guys hit it yeah you hit it almost on by chance yeah they should come around once every now and then Connor wasn't like that early in his career I'm good not at all he was just a great fighter you know he's just like looking promising and then all sudden it gets to the UFC he feels the crowd all the Irish people behind him and he starts just talking shit and going off and then people love it more shit goes off more then he starts predicting what round he's gonna Merc people in and then he starts pulling it off and then he's like who the fuck is that guy and everybody goes crazy and then think about John John didn't get really mainstream ESPN coverage Good Morning America till you went bad then people like oh I want to see that badass fight he's an amazing for how long he had a press conference that he he said but I've always said he said at the end of the day he goes uh about him I've always said about him he was at the end of the day I'm a bad motherfucker I'm a wild motherfucker I want and that's what I do perfect at the end of it at the end of the day I'm a wild motherfucker I'm like that's what I would say yeah that's it brother yeah run with that I told him that too when I talked to him about it you know and he wanted to have a conversation before he did the podcast and you know he wanted to come clean I go dude you're gonna make mistakes you're a wild motherfucker it's okay that's you don't get to be as good as you are without being a wild motherfuck don't have to apologize for it John if you came out I went listen Mia Holly I'm gonna make some mistakes and I probably make a lot more I'm a wild motherfucker I'm a baddest dude on the planet this is what you get love it or hate it buddy Gotham I just can't do things that hurt people like the driving fucked up and smashing into that lady's car you said take away the things that hurt people yeah and you just out party and having a good time and occasionally do blow no one's gonna care and that's give up that's a great guy that's a fun guy it's like you gotta make sure you avoid hurting other people and then this the steroid thing is the goddamn that's the knife in the heart like this I said you got you got a you got a look into the strand of all stuff with it with the baseball all these guys who have all these problems at GNC it's and all these supplements I saw that again I've been roasting John bad because I'm upset madam because he's my favorite fighter right one of them so it is possible that he could have taken something that's trace elements of this I've also seen that other things are recognized as that stuff in the test but I have a hard time believing that you saw it wouldn't know that I know so I have a hard time once they come clean with this they come out with this I don't think it's ever been proven once that they said that a person had tested positive or something and that that person had never actually taken that thing I don't know I've not seen oh no you saw us so thorough it man if you have the Golden Snitch on your trail you're fucked he's like Sherlock Holmes of peds you are so fucked and again just fucking dead calm about it not judgemental just the facts going over the details my father's this is what bothered me a little bit and why I'm going back and forth on John if my career was in jeopardy I would be out there been like listen this is what fucking happened man hear me out I'm not going radio silent sending these weird cryptic tweets doing this evens my manager like dude let's wait I'm doing a press comes like listen to me right now man this maybe I click this sup what I've never done steroids in my fucking life that is bullshit yeah but you can't say too much if it's going to go to some sort of a arbitration or a trial or I don't know what the process you can you can if you didn't take it but here's the thing he's got to find out how if it there is a way that something happened say if you maybe it's you okay say you take something from GMC and maybe take a bunch of shit you thought everything was good and then you get tested positive before you say anything I never took steroids like you have to find out what the fuck it is was in those things so you have to report those things and then they have to check and then they have to independently buy those things from from somewhere to confirmation yeah and that's a process and this one a thing that Jeff Novitzky said you got to let the process play out before you start accusing John so there'll be a process I'm just saying man not good a sample and be sample it's not good it's not good I just think it could go a long ways with his fans everything going on if he came out and was just like let me tell you guys you're gonna hear this cuz the public right now we see test date to speed both positive oh fuck steroids he's dead to me but if you tweet where he's said that he never took steroids again his Heavenly Father remember he capitalized heavenly and father so skeptical so fuck off fuck off yeah that actually made me gone hmm he was on steroids huh yeah me too I was a god damn it let me put all right clearly when he went heavily father was like you're bad guys John he's a bad guy how about how about John does this and we're all like I'll fucking the worst greatest of all time my ass then Brian Cushing I don't know football Brian Cushing captain of the Houston Texans he's been caught I think two or three times before straight-up test positive for PD like straight-up steroids and he's a monster linebacker he's tested again he's gonna I think you're banned or he's gonna miss like ten games they docked four million dollars of his paycheck the media doesn't make it nothing about it this guy's a superstar ball of course they're on steroids everybody who's 360 pounds of solid muscles on steroids but how crazy we just give them a ride off like they should don't be testing those guys it's ridiculous but he's up he's playing a position to where he hits guys he's taking years off their life he's given them brain trauma and he's rocking them Jack to the gills that's what we want to see if you want to see football okay you want to see big giant guys colliding with each other you don't see natural athletes we're out there like trying to fucking pound whey protein in the middle of night we're do you want to see that traffic on the UFC hate to tell you yes those guys aren't right I hear ya but there's weight classes in the UFC and that's where it gets different because you're talking about guys trying to get as big and as fast as powerful as they can and we've all known forever you ask the average person the football players take peds of course they do of course they do you're looking at these mountains well most people assume you'll see fires on Petey's like I've had some talks and what did we say well I don't I mean I know there's a giant percentage but but there's a different standard wait less are now but I think for the longest time 42 supplements including some that are available at GNC can trigger our positive test for Toronto ball yeah this that Fox Porto Ercole yeah yeah the officials said the Cubs again were reminded this week that players should only she used only supplements certified by NSF international independent organization to tests and approved products blah blah blah blah blah blah blah so there's a lot of shit look the union hammers concerned about the run of suspension of Toronto ball and continues to seek evidence that might shed light on why some players are testing positive because so many guys are testing positive for it well dismisses short-acting though that's out of your system fairly quickly I think that was the thing about this stuff but they preyed on that there's even debate on that though Joe yeah why did I see why don't I see something that said it had a 60-day window I've seen it's I've seen months I've seen weeks I've seen days I've seen hours again we don't fucking know do for one of it's been explained to me the stuff that gets out your system the quickest is those little edible testosterone things like the gummies they run them but those are just a few hours and a few hours are out of your system the other thing we're gonna just like we're doing now with baseball like Barry Bonds Mark McGwire Sammy Sosa at the time we're like oh my god peds homeruns that doesn't count the years go by like those guys are still pretty fun good even the pictures were sauced up I think that could happen with John to like 5-10 years like nice he's the greatest of all time still yeah but no because Daniel Cormier wasn't sauced up Daniel Cormier was totally on the natch you know believe that I don't know I assume he is skeptic no I assume he is I have no idea I have no reason not to this world anymore well you know you gotta think man your Health's on the line your futures on the line your careers on the wine you've been out of the game for essentially two and a half years plus one fight in between there the OSB fight he's been out of cage for a long time you gotta fight the best in the world yeah by the best in the world it's made you got all this pressure on you and you just go just a little bit a little bit a little bit help I don't know if you need that help if you John might not might not maybe go the club do a couple lines of coke maybe it's one of those things where he's always used it got away with it now he didn't maybe it's uh he took a supplement that had it in it I mean we really don't know it's one of the things that Nowitzki stressed that I really believe you gotta kind of before casting 100% judgment on them you can't let it play out but this is a thing we say let it play out again I know I'm playing both sides the feel here but when you say let it play out we know he has a history of fucking up yeah he's gonna hang him before it's actually come out because go know he's consistently good at beating people up and fucking up and here's another fucked up yeah that's good way of looking at it yeah that's why that's why everyone's like nope he's done to me well it's depressing to us right as fans because he's so fucking good and didn't know that he's gonna be out possibly for four years now that shit's just devastating to me we need him I don't know we don't know we fucking medium he was in fights t pay for the heavyweight title you fought steep I didn't even know about that well now you know fight for Steve Fae and then he was gonna fight Brock Lesnar we Agustin owes DeMaio DC there's so much out there to John's versus T pay for the heavyweight title would be as we'll talk about fucking dragons and Jon Snow it's because neither one of them's happening it's interesting right it's like what your theory about the frittatas pumping it up with Reebok and with you sada and then just to sell that's science son I mean theory but it's a very good theory that I haven't heard before I'll word I've never heard it is your theory entirely your idea I mean it's evidence it's just right but the evidence was always there yeah always always put two and two together what they're doing it's that's genius you mean if they really played it that that 3d chess that's fuckin genius 100% that's what they're doing but it really is they're so smart man if you just bought it and you were WME you probably if Rokita is this huge sort of thing to be doing with this yeah yeah you're going hold on it's here how long does it go I don't know what their deal is with you sonic is you saw it as a an employee of the UFC let's find out realize that right find out what how long the deal is with the UFC in you sada let's say yes let's say yours these 10 years you can't do 10 years gold sitting behind 14 houses of its table what happens if they abandon it and all sudden everybody just comes like Erik Silva comes back Jeff ratings go everybody alistair jacked alistair goes back to be an uber een all he has to do is pass the the one at the weigh-ins said we're going says they better pray to God the Golden Snitch contract runs out next two years you bringing that Russian cat from the kiosk you printing it caress whatever it is you bringing everybody in anybody all the Russians they're the best out of it all of them bring them in this guy had this dude on a protocol I fell asleep pause watching I want only watch the first 15 minutes I don't went to bed I'm gonna watch the rest of it I've heard about it but he was banging like five different things in his ass he's like amber liquids it looked like Jack Daniels Jack yeah but he just started doing this you just started doing this why listen this guy and I guess the ideas that they're gonna test him and he's gonna give him peds forever and he's gonna tell that's sick yeah yeah I need to see the whole thing say like 15 20 minutes into it out yeah if you're WME you're looking at that going when's that contract up when's the Reebok deal you're literally doing you're gonna tear it down and go let us do it like you guys got it to this point right like this isn't working for us huh yeah those are two ideas that look good to sell to another company make it a JIT but the thing is like if you can get a better deal like right you have a deal with Reebok goes for so long and then if its profitable for reblocked and adidas comes in it goes hey we like what you're doing here let's switch it up let's go adidas and then you have a bidding war between Adidas and Reebok and then maybe Nike thinks about it too and you know if you can prove that you're cleaning the sport up right with you sada that's a very smart move to get a big company to invest in a sport that's what you do it but the big company has to see some sort of a payback that's why people were pissed off because they were like well the sponsorship doesn't match what we were getting before and you know I know you had a real issue with that it was a big like 100-plus thousand dollars a fight yeah that was the biggest issue is I like the uniform system and make it look like a professional sport but if you're gonna bring in a major sponsor like that then cut down and guys pays then you're fucking the product you're fucking the fighters yeah and what you don't realize is you're actually fucking Reebok yeah as the UFC does the middleman you're screwing Reebok cuz no one had any issues with Reebok they are owning the CrossFit world they're doing thing actually like I've noticed you threw a rock I talked to represent from Reebok the other day I want to send me a fight kit so for who I forget who does it's a new box and choosing some shorts you want to send me one guy cool man I would like you honest fight kit spell her name I want mine how much if I gave you 10 million dollars do you think you could spell you Ani and Jett checks last nope nope nope nope I'm close I bet she can't spell it get her together she's like who it is this was a purchase the program they started together so they can cancel anytime I would imagine this is you sada or only thing I think is that the UFC has committed millions of dollars to in and out of competition for sure you know to bring in for the UFC to bring in a big sponsor like Reebok like that's a good way to ensure that you got a clean sport that you represent to represent a clean sport you know that's why that fighter the other night when Gavin Tucker fought goddamn it was Tucker because he's you know he's a guy who take the beatdown right yes with that ref right that ref that stopped the fight it's good to Mitch just let em know you look great though Rick the glass yes yes we're to first his mustache Rick Glen to predict Glenn beat the shit out of him beat the brakes like way too much there's like that fight should have been stopped like minutes before horrible yeah it's not good like when you see that like if I was Reebok and be like hey this guy can't do we can't sponsor a fight with this guys ref ever again we like the sport that will to do that whatever you get us they know it now you know you know I do if I still see if I'm W me I get rid of this snitch I don't see but I don't say anything I'll let people assume I let people I let everyone assume I'm sure there's an undisclosed all that you don't think the Golden Snitch is gonna go on the Ariel Helwani show the moment you out maybe you pay my fat sub by cage just go away but let's not say anything when I do a streak that's baloney it was Brock Lesnar's urine it looked like Gator gravy yeah I don't that's what I do I I would just take him out of it the equation not say anything to the public and then all sending of all the monsters back we're gonna know how they gonna know we all assume they're gonna know they're gonna find out people are fans if I'm the general public we'll find out everybody's gonna find out no you don't think so no that's so stupid you think it wouldn't get out if you saw the left if the UFC like what about the testing yeah no no we're still testing testing that I do before I was still being there still testing the Commission tests which would test after the weigh-in and then maybe after the fight depending maybe that so you saw there's just the surprise testing whenever and you saw this 365 days a year and they also way more thorough tests are very very they do blood but um the other one only does urine Victor Conte the guy who got busted the ball co scandal what does the block says but he said to me he was like if you fail one of those post weigh-in tests that's an intelligence test rekt you just you're just a dummy he's like anybody knows what they're doing can pass those tests right yeah yeah yeah if you have a guy like him you dealing with these like high-level guys like that's an easy test you saw though there's not to keep in your your-your-your piss and your blood for like seven years or freezing that shit they're keeping it for seven years math too much they're gonna test it and strip people of the title you know the Olympics has already done that ya know they busted Russians retro actively they busted two gold medalists I want to say like 2008 two gold medalists from 2008 like yeah you imagine getting that call who the fuck was that the Olympic Committee from fucking to LA just stripped our gold medals well you know they came real close to banning Russia from competing now in Rio did they banned some of their athletes or is that China did they ban like China's a gymnastic team do you have to give that back the medal they took like Reggie Bush remember that they took his Heisman you can't find any more and they took their trophies they took his Heisman for what for what reason cuz that year he proceeded benefits like you took money from boosters good lord they're like oh can I see that trophy bitch Vermont they gave him money he gave his parents like a house something like that so they investigated and took all shit and they voided all usc's wins that year all USC's wins holy shit because he violated that agreement him and the coach and they had a bunch of fuck-ups let's delay that is so bizarre I know just have to act like you never happened that's so crazy how is that possible how can you they're saying that wins everything none of it counts I was the record book so like it's still the record it's a lie right no but some money money was transpired the who watched it on TV you know I mean like the university buddy yeah well it's like Jon Jones Daniel Cormier you could you could call that a no contest all you want we saw Jon Jones beat Daniel asleep we saw it we saw the money yes he made the money off that yeah but they're not thinking that way what they're thinking is this is not it's a violation of the rules in terms of like someone competing on a performance-enhancing drug they set up the rules the guy violated it so they stripped his title as they're supposed to and they reinstated it to DC I'll doing better how about UFC 200 we're Brock Lesnar think about that and then you see cuz you get all the bikes for Brock Lesnar they realize test hot afterwards like fuck I'm deputy of course I was there's like a goddamn bro wow that's often since a little you know Brock Lester independently tested himself a shit ton of times leading up for that try well listen let me listen to me listen to me don't be crazy to independently test yourself it's cuz you want to make sure that you're showing up clean it's not because you think you're clean you want to show the world it's because you want to make sure like a is this showing up for sure here let's test out like is this really working mr. history multiple independent tests that he did which you wouldn't have to do if you weren't taking anything he's trying to get whatever it is out of his system trying to get his body up to baseline for sure I mean when you watched him in the WWE and he's 300 plus pounds fucking jack he looks the same he's he's a giant guy you know and he's 39 or something like that now that was a dirty one that was the most dirtiest well that's another mark hunt beating I know slurred speech yeah Alistair Overeem that was the worst one that knee tucked to the face flatlined him straight up flat right right in front of us man he was doing a toe curl you know when they get Kayode and get that Tokra do they do like the Shocker with their feet that toe curl is hard to watch because you know that that that's the whole body on it's weird people enjoy seeing that they don't enjoy seeing that they enjoy seeing the kick landing cuz it's so difficult and you know the consequences are so grave it's like oh like it like our the way we're made up you you you almost want to flinch when you see that someone's brain shuts off like that you should be genetically you go oh my god you know you know I just don't think the people that suffer the most start they don't come out about it they just kind of go away what do you mean right like guys like Don Frye you don't see Don Frye all the time being interviewed on TV you don't think about like his fight with Takayama and they both stood in front of each other and blast each other in the face over and over and over your older generation it's not in their nature to do that they're not they're not very good on camera stuff like that I think as you go on and what I mean you're gonna see guys coming out though maybe oh but just because people don't see them they fade away I saw you say you're not in the spotlight yeah they're not in this probably so people don't think about that when you think of fighting you think of you know watching tyron woodley right now in his prime yeah you know he's doing damage you know that you know he's had some good fights but he's okay he's fine yeah you think of it as what you knows knockout loss yet to Nate Marquardt in Strikeforce it's like the only like real bad loss that he has the other losses you know it just doesn't doesn't seem like he's in a bad place but then you know you don't see guys that were in the UFC 15 20 years ago you know that took crazy debt like Gary Goodridge Big Daddy Goodrich who went over to k1 and he's got crazy CTE now horrible he talked about it right yeah he talks about it really open lane is he's got a great Twitter to follow whoever had him on here no would you for sure yeah talk about that I mean I'm sure he would want to talk about that you want people who know you know I just obviously if you're gonna fight brain traumas one of the one caption one that's that's what we do obviously so if you were to come on in my ki brain tribe CT I don't feel like most people my god it's terrible I'm not watching well you feel bad like you know you see someone slurring their words ever see Joe Frazier before he died yeah he was on the Opie and Anthony show once and I remember listening I was like wow this is hard to listen to man it's just like there's some guys like that in the AFC yeah yes I won't mention names some guys who like Alf conversation with I'm like oh my god man yeah see it yeah it's look nobody rides for free you get hit enough just it's the the weird thing is the numbers different for everybody like the number for one guy like Mark Hunt it took years and years and years and years and years and years for his chin started to fail him he think about the k1 fights he had the strike for that all the k1 pride the pride fights he had you know I think he fought in dream as well I mean when did Melvin Manhoef knock him out was that dream no no it was a pride um it's just the all the k1 bounce man I mean he was k1 grumpy champion yeah maybe you fought some fucking war was it a k1 MMA fight yes Kalin yeah I mean just there's only so many of those fights you can have it is weird how certain guys get you know their capabilities to take punches know what so much longer than other guys oh yeah I think it's a structured thing the way they're built I think the way you're built like Mark Hunt is built like a tank he's 510 to 65 he's just a tank the other problem is sighs his head his body's denseness when you see his shins like when Mark is standing front his knees are giant his knees like this big his shins are huge is but he's like a thick boned guy well the other issue is is ufc's especially as I say mixed martial art 8 when they were called makes much noise GFC but mixed martial arts is so new in the grand scheme of things compared to other sports right we don't know the best way to train to stay healthy did not get brain trouble we have not the people trying to figure out there's doctors he just hasn't been around around long enough like in football and the CFL just passes they're not allowed to put pads on in practice anymore they cannot hit and practice someone that is a rule smart and now the NFL's going bow we're gonna look into that now the NFL only has I think 14 days of bad work whether they're in pads during the season but they want to eliminate that well the sports been around for a grip the best saving grace for the sport would be or the best hope for the sport would be medical science medical science comes along with some sort of stem cell regeneration things your brain come back to 100% which is totally possible they just have to crack the code you just think about what they can do with other parts your bodies where they can repair things the brain is far more complicated than anything we have to deal with but if you could somehow or another reignite the body's ability to heal itself and in fact they have a new chip that they're going to that they're working on now where they install it in a person's body and it reprograms your genes and they think it can repair brain trauma injuries tissue damage and even the effects of aging oh my god oh my god yeah it's a chip you put into your body and it reprograms your genes and I think it's probably at some like very embryonic stage of development and a trillion dollars you know who knows but they're probably trying to juice up you know excitement for it by making it this I can't imagine I can don't look dude you know I've you know the store with my shoulder ya know I showed it was fucked I was ready to get shoulder surgery was hurting all the time it doesn't hurt at all brains I'm different now all it is you're right it is like you talk to way more calm - yeah you listen to the scientists say go weekend you need a new heart we can make that you need lungs you have muscle bones we can make all that can't help your brain right now now stop and think about where we were 50 years ago 50 years ago none of those things are possible so all these ideas that are commonplace today we're just it's science fiction 50 years ago 50 years from now they be able to use this chip if you found that thing that chip the one I found isn't even new it's from three years ago but made by no no no that's not what it is it's a new chip installed under skin that reprograms DNA and can heal injuries look look forget about brain injury just look at that because new chip I think it can replicate and restore the idea behind it is it can program the genes to replicate and restore any sort of injury we saw for some I think was live science calm it's one of those websites science websites bitch about that is by the time that's out you and I probably be dead no that's not true it might be out real soon breakthrough device heals organs with a single touch device instantly delivers new DNA or RNA into living skin cells to change their function this is it they've developed a device that will switch cell function to rescue failing body functions with a single touch the technology known as tissue nano transfection injects genetic code into the skin cells turning those skin cells into other types of cells required for treating disease conditions welcome to the Future motherfucker CTE out the window football no helmets don't be a pussy pop right back into place like whoa you know what happens then sword fights yeah they could just grab ahold you bring you back to life it's gonna be a bitch where if you get stabbed you recover sword fights would be like you're not allowed to cut their head off okay fix that fix that it's like elbows to the back of the head within one week active blood vessels appeared in the injured leg and by the second week the leg was saved holy shit researchers studied mice and pigs in these experiments in the study researchers were able to reprogram skin cells to become vascular sells in badly injured legs that lacked blood flow so amazing probably for people with diabetes amazing for you know people that are suffering from all sorts of circulatory conditions bro it takes less than a second and is non-invasive come on son welcome to the new world it's like that na song the chip doesn't even stay in your body I think talking about why is it this bigger news why didn't this on CNN all that shit they're too busy talking about Trump Earth's flat they were talking about whether or not Trump is a racist and whether or not that girl should get fired instead of that is not excitement Oh how's that not exciting ash it's exciting a shit I'm gonna go bash my brains in we're in the new world man and this is just one step right what is this gonna be like twenty we didn't see this comment what's it gonna be like twenty years now we don't know who's in Austria right now in some fuckin laboratory with white gloves on a huge brim put in their hand into some crazy machine there's a petri dish and they got all these lasers or zapping this thing and they're who knows what the fuck they're doing right now what's up bummer it's just the first I've heard about - you fuckin brought it up I'm on the ball son powerful Matt Staggs sent me that shoutout to Matt's tags I like that guy he's awesome guy this this whole what we're experiencing now is this you know this um escalating sort of technological race like one invention like this is going to allow for the idea of several other different inventions and maybe they'll come up with something to add this to CRISPR you know CRISPR yeah there's new genetic reprogramming I don't know the best way to describe it but it's a tool for altering genetics now they get a hold of that and they use it with this so you use CRISPR and this you got the Hulk you got john jones and brock lesnar baby you got the hulk fuck john jones and brock lesnar if the hulk shows up right now if they had a baby through the wall he leaps through the flesh maneuvering non-stop literally from the dressing room Leedy air and boom lands in the center of the Octagon and Brock Lester just goes shit that was the best when the Hulk grabs that fuckin Thor's brother and he's like I'm a god he just grabs busts of the Communists I fucking love the idea that some peaceful like Mark Ruffalo character who's this brilliant scientist who's like concerned with helping people if you piss this motherfucker off he becomes a bulletproof giant history dump not only it happened so quick that he tried to shoot himself in the mouth and by the time the bullet hit the skin he's the Hulk spit out the bullet come on son it's great it's fucking it's super all the whole do you think everybody else can suck my dick every single one you know why because they all call in the Hulk if the shit goes wrong if everything goes wrong like what just sending the Hulk what's that asshole with the bow and arrow doing there Johansson what are you gonna do Triangle people with your stilettos on shut the fuck up everybody calling the green guy and let's just get this over with punching spaceships into oblivion and what are you doing gonna shoot arrows shoot those at the spaceship Archer the fuck outta here love you some Hulk he's the best he's the only one to call if I was Captain America I'd be like listen I'm gay this is happen America get the fuck out of my face yeah look you wanted to get some body she's the only one I can calm him down oh my calm down Hulk down boy that looks so fake there that was that looks like my kid drew it that looks little bit holistic no it looks like Shrek there was two Hulk's though yeah m0 munch and then the Demark Reuben lunch alone yeah at Norton was one Eric Bana was the worst I want to see that Eric banner movie when I when I was not that he's a bad actor he's amazing actor he was great in choppers your semen chopper his ridiculous fucking fantastic but do something about that Hulk movie with him I was like this is why that's not his fault I want I want to see it's super duper high and when I went to see it super duper high I was like oh my god the this movie so bad marijuana is the number one detector of shitty acting like you just sense it there he is go big screen on that money son to son that's Eric Bana one that's early days that's the first ho San Francisco Hulk yeah so you see the difference between the Ed Norton Hulk on the right and actually the one loaded terrible the one level exploded Banahaw gooks so fake the Ed Norton one is so much better which one's this that's the bad that looks like shit now go to the most recent the Mark Ruffalo Hulk let's see what that one looks like yeah the Mark Ruffalo Hulk is the best Hulk yeah that's it right there come a little more realistic a little more but I mean it's obviously it's still a Hulk go full screen Jesus Christ yeah that's dope yeah if that thing hops into the Octagon brock lesnar good luck yeah if your whole thing is that you're big and strong and that's a big part of what Brock Lesnar's thing is he's big and strong it's his only thing yeah I mean he's like the Hulk of UFC fighters what are you gonna Mighty Mouse gonna move around him that's real real well that was the The Ed Norton one the opening scene when he fuckin ha oh that does look yeah it looks dope its teeth are fucked if we can figure if they can figure out a way to do that to people the world's gonna be a totally different place it's not far away look let's think of what they could do with steroids like did you ever see that guy who just died rich Piana his name is he's a famous internet bodybuilder oh yes I saw my gold a bunch time nicest guy ever very nice guy his arms are as big as my entire torso look at the size this fucker he just died and I think they suspect painkillers did a man I mean I can't imagine stories didn't have some sort of play in the death of this man that could've very well have but they were suspecting paint yours apparently all the big cycles that he did were like a long time ago and he doesn't really do those big cycles anymore but he is so preposterous look at that photo right there there is so preposterous look at the size of his arm it's like he's got a person that's head is attached to his shoulder get his thing and the person's like holding their body like this is his bicep was a person's body with their arms crossed it's like the three of arms put together in here he's enormous or was I should say right now but yeah you he gonna coma or something I don't know look at a picture there him in this giant dude what what is that natural bodybuilder what what are you saying natural bodybuilder Mike O'Hearn thanks Michael opens up steroid wasn't whatever means that bodybuilding calm people did super into that shit muscle okay that if that guy is real if that's a real natural body bowl or not we need to find out what he's eating and let's see if he passes the Golden Snitch test yeah he's natural on steroids he's just he's just clean the day of the competition probably why would you not you you're not hurting anybody he's shred City's own natural body builder well it's got to be possible to get a certain size just show some Jeanette for like the biggest freaks I know are genetically look my friend Klopp t-bo's fucking shredded naturally be those guys are but that's judge will leave that picture of him with a six-pack of him go back who the picture him look at that come on son that dudes Jax if that is natural 100% natural that's insane genetics they'd be the most insane genetics I've ever seen and I'd be willing to bet my life on it he has something run through the system but is it possible to be built like that with nothing else than genetics and hard work what do you think Joe I say no not that well I want to say no but I think that tyron woodley could probably look like that that guy six four sir I don't mean like the height I mean if Tyrone would you look at like tyrants body yeah I'm tired let's act like naturally jacked like gives superior genetic look at this Jack's on the left though that's him yes so he wasn't born like that you know I'm saying to neckli partying back then but look at any picture of Woodley average Joe read it jacked subway every day and be transits in Ghana here's another one some people have substantial black guys but there's got to be natural body builders that are jacked I had a friend I don't de Brian Frazier friend of mine from Boston who was a stand-up comedian who was Jack it was huge but was he thick and tall yes no he wasn't that tall he was like maybe he's 510 or 511 but like soup at the time super jacked like giant muscles and I know for a fact he never did anything no he didn't I'm telling you I know the guy very well didn't do shit but like I know that Rowe bodybuilding he's up BC trains for doom he trains a lot of these guys to name some Mike safai trains out of interesting Silva's Jim are used to I think he's training out training out of Henry Gracie's gym and he's a natural body builder he competes and he is fucking shredded he's big no he's just he's like thin like strong hmm yeah there is yeah that's reddit now that's totally possible to do naturally she's all natural enough for a fact it can totally be done his whole family's like that his brothers his sister like they're all built that same way totally can be done the question is can you do what the other guy looks like no that's different I should say no because he no cuz my like Klopp my buddy clap he's 66 to 70 if he and heats like shit and he's jacked and shredded if he got on like a regular diet like a strict like Kido yeah I'm sure he'd aleni out even more and if he got obsessed with lifting like he was lifting every day Moochie is several times a day yeah I like it was his job yeah like this possible they just you'd have to be a freak of all freaks it's like girls with giant natural tits like whoa where'd that come from like there they do exist god bless them yeah guys with huge hogs they exist do they ever [Laughter] people big noses am i right right right yeah girls love a guy with a big nose they eat their pussy from a heart some chest love a big nose that's why to restrain they want to back their ass knows they want nose in the ass mouth on the pussy that's what they want you think that's why they love a big just have a bit about it it's called doing the pigeon I think that's what it is I don't know for sure but as much as a girl I can't have a huge nose no it doesn't help doesn't help no like Cyrano de Bergerac back with her head like leaning over backwards mmm that nose could be like a taint rub all right that bird oh that birds horrible due to that video that I put on my Instagram with his bird fucking up his chick a woodpecker finds these chicks in this bird nest and just starts jacking a man god damn horrifying is that is that woodpecker woodpecker crime or is that it like a pigeon he's four I think that's just another birds birds he ate his brain see if he could figure it out and that fucking chick can't do anything it's just getting literally stabbed in the head repeatedly by a woodpecker oh my god fuck woodpeckers yeah man people we have a weird idea what nature is and you need to see things like that like this is a great website Instagram page nature is metal is that the one that I was at what i retweeted nature's method is nature's metal it's one of my favorite I go to that every day nature's metal is crazy it's all clips of shit getting jacked everything is crocodiles jack and gazelles and hippos jack and crocodiles and crocodiles Jack and other crap it's an otter going ham on a croc that's an alligator but yeah otters are ruthless bro if an otter thinks that it leave that thing it's a fucking hawk tearing apart another bird holy food nature is metal let me see even though I'm not sold yet there's one of a lion yeah look at that crocodile oh Jesus Christ look at that one crocodile with another crocodile in its mouth doing a crocodile roll winging it through the air by its head and ripping his face off just they they're fucking ruthless go go go friends take noted friends professional friends look at that fucking look at that teeth on that thing do you see that read that reporter he was surfing with his friends in Sri Lanka last night got eaten alive by a crocodile oh great you know what you go watch his hand that crack was like oh cool story reporter got him well the reporters you know the guy his job was a reporter he was out in Sri Lanka just vacationing surfboarding and a saltwater croc got his ass goddamn saltwater crocs was terrifying look at that Wow god I'm gonna the one up top where the deer got jacked by a tree look at that palm tree dropped on his head the tree just fell on his head what are the odds not good it's a terrible way to go terrible way to go just landed right on his head how the fuck does that only have 159 likes cuz now we will talk about it get more likes it's about to blow up probably at 17,000 feet just gonna blow it sure nature is metal and then underscore but go go further down there's some fucking crazy ones on that page I go to the shit every day I'm gonna follow it now yeah there's a lot I got that Hawks about the fucked up that snake there leave that one yeah go go back please look at this one with this crocodile right here the mouth open with a zebra head his mouth look at that you know what people say bread people said send me these all time because when I was leaving Fox I said I'm a zebra I know wait you ever seen anyone fucking ride a zebra you can't I'm a zebra people are like really then they sent me these all the time look at the mouth on that thing that is a fucking dinosaur that's a dinosaur that zebra is fucking I'm not met his set of his teeth either than that but he's obviously older right like that's an old I mean they stock their teeth up pretty quick they probably don't live that long I mean I would assume that zebras much like any other animal that lives in the wild you know they if you you know you can get to 10 years congratulations you did something amazing you're killing the game but those zebras if you're like looking at their about to Jack that mouth that's a metaphor for life like this licensing picture the zebra stripes those are designed so that a lion has a hard time picking out one individual animal is that why they do it always think together in the herd you can't tell if you look at him I always wonder that cuz to me they would stick out being black and white in the goddamn desert no Africa this is one of the things they did they put a collar on a zebra to track them and every time they would do it that was ebrill get killed how because they could see it because they could see it it would stand out I can see that collar like that's the one see that there's a pattern that they use for camo that this company called first light they make like the if not the best one of the best hunting gears in the world it's like they make this like really fine merino wool clothes that they put camo patterns on and they when you sweat in merino wool it's like really good because you never get cold it kills your body it's a natural fibre but anyway they have this one pattern that used called a Sat ASAT all season all terrain and in a way it kind of mimics what you see in a zebra so like what a zebra is like you can't make out the outline oh yeah the blacks and the whites the contrast it's like you have a hard time for an animal and this camel is black and light this camels got a few different shades in it but the idea behind the invention of this camels like one of the first camos like most camels back in the day used to be either like army shit like photography or they would be like leaves like the actual leaves like a lot of companies started making like where it looks like photorealistic trees and patterns and stuff which kind of works kind of oh the whole I did that's ASAP so see see how that is like it breaks up looks like easy so you'll go up right up there to the jacket Jamie the jacket right there yeah that's a like kind of a ghillie suit it has all this extra phrase to it that you would use that if you were hunting turkeys because turkeys can see real good but when you're wearing that the idea is that all those stripes break up your outline that's the exact same reason why a zebra has that shit I did not know that I always wanted that I always wanted it - that's so it yeah have you seen the new bodysuits threw in the water for sharks so the suits yeah have you seen those yeah you saying so the sharks can't see your electrical signal no it's for sharks that they so they don't think you're a seal Oh what does it do is a different color yeah it's uh more black and white for look at them there's this thing called hex HECS and they're these suits that people wear in particular when they go to is this it Jamie what is this carbon full sleeve wetsuit now that's just pretty now if you go to let me show you right a fish I'd fuck you up yeah you look like a sweet ass delicious to go to a hex suit HECS so i don't know if this is real so this is one of the things that i want to just write hex suit HECS suit i would love people yeah hex suit i would love people to tell me whether or not this really works because apparently your body is supposed to emit some sort of electric electrical signal and if you run your body over this thing it doesn't it registers your body's electrical signal but if you put this hex suit on and run your body over this thing it doesn't register does that prove that it's really working like that's chill Turkey I don't know please that guy's in shape I mean but it works apparently like noticeably works in the water like this guys what he's doing here it's just fucking no no no you can't they try to get the fuck away from you with this hex suit on they've shown the difference between wearing it and not wearing it and it seems to Allah see this I'm not impressed with because he's about to shoot this animal that animal can't see him anybody could do that I could do that with like clothes on if the animal can't supply doesn't matter yeah but the animal doesn't see you it doesn't matter but if the animal sees you the idea is that this heck suit is supposed to somehow another protect you they shouldn't have shown that one because that video didn't mean anything it's like you couldn't see that the animal was looking his way it was interesting though see it shows like go back a little bit so watch it shows when they walk in front no you just had its leave it alone go back they're kind of sure okay man watch see he's passing in front of it and without hacks you see how it registers now with the hex Sudan it registers very little again this is somehow or another supposed to be read recognising the electrical signal that your body has they so badly want you physics thanks Iran did you get your piss on some pizza see this doesn't impress me that's a fucking armadillo house want anyone you know anyone that has one John Dudley he believes in it that's why I'm curious about it because I don't know how much there's John Dudley write down hex testimonial I just don't know how much science is behind it I mean a lot of times you want to believe that things work and I think he kind of it works with coyotes - that's the weird one coyotes like walk right up to people that are wearing it the idea is that animals might have certain senses and ability to detect signals that you give off that we just don't possess so because we don't possess those those abilities to recognize those signals we don't recognize that these animals do because we don't think of it as an option and what they're saying is it's entirely possible especially with predators apparently entirely possible that animals emit some sort of an electrical signal that animals are attracted to and then when they see this person wearing this hex suit those signals don't come through and they don't know what the fuck you are which is really fascinating see electromagnetic signal right is I would it saying yeah I don't know how much of it is real though like I've never I've never seen a study on it do they have Studies on this like do that when you go up there when it says proof do they have a proof thing if you go to the top I would like how it works yeah how does it work there's no like oh yeah see I feel like hex blocks the electrical signal okay seems to block that the real question to me is do the animals see it yeah they've done a extensive extensive Studies on what animals do and don't see as far as camouflage and I think one of the ways they've done that and what kind of light they see one of the way they've done that is through like they have like dear far so they have undulates in captivity and they feed them and they only feed them if they can see certain things so they show them certain things and that's how they measure whether or not they're actually able to recognize patterns because some patterns are really good like some patterns just completely break up the outline of a person to an animal and the animal just sees some weird shit that looks like a bush sighs the mesh is crucial to effectively blocking humans Faraday cages which is the part I was just found look looking at this is the science invented in 1836 so just before a dude invented chiropractic by an English scientist Michael Faraday a Faraday cage is an enclosure made out of a conductive mesh material that blocks electrical fields by channeling the electricity through the mesh that's used to protect electronic equipment from lighting lightning strikes or in screen rooms which allows for environments to be free of electromagnetic interference that makes sense what I don't know is whether or not an animal can see that I'd like to know yeah okay why don't you Google can animals detect electrical pretty sure that energy it's why it shows those like flocks of birds floating around from what I've read it's that science I believe thinks that's how they're communicating through electrical schools of fish or magnetism magnetic magnetic waves electromagnetic waves yeah I mean it only makes sense if you watch those giant flocks of birds all flowing together that they have some sort of way of interacting with each other that we don't understand like what is it I don't know but there's something going on I mean there's no way you could ever get people to fly through the air like that I mean just I've heard people that said they're taken like the god dose of mushrooms can see it when they're like all fucked up and on the beach they can see magnetic waves coming in off waves and I've never been that high I apologize that took these words don't know this bro listen this I'll try to be cool about guitar this sweats no listen to this what happened I haven't eaten anything all day and I went to Starbucks ah you know what give me one of those nitro Bruce I need a venti and she goes we don't do ventis it's dangerous only grande went but with a nitro brew it's like it crazy kind of like think of Guinness coffee that comes out of like a tack oh it's like it's just like caveman Nitro oh came a nitro super strong might give me a venti you know I get some shit's nitrogen aided coffee yeah super strong she goes I can't give you 50 only grinding when I find just put two shots in it she goes we're not recommended I go put two shots in it so that's what I got yeah two shots in it you see that slingshot bitch would do shots in it she did that and halfway through talking about camouflage I went Oh miss Starbucks was right yeah that horn the Bell shit my pants I swear that's the closest I've ever come to shit my pants on fucking on a podcast on anything I don't shit my Panther man you don't shake your hands ever no no one Brian lied and said shit his pants because he like was later mr. show yeah hilarious don't men don't shit their pants pair pair of pants trunk and just change them would you do more class oh you did how did you clean up I just went to a gas station oh sure you did he ever makes total sense do I should I be cool and a good idea to keep a pair of pants underwear socks shoes why not pkt one small change of clothes in your trunk always a smart move I never do it right it seems like if you have a trunk what the fuck you carrying what's in your trunk you have room it's not like it's gonna cost you gas mileage just a little bag make sense that this makes sense you even shoot a hole downstairs yeah bring a whole outfit extra outfit so something terrible happens well I'll tell you right now something terrible will happen when I'm on the 405 night goddamn slingshot with no AC and my stomach's on the fritz like this why did you get that thing like what was going to give it to me for free yes that's ridiculous tupid I'm not like Oprah said hey man have this they went yeah post on of it yeah so you just have to tell people how ridiculous it is they they didn't seal I say if you want to post about whatever you want to do man we want you to happen would you take this spin around for me cool right might as well that's amazing I love the fact that it's got a stick shift yeah you need a dictated for spin I feel weird when I Drive that Corvette Corvette Convertible yeah I know no roof my cool wolf like a rock when I'm behind a truck I'm like kind of a rock spits up don't go back you know I'd always get out of the way yeah you got to be clever about how you approach like large groups of cars when you have a convertible or a motorcycle I guess that's why I like it because I'm more in tuned with what's going on like fucking I'm on it where I'm like I'm so comfortable the PDK I can wear I have a gauge yeah shit and jacking off whatever yeah it's interesting like does your car have the carplay thing or you can talk to it and tell what yaks people yeah how amazing is that ridiculous it reads the text for you and it tells you like would you like to reply and you like yes I would bitch take them back whatever you want whatever you don't need to get text anymore take some time I wonder if you get program Siri where you say bitch after everything of course bitch yes I do bitch for sure and if you don't say bitch Siri doesn't recognize I'm sorry what did you say bitch you heard me that new iPhone drops next month I'm still sword we have you seen it there's two you fucks with us oh yeah by phone yeah finally there's two new ones finally I only tried a Google phone for like a month I feel like you're on that Google trip for a second though I did while I tried to get off the Apple tit yeah I went with a Mac lap I mean a Windows laptop and I went with an Android phone command and both oh come on Sanada and the announcement for it they said something when they were shown the face ID that kind of was alarming to me that I didn't know oh yeah this ID one in 50,000 chance that someone just unlocks your phone without your fingerprint let it seem like that secure one in 50 thousands pretty goddamn secure damning pretty secure but I'd take my chance so low how many dick pics you care not know I mean they can easily get on my I have a Apple pay put on my phone so like you can get you can start using my card right away multiple coders are paying for shit will get my phone the new ones its face recognition and that's the next one says just want to see that yeah the problem with that is well wonder what and I want my worried about that I'm worried about being next to your girl and your girl sticks your phone right in your face sit up and then Israel oh look at this motherfucker Jamie Vernon with a bunch of dick pics oh that one it's the same fall asleep when she puts your thumb on there and unlock cities that's true if she tries get my face touch me when I'm asleep I will wake up immediately and choke you yeah but I just fuck you for this one he says already looking at it you have to like you have to heaven yes then she drugs you need your takes her fingers pose your eyelids back she can do it them hoes they figure it out all just to do is paint fake eyeballs on your sure you're asleep but she's got white paint it just be crazy and then she puts like black sharpie mark but it's like the most expensive phone ever no no it's like 1,200 bucks I think if you're buying it outright that's there's tiny give that spider-man look at my phone my son broke the fuck I refused to get a new one why I'm waiting for the coming out but it's interesting they're coming out with the iPhone 8 8 plus and the 10 all together at the same time it's like look you can go X you can go PO they skip the 9 it's just the x10 hold on your anniversary well Jamie it says iPhone 10 how to pronounce the new iPhone then you have Tim Cook saying we call it iPhone 10 boom hold on me if you're wrong I didn't know that so there's a 9 in it so - here's the thing you get these bullshit ass like dead spots where you don't have a screen on the name so you can fear all poor next to that person that has the 10 that has no wow oh the 8 is why I was charging - and it's waterproof now complex' you can go in the ocean with it can you know the phone yeah now it's water resistance that one's just what a little bit waterproof the new one but the new new shit water resistant swim swimming underwater picks the new one is three right iPhone 3 watch the watches the three three yeah yeah cellular added to it I like it so you don't even have to bring your phone you can go run yeah and then your girls back at home she's like I used your face to find your phone and now I'm kidding I'm your own phone to say fuck you I'm lighting your house on fire you dick pics and in son of a bitch of a bit dude I don't get down with iPhone watches not my cup of tea maybe a phone call like three seconds later you're receiving dick pics - are you taking - Andy dick wants to suck your dick really really you didn't block his number you septum you're like oh that's what I would say I want to suck a guy's dick I'd say lol come on over suck my dick you just cut it out I mean so silly how do they say if they know they're gonna suck it lol yeah if you say yeah and then they call you up and go hey don't ever fucking text me something like that again I'm sorry that's like normal but if they go lol lol it's like she's like getting wet just for you out hello you're silly it's all ice on it'll say lol lol you silly goose hoots silly stop driving over your house thing what is it about these new phones like would you really how much do you need that new phone how much you need that new screen it's like it's a trap like and that's gonna be a piece of shit in a year from now a year from now is gonna be some new thing that's everything though it puts pressure on you get the new phone cuz that's what's cool that's what's hip but they they're adding new stuff to it it's like the new car where's the fingerprint reader there isn't one just your face well you can go fuck yourself that's stupid what if I face gets beat up and us it knows learning with you because you would have been looking at that's kind of scary learning with you yeah what the fuck's up and that data is all stored somewhere and it's supposedly Jesus the Apple has my face I just thought about they could where they gonna do three or four or five years down the line when they have five years of your aging of daily multi in 20 30 40 times a day do you think it looks at kylie jenner and goes who the fuck is that guy yeah it's like I recognize girls fuckin give that kylie jenner surgery is it kylie or close which one's the one has the most highly what what is it where's the rest your jaw what's going on here you know if you knew by phone mmm every few months just to keep up with it i don't like that no fingerprint I don't I don't think I enjoy that I think that seems stupid you might love it though cuz we're just gonna take your face hold it up and pull you over they pull you over they're just here to take your phone put it up to your face all you give me your phone I want to know what you're doing well yeah you can't look at my phone oh yeah and I do that and then they can just do it like people of cops have tried to look in people's phones before they've told people to see if we're texting like they're allowed to put your finger on it they're not no yes they are they're not allowed to enter your password they're not allowed for you to ask what the password is that's why they say for people you should not use the fingerprint part because cops can actually actively use it because it's not specifically stated I do not a little yes oh I'm not allowed to tell someone you want their passwords that's an invasion of privacy you are allowed to take their finger and put it on their phone and open their phone up what the fuck exactly yeah it's like the technology moving too fast and we don't have the words in the language and the you know the preparations there's a new system built into the iOS 11 which comes out a couple days that allows you to bypass that sort of a few quick tap five times you can turn off touch ID mmm looks like it's basically what they're calling it as a cop yeah I just don't think that's the way to go the facial-recognition thing just seems corny I do this every time I want to borrow something no you just--come I can't just put my fucking thumb on it you know what it is here's the problem these cunts can't figure out a way to get your fingerprint right off your phone yet right off the main screen that's what they've been working on forever trying to get on the big screen yeah so you just touch anywhere in the screen and it picks up your fingerprint that's what they've been working on forever they do not have that yet so they went with facial recognition which they've already had for snapchat and for Instagram filters and all those things really see your face and then turn you into Abraham Lincoln or some shit way better than those but it's an acceleration of that what they haven't been able to do is get your whole screen to be a fingerprint sensor and still be able to show images all that stuff got something like six felt selfie cameras ones like IR one I am dots like the camera industry just done just tell you their use last time you saw like a straight up camera well you'd have to be like a guy was a photographer like Jamie then you carry those goofy bricks you want impress chicks you know what he's doing is just taking pictures of chicks I see them all the time they just go on like a little photo shoot date with their like girls too and to see all the time there's taking pictures of each other they don't need to hire the photographer anymore I've seen that man I was at a restaurant these two bitches just kept doing that back and forth with each other I was like ladies enjoy your meal cry and they were like now with witness iPhones yeah this is the I'm about to take a selfie face ready there's a thing that girls do with their neck that they only do when they're about to take a selfie this is it ready that that weird neck move you don't ever do that any other time except for when you're like looking at your phone you like right yeah nothing is more awkward nothing is more awkward seeing someone trying to take a selfie you ever seen that mom at the playground with a kid trying to take selfies she 40-something selfies you see like this bitch smile that's what you look like okay you just roll with it doesn't always look great you don't having a girl shrieking people buy filters this weird chicken moving check it adds chicken heads chicken heads that's where it comes from chickens be crazy it's not where it comes from but it belongs in a crew it's in the same right yeah on briella but that's a real chicken head yeah this is really this is trust me I have chickens that's what they do man there's nothing more awkward see someone's trying to take fucking selfies it's so embarrassing there's definitely more awkward shit it's more awkward if your friend is taking and you're a guy it's so how many guys take pictures like this I'm mysterious thinking about this book I'm writing I saw story about a dude who died because he's getting a dick operation what yeah he's getting fat pumped into his dick like Kim Kardashian's ass but he's a fat dick had a fucking heart attack fat went through his bloodstream somehow and his body locked up and that's a wrap and he was like 32 or some shit how old is a 30-30 30 year old relatively healthy person wanted a penile elongation and girth enhancement surgery college boy call it the girth which includes transferring fat from one area of the body and replayed he see he doesn't understand when we talk about having a fat dick no yeah it doesn't count it's like you take that literally okay like George Foreman's best man I wish I had a fish like George farm so pump fat Mickey Mouse's gloves yeah this guy fucked up man he fucked up well he definitely fucked up now he's dead hit a pulmonary fat embolism when fat traveled the blood stream to his lungs and ruptured blood vessels Christ's first case of a seemingly simple and safe procedure of penis enlargement by autologous fat transfer caused a sudden death of a healthy young man according to the report doctors believe this is the first case first of all doctors fuck you does that sounds like an ad for a dick surgery which just shouldn't get okay because you don't know what you're doing you're just making weird fucked-up dicks you're not making a bigger yeah like it's it's completely useless procedure well how about it never works in disfigures man what if you dick got fatter but the head was the same size like a big giant guy with a tiny head there's a steroid dude that there's pictures of him on the internet and his head is the size of a softball and his body is as weii as his table and is the weird it's like beetlejuice he looks like the henchman from Meyer Brothers the movie if you remember that it might be faked out it might be like one I'm so shy shrugs I love that guy just was fucking outstanding what a class what a fucking phenomenon was one of those remakes things that are happening it's like sequel do you see you know not so good I heard it's really good I love me too it's exciting last night people like Cathy see they're like you're like best movie ever I can't wait me I'm in me too I'm gonna figure it out I think we need more monster movies didn't you say that John Landis his son is remaking American Werewolf in London don't they're redoing something like so in the same vein that the Avengers exist now they're doing the monster world no that's where the mummy is cool like a Frankenstein on the mummy you're gonna they're gonna be a fucking fighting team I love origin stories first and I'm sure there's gonna be a monster mash fighters nearly drop drop that's not what I asked though I'm pretty sure John Landis his son John Landis the original director of an American Werewolf in London my favorite movie of all time of all time yeah watch this day Wow which one which one first one the real one the only one came out what year 1910 I think I've been like right out of high school 85 American we're often so he's made comments against the remake that his son is making is what Oh John Landis has made comments against his son Network what on the dick six hours ago the clarification of these comments how about you keep your mouth shut pops just let your son shine I don't do this goddamn thing 17 yeah but what if your son was like Eddie Van Halen's son and he just takes over van Halen hey fuckface ya know he starts singing he's like I'm van Halen - no no can't use the van Halen name how about I'm Mike Van Halen Van Halen band that's like I use that I'm gonna sing Panama's okay hot for teacher the script process right now he's writing the script and it might get made so it's not even Oh dad tweakin someone pry ask them it's a ways to go blog about it and spread know what year was American Werewolf in London made let's guess I want to say 90 i'll say 90 no 87 I'll say 92 I'm saying 7 ah way off but then that's another one like a more current one right oh yeah I'm Eric Amaro from Paris was dead so I'm thinking but I had that hot French girl yes oddly hot see when you said that your favorite movie I completely judge you because I was based on that cuz that's what I'm terrible that's so bad but that girl was in an amazing movie that nobody's ever heard of called killing Zoey Missy came out right around the time that see pulp fiction was made by Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avery a lot of people forgot about Roger Avery Roger Avery was a brilliant brilliant screenwriter a really interesting guy and he went to jail for like a drunk driving accident on the PCH in Malibu like serious stuff and he was actually tweeting from jail for a while yeah it was way way way back in the day yeah Julie Delpy but Roger Avery was tweeting from jail like really interesting shit and one of the things that came out of that was that Quentin Tarantino you just have this rant that he did about Top Gun being like really gay any kid in some movie but apparently stolen straight up from Roger Avery oh really yes did his bit Roger Avery had like mapped it all out oh fuck and Terrance you know just gank this hook it yeah and did it in a movie did it in a movie yeah yeah yeah that's the word but the Roger Avery movie killing Zoe is with that girl Julie Delpy and it's excellent it's really good it's a crazy like drama drama crime drama movie quinton t no can't-miss fuckin kills it dick you smells it yeah it's a bummer than when you hear like that he stole Roger Avery's Top Gun thing I would like to hear his story like maybe Roger Avery says he stole it but maybe him and Quentin and Roger Avery came up with it together maybe they're drunk like going back and forth yeah yeah and then maybe Quentin just Reb I know people have done that before Doug Stanhope has had a problem with that well he has guys opening with him and he'll be on the road they'll go to a diner and he Doug will be riffing about something and they will do it on stage the next day because they don't think it's a bit it's like they're getting in under the wire Tarantino and screenwriter Roger Avery which who me pen pal fishing that's what I'll just read by them was originally written yeah this but let's see if he says that for a separate feature while it's compelling the theory airs on one I was just the thing about him in it no this is just about the theory itself and then this mention isn't hemp them together writing it while it's compelling the theory airs on one key aspect that duo argue that Top Gun is subvert on a mass level but Tony Scott did not set out to make Starship Troopers much of its homoeroticism was happenstance okay that's just I'm just showing you that and said that they wrote it together here and this right but find out but now that find out if that's true like find out if Roger Avery says Quentin Tarantino stole that idea from him so Stanhope will be at a restaurant legal laughs hanging out whatever riffing has a couple cocktails and I'm riffing with his opening acts this is a long time ago but he had a real issue with it and those guys would wind up doing his riffs on stage like it was their own and I don't think he wanted to say anything chunky was all pissed off it's like fuck man I can't even rant around you guys damn cuz that's like unspoken shit not even unspoken it's like you can't do that but stealing that's the yeah and the guy like Stanhope rather that's how he formulates ideas he bounces him off friends if he can't bounce them off you because you're just full of shit these concepts does happen though you know sometimes even this day and age though cuz you found out so fast yep that's like John Jones people still do it people still cheat they try you need a cop though in common with the phenomenon hang out in the back and you say something funny and then a week goes by and some guy goes up and does the same thing that you said comedy fucked comedies way easier to do that with and say cheating with steroids hotter person is what steroids the thing with steroids is you could test it the thing with comedy is you could say I thought of it - okay well Top Gun does seem gay think about it you know I mean Val Kilmer's face is all sweaty and smooth shaven he's got this like gay fuck boy haircut him and Tom Cruise look at each other Tom Cruise gets man rides off on its motorbike cuz he's dangerous dangerous people but fuck okay yeah they do but fuck that doing crazy hair got slippery shiny smooth face he comes out of the shower at Avalon look into each other's eyes play volleyball yeah I mean it's not out of the possibilities that you could come up with that too if you just watched it you like yo dude is it me or is this a gay movie you saying that that seems like a tongue and we would be how like it is gay look the woman with the fucking woods a woman's name I forget the woman who plays his girl Kelly something press plays his female love interest she was probably like what is going on here who wrote it yeah it's like ah the gay boy in the corner literally like that's what it is like he's struggling with his true nature I mean that's something that anybody could come up with but the question is did Roger Avery come up with it and did quit antenna Tarantino steal it because you know Quentin Tarantino has been accused before of using the plot lines from a bunch of real classic Japanese movies for his films oh yeah yeah like um hey played and she I don't know about that one but I think that was the thing with Reservoir Dogs I think Reservoir Dogs was essentially almost like a tribute of a classic Japanese gangster movie I didn't know that yeah see that's true we would like to other people Google concepts that takes a lot of whatever yeah influences he'll call it but right it's like beggar Eckstein scene-stealing order right which is why someone would probably accuse him of doing this with the Roger Avery only line you ever see Rodrigo to see if you could find Roger Avery tweets from prison it's fascinating because he was in jail and somehow another was able to tweet I don't know how he was pulling it off but they found out about it after a while and they can that Candice Shay well Twitter's been out around how long enough that long seven years yeah shit mmm and this was the beginning days of Twitter when hardly any was know any pulp fiction writer tweets on life in prison look at his face there who shit there January was that say 2008 for drunk driving yeah so he was quite a few years after it started sickness spread throughout the facility like bushfires and it was great stuff man I remember reading it is really interesting stuff so you could find it it doubt you wouldn't even think about that like right like a sickness spreading through the place like a bushfire made amazing that my fuck was a poet with his words well he's a brilliant writer yeah and that's why that movie killing Zoey which is his movie did he what else did he make underrated Starship Troopers it said no I don't think that was him I think that was someone else they were just talking about the homo Rasta versus Quentin Tarantino's of attraction I think was the one big one he made to jammer then yeah bunch of fucked-up shit happening in that movie he's got a weird mind for sure gonna have to be yeah that's right Beowulf that was a crazy movie man it was like a you're watching a live video game oh yeah bale off his widow Silent Hill all right yeah Beowulf was like they did it CGI but not realistic remember that well kids start off as a video game right no real fable it's a it's an old old old story and they used back when Angelina Jolie that's when she hypnotized Brad Pitt God was - drinking adopting random trash yeah she cracked that dude she cracks them all that's a black widow right there boy Billy Bob Thornton Maxim Maxim that Billy Bob Thornton longer blood around her neck you're both wearing each other's blood crazy yeah she was wrecking them back then was just too powerful an attraction those lips - yeah that happen world how the world that believes weird yeah I don't know she was the tiger and Panda mm no you know killing the game yeah but it's um that Beowulf movie was fun because it was like animated but like they use people's faces so it was like kind of close but you knew it wasn't real it's real weird I don't know if you could pull that off today you could was good yeah it was a fun movie it was good like that movie I guess the avatar is a little bit of that now because avatar the people look like people in this movie nobody looks like a person yeah but the avatars look they they do look like aliens but they still have the same kind of quality yeah like you can tell it's the actor yeah that's true but it looks a lot better than this shit wait that's also because it's not a person see that's the sneaky trick about CGI is gie works best on something that's not real we have nothing to base it on exactly yeah that's why CGI so bad with animals like when you see like those wolves in the Game of Thrones like that's not really although Jungle Book said what up it's not bad pretty good pretty good pretty fuss getting way better for sure I better it's like it's at the edge of what they call the uncanny valley you know the uncanny valley is it's like the gap between something that looks hyper realistic and something looks totally fake yeah it's like you get to this point where like wow almost it's real close but then you can't tell mm-hmm wish I could stop clearing my throat try not to throw expect off you getting mad no it's a weed smoked weed for this podcast I'll take that right throat problem over shitting my pants I'm worried for that slingshot I just I'll just light that bathroom up one more time you don't want to get on that PCH and start spraying people behind you when that ocean wind hits you you're driving in your car and just shit splatters on your windshield oh you should have like more so you should have my fucking pores are we in problems if you or we're in that slingshot and yours diarrhea just flying out of your ass and you maybe have beaver fever you know beaver fever is a fever is when people drink water they get guard like out of the ground like a creek water you get Giardia it's from beavers shitting in the water like literally you're getting bacteria Giardia literally comes from animal shit like I got beer Aviva from this but when you get it you're like hurting play catch it much I just can't believe you haven't shit your pants before ever I mean when I was a kid man was coming in here just now I was coming home from a fear factor once when I filled my pants up like like one I'm glad hefty bag Parker will use throw some baton there something I just couldn't hold it in I was like Jesus Jesus power you remember did you shit your Supra no that was passed down five you just let these lines I didn't want to I don't remember the exact specifics but I do absolutely remember failing my underwear was shit I just couldn't maybe I was stuck in traffic I don't remember the specific for sure it was so bad over here you go fuck it it's right it was no I didn't have a but there was no argument on my part I really didn't have the willpower there's nothing there that could stop this routine place it was just gonna take place this levels to everything bro there's diarrhea cream in it certain levels of diarrhea well like you listen I don't care how much finger workouts you've been doing yeah yeah that thing's coming do you think I would imagine like but it's probably get really like you know girls do like Kegel exercises Kegel exercises to me it's like man who's got that is that muscle even devoutly you're at a long road ahead of you tiny man that bad baby yeah that's possible it is like Russian chicks can carry weight ah there's a woman from Russia it has a tendency she has like the world record it's like 70 kilos with her pussy Jesus Christ now they put like a golf ball on the end of a rope and attach it to a kettlebell boys in case dubs that golf ball or pussy just sit down carries that weight around I don't want that but your butt would be way easier to clamp down but I don't care who you are if you had the diarrhea that day it's coming out I'm telling you right now if you get a nitro brew with extra shots you going sizzler in your pants how to do but kegels hmm we go here we go what is this what is the way what's the website we're dealing with here luxury spot is it a girl website problem but Kiehl's channels so what they are and how to do them get larger please let me read this what no no larger yeah there we go why do but kegels kegels are designed to tighten the-- Wow look at this word pu b OC OC c kaki YG e us kaki GS muscles your asshole the PC muscles are used for two things clenching your anus and controlling the flow of urine anytime you stop yourself midstream at the urinal these are the PC muscles at work well my shits working overtime right now my my my anus clenching skills I'm like Cain Velasquez but I've I stand with her women with strong PC muscles tend to have tighter stronger vaginas which often means stronger contractions during orgasms if you know anything about orgasms you know that stronger is always better at all caps if you know anything about orgasms that's not a very technical way to write men on the other hand use the PC muscles to stop their urine mid flow but also to stop urine from coming out in the first place when you feel the need to use the bathroom but have to hold it thanks to a long line those are the PC muscles doing the work so you're clenching your pc muscles so you can stop your flow of piss or you're tightening up your asshole oh you will be able to clench to stop gas from passing through your anus to hold your waist until you reach a toilet and even to eliminate waste more efficiently be supportive be better at getting butt-fucked that tight down how about why did he leave that out there you talking about for women but kegels is an exercise that they use for tightening your vagina to enhance intercourse so you're calling it kegels and you're saying do I'm doing it to stop shitting myself how often is this taking place maybe you should reconsider your diet before you sit around like an asshole just clenching your butt all day well I wish I did those exercises last night on well now and then he would be fatigued you want to do them like two weeks be friends or started out got a pill time I expect this though got a buildup I did my run today and I went harder and stronger than I've ever done it before I still suck at it since what I thought Saul Hills you know I'm doing this doing two miles and it's like a very steep hills day but I'm can do it longer just I know I suck at it still but when you know that you make it just like a little bit of a yes just a little bit of progress you know that's the same thing with but kegels you can't just I've been doing this to go back rabbit running for a long time right I've been running from not a long test you'll run with their modern shoes not today today I didn't because I've been I've been hunting with these things these Solomons don't have laces on him no like velcro older kids they pulled tight with like a chord and then slides down the cord tucks into the mouth you shoot very easy to tighten up when you're in the field after in the field enough time to issue but I like the Vibram FiveFingers better but I wanted to get a real hard running today and yeah I have to be more careful where I step when I wear those five fingers shows I can just go reckless hard full out with these things on I'll step anywhere it doesn't matter so you can get a better workout yeah because with the Vibrams if I hit a sharp rock I'm kind of fucked with this I'm not even feeling that shit with these things I can run over pretty much anything but I think for control it's almost 2 o'clock I want fucks with my speedster muscles or what I was oh you know you like you know it looks like a cup ride at Disney well you think that thing is spinning you kind of going too fast like Oh me I don't be the first guy to shit his pants like like me and cam Haynes and our kids got him one of them teacup things and with me and him going full clip I mean full clip I don't know how found there's a limitation on how fast those things go but it ain't getting any faster we got it was so ridiculous we were spinning so fast you're sick Oh totally sick dude my youngest my 7 year old is fucking nuts she loves to go on those things fast like there's a carousel at the mall it's actually way faster than Walt Disney Land really yeah they have a teacup thing on there and you're right down the street the panga mall you grab that fucking steering wheel start whipping around it goes so fast your head is like you're holding your you have to use all your muscles to keep your head from just that's what you look like right here you like that's like yeah it's the same things like you're on a teacup like I really good job in that spinning dude just stick your asshole up in the air when you get on the highway when you come over the crest of the 405 and you get that big long hill just pull your pants down lift your ass in the air yeah that's not I'm taking Topanga Canyon Sedona sees me shit that slingshot Cowan has a great story about being either girl once like many many moons ago and he was going on a hike with her and he had a shit and so he came up with I hear something any like made a game out of it they ran and shit and she thought it was really funny you know she's like what are you doing nothing I heard something I thought no big deal I'm just sure that we're safe and then they were kept hiking and he's like oh my god I have to shit again and then he ran away again and there's and she's like what are you doing that she realized he was life it is a weird thing man like you know it's an inefficiency of the body like breaking everything down but not this stuff get it out of here your body's like this not good man get it happen yeah I wonder if I click hot lava if that's a good is that a good design yes the animal is there any animal like or plant there's a plant do that like the plant takes things in but the plant doesn't shit anything out right putting it through the waste does it it gets rid of Cronin kids heard of oxygen it processes carbon carbon dioxide and turns it into oxygen but it's not waste that's like us we breathe out carbon dioxide I wouldn't necessarily say it's waste it's just we're transferring or a tree if that carbon dioxide was in your body you'd die right so we're getting rid of it no no it doesn't kill you yeah obviously you're making it you're pushing it out you just don't want to have too much yeah but do you know that the the air is not really mostly oxygen do you know what most of the air is nitrogen nitrogen like a massive percentage of it I think it's in like the high 80s right say 68 % like that let's find out but the plants just turns it into carbon dioxide that's there that's it yeah that's all they do that's amazing like Canada so they're what they're getting out of the water and out of the soil they figure out a way to use but say what percentage of the air is nitrogen I really want to say it's in the 80s but I don't know just making it up you know they pull nitrogen out of the air and use it for fertilizer 88-78 the guy that's high it's a lot that's mostly nitrogen that's crazy we would think of the air is mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide sure that's taught in school but uh all the other animals live in organisms may besides plants release the ways yes we do yeah every other mammal fish they all do it you know what's crazy is that the there's nitrogen around us all the time and a dude figured out how to extract that nitrogen out of the air and use it for fertilizer and that's why there's so many people on the earth today there's a guy named fritz haber and he made something called the haba method of extracting nitrogen he did it like in World War one the genius he also created Zyklon a which is the shit that they use a change agent a know the stuff that they they gassed the Jews with fucking but he didn't mean to my yams no he made Zaycon a which had a scent to it and then they were because so you could tell when I was there to get away from it and they removed the scent and created zyklon-b and that's what they used the gas that Jews in the gas man crazy and he was Jewish more fucked up so he was there during World War one and then when World War two was happening that's when he had to leave Germany and one of dying of a heart attack yeah crazy shit man he was he was also this was like the nuttiest thing about harbor at the time he was receiving a nobel prize for creating the Habra method of extracting nitrogen out of the atmosphere rightfully so he also was wanted for crimes against humanity because he was gassing the the British and Canadian I think it was troops like when they first started he was like for the first guy that initiated a gas attack Jesus Christ crazy so this guy that's responsible the nitrogen from the harbor method is responsible for some insane percentage of the nitrogen that's in people's bodies it comes from food like they think it's something around like half like half of the nitrogen that you have in your body from food it was a direct result of them extracting it out of the air with the harbor method which is like what and this is the same guy that was gassing Allied forces and this is the same guy that created this Zyklon a which eventually became zyklon-b they used to gas the Jews brilliant brilliant dude but nuts his wife apparently shot herself in front of him because she like she disagreed with who knows what the whole thing was but what he was doing and he was off to war and all this thing so in front of him he shot herself he left his dying wife with his 13 year old son said see you gotta go to war he's a terrible person who knows I mean really who knows what the actual circumstances were you know like I guess you'd have to get like all the variables what why he left the son might have had other people to watch out for him he could he had no option other than to leave of they were kill to drop him off at a friend's house with God's sakes I don't know what the kid was with somebody or not is my point but that's the story behind it is this one brilliant guy that figured out a way to extract jujin became this fucking moderator of a monster yeah but also the reason why I mean maybe somebody would have figured it out eventually but he's the reason why they were able to do that during world war watch you think someone eventually came on and figure it out yeah does that stay with much things with most things I think that was the case like with the invention of the light bulb I think there was a bunch of people that were working on at the same time and the vention of I think the telephone was the same thing radio was the same thing there's always like all most inventions like we're talking about that chip they sort of rewires your DNA there's always these inventions that open up the possibility of other inventions and then the technology that allows for an invention like that gets analyzed by a bunch of different people so there's a you know it's always one of those things where anytime something happens today there's a network it's very rare that one person figures one thing out that nobody ever saw before it's like there's a network of inventions and innovation yeah because you need machines for sure and computers and all these different things that other people have created that allow you to do the calculations to invent something new so all it feeds off of all of it and then isn't it the best kind of sometimes the best marketer best talker they get the notoriety for it so sometimes yeah sometimes just like fighting right full circle so before we end this Canelo or Gennady golovkin oh my god what a fucking fight well you ladies Mexicans you got a move route for Canelo otherwise and they're from the same town Lara I'm rooting for Canelo I'm rooting for a good performance Brennan Chavez that's what I do that's what you do I do I have to none but this case yep what cuz I want to see what happens I'm I want to see what happens I know I'm gonna have like a guy I want to win like if Jeannie triple G wins I'm not gonna be bummed out no I just want to kiss fight exactly I want to see what happens but I'm that guy I don't see either guy lose hmm like I like both of them on my father cause I don't wanna kind of loose I don't anyone to have that L that way oh yeah with that little kid punched that guy in the deck that's his son punched that guy in the dick Billy Joe Saunders he's a great following kid on the fucking look he gets on the scale oh my guys like no don't do that dude and sad look at this he's flexing kids on the scale and he just like what's up little man and he punched him indicate and he kicked him that's so fucked up that's such a bad look well it's so stupid that they let that little kid be there what if he punched that kid right in the face shut the fuck up at least slap him if he kicked him be good to good to go Thai boxing Starbucks says shots she's fucking right yeah you can't add extra shots to a caveman night relationship taped her tape Fletcher can consume he can throw that caveman nitro down like it's water let's just wrap this up before you shoot yourself I'm gonna throw up and shit myself what do you think's going on here not good this is my prediction I think if triple G doesn't stop them Canella wins the decision the public's piss because you all look at the politics of it Golden Boy sighs II Canelo wait a minute you saying if triple G hold the music please you saying of triple G out boxes and we won't get the decision nope boxing for you I think you would because I think it sets up the rematch I think you're emotional matter what even if it gives decisions laws no one gets stopped so you really think that if triple G puts on a show an out box you know how would you like for like ten rounds which I don't think you will I think if it's even close like let's say it's like seven to six something like some crazy you know yeah my concern with Canelo is that he might not have the endurance for a prolonged firefight and you think triple G does because you got against Jacobs pretty tight against Jacobs no that was a goddamn firefight as well and come on fight yes I don't think it's close I thought he won the fight I'll give it toes of close yeah Jacobs completely different fighting the canal just II just watch that the other day great fight I forgot how good it was Jacobs was a motherfucker clear some space on my DVR so I was deleting some boxing match that goes it's a certain thing like why do I have a hundred Ted Nugent spirit of the wild safety yeah so I got to that fight I said let me watch this again cuz this triple G fights coming up this weekend that was it Jacob's can fight his ass off that was a great fight toughest fight for triple G though he's over the hill like No Jacob's just Lud yet and completely different violent Canelo his footwork it makes me wish Terence Crawford was just a little bigger I know he's about 45 now go up to 47 he was to fight Pacquiao yeah but I wish she was like 160 you know me too cuz yeah thin fella you know but I just don't all I think part of like his style is like he's built perfect for the way he fights yeah you know that's perfect endurance if you put more weight on him he probably weighed down a little bit slow him down like he that he's definitely in his zone but forty forty seven yeah that's the right way o'clock since I'm a killer here man cuz that's now they have anti Joshua he's fighting and then you have a JIT Goliath heavyweight champion built like a statue looks like a Greek god yeah and then you know well like really well spoken super polite Under Armour and British guy yeah and then you got yeah wild or Deontay Wilder fighting uh fucking what's the name the fucking Cuban killer oh yeah King Kong yes yes fighting him yeah I think it's a rough fight for yes I think it's a bad idea ya know the winners of each of those will fight yeah it's good time for boxing but tomorrow's the big one tomorrow's the big one tomorrow like really can't wait shows who the superstar boxing is cuz Loma chenko I think is like one of the most skillful guys ever but he's not being challenged there's not like a lot of drawl well there's also not a guy in his division that stands out as being the guy who has to fight he's like Mighty Mouse yeah whereas like Canelo and triple G's the fight that everybody's want to see for a while I think you'll get a true legend elbow up who knows who knows how it plays out I can't wait though yeah I wonder I really wonder what's gonna happen I'm super fascinated me too and then you also have what do you think about David branch versus Luke Rockhold tomorrow somebody I haven't seen it myself people are like hey have you seen Rock Hall at Wayne's doesn't look the same but Wayans they had Wayne's yesterday Oh yesterday it wins yeah oh I thought when you're saying at weigh-ins I was thinking like other wins like what wins oh yeah forgot this today yeah weights today the fights tomorrow though Wayne's were today yeah yeah and people were complaining about it nobody get a picture of Luke Rockhold from today's weigh-in yeah I mean Luke's at it you could argue is the best middleweight in the world you know yet that laughs can you argue with that if Michael Bisping knocked him out we hear me out there you could say he's not because Michael Bisping is the real champ but he got caught by Bisbing right but before that Luke Rockhold is a motherfucker Hector Lombard back did you hear that a Thiago Alves had a back out okay big guy was that what it is cuz of a hurricane yeah there's nothing wrong with Rockhold he looks fine the thinnest I've ever seen him talking shit to each other rock coal should don't want to hear what they were saying man oh listen David branch don't joke dude don't get confused if Rockhold fuck's up and gets clipped by branch what is it what are they saying to each other they know vol branch would talk and shit for a while or nothing yes you can hear old verses the ninth ranked David Wright that's anak break you up break you up son I'm not fine it's I was a great shit talking break you up son I mean I'm gonna break you off son this would be funny but they all up in that what does that mean what exactly it is that we're gonna want to fight right you know that so what do you do you break me out you're gonna break me I mean what I mean Luke's been gone for a while it branches a tough customer and he's a former world champion World Series fighting it light heavyweight middleweight but if you're not in the Aussie I don't give a fuck you're not fighting the same guys do grab hold fire well he fought rumble anyone went to a decision and a decision to rumble in World Series a light heavyweight yeah that's rubble World Series he was scaring a world beater wasn't a long ago cuz it was it del rumble in the UFC also Dave branch had his run in the UFC before that series not good he knows the world series of fighting does work well Gerald Harris Kayode him with a slam in his first fight for example yeah and then he lost to someone he'd see like it depends like how focused motivated very skillful he's very skilled for his ground games very good talk about branch or uncle branch I think I'm the ground ridin man see you can't say underrated cuz he's under way cuz he's fighting playing grab-ass some world series of fighting it's not even close to them you're talking about wmba compared to NBA I just think he's very talented and if Rocco doesn't take him seriously the same way it didn't take Bisping seriously he'd get fucked up 100% Brock there's a lot of pressure on Ronald because he's been gone for a while you know he needs he needs this win my the only way I think Rocco gets fucked up is again yeah if you didn't think I'm serious yes and if you know if his heart's not in it yes if a game rock cold shows up a game David branch shows up Rocco destroys him you know what rock I could see Rocklin even submitting him underrated with his top position most top games start having a fucking tree on you his jiu-jitsu is ridiculous very ridiculous you look at the lyoto machida fight beat the shit out of him from the top position look though like when he go wide man down when he got Weidman down you could see like why moves like shocked he submitted Bisbing with one arm yeah after headkick but no I think I think if Rockhold stand up is gonna be the difference-maker and he's got a long reach man you just gotta make sure that he doesn't fuck up and get clipped again but I want to see what happens because when a guy like Rockhold who has a lot to lose but not a lot to gain fights a guy like branch who has the golden opportunity in front of him I mean if branch can beat Rockhold just gigantic I'm a huge and I've been watching his training footage he sees training fucking hard just the question is is it hard enough has he mean is he in that kind of shape I go easy at world-class level it really never fought anybody like Rockhold other than rumble in the World Series but also with branch it's like are you gonna take the fucking governor off and go after it because his last night maybe it's just a dance partner even the world city is fine he's not Murkin guys so it's like in the UFC he's never been that you know guy everyone was afraid of Luke we'll take the governor off and kick you in the fucking face it's a very interesting fight because it's supposed to be if you looked at it on paper it would be more of a showcase fight for Rockhold Rockhold was the former champion I don't think David branch is ranked in the top five I think he's 9 yeah yeah that makes sense so it's a big opportunity for branch you know how old is branch I want to say he's like 36 can't tell buck does how dare you you such a good thing 35 yeah so it's not too old it's gonna be interesting and then Brock old is like what 30 Rocco was still pretty young I think the thing about Rockhold he meets this fight coz out - out of sight out of mind oh we can find a grip so everyone's like all right let's see it now yeah everybody remembers Bisping clipping him knocking a mountain and talking mad shit to him inside the cage after he knocked him out is this fight tonight or Saturday night tomorrow night is it for sure tomorrow you're doing a fight companion but you're not gonna be here you guys do a fuck you pain instead of I watch that Lana triple G I can't miss trip I got to see I gotta maybe I'll watch a little bit of little screens here yeah Oh we'll watch both do you want to put one of them on YouTube as well Bravo playlist the background you see power7 we'll put our k1 on one of the screen I just can't miss it man yeah this card slot that bad you know it would have been a lot better with Thiago Alves Mike Perry that would be a crazy fucking fight in there he's a monster they're both American Top Team - that's right yeah Perry's a monster but Thiago is just very skillful that's a big difference okay fine Alex Reyes stepped up mmm Alex Rios is no joke man 13 - who's Alex Reyes short notice I've seen him fight Yeah right like what kind of shape is in and can he make the weight was to say no record there it's not while they have to update it fight history alright let's wrap this fucker up good night everybody
