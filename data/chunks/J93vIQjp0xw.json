the girag and experience it's funny because the things that I thought used to be my weaknesses in this new environment are actually your biggest strength so guy was kind of deeply insecure back when I was a journalist now i'm a journalist again because the Congressional thing I think that was a little delusional on my part to think that you can jump in there and hope to have any kind of chance to be taken seriously but now that I'm back to doing journalism the things that I used to be really insecure about that I wasn't working for a TV network and didn't have you know New York Times or NBC News after my name those are actually your biggest strengths today because people go oh if this guy knows about something he's not gonna hold back yeah he's going to do the research and put it out there and the other thing that I'm not afraid to do that I think more journalists should do it's put things into perspective for people people are busy you know I said they're reading through this boring national security stuff and then I'm able to pick out what's important and tell people this matters and then sometimes people will tweet me something that seems like a really big deal and I'll debunk it I'm like actually it's problematic but it probably doesn't matter because of a B and C and people need that because there's no sense of perspective anymore you go to the home page of yahoo and it's something about Obama some huge meeting with you know Merkel and Germany and then the next line right next to it is Kim Kardashian's baby and then the line below that is that the Duggar family or the Doug are is whatever they're called that have 19 kids the reality TV whores it's them and so it fucks with your mind is like these things all equally important and these this is what's most important in the world today are these three stories and you need people who are not compromised by the system who have no paycheck coming directly from a news organization to just say yeah this is really important people should pay attention to it or this is bullshit it's just being hyped and it's not that big a deal well essentially there's always going to be a need for junk food yeah and there's going to be a need for intellectual junk food as well and much like actual and food if you offer people intellectual junk food there's a certain group of us and I lump me in there as well that will self-sabotage and they will they will eat junk food and they will have a cheeseburger and then they should really have a salad and they will watch intellectual junk food when maybe would do them better said on and read a book or to watch Nova or to you know see documentary there's sometimes you don't want to watch documentary you want to watch a bunch of assholes bid on storage space you know it does it doesn't make any fucking sense and that's that's good too like there's no reason I have to do serious stuff all day long you're right i certainly don't subscribe to that but you're a balanced person yeah and if you're an imbalance person much like people who just eat cheeseburgers you're going to have intellectual junk food 24-7 you're going to be comforted your mind will be occupied by nonsense and that's what we really need our minds are designed to be occupied by the pursuit of food sustenance and sexuality that's what we're after we're trying to find a place to rest someone to fuck something to eat keep going ready go get up in the morning are you awake okay fill the needs and now those needs are filled instead you're plugged into a fucking video game you're playing football with some digital characters and you're eating pizza that some guy actually walked up to your fucking door and bit all you do is give them some paper that means almost nothing and he gives you pizza and you're stuffing your fat face and go right back to your stupid game and it's so easy to do that it's so easy to do that as long as you can do enough to justify enough ones and zeros coming into your whatever your bank account is these days knowing the vault the vaults are filled with paper you know what's in that fuckin fault its vaults filled with paper that's promising somebody promises inside Jason what kind of car do you drive dude oh that was I don't have a car and use one of those motherfuckers I'm in New York Jesus someone here are New York you don't need own
