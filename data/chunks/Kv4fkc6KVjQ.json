the Joe Rogan experience oh fuck that's such anxiety watching this how big is that wave I don't know probably 60 feet on the face damn son oh what's that feel like right there when it's over this part is cool watch I get air on the way down oh my you'll see my board cuts completely in the air right there oh dude you are so high that is so high that wave is so giant it's like 40 feet above your head right now oh my god this gives me anxiety you know what's cool about surfing is in those moments like there's very few things in the world other than like I don't know I don't know how to relate that but um like that moment right there for me was like the pinnacle of like Who I am what I do best that moment that wave coming in at that at that minute in my life where I was in the right square foot of the ocean when that wave came in that was the best that was one of the best days in history at that surf spot Wow and I was there I was prepared I was healthy on the right board the right equipment the right energy level I wasn't sick didn't have any you know everything was just lined up and the waves are lined up and the swell was lined up and the wind was lying up and the tide was lined up and I was in a perfect spot when that wave came in do you watch that video all the time no but every time I do I remember all those things because it seemed so much so so much luck how to do with it it's just like alignment the stars aligning it almost seems like something I want to watch every day like right get get the day going you know your first kiss from a girl yeah that's what that is wow that like mind blown this is this is like an important moment in my life I need to like have this moment in time frozen that's what that is right there and so I think as an adult you very rarely have those moments left I mean I'd like a really like mind expanding mind exploding moments really holy shit this is life 100% life right now and that's that's what I think we're all chasing you know I mean those people sitting in traffic outside right now driving the freeway they're not having those moments not right then that's a real problem yeah that's a real problem with life is that people aren't having enough for those moments and when you're 75 yards away from that elk a few weeks ago and you had an hour to really think about what you're doing and where you were in your life and you know how you got to 75 yards away from this animal and the whole year of practicing on the target and all the millions of arrows you shot and all the preparation and then this thing stands up and times ticking and that moment is there for the taking and it's so easy to fuck up and it it all happens the way that you you hope to visualize it though those moments don't happen very often man anyway I got an email about the 10th to 12th of October from some lady at Snap Fitness in Shawnee Kansas saying hey kids do you know you're accidentally registered in my gym yeah and we are doing an October challenge

free range at least and a cake fuck me this somebody beat me at home you know you see me rewind it just a little bit Jamie goes um it's it was piss on me piss somebody beat me at home you know what's that what's that ho meow meow what do you think he's saying good question one more tragically sanic a fuck me piss somebody beat me at home you know you see me what we have to go through that like this is a pruder film well what do you what do you hear like a word oh-ho-ho-ho a man out gonna kick fuck me but somebody beat me at home you know right hold me now hey ho ho ho man ho a man out is one here that again maybe that's it did I K fuck me this time you beat me at home you know you could be anything hold me now oh man ladies another language oh man yeah if we were like working for the government and we're trying to decipher the tape like we have to find out where the kidnapper is being held here a train in the distance right we'd be reo experts in a room somewhere we've got it we've got it hold man out hold man out hold man out it could be or it could be I'm home I'm home here now because he gives out his address he goes inwards I'm at 23 95 and we cut it out we cut it out somebody beat me at home you know he's home now so you felt calm while it was flipping oh yeah I always well I've seen cars flip right I've seen it for years right so I know that's possible so I get in there and I got turned around at a race in 1998 I was racing at Daytona and I got turned around and the car so I'm flipping for the first time in my life and this cars like over 3,000 3,000 pounds so it's it's but it flies up in the air like it's paper man it's the craziest thing in the world it's so weightless you know and what it felt like to me because of the car rolled on its side and came down kind of on its side it felt like somebody rolled a prop wall of grass up against the car you know I'm saying when I was on my side and I could see the ground I felt like I was right side up because as you're flipping this the force pushes you down in the seat so you feel eternally it you feel gravity all the time like you're you know the cars flipping you're you're pushed into the seat so you feel Grant you feel weight of yourself in the seat that never changes you never kind of come up out of the like that you know and so it's like some rolled a prop wall of grass up against the side of the car and then against the roof and then against that side and in this you know it kept doing that and I'm like it's just the weirdest feeling and you feel completely safe you know you feel like you know nothing's gonna harm me but this and you know just you just one of the things they always talk about it's like get your hands onto something because the spinning makes your arms go like this and if you watch a lot of old wrecks from the sixties and seventies you'll see the guy's arms come flying out the window and they're just kind of flopping around they can't pull yeah it's spinning so fast you can't pull it in and your arms go like that so as soon as you know you're going upside down you grab the bottom of the steering wheel and just kind of you know watch but I flipped my pickup truck one time on Christmas Day and I wasn't holding on the steering wheel and my arm went out of the window you know for like a split second it banging around in the in the in the windowsill and I was like man you know I got it back in and grabbed a hold of steering wheel with both my hands and so ever since then I've like you know now I know like any time I'm in a crash you got to have your hands ahold of something because that's the one thing that you can't control your you're strapped in with your seat belt and everything but your arms are you know can go anywhere and in that moment when the car is rolling or barrel rolling or flipping you it's so fast like you can't your arms just go this way yeah that's the craziest thing in the world that's the only fear I guess is that your arm could get outside the window and get crushed or something cuz guys have had that happen I mean the discourse in this country is completely collapsed and I love it why do you love it though that this course is come on cuz my rights aren't up for discussion let alone a vote so whenever people sit down and have a talk about my life and freedom it's gonna end badly for me so if people can't talk to each other about this maybe we'll go our separate ways and live peacefully so you'd rather not talk about it and just go peacefully is that what you're saying yeah someone's political opinions and preferences should have as much impact in my life as their sexual preferences you want to fuck dudes you want to have a threesome I don't I care if you're my friend and that I'm interested but it's not going to impact me and it shouldn't impact me and same thing with the oh you want more welfare great go live your life that one instead of it becoming some shouting match on your front door and and exactly yeah instead of you and your buddies coming up and skin the shit out of my kids yeah I mean know what I mean very few people deserve that I was gonna say no one but very few people deserve that yeah so the disengaging from political discourse as a strategy for just overall civility but also worsening political discourse and a purpose to make it so that people can't actually form coalition's and get anything done but it is amazing how personal people take other people's opinions on things it's crazy yeah it's like the people JIT you know what it is it's like when you're dating and you think oh this this girl likes the same kind of music I do so we're going to get along that is a very weak correlation yeah and there's lots of people who are right-wing who are good people and there's lots of people who are left-wing who are good people and there's lots of people who are right-wing who are bad people there's a very weak correlation between this it's a cultural signifier you probably came from the same culture because people just take the culture of what they grew up with but if you're gonna just dismiss entire schools of thought just because they vote differently from you is it as a personal level that's you're missing out a lot of quality people perhaps Erikson did before him I don't know anyway you you you take an automatic process and you interrupted in the middle so like when you're shaking hands with somebody that's a such a familiar process that when you start you're not thinking okay I'm gonna grip this person's hand now and I'm gonna move my hand up and down with them a few times then I'll take my hand away you just kind of do it automatically and and there's something about interrupting that that leaves people really flummoxed and the will did because there really it really caught off-guard like if you imagine somebody comes up to you in the street and says it's not half-past seven you know your reaction isn't to go yeah yeah I know it's 20 past 9:00 your reaction is a sort of you you think like you've missed something like you're trying to make sense of it it's a strange kind of put you on the back foot and at that point if you if you've got somebody who's fairly suggestible and people coming up on stage it's such an odd moment for them anyway they're naturally very suggestible that a clear instruction to sleep or whatever you want to give them tends to be taken very deeply and very often then you'll see I'll shake hands and I'll break the pattern at the hand well I'll often take their hand and lift it up to their face and say sleep and show them their hand like that and they just sleep and well it's not sleep but it's a kind of it looks like I mean they they'll do anything from eyes closed head drops down to just drop like a like a dead weight on the floor you know I found this most interesting actually was I liked applying this in slightly more useful everyday situations was as a sort of like a self-defense technique I was walking between so I was like must have been like 20 or something and I was at a magic convention and I was walking from one hotel to another and I'm dressed like a three-piece velvet soon as this skinny British might as well have you know punched me in the throat tattooed across my face and this guy comes up and it's like he's drunk it's about 3:00 in the morning drunk aggressive is with his girlfriend clearly looking for a fight and he sort of he comes up to me and he says what are you what are you fucking looking at what you looking at and because I had spoken about this how to deal with this sort of thing but had never found myself in this situation I kind of had it all mentally rehearsed so I said to him I said the wall outside my house isn't four foot high and I guess there's an equivalent to this with a sort of adrenaline dump I think it's called in in martial arts but there's a it's just like he's got all this adrenaline and then a thing like that from me which is just out of context like it makes sense I'm not like talking gibberish it makes sense but it's just out of context so now suddenly he's thinking I've what I've missed something so now he he was sort of went what and I said and the girlfriend walked off and I said though the wall outside my house isn't for for hi I spent some time in Spain the walls that were very high but if you look at the ones here that they're tiny that nothing and then he just sort of broke down he's literate and start crying well you know no wasn't quite crying but it was just it was like all the adrenaline and everything just just flooded out of him and he sat down and I end up sitting next to him on the like you know on the roadside asking him you know so what I was the plan was I was gonna try and stick his feet to the floor and I had his whole plan he just kind of collapsed and sat down so I sliced his feet yeah that was because I knew it'd be like this highly suggestible stay and either way the moment of aggression and past but I ended up ended up weirdly sitting with him asking him what had happened that evening and his girlfriend it I think she'd bottled somebody or something horrible attack so he got out with all this aggression but it's it's a good wasn't it if you just have like um it could be just a song lyric or just some some weird kind of thing that you can just go into is in those situations that I mean if someone's running you with a knife it's a bit difficult but you just you you're kind of strangely taking control of a situation [Applause]
