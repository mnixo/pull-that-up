and boom right when you take a drink of water that's when we go live always thanks for my pleasure I'm a big fan I've been a fan for a long time so much and I'm very excited about this Badr Hari rematch so we were just talking about it that's gonna be in December yes sir yeah there's gonna be huge is I think is gonna be the biggest fighting keep boxing history I think it's already I mean you were just saying that the tickets go on presale today I think yeah today or tomorrow so yeah where is it gonna be held yeah it's gonna be in Holland yes where it's called the Sheldon Dome and how many seats is that I believe around 25 30,000 Wow so that's crazy how big kickboxing is in Holland as opposed to America yeah it's but Holland Europe it's a lot bigger than it is here so we I did I do not for the life of me understand why it hasn't taken off in America I don't get it well I think the step of going to MMA then to kickboxing is so much closer for example from high school it's so much more logical when you do wrestling right a little bit of boxing well let's jump into MMA there because it's so close to each other and when you go to kick box it's totally different right it slightly different so many people in America when they watch on my main they want guys to stand up yeah I know that's why doesn't make any sense but still I think like every country is like very patriotic they want their own guys right to be very good at something sort of but like when Anderson Silva was at the top of the heap in in MMA everybody wanted to see him fight yeah it didn't matter that he was from Brazil yeah that's true in America they still wanted to see him fight he's just they want to see high level stuff I just know everyone here is such a fan of knockouts yeah and striking and high-level striking I just don't understand it no muy Thai - you keep more tight doesn't sell at all no you mean there's no big muy Thai events like they had a pro muy Thai League event here and it was like Nikki Holt skin fought on it and bull Kyle and a few other big-name guys fought on it but it's like you know nobody in the crowd never sell also like Mort is also with the clinching and they hold right it's it's like I think it's a little bit boring like would we do with glory now is it's like more commercial mm-hmm you can hold like just for three three seconds right and then break and then continue fighting so and in the end that's what people want to see I get that but I like clinched work - and I like elbows elbows and knees in the clinch you don't like it I like the knees but no no - any cut that nasty yeah nasty so cuts are nasty yeah so I had what do you think about how like the amateur Muay Thai guys have elbow pads I think that's probably and all that prevent for people who don't understand what we're talking about it's weird that like we see you could t you can see with bare-knuckle boxing there's a lot of bare-knuckle boxing matches now and you see these guys faces are just getting destroyed yet and they just ripped apart it's crazy it's not healthy no it's not it's definitely not good for the longevity of your career No and so in amateur when we tie they have these elbow pads they wear and that would mean you still cannot guys out just as easily but an option to get the cuts exactly cut so I think that's that's a that's a good thing yeah but I'm just not a big fan of the elbow the elbow work but I love to see it but I don't like to get it I remember I remember I was I think I was training with the black zillions like years ago I think it was even before I became champion and I was training there doing a little bit of MMA helping some guys out and I was training and somebody would just he said on accent he's just Bop throw it right on the nose he just opened it up just a little bit nicer what the hell are you doing yeah I'm sorry I'm sorry yeah just accidentally yeah accident so well and a few extra low kicks afternoon and MMA I mean it's such a staple technique ya know it's probably hard to not do it yeah you've had a couple MMA fights right one just one yeah you mounted the guy yeah that was crazy took the ground yeah I was like let's give it a try we got to try everything but what I saw it I was like damn if he makes his way to MMA because the heavyweight division particularly in the UFC is extremely shallow yeah extremely shallow I mean you have some great talent but there's like four or five really good fighters you know it's like there's obviously Cormier there's steep a Francis and gah know there's a few other guys but it's you you know with a couple of wins you're in the mix for a heavyweight title shot yeah you know if you're thought about doing that I thought about it you're still young right yeah thirty yeah see which is crazy because you've had a lot of fights right yeah 6070 fights yeah that's crazy you know and it's um and but the thing is as European like fighting in glory like it's a that's what people don't understand it is enormous overseas it's it's hard for people to in America the like what kickboxing but if you go to see those events I mean I watch all of them you watch the events on television it's like fucking crazy pack thousands always full the first fight you had with Badr holy shit was that crowd huh that was a wild crowd and they even like jump to the ropes and everything everything went crazy so well it ended in a fucked up way yeah you know Badr said his arm was hurt like what was that did he get an MRI or anything like that I have no clue nut from the organization or something so yeah he did some bandage or something over his arm in the Navy because that's what he posted on Instagram but I don't know I don't know for me it was yeah you know it was like an anti-climax it yes there wasn't the way I wanted to end that fight right but I think for the rest for for him this was the perfect way to end the fight because this is the way you could get a rematch because if it would would have lost no point in doing a rematch would get knocked out no point in doing a rematch so well that was a really close fight and then you eventually won yeah you know but from for my feeling yeah but we go walked into the jabs the first round and everything that's true but I was pressuring him I was pressuring him the whole time and I was trying to feel like where is my distance where I can hit and where I can where I get hit no of course that's right yeah you get tired yeah you get attacked sometimes so my nose was already during training my nose opened up so when he hit it it opened up again so I was like yeah it is what it is you know I'm not really bothered by it so I was pressure impression and I was like okay now I got now I got it so after that first round and yeah then we jumped into the second round I was fit I was ready for I was ready for this fight and that's what I like to do I would like to drag people into the deep waters well you're very fit for a heavyweight you have crazy cardio it's one of the things that I've always admired about your fighting style so you put insane pressure on guys for a heavyweight cuz heavyweights bigger guys tend to fight at a slower pace and less volume but you you push a pace and when the fight gets to third fourth and fifth rounds you fucking pile it on man yeah because I've been training with light guys for like my whole career so when I started at the gym I started it with the super pro SportsCenter with Dennis Carrillo he had Albert Kraus he was the first in k1 max champion and he had Alpher Lima like multiple middleweight champion world champion so I was working with those guys like every day and they just kept on pressuring me and I was getting my ass whupped like almost every day by like guys every way like 75 kilos so I was like I can keep hitting him to keep hitting those guys hard or just go with less power and pressure them like they try to pressure me and of course didn't begin is like still you get tired but at a certain moment you get like hey this is going better and right yeah yeah don't try to hit them hard but just try to keep the work right now she gun is that something that happens in a fight as well where you have to balance out how hard you swing versus like not going full blast but going technical or knowing that you can start unloading in the third fourth and fifth rounds you start season four aid but it's for me it's like I'm playing a game for me this is we always say fighting is a thinking man's game because fighting everybody can fight when they have to everybody can fight when doesn't matter what person when you put them in a corner and it's life or death everybody can fight but it's it's so much more than that it's so much more than just fighting so and that's trying how I try to step into the ring with that mentality like people don't understand that who've never competed the managing of the resources yes is a big factor exert the gas yeah and you see like guys and MMA see it with the garlic Nick Diaz like Nick Diaz is famous for not hitting guys hard he just stays on you just stays on you a lot of volume and then you get tired yeah and then then he starts unloading exactly no with big shots so and it's that's what I like to do the biggest compliment I could get from an opponent and I had it like for my like my last six opponent got like three or four times this is like we go now I understand why you are the champion I fought everybody but this I've never felt before and you're on a different level and that's the biggest compliment I could get because I'm in there in the ring for five rounds with this guy and they they got every opportunity to do everything they've trained for with me for five rounds so I didn't knock them out we just fought for five rounds but they just did not know what to do and that's yeah for me the biggest compliment I could get yeah to be technical and to just play your game exactly yeah I really loved your rematch with Jamal Benson yeah that was one of my favorite fights at least that was a great it's like it that was like the The Fool Rocky version of a fight that people would love to see you get tagged in the beginning and then you overwhelmed and then when you put him away I was like holy shit what a fight yeah what a fight that was that guy's a big motherfucker - yeah this is a big guy and like I lost against him like back in the days and when I was like just a little little kid and so this fight brought something with it as well he's like yeah he's a champion now but I beat him but it was like six seven years I'm a totally different fighter than I was back then let's go I'm ready for you so yeah this was the the best thing and he spit in my face during a press conference so I got some extra motivation for that fight well you played it out perfectly to where even when he hit you and hurt you early in the fight you stayed calm you didn't get emotional you use good defense and then once you got him into the deep water you stopped him in the fourth and the fifth fifth round yeah once you got him in the deep water then you piled it on and then put him away but then again it's the same thing for me how did you do that you got tagged and I said but then again like I said it's a thinking man's game so I get hit from my point of view I made a mistake I switched the South Pole but instead of switching and stepping outside of his front leg I was right in front of his of his leg and he was just throwing a left right and I was walked straight into that and that's what that's what happened it's not that from our point of view that he timed death so it happened and from that moment I can do two things I can think okay I can jump into the fight you're trying to get that point or whatever in that moment back or just thinking my mind like okay fuck it you lost this round take it and let's go fresh into the second that's what I did there so just think about okay I lost this round but I got four more to go and I got back into the corner and my choice hey you back so yep okay he's tired now yeah when he tried to unload on you he emptied out a lot of the gas tank we got you hurt yeah yeah so that's the game right trying to figure out when you can finish when you eject me yeah just stay focused stay relaxed and of course he with some some good shots but but he's a big powerful guy yeah he's always a dangerous fighter that guy's huge what is he like six nine six ten something like that yeah yeah then yeah it's huge in like 270 pounds I think yeah that's so yeah now it's 1-1 say come on man you beat me like six every year yeah he had since then all right he won a tournament last year right so he set a few yeah so maybe their fight is gonna come but like I said now I'm in like last year the 31st of December my contract was finished with glory so we've been in negotiations ever since so from that moment on I said in my last contract you guys told me the about a fight was gonna happen and you it didn't happen so that's what I want first give me the butter fight and from that moment on we're gonna discuss yeah so people who don't know the sport Badr Hari is one of the biggest names in the sport like forever he's he's a guy who he's stopped Alistair Overeem he you know he's fought in k1 thought everybody said and she'll be arts I mean he's a fucking wild man today you know but he hasn't fought in high-level competition for a long time and then he fought you yeah yeah yeah so the thing was everybody was I was beating everybody I was champion I was beating everybody who said yeah Rico's good he's the champion but he hasn't fought Badr I was like hey if he was so our national television said hey if he wants to fight let's go but he had been dealing with a bunch of legal trouble he had a lot of problems yeah he broke someone's leg in a club yeah a lot of lunch it's crazy shit there's a video of him slapping some guy's face it yeah in a hotel yeah imagine that guy's slapping your face to support you working behind the counter water comes in yeah yeah so so yeah he had a bunch of problems but then eventually the fight happened because that's the fight that people wanted to see you know but for me it was just like another fight and then the fight at the end the fight ended that way yeah that was too bad so but now we can do it again yeah so the fight was quite a while ago how long ago was that 2016 yeah that's why did it take so long for the rematch oh yeah there was a bunch of stuff going on in between and like last year he fought has the Girgis also a good kick box I believe he's now all doing MMA in Bellator and he's fought he's got a four right yeah he fought as before but got disqualified so that's right he stomped him his around yeah so so and but after definitely he's so crazy so it's such a wild dude yeah and then after that fight they both got got caught with using whatever Oh steroids yeah oh so so they both got suspended and I believe hesti as he wasn't suspended I don't know but he got suspended till December this year so that's why how did the fight go the last when he fought last year with heads ooh uh he won won what that wasn't easy but he won was it lost I mean a decision or was a decision you know yeah so for him that was the first fight since your fight with him in 2016 is that it yeah he's been because he's had enough yeah yeah but and now he's not training at Mike's gym anymore so no right do you know who he's trained him with yeah I don't know his name I don't know I know the guy but don't know he's training with well he looks good on Instagram for sure but it's very fit a lot of people a lot of people look good in Instagram you know that you see my real life it looks totally different well I'm sure he looks the same yeah but it's it's what's interesting is when you're in high-level competition like he was of course in you know the days when he fought Alistair before Alistair made the transition fold Nam to MMA when he before he came to Strikeforce and all that stuff that's that's a long time ago yeah you know it's probably hard to get back I mean and to jump straight in the top level competition like heads II or especially like fighting you as a champion that's a big leap right yeah so but that's the thing now we both have it so he fought last year March and I fought last year September so because I'm was it negotiated and still am in negotiations with glory for a new contract so it's it's both been a while for us but I've been before that I was liking it much yeah yeah crazy yes low yeah you definitely have much more momentum and just there's a thing about fighting too when guys take a long time off it's almost like they they lose the feel for it yeah they lose you know how obviously they know how to kick they know how to punch they know what to do they're in shape yeah but there's a feel that they have for the ring for exactly excited this side this is there's a where people don't I said like hey you step in the ring and that's what that's what you do there's what you were born to do that's true but you need that the attention you need that five of walking towards the ring stepping into the ring all those people looking at you at that moment that's a certain type of feeling that you get and you got to be comfortable with it yeah and that that's exactly what it is you're not to feel comfortable and only way you can be comfortable and stay comfortable is being active yes being active is very it's it's just so critical for a fighter when when a guy takes a year off or two years off or the more the time is the more it becomes problematic yeah and the older you get this is how old's bar now 35 I think hmm yeah does glory drug test yeah they do that that's one that's how they got caught was it hammer was an athletic commission I mean was it glory or was it no it's not glory it's an induction ocol good touch yeah and so they're gonna drug test for this fight as well yeah yeah yeah sure so I I got tested like every every time is it like water testing like the same standards the world yeah yeah yeah so they like wake you up like 7 o'clock in the morning hey Rico oh no no no no that's not the testing would they just test at the events oh I would even rather have that yes wake up and random contest but didn't know what they do there but they test like really strict when you are when you're there yeah that's that's a little bit easier to pass though that's true no that's a lot easier to pass I should I have no clue and I don't know what to do or what ways there are to because I'm not on it I don't want to stay busy I don't want to think about it right but whatever you know I just jump in there and just do what I got to do but that's why I told glory now again after this whole issue because a lot of people were caught late last year and they didn't expect that I was like hey we gotta keep doing this because this is the way we make the sport clean yes and I think that's what we deserve because we yeah we are we are a good sport we are all athletes but I want to be safe in the ring and what do you mean was safe you're going into a fight I understand but somebody that uses whatever can maybe just punch a little bit harder in the beginning of the fight or whatever I'm a little more endurance exactly you were some punch so they wouldn't be able to hit you with the nonce I'm sure exactly so that's what I mean with done and glory I want to be safe when I'm in the ring well for sure I mean if if one person's on it and one person is not that's you know it's it's a giant advantage anybody says it's not it's just lying to themselves yeah yeah so but I'm Indian you know I just go in there and don't I'm not even thinking about it well it is the fight to make in kickboxing too and if there's a fight that I could tell people hey you got to watch you you really want to know what kickboxing all about watch this fight this if that is the fight because bots are such a wild man he's such a knockout art and you obviously one of the most successful heavyweights ever you know I mean your your kickboxing record and glory and just to highlight reels amazing you've got so many great fights over there yeah I've been doing so good and really injure myself and that's what I said I want to bring kickboxing to a new level like then especially when you go now in Holland like normally in Holland was like soccer or whatever cycling or ice skating that's where parents were bringing their kids to and lukie-pookie boxing and now okay this is cold when we go change I think like two three years ago what wouldn't made it change I think because of the Badr fight that was so we were getting it we were getting more airtime and after the Bata fight and everything that happened around him and there was surrounding him like what would the things you said would happen outside in the club and they'd seen that you know he was like the national asshole right now and I was like the National good guy is that right so and that was like the perfect clash and then of course yeah I beat him so everybody's like oh you are here right so that that's like that's how everything a little bit exploded but but again for you that's unsatisfying the way it happened though he gets his arm injured yeah in whatever way reason or whatever he thinks happen but like you cuz you're suspicious I'm suspicious about it so because he's looking at one arm then looking at the other arm and it's just it's a fake thing for me but it's like but that's what I have with this whole thing that he tries to create it's like when he's getting announced and everything's like butter hurry 110 something fights 90 knockouts but I'm obsessed with what I'm doing I'm when I'm when I fight and when I have an opponent and I'm fighting I'm looking for everything I want to know everything about you and everything these days you can find on the Internet so when I'm looking on the internet for example you look at Wikipedia and looking all of the fight from back in the days k1 days and even before that you maybe get to 6070 fights so where are the other fights does that mean like when you were younger in the youth period you did like 40 something fights did you knock everybody out I don't know my training has been there for years even before that and he doesn't know about it so that's strange because everything is documented on on the internet everything you can find on the Internet so so you think his records inflated I think so it's got some crazy knockouts though he got yeah yeah yeah Stefan Leko that weird Lucas but that's what I said he got he's got net he's got amazing records but yeah I think it's not as crazy as they make it to be which is crazy because the reality is pretty crazy I mean you don't need to hype it up any more than it really is hmm right nobody's been there for years like he did 100 something fights there's so many knockouts but when I look at it is I can't find it mmm because but maybe it's there maybe today maybe it's from years ago whatever I don't know but that's all that I'm looking at you're suspicious I'm suspicious about because when I look at Wikipedia and I'm looking when he was around you start from when he was around 16 till now it's like 60 70 fights it's funny when you look at him in the early days - he was so skinny yeah I give him when he fought Stefan Leko yeah and then now he's fucking jacked yeah but he put so much time into strength strength and conditioning workout so you could see like he's always doing some crazy strength routine yeah yeah so do you do a lot of strength and conditioning like what are your workouts like it's supposed to like how much skill work do you do and how much strength and conditioning work I think it's pretty even balance out I think at range strength like three times a week but even my strength between is so balanced out with doing strength and then the same muscle group I also do conditioning so first I'll do low reps and then do a lot of reps because these muscles are for me aren't supposed to be big they need to be strong and it give me they need to be making the same punch 50 times with the same strength so ten times really hard no 50 times on the same strength same level so that's how we approach that and then yeah we got skill training like two three times a week like pad work I got explosive training so I try to always look also at different sports that's soccer and Mac football and it's ice skating and they all have a certain type of explosiveness that they train in a certain way so I try to pick everything from everywhere and work with that so we created a training that we just used for explosive for being explosive so it there's nothing to do with endurance because it's maybe like 45 minutes and it's just a few seconds you go go back go you come back because logically for a big guy you're slow when something is big and heavy it's slow and that's what we try to do we try to be as fast as possible for a big guy so a lot of plyometric type stiff explosive type stuff yeah no way you'd letter yeah like that okay yeah so when you do this constant when you were saying that you lift low reps and then high reps yeah so you do like heavy weights first yeah so just try to max out or get the the muscles very tired and then really wear them out with with reps yeah so we do but we never go max max so right right then that like over max what we so you don't don't go to failure with like a heavy heavy weight yeah what kind of stuff are you doing you're doing like dumbbells kettlebells a lot of a lot of dumbbells yeah yeah there's not as much loose weight as possible like a few with the barbell but it's much with with the dumbbells because that's when you gotta keep in balance and work on this core and stuff like that so what about our sparring how often you spar week normally like twice two three times a week and when you do it are you doing hard spot I know you're from Holland oh yeah fucking Hollan guys like spar Hardman do you do a lot of hiring is it more technical like how do you how do you bounce it out um it depends depends on who's who's in because now in preparation we're gonna fly guys in and then yeah it's gonna be pretty tough sparring because that's what you yeah what you got would you get the guys four right but in the end I'm always thinking about hey we do hard sparring but we don't want to injure each other right there's no point for me in knocking guys out doing sparring because yeah I don't have any sparring partners anymore right so I do hard sparring kick him hard on the legs kick him hard on the body and of course people get knocked knocked down not knocked out but right down but you don't go full blast to the head no that's a Holland thing right I mean there's a lot of guys do it yeah spar like that yeah we go we go pretty tough we go pretty tough to the to the head black eyes bloody nose but I'm always like 90% know I'm always looking at like hey or when I'm making a move and I can make a head kick I always try to when I see I'm gonna make a full hit tries to keep it back just a little bit mm-hmm so I think yeah but just being controlled I think it's very important so I trained with all the guys all the heavyweight guys from glory I trained with with and of course you do heart sparring but we do not add from my point of view I don't want to injure them right yeah I mean it only makes sense I mean that's one of the most valuable things right is to have high-level training partners exactly and if you guys think you're gonna put him to sleep all the time they're not really interested in spawn for example I trained with Benny Alec Bowie he's like the number two or number three in glory and I fought him twice but we trained to get it reach now at my gym and I try to make him better say hey you try this try that and because if he's better you're better exactly and people like no no I don't want to train with competition because then they know what I'm gonna do that's true but you also know what they're doing so it it depends on how you approach things where every negative thing has a positive thing at it as well so that's I really always I'm always looking at the positive things and always try to surround myself with people people that are positive and yeah that's that's the vibe that I'm going with because that's what works well that's also the mark of a confident fighter but you know that you're the best so if you help him he's just gonna help you become even better than you are currently yeah but you gotta be you gotta be comfortable with that because you also see a lot of guys that like I'm not gonna help the guy I'm not gonna tell them whatever because this is not gonna be good for me but and then everybody that gets better can help me get better as well so I always put position myself as a sponge trying to get this much info in wherever I am so I'm now really going into acting I want to I want to act so now kevin was on your show as well Kevin Hart yeah yeah so you were training with them yeah so it was a lot of fun the first kick he ever threw he threw with you yeah so who is crazy he's a great guy is such a good guy but so so much positivity and he has such a great vibe and he's such a great mentor and I was just sitting there we were talking and like I said how is just position mister has a spine I was just trying to get as much information in there as possible and yeah now I've been I'm here now in a lay for about a month now I'm been training with with Mark Wahlberg and also the same thing and Anthony hard on any hard dog is here so it's amazing because when you're in LA you want to do Dutch kickboxing that's the place yeah hard arts awesome yeah yeah he's amazing so so every time whenever they I'm good tell people where he's done dynamics yeah dynamics is endemic seven MMA which is in Santa Monica yeah just said they're opening up another one that he's gonna run in West LA he's just he was when he used to fight in the UFC I still love watching him fight because he was probably one of the best leg kickers ever in the heavyweight division yeah he would just fought guys legs yeah it's so technical yeah so much fun so last Saturday we we started sparring a little bit yeah looking for a little bit of sparring okay I said he said I didn't do so anything for ten years but I want to do it just want to help you I said it's good but I just want to move around you know I don't want to kick nobody's ass I just want to move around so that's what we did we had a lot of fun so and then you still see has that feeling has that Dutch kickboxing touch so it's it's amazing yeah no there's not a lot of like real high-level Dutch kickboxing you can get in California especially out here no no no he's definitely gotta go too but just heavy weights it's difficulty weight sparring is and it's hard yeah good level heavyweight sparring so yeah we just keep keep going around and that's that's why I love being here so actually I'm here for a vacation but when I'm here I gotta work as well alright so the fight is in December Yeah right gonna be when December the 21st ok so right before Christmas Christmas yeah so that's what I said is it yeah maybe we're doing it in January fuck I wish I wish it was in America I would love to see that shit why well I don't love Holland hey you gotta come to Harlem and that's a lot of fun I'm sure I'm sure it's bit but if it was in like Chicago or some shit I'd fly out oh that's a fucking that's a long that's a lot of flying yes a lot of time in left an hour's yeah 11 hours on the plane a jet lag stay for a couple days I don't have a week to spare no wish so your honor you're trying to act - that's not gonna try to do yeah yes I get an agent and meeting with people and stuff like that yeah yeah exactly so I'm uh with with paradigm my name is my American management now you taking you you obviously speak fluent English yeah but are you taking lessons to get better at it yeah you can act and yeah so that's your next goal exactly so I'm gonna still an active athlete but I'm still looking at like hey what can I do next because I can't and I don't want to do this for like ten more years do you want to retire do you have a thought in your head I don't know it depends on what right now you're in your prime yeah so it depends on what what comes on my my route so yeah I'm still looking at so now I'm in negotiations with glory how is glory doing as an organization are they doing well because I know they were they were struggling a little bit in America they were you trying to death but I do they still have events here in America yeah yeah but less less than in the beginning because Europe is it's so much more yeah successful so dare we fill up like arenas mm-hmm here we can get like five but I went to the last man standing in LA when yeah yeah Joe Schilling was there yeah oh shit was that crazy yeah that was awesome but I always tell people like you want to see real high level striking you see high level striking at MMA but with MMA there's all the other variables yes takedowns and you know small gloves the whole deal like to really want to see high level kickboxing yeah Glory's worth that exactly so that's for me now where I read is like I'm still in negotiation for glory for a new contract and if we in what way or the other we we can get out of it so maybe I'm gonna do something else or I don't know I'm look I'm looking at the support like a totally different way I don't wanna I think the sport can totally be elevated in in all certain ways you know all different ways because how crazy would it be to do mixed fights it's fun to go from one guy go to the other sport you know how cool would it be that the other guy would go to the other sport as well so someone from MMA coming to kickboxing and the other way around yeah well the other way around see I mean I I could see like Francis and Gahan oh yeah I think he would do really well and in kickbox it's a fucking ridiculously powerful striker yeah he would do really well but I don't think there's a lot of other well I mean obviously Alistair if Alistair really dedicated himself to it he's chasing the goal of being a UFC heavyweight champion yeah yeah I mean well I mean the only other organization is one and one has they they're do kickbox as well now yeah they do kickboxing n muy Thai and they do more time with little gloves pretty good have you thought about doing that no no really that's crazy yeah but I don't mind we're doing the Smart Girls but keep boxing your small gloves is pretty insane how can I intense because there's no way to block anything anymore guys stand up and fight you can just put the gloves out and just do bare-knuckle fight because that's almost the same right so in terms of like for people don't understand when you have big gloves on there's more you can protect yourself exactly you can shell up better yeah and defensively you know Liam Liam Harrison yeah he fought in one with little gloves and muy Thai and he was like holy face sent me a message like fucking brutal bad he's like I can't believe how hard it is so much different yet so yeah okay clean she can do whatever so yeah that's the that's pretty insane so but like I said I don't know why one phone that because I know they do have some matches where they wear big gloves just to push the limit yeah well they have so many different kinds of matches over there they even have grappling matches like straight straight grappling yeah I don't know that well have you been to one at all no they're gigantic yeah yeah in Asia fucking huge man no but I've bunch of friends have gone over there to coach and even to fight and you know and a couple people from the UFC miesha tate she's some chess some executive position over there right now Rich Franklin does as well mmm who used to be the middleweight champion yeah yeah so they they have a bigger audience worldwide than the UFC does they're huge in Asia like just gigantic they're getting bigger and bigger and they got really high-level fighters too so it's really interesting but I know they're doing a lot of kickboxing as well yeah so who knows who knows more than better right more competition the better yeah exactly exactly because that's what brings the whole sport up yes yeah that's that's perfect that's cool but it's like I said it's I just like to do different stuff yeah and now like I said I don't want to do I don't want to fight for another 10 years so let's see what what yeah what's gonna happen you know I'm gonna make a movie either way so I'm gonna start filming a movie in the beginning of next year so that's that's pretty cool it's the movie it's gonna be it's like totally from blank we started it so it's been it's been written now I got the first draft of the script and it's it's crazy please tell me what you do yeah so I'm like a like a black ops kind of guy but something happens you're in operation and I stopped because I think okay this what happened is crazy I told them not to do this and it still this happened so I'm gonna stop and yeah and they bring you back they I get back people of course of course but I'm not that's the thing I said I don't want to be a fighter because people already know me from finding write I want to do something else I want to really show my my acting skills right so that's gonna there's gonna be so much fun and that's what I get my excitement from because I love do since I was six years old I mean it's like forever so I want to do something else as well so that this is gonna be a lot of fun it's a hard transition the not a lot of people have been successful at it like Randy Couture is probably the most successful yeah you know he's he's got a real career as an actor now yeah and he acts and a bunch of movies man obviously he's in the Expendables and but he's always working yeah but a lot of in the end when you look at the history a lot of athletes did it yeah sure not a lot were like really good again we got like it's watching nigger damn and sure he says war it's possible and I like the challenge is there ever a worry of being like one foot in one foot out with your fighting career like if acting starts to take off but you're still fighting is there a worry about not being a hundred percent all in no no because then the thing we said I'd also discussed this with my trainer because he's really cautious with that he's like hey when we focus on making a movie that's what we're gonna focus on and if we're gonna have a fight we're gonna fully focus on that so those side things or growl let's do this for a second and then we go back and um just gonna focus on that because that's what does fighters in exactly I mean you've seen it like that that happened with Ronda Rousey it's happened with other fighters where they just get to spread thin yeah it's spread too thin and they'd have too many different projects simultaneously I still they they people still say that about me now at this moment like Rico's I focused he doesn't say hey but I trained every day I'm focused in what I'm doing I focused in kickboxing but I just like the acting part I just want to gain my knowledge and get better at it so you gotta train it the same escape boxing yeah it's got to stay focused do you do you ever do any jujitsu I did some did some yeah I like it I like it it's a lot of fun but now the last two years have been so busy with with key boxing and everything that happens on the side it's just no time so you don't have any real designs of eventually transferring to MMA you know like I said for me when I look at it because people ask me ask me there's a lot like Rico would you why don't you go to MMA yeah could be could be possible what like from if I look at it honestly it's not my basic ambition to go there yeah my ambition my next ambition because when I look at it's like if you jump into something different you should you have the the will and want to be the best right and I don't necessarily have the will to be the best in MMA but if you get a crazy offer that's what I was gonna say someone comes along with the real shackles you get thank you lots of stuff just a little bit more let's go I got this I'm motivated know so know that that's exactly what but if you GI decide to do that how much time do you think you would legit we need for like a real high-level opponent the worry here take down a year yeah take down his pants thing I know what to do I've trained this for like two three years so I know but my body just needs to work on it have a fight in between maybe another fight and then I'm gonna be able to do a high-level fight now do you do any other kind of cardio do you run or horse yeah do you hate it you hate it but ya do it yeah but it's also for a big guy it's more of a pain in the ass yeah like what do you weigh about 250 somewhere around there 260 260 so that's when you're running that's a lot of weight it's a lot of weight on your pressure and so but in the end how much I hate it just uh it works for me because it's also for me a mental training because I hate it so much mhm and I jump on the treadmill or I go outside and I just wanna come you gotta keep going you gotta keep going because when you get you have that feeling like 90% of the people would stop mmm but you're not that person you gotta keep going and that's what that's what motivates me just to do things different than everybody else does being comfortable being uncomfortable yes exactly yeah the grind the grind is I think that's the moment when it starts we can get that feeling shit is gonna hurt your body starts hurting and that's when like a lot of people give up and that's where we as champions we continue it's interesting too because a lot of fighters they'll do all sorts of high-intensity training and interval training and all these different plyometrics and cardio and different things but many of them will tell you that one of the more important things is just long range running yeah because when you do this long-distance running when you're on five six seven miles when you do that you develop this cardio base yeah you can just keep working and you can recover faster yeah and it's just I mean that's one of the things if you go back and look at old-time fighters you know back Muhammad Ali Sugar Ray Robinson all those guys everybody ran but Rocky Marciano everybody ran yeah there wasn't an option it wasn't like you don't have to run we could do a bunch of other things like no no fighters run yeah that's what we do yeah but it's just I always feel like running is not it's not the base of your it's not most important but it's like a really important factor of the total package right so it's just you're yet the oxygen you have like for keeping the same pace for a longer a longer time then of course the explosiveness that we use during a fight is important but also just your basic lung capacity should be should be big as well what about heavy bag work yeah we do it but not that much yeah I think like once a week some more pad work more technical things yeah not like as I see some guy it's really interesting how different camps different fighters different trainers prefer different preparation methods yeah and some swear by intervals on the heavy heavy bags and swear by doing rounds on the heavy bag you know and some some don't think it's that critical yeah I think for everybody is different but like for me throughout all those years I've been trying different stuff and I think now I created the right combination of different trainings just polishing everything and I think I found the right way to get fit because I don't need to get I need to get better I always I'm always looking to get better but you get better by putting in the work but I'm always looking at how can I change my training up what would be an add on what I'm in what I already have right so now I think I created the right combination but and still I'm looking to add stuff on but I think I created the right way to get fit for a fight because I've shown that throughout all those years I've shown that I'm fitter than all the rest and that's that's a part but still I think the biggest differences that everybody is strong and everybody's fit and everybody can fight but the biggest difference is mentally what happens to you mentally when you get to the fourth and fifth round I think that's the most important thing how strongly you mentally to continue fighting a lot of people when you feel like I always for the people that do not understand what this what this fighting game is what happens to you when you're in the ring or in an octagon so you can I always compared with driving a car you're driving a car and the last 4050 miles the the gas light comes on hey you got a good gas that's the same thing that happens to your body when you get tired and Sun whatever happens in your mind your head hey you're tired when you're tired you need to rest and we as athletes we do not listen to that light that goes off in your car and even in my car I don't listen I always go I had a few times that was on the side of the road with without gas so I'm sorry but this is that psychological do you do that because you think of your car like a body again Thank You chair fuck you car don't be a pussy hey Joe they appreciate that that yeah I think that is what it is you know it's like the same game you're playing they play that game it's so stupid but for me it works because I I always push my car to the limit that's what I'm gonna do to myself as well you know and that's what I luckily have a great team of people around me for because even when everything is hurting and tired and I almost get over trained my people have to pull me back Rico just no point in training now because you're gonna get overtraining you're gonna fuck yourself up right let's not find balance right it's hard to figure out I don't have to balance right I don't have it I tried to have it and every time in preparation I think I got it now I got it I know got it no so you need other people around you that are objective that can tell you like hey Rico you got to step back because for me in my mind I don't know what it is but we're not when I'm not working I'm standing still or going down mmm that's what happens in my mind so right I gotta keep working I gotta keep grinding right but that's also because of your style because of the fact that you do push such a tremendous pace that you're you're constantly feel like you have to have your foot on the gas yeah right that's interested so you've been with the same coach for a long time yeah like since I was like 17 oh so that's great so yeah they know you yeah thinking yeah when I come in what's going on so critical right and did the whole team so much power culture oh okay so the same same team the entire yeah okay well I'm like like in the beginning of we were working like we working like four three four years and then I come in Monday morning power training what the hell you need is weekend what do you mean what have you been eating yeah Saturday night I went to the McDonald's what's the problem look at your blown head man see that like yeah you know fat holds the the water in your in the fluid he gets help from one McDonald's meal really that's how close we were so that's how like he sees me like multiple times a week so he saw me like like Friday so he just knows you just need you know knows everything did you monitor your heart rate or anything on time yes every morning I uh I check my blood pressure or stuff like that get my temperature do you do it with a computer do you have our program dear on no no just write it down yeah just write it down and then send it to the to the doctor have you known so if your heart rate is a little bit too high in the morning do you just do it like an active recovery day just relax yeah we we now check it more through the temperature then through the heart rate really yeah temperature yeah it's interesting so when my temperature is up I gotta watch out so you might be fighting off a cold or something like that something like that fighting off a cold or you still your body still recovering from the last four down last training so from that we can so we haven't doing it now for a few years and that's exactly what when I feel like hey when my temperature goes up and it goes there mmm this doesn't feel good and then every time when were you in the end we always look back at and analyze stuff and then my treasure hey Jackie there this training was shit so you take do you use this like do you make a log during your training and compare it to like your last camp and you look at the numbers and make sure that everything lines up yeah yeah so you kind of have to be right at this point Tom if you want to really get everything dialed in you kind of have to be scientific about it yeah there's so much more than just fighting and good training is like good nutrition and yes and that it's just everything has to be balanced out I was gonna ask you about that do you have a dietician or someone who cooks for you yeah so in in in camp so in I think like two years ago I started with that do you eat horsemeat yeah no there's no same thing over there like al stirs a big horse meat guy I don't think that was a good excuse for next to next inviting that's what everybody said - everyone's like yeah horse meat yeah it works you know what horse yeah yeah so no so that's uh no I have no clue no god it's not like in my diet or something just what do you eat a lot in a lot yeah multiple meals a day yeah yeah yeah sure so but that that's a fun people how much do you eat it's it's crazy yeah but I burned a lot as well so right I have to and for me the the the fun thing with that is the the fun and the strange thing when I tell people said when I get closer to the fight I'm eating myself slim so the more I'm eating the slimmer I'm getting because I'm training very hard and your body's just in a burning process right when the food is gone it's gonna start burning fat so I get slimmer the closer I get to the fight mmm that's it but when you see what I eat is like how do you do that but it's just all this is truly training so much yeah so what what kind of foods do they prepare for you do they did they have like those prepaid pre-prepared packets and you just heat them up or something like that like how does that work yeah me like a meal prep company does yeah no it's just like a private cook okay yeah private chef that runs with me and just make sure every day I get and they checked the macros and make sure that you have the same right amount of protein the right amount of carbohydrate yes it's not like really like that everything is put it on a scale or something like that we don't do that because yeah there's certain things I just want a little bit more all right I still have I'm still a little bit hungry so it's so you need to lose weight no all right so but still have in my mind always a certain type of fight weight that I like to fight on what is that weight like 118 and a half 118 half kilos what is that I think is around two to eighty five to fifty eight I think well it's 2.2 pounds 2.2 kilos or at 2.2 pounds per kilo 118 260 pounds to six that's right right on there huh yeah so okay then I'm lying then I'm now a little bit heavier guys come on I'm in LA no I went in and out a few times so how could you not yeah so it's gotta be round to 265 do you try to stay pretty healthy in terms of your diet though even when you're not in camp yeah yeah so for me to say like we go how do you do it fighting is a lifestyle it's not it's not like when I go when I wake up Oh this morning I go to the gym think about the fight focus focus focus go out the gym and my focus is all I said I wake up with it I go to bed with it and when I'm in bed I'm dreaming about it I'm this is 24/7 every day I'm thinking about every meal every thing you do is just thinking about what's coming that's why you're the champ yeah I think so I think but for me it's like such a crazy thing that goes on in my mind because I train twice a day and then at night when I'm at home things like you know what I'm in front of television my wife on the couch and like I wanna do some stretching I'm just gonna sit on the ground just stretch or do some more ab work it's just I don't know I absolutely like I'm obsessed over it you have to be obsessed I mean you're in the most one of the most dangerous combat sports in the world and you're the world champion so it's constantly there's pressure and I just thinking hey my opponent probably know is resting or whatever he's doing I don't care but I need to do some mixer right so constantly that's that that's running through my mind everything that I'm doing he's not doing now do you take vitamins and supplements woody what kind of stuff do you take oh it's really like like all natural stuff and I go to the to the doctor so he takes my blood and then from there on he always looks at how does it look this is looking good it maybe you need some more yeah so so he fills it up whenever whenever it's needed and during the period I'm trained I just take the normal the normal stuff magnesium iron whatever right vitamin C stuff like that just to keep everything on the right level and then once a month I go to him or the closer we get to the fight maybe go twice a twice a month and then you just check it like okay it's good or now oh you got a lot of white blood cells so you're getting close to being your muscles are tired you know maybe eating over train to look at that maybe get some more protein and stuff like that so that's how we try to do what else you do for recovery do you do any cryotherapy or things on those lines yeah so I've been starting that like one and a half year ago something and it works I like it do you do it do you do ice baths or like how do you what do you do no I just do literally the cryo the machines also ignite frozen yeah yeah yeah so I did like two different in Holland now it's really starting to do to be hype so now I get like different places do you go on the one that is from the neck down or the one that gets your whole body in there yeah so first I started with with the one with there with the neck now the whole body is a better one though yeah this is a place out here cryotherapy it's the fucking shit I love it it's 240 degrees below zero and just like a mental training come on you gotta so that's what I started with and then but you know I think the only one we have now is in Amsterdam like the boom body and like F's I was like two hours well from the neck down is good enough yeah so now I get one I get one in my own gym mm-hmm so just I can jump in you know how easy yeah so just start with that and then from there I'm gonna see gonna see how it works but about sauna yeah I use it but not not too often so good man I know we're so good for recovery you know I like it for the four first two minutes afterwards I like it it's like again it's like mentoring training no no but I'm like after my wife's like enjoying it there's something it's so nice cuz you're playing the game with you you can't just enjoy it you have your your opponent will probably get out now you're gonna stay in come on it's like really AM it just dripping off like it's like when I was fun myself up because I was trying to crank it up - I had Laird Hamilton on the podcast he's a surfer big-time surfer and his wife Gabriella Reese was telling me that he cranks his up to 220 degrees so I did that for a little bit I got up late to 10 to 18 yeah but it was I think it was burning my lungs I think I was cooking in there I really do feel like shit and I'll get out I'd be so fucking tired it was like I don't think this is good for it I drop down now I do normal now I do it like 180 which is normal 180 degrees Fahrenheit oh that is Celsius yeah I think like like 80 85 yes but that's normal that's like a normal hot sauna good enough 20 minutes I mean I'm out so you have it's it's very good for you those heat shock proteins and they did these studies that showed a 40% decrease in mortality for all causes heart attack stroke cancer 40% decrease where people use the sauna for four times a week or more that was in was it Sweden Jamie do you remember dr. Rhonda Patrick yes that's interesting talking about it I don't know that's playing it yeah it's phenomenal for you because of heat shock proteins it makes your body reduces inflammation throughout your whole body as does cryotherapy anything where you're dealing with extreme cold or extreme heat your body develops either heat shock proteins or cold shock proteins yeah so I also I so there was this this place where I went when I went for the cryo and he said oh we also got something else I don't know what it's called can't remember so you just get like like put in a cocoon or something uh-huh just go to sleep Oh only in water so you're like floating it did so the water is like your foot yeah the water so floating it's got floating this what it's called it's like what happens look that's a fucking scar you mean like a crowd like a float tank like yeah yeah but it's here it looks like a cocoon okay I know what you're talking about and then they just close it and they put you in that sensory deprivation tank yeah for an hour you have one right here oh really yeah it's awesome I'm gonna sleep for now it's huge the one I have here it's huge yeah why do you use a small yeah but I just wanted one that anyone can come in they so it's like seven feet long and 9 feet high yeah yeah it's amazing and they said they say when you finally get to the point where you know how to work relax mentally relax it's the same as one hours like four or five hours yes yeah yeah you relax it's also your body absorbs magnesium yeah because it's Epsom salts so all the salt that's in the water is a thousand pounds of salt and water all that epsom salts the magnesium gets through your skin into your bloodstream so it's really good like it's almost like taking new magnets as good or better take them taking a magnesium supplement yeah really good for your muscles to look everything gets loose yaks and it feels like everything stretches out and yeah what about our dead yeah oh shit I'll show you - you got here what about massage do you get massage yeah like daily daily yeah yeah physiotherapist uh comes in after the house it just keeps it keeps the blood flowing nice just make sure yeah everything not just for recovery but also also just for the injuries keep checking like oh what's this was that man what's hurting and so luckily I've been doing pretty good not too many injuries yeah having a good one a good massage therapist yeah deal with injuries is just gigantic yeah yeah it's so important so they can they can prevent things fix things things that are starting to go south they can stop it in its tracks and remain loose and everything up and because sometimes if you get an injury right everything it tightens up and then when you're training it gets even more fucked up but if someone can loosen that up then it has time to relax and yeah yeah yeah well so just getting more tense and then yeah you're gonna rip something somewhat every so yeah that's so important I think that's one of the key factors in being a pro athlete is the people you have around you yes the team that helps you balance everything out and they say oh yeah you're a fighter yeah I'm Rico to fight I'm Rico the champion because of all those people that are the team yeah there are around me so still in the end you're doing an individual sport but you have a great team around you to be that person that you are in the ring and at the highest level I think you have to have that you have to have all the ducks in line right yeah you have to have everything in line if you want to be at the very top of the heap yeah you have to what about psychology do you have a mental trainer or anybody who's like a sports psychologist well that's the little fun thing I started off with the guy I was telling you about of your lima he's uh also kickboxing world champion in different different weight divisions and I was training with him and he took me with his training took me to his training and I was working with him in his prime and without him knowing he was teaching me so much about mental training because I was training with him and he was never giving up and the moment and I just showed something like he gave even extra even more gas so when you started slowing down yeah and it was even pushing the pace even more and that's what I was seeing in his fights and I was just studying him and from that I learned so much and I respected I was still so much so thankful for that so and he's still my mental coach with that so easy my corner and every time when he says something I just think about I don't want to disappoint this man because he knows what how important this is and I think from the start last year or something I was really like a little bit skeptical about talking to people like like a psychologist or something I don't know just talk about personal stuff you know pretty deep with somebody you don't know is I don't know doesn't maybe in my mind just doesn't add up you know how does it feel good but still I got in the situation that I had - all right yeah I just I just had to and I went there and it actually felt pretty good so from that moment on I just kept on doing it just talk about just talk about stuff you know it's just you like like no other know what how many things happen of what everything that happens in your life and you just got a process - all that stuff but sometimes she just so many things happen in your life that you just can't process and you put them away and yeah and they're fucking with you in the back your head exactly exactly and then you just have the time take the time to talk about this stuff you just it just feels a lot better feels like it like a bag of bricks on your on your back you just fall off yeah it feels good so I think of it the same way you were talking about physical therapy that like if you have little injuries nagging injuries and get it massaged doubt and everything loosens up I think of it the same way if you're not taking a good account of what's going on in your mind you can develop like little mental injuries yeah exactly but for me and maybe a lot of people have maybe not nowadays but like from back in the days people say that like when you talking to a psychology you crazy right yeah that's what that's how people in Holland like yeah approached it well for here for a long time here for fighters it was the same thing like most fighters didn't need a psychologist that's not for winners winners know how to win you just don't be a pussy you go out there and fucking fight yeah but that's nonsense like you there's no pussies in professional fight you know you know but there is edge you can get an edge you can get an advantage whether you get that advantage from getting massaged or cryotherapy or from a sports psychologist there's advantages to be had yeah so but I think that's what my what I got from my dad is just being tough being tough and being hiring herself in whatever situation you're in just be tough on yourself and just because that's what he was he was tough on itself and so that's what I got from him and but now I just think that way just do tweak everything up and just get mentally imbalanced and especially when he passed away like almost two years ago it's just yeah it was tough was tough especially when the the relationship we had wasn't like was like on and off on and off and when it was on it was like a lot of discussion and he just just hurts and then things happen in your life and you just try to process everything and give it a certain spot but it's just hard sometimes and you just need somebody outside of your comfort zone to talk about that burn and yeah that that really that really worked and help for me so I'm very thankful for that and just you know I think always how I approach things is everything in life happens for a reason whatever positive or negative and sometimes you you know what happens and why it happened and sometimes you probably know it after like a few years and maybe you never know it but in my opinion everything in life positive or negative happens for a reason and just yeah it's on you whether you don't sit or doesn't if you decide that it does that it happens for a reason and you can find benefit and good or bad things then it does happen for a reason but you make that distinction that it's going to be for your benefit it can help you in the long run that's the difference between a person who takes things that happen adversity in life and decides that the world is against them yeah I'm oh I can't catch a break the world's fucked me over those people wind up becoming lose versus someone who says you know what we're gonna be fine this is gonna make me better it's gonna make me stronger this is gonna make me understand I'm even though I'm more vulnerable right now this is gonna make me understand myself better it's gonna ultimately make me better at everything I do if you decide that then they do then things do happen for a reason exactly and that's and that's one of the reasons I love watching your podcast because that's what you bring and especially what I think for people that maybe sometimes struggle with certain things or like you just explain in a situation or anything like fuck what the fuck did I do to life that constantly haven't been just backfires on me it's I always think like you are responsible for the choices that you make in your life and nobody else you're also responsible for how you accept or how you focus on your life exactly how you think about things and how you how you process it you're responsible for it yeah so and those those are things like are so important to me and that's why that and that's what I mean with I try to surround myself with people that boost my flame mmm and just look at my phone like go to it like who did I text or who did I call like you know those people need to boost my flame they need to be important in yeah one way or the other doesn't mean they have to to be important in business or in work or it can be in every in love or in family or whatever need to be important in some kind of way I just need to have positively around me because I've seen so many negative things from my family side that it's like it doesn't work drains you it drains you and I believe like it's like karma if you your negative you will attract more negative things your positive or positive things will come your way I'm 100% I believe that as well do you have a visualization plan when you go into a fight like say like this rematch with Badr Hari do you you gonna sit down and visualize certain scenarios do you train your your thought process to go over scenarios or to have a game plan and your mind the way execute the fight the way you would like to imagine it of course of course I think every fighter does and this is something you set aside like do you meditate and set aside time to do that or you just do that all the time no it's just just happens you're just doing it all the time you're in the car right I just yeah I just have them when you run the threat meal whatever it just it just happens when you you think about what's gonna what's going to happen in the upcoming months you just know that okay this is gonna be next level okay but how are we going to approach this fight what is going to happen what might happen if he does this I do that okay but this could happen and that could happen and in my mind before going into the fight I fought it already like a thousand times maybe even more because you're thinking about this this person and this fight for so long and for like three or four months that's that's a long time so that happens and whatever I always feel like what's fun to people to to realize is that my confident level during a period of like three four months into a fight goes like up and down up and down how is that possible you are the fucking best of what you do yes Mac and everybody in the in training camp and how does it happen I don't know but that is what happens I think that happens to everybody so you just accept the process you just accept the process but it's arts it's such a fucking frustrating process that when you're when you're here just try to get back up there again but you know that it's part of the process because I've been doing this for my whole life so I know it's part of the process but still it's frustrating so and that's what for examples a mental coach and a psychologist pew with to cope with that at that moment so that you don't stay here and you do climb back up again but it's it's and then you say wait but where does that come from can't come from anywhere you know from your body being tired like hey why can't I cope with this training or why is this training getting to me or during sparring why did I get get hit five times with the right hand and didn't block or react or whatever so it can come from anywhere and then the monotony of training as well right yeah yeah yeah so now this fight that's gonna be happening December December 21st how can people get it can is it going to be available on is it on UFC fight pass yeah it's gonna be USC fight pass and I believe it's on ESPN as well okay what did ESPN to do I think so but I'm not 100% sure well I'll find out and we'll make sure we tell everybody why don't when it's taking place so we'll make sure we get a bunch of people to watch that mess of course this is gonna be kickboxing history so it is it really is like you said probably the biggest fight in kick boxing history yeah of course we had so much so many great fights in the k1 tournament and it was it was amazing but this is just the one the biggest one on one fight and from this time from this time yeah in this era yeah this error every that everybody wants see well I hope a million fucking people watch it or more and I hope it really does open up the door for bigger and bigger fights because I think that it's look glories amazing you guys have so many incredibly talented fighters and so many high-level fights I fucking love it man I'm just such a huge fan I don't understand why it's not bigger in America I know Europe yeah but that's yeah for us the same thing so we just hope that during the years you know we just keep building it up building it up and hope like for example with with Antony opened up more opening up more gyms more great American kick boxers and American fighters will stand up and copied well don't be amazing who knows this might be it man this one might be the one
