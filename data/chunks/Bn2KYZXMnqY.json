hello freak bitches and I attributed it to cutting out refined sugars and refined carbohydrates oh yeah I think that stuff's poison there's been studies showing it also affects your brain and negative way as well and people that eat refined sugar you know there's there's more brain atrophy I mean there's lots of correlations the one thing I will say is that you know there are people that are super physically active and they're like working out two hours a day and you know those guys they'll use refined sugar just to like yeah you know they're they're increased transport you know glucose transported their muscles and we're using it as an anabolic way to like get bigger muscle and I know guys who do that after they work out the candy yeah I'm and and it it's not like it's it's you can't compare like people that aren't working out like two hours a day or you know like that to normal people a sedentary people weightlifters yeah weightlifter people that are just ripping their body apart there I mean there's a lot of savages out there that are doing crazy powerlifting workouts and benching and squatting and I know a lot of guys who like to eat candy afterwards right ya know it's it's certainly you know I think that those people you know it they're they're not it's not it's not acting the same way it's a radically different requirement that their body needs right terms of glucose right and and the thing is I mean still it's like the way I think about it is it's not really nutrient dense you know I like to like I'm like well there's lots of there's reasons yeah there's reason why I like to like take it if you want the sugar and you know even orange right or an apple or something like that or you should you know probably the better move than eating candy but I think they just want a ton of it and what is the what's the anabolic factor look if you were gonna eat candy or something like that has a bunch of refined sugar after like an intense workout what would be the anabolic factor well the glucose so the the workout causes glucose transporters that transport glucose to like go through the roof and so you start the Bluecoats from your bloodstream it's like sucked into the muscle and then in the muscle you know you're you're basically you can you can use that as a way to have insulin and it can be anabolic right where where whereas if you weren't doing that then the the glucose is in your bloodstream and it can all sorts of small dense LDL particles can start to form because the inflammatory transformations that happen and things like that that's at least my understanding that's in combination of course with amino acids which are also important for the growth of the protein muscle but that's my understanding of it I think so like in general though if someone could cut one thing out of their diet refined carbohydrates and refined sugars be a great way to go I think the one if you were to think about the one easiest thing that you could do that would have the biggest impact on your health and if you're talking for talking about we're not talking about someone who's already paleo or someone like you right we're talking about like standard American person yes the one thing that they could do to have the biggest impact on their health I would say is to cut out refined sugar like that's that's probably the biggest thing you know the easiest thing I mean I don't know how easy it is that you know it can be a dick very dick yeah and that's been shown dopamine levels you know can get activated game B was basically proceeded from the idea that what we live in is a game theoretic landscape right that the winners in this game theoretic landscape are individuals who have figured out where there is a niche some of them have figured out how to engage in something called rent-seeking which rent-seeking basically means making money without producing some without producing value so there's a lot of stuff that goes on in our economy that is not productive and good but nonetheless generates fortunes so that's rent-seeking as opposed to innovation or productivity you talking about like hedge fund type stuff moving money around well I want to be a little careful about this because it is quite possible for things like hedge funds to actually correct inefficiencies in the economy in a way that is productive it doesn't mean that that's the average thing that so what things are you referring to well I mean you know let's let's take the the ultimate example that will make it clear a warlord is not responsible for for building the road that they then stand by the side of and extort money from people who want to travel it a cable company may produce some benefit they obviously have infrastructure allows you to get content but what fraction of what you're paying for is actually about them delivering a service at some price and making some reasonable profit and what fraction of it is about the fact that they are in economic Goliath and that you don't have enough choice to be able to negotiate a decent price with them so there's some fraction of what they're producing that is productive but then there's a large amount of profit there that isn't about productivity or innovation it's about the fact that they own a choke point and you can't get around it so we don't know what fraction of the economy is rent-seeking and what fraction of it is productive but there especially if one is broad-minded about thinking about all the ways that one can engage in rent-seeking one can actually be destructive of value if you destroy future well-being for our descendants it may look productive in the present but it isn't productive it's actually destructive so that's a kind of rent-seeking that we don't even typically model but where where were we headed so oh yes so we live in a game theoretic landscape that's both good and bad as you point out competition is a healthy thing and competition in markets produces a huge amount of value so I hear people deriding capitalism and I always want to make the same point to them which is you've got two things glued together and you are challenging them as a package but there's no reason they have to be packaged so we would be foolish to give up markets markets are amazingly powerful engines of innovation they are capable of solving problems that we cannot solve deliberately even if we want it to so we need markets but we don't want markets ruling the planet and deciding that anything that spits out a profit is therefore good and that we should be exposed to whatever the market discovers can be viable so what we want is ultimately to provide and provide incentive structures that caused the market to produce things that are good for us right in other words if you tell the market that you want the solution to some problem the market can figure out how to solve that problem and it will do it very well but if you allow the market to decide what problems to solve it may end up for example addicting you to your phone right addicting to you to your phone in a way that harms your social relationships harms your your parenting of your children harms all kinds of things that are really important breaks the ability of your children to have a educational experience in school we don't want the market discovering how to disrupt useful functioning of people we want the market to stay out of that stuff and then to provide us benefits that only it can provide like all of the mechanisms that now allow us to navigate seamlessly in places that we've never been avoiding traffic that we wouldn't know to worry about right those are huge benefits and they're capable of taking a city that is too snarled with traffic and reducing the degree to which it is snarled with traffic so they're very powerful but we shouldn't we shouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater markets are good allowing markets to discover any and every mechanism for exploiting you is not good at all and in fact it's a large part of why we're in the predicament that we're in is that we let the market decide what problems to solve [Applause] [Music]
