damn the right foot specially put presidents and corporations people that you imagine if you had to work in a fuckin office for your whole life as old as we are now if we were in an office since the time we were like 23 24 years old right at school just everyday button-down try not to say anything that's gonna get you in trouble just trying to fucking make it to five o'clock and then immediately go to a bar and talk shit with your friends and then do it all over again on Monday I time it so I know you're in a meeting I know that you're in a meeting with eight white dudes a real serious about you know numbers have to be out statistics and I'll sign your phone rings you fucking open it up it's a picture with woman's vagina breaks up the hormonal I think God Joey Diaz exists because he understands what I'm going through that's tough that's tough corner sales meetings I used to go to sales meetings and they talk about don't you know what the Anthony Robbins are things did you well I was a burglar and what the engineer Robin CPS better burger know and I ended up kidnapping a motherfucker he said I walked on the polls I was all in with Anthony Robbins you know those really because I worked for a Subaru dealerships or Subaru paid for you to go to Anthony Robbins seminars so they would give me like three bills for the day for per diem I would go to Denver and do the Anthony Robbins seminar do it you should be a Subaru spokesperson who's more loyal to Subaru than you nobody he fucking loves Subarus love him love him I just cannot because he lived in Boulder I lived in Aspen yes and I saw vans I saw every type of high level costs been around and you just lose control and I give a lose control on Colorado I didn't but I did respond for a bunch of times yeah it wasn't fun it's not whenever you're driving in so it's touch-and-go you could get patches of ice and in Colorado at night you got a thing called black ice and you know I remember being I worked at the Crestwood I was security and I had to pick people up at the airport at night and I fucking did everything I could to get out of that job because when I was in a van with people doing the speed limit no alcohol you know me I just hit black ice and the thing started spinning and you don't know where you're gonna land you have no idea I was a you acquire it so you guys wire and I were on the way to the airport in Ohio and we cross over a bridge and bridges where you get it because there's no ground underneath it so things freeze quicker we went over this bridge just we just got lucky nothing happened we both went alright you know it stopped where we were facing the wrong way but there was no one on the road cuz it was early we were headed back to the airport and we just got packed in wine and just like okay I remember this I remember this like all the sudden you got no power you know I love German technology I love to look a lot of sport cars and everything like that but one I there's been nights happen at ten years ago I had a gig in Irvine and it was raining one of those January and cot in California just coming down I mean you couldn't see in front and cause a bulldog and I'm doing 75 minutes ooh why is a Subaru so good at that what is the big deal about Subarus what I first started with like I had never sold the car before I was a detailer and I became a French at the guy at Subaru and he bust my balls every day's name was Peter Pan dolphin Florida [Music] Florida went all the way up to Colorado to sell cars and he became man and I got I was properly introduced in those days they gave you 1,500 bucks the first month and they trained you for two weeks on cars I knew nothing about the car like when you had that car in the axle fell off you got rid of it because you're not a car guy you're not gonna get up on Saturdays and go to the Splore and find the piece from 1966 come it just some people have that love that shit Tim Al and Jay Leno Oh Gabriel I love them for that I don't have that gift so when I was introduced to the super I'm like yeah whatever it's just another fucking car and then I saw snowstorms and I saw how people reacted to superoes in Boulder it's either Subaru or a fucking 4runner yeah that's it I'm sorry I knew that said something you know once the snow drops that September snowstorm it's super-super was the first car that has an engine sideways the engine isn't in like usual cause that was the secret about Subaru engine side it's it's I've seen a few engines like that what do they call that in line is something like now in line is straight right that's like a BMW they have solid word for it I have it's super technology started there and then when I started selling Subarus and had a GL ten I was really impressed with because what it like let you do is if you went up if you won up Lee Hill Road okay and you made the left to go down into your property and there was snow you could press a button and the shock absorbers would fill up and your car would rise above C to go through the snow so all those little things the only night I had that way back then 1988-89 the GL pens the only knock Subaru had was that if you had a stick you couldn't keep your hand on it you couldn't keep your handling right so if I'm driving a stick boom I'm a woman - right I'm injury I got a kept my hand off it I could only the clutch cable that was the only knock they had so the question would break it would break if you kept your hand huh I had one of those break on me once yes so you have to go one then two then three then four I had to actually break him twice once I got stuck in second gear and I managed to drive to a parking lot and get towed that was in I had a 2005 or something like that 2004 2005 Porsche they just kept breaking and the thing that kept breaking was that that thing with the clutch and also the fuel pump see I was a GL 10 sedan I'm talking about the wagon the doodle up wagon was just a brilliant automobile and then I started selling Toyotas those things are still on the road just on the road guys and this is what I'm saying about the American bow I like the Subaru because I respect what they do with the American dollar well they do they give you $1 worth for $1 all right they really do for the American who's really looking for a fucking car to last I've gone in to Douglas Toyota and have seen trucks with a half of a million miles on it I'll tell you a truck that says a lot hmm when you're an American and you're a construction guy you know you're putting them bids in bah-bah-bah do you know Matt Farah smoking tire do you know that - no he's a big fan of yours he loves comedy he's got this great YouTube channel it's all about cars and they had a car a Lexus that they took - a million miles he had a million mile Lexus now who makes life's at the end of the day Oh des what the fuck could we do that's what I'm saying so when I had three Lexuses over the course of my life never had a single problem zero problems they just they just work didn't always work they just work all cars are so amazing now it's like the the the bar is set so high that if you just get like us like if you get a Mustang GT just a Mustang GT today which is like very reasonable like I think a Ford Mustang GT tell me how much one of those fucking things cost but it's got performance that you couldn't even imagine 20 years ago and it's probably under $50,000 it's probably 40 grand how much of those 26 26 26 hours is that for the regular Mustang or the GT I say it is my tectum GT but it says regular home okay so that's where I think the regular one might have a six-cylinder I'm not sure I think they still do that so I might be wrong about that premium fastback starts at 39 okay the and that's the one with the v8 right that's the coyote v8 it's a 5-liter v8 fucking rip wicked powerful like 460 horsepower I mean the power that you get with 40,000 45,000 dollars today it's just insane they keep getting better and better and better it's like where are they gonna code these well and the leases are great the lease is a great delete the deals they're giving me now I mean a buddy of mine just bought a Connie how to point half whatever interest rate oh you know four point I have mediocre credit it's a time to buy a car yeah yeah whatever the fuck you want Wow cars a good dog that's that yeah it's like you can't make a shitty car anymore like America went through a time period we just made dog shit cars and everybody knew that they broke and everybody was like looking buy American cars you you're gonna buy something that it's gonna cost the same amount but it's not gonna last as long and the Japanese just took the Germans they just took over it doesn't open then Lee Iacocca brought it back with the cake off you know it's the most hilarious country that's the cars my people the Italian a single car that's reliable when we had the conversation about my buddy who had the the Italian car he went he went crazy I'm gonna keep it in my roots the car is still in the garage bro rusty fucking the Bugatti or whatever the fuck Perry the new ones you can drive like a new one they're actually reliable for two weeks no no no no the new ones apparently it's like everything else they got to a point where they just had to have better yes I do de triumph we grew up on the triumphs the thing by Volkswagen I don't remember things by Volkswagen was that their little van thing it was a little van thing that that they're very there's like 10 left if you got a thing somebody'll give you a million dollars really they had a Subaru made a car called the JA that's it that's the thing Subaru made a car called adjusted three cylinder just a beat just to compete with the Hyundai when the Hyundai came out with the mutt 'mobile in 87 my Hyundai changed a game and they came out with the Istana what I'm like a little four-door car is 160 you know 150 down 150 a month busted the car industry Subaru yeah Pete everybody had to drop those tin cans just to compete those there was a lot of people driving those Hyundai's when they first came out I thought it was so cheaper but buddy of my god 50 150 a month yeah all day long a buddy of mine called Monday that I used to drive deliver papers with then he was telling me he's like look look these fucking Koreans man when they get into something they know what they're doing like if they're gonna jump into the car market that that's a disciplined group of people if they're gonna jump into the car market they're gonna make a badass car whoa listen and they're very reliable Mitsubishi for example Mitsubishi people hate Mitsubishi American why the hate myths of issue because Mitsubishi made the parts that were in the magnets that the American is one up against some World War two oh really so if you try to sell a fucking those those guys are all gone knocking that rest in peace but when you sold the car to a guy that did the reading I like there was certain Chrysler's that had Mitsubishi parts Ford had Mitsubishi parts on it because mr. B she's like the greatest biggest thing of car parts buses everybody has Mitsubishi parts on that car something belongs to Mitsubishi so if you had a Mitsubishi you're a bad person no no no no so when most some Americans old school veterans you know those guys that wear the jackets with the act with them when they come to see a car if you show them the Chrysler a certain type of Chrysler they go nah they got a Mitsubishi fucking can well tailpipe that makes sense because that's how pissed off they were about because the mag's would shoot down the Americans or somebody with something I get historic thing but that Mitsubishi got into the business Mitsubishi but still along unlike the eighties the late eighties they came out with that fucking car the Eclipse hmm remember the Eclipse I remember that yeah a little fucking car I had a Mitsubishi at one point I have story on every day yeah because they were cheap you know you go until you go into Toyota plans to buy your money you didn't speak to that dodge used to sell their version of the story on it was the conquest Dodge had the conquest TSI and it was their version of the star and it was the same car it was one of the rare times in history where two car companies have the exact same car the exact same car one was the conch was a story on that was it yes that red one right looks exactly like my buddy Jimmy to tell you yep my buddy Jimmy had one exactly like that when we were like 21 this is why it's very hard for a guy like me to fall for fans especially for cars because I've seen a lot of fan I remember Suzuki Samurai mm-hmm how many motherfuckers killed this is uki samurai was like the scooter you know these jerk-offs at the school just today thinking that that cool huh does the zookie samurai came around and it started tipping over things started tipping over but again take corners with the one feels like a sports car thing weighed 8 pounds I had a friend's tipping them over they were made of fucking ten and then one goofy down you know 150 a month and for fucking an extra 25 hours that a guy with a fan because you would die in these things people would die what the fuck yeah they sell these in the Studio City what is it it's a electric car that's like a one-seater it's a three wheel one-seater Electra meccanica I don't have to say it I think that's it Electra dad it's crazy and it's a one-person car yeah it's a bro it doubles as a casket that's what's great about that fucking car that your family saves 10 G's buy a casket they just bury in that fucking thing but if you think about if you have to get around everywhere it's just you most days and something like this is cheap what is the difference between being in that and being in a big truck where all that fucking empty fucking thing you ever drive past one of these idiots and you had a light and you actually look at them and you're like you're in his mind he's thinking he's the coolest guy in the fucking world that guy thinks he's fucking Ricky Gervais that's actually a cool looking one look at that fronts good hood scoop Joe that's a casket light no it's a hood scoop is that their high beams looks like a headlights but I think that's actually a real hood scoop for some strange lasting piece over it yeah what is that is that clear plastic over it could be because it's inside but I don't know I'm so crazy that's like the rx-7 the arcs was a casket for two was it remember the Mazda ah yeah I fucking hated that car you know why that's why because I was coming home on January 1st and I was one of the first people on the site and I was I don't know I don't want to sad and I was tripping on something I was on some type of drug but I wasn't over the hill I was still alert and we were like maybe the third car there and it was a Mazda then hit a pole head-on and it was split down the middle all the way to the windshield and I could hear the girl yelling oh my god and we were there the fire department came ambulance a couple heroes came out he was dead on arrival they saw the car and that's why I don't like those little cars their caskets that's the caskets hmm in those days and after that I'd never gotten to her except my buddy the devil had an rx-7 were they the ones with the rotary engine I don't know as Mazda has there's a sports car company that uniquely has a rotary engine it's a different kind of engine it's not like cylinders said it is Mazda yeah they got a different kind of engine to touch my car more modern Mazdas like mm maybe no no it was like 90s like before okay it was before I moved to California see look at that thing that's how the engine works instead of having a bunch of Pistons it's got this big fucking thing in the middle of it like I wish I understood engines to know why this is that different engines have yeah real car people must be going crazy I'm sorry I don't know shit so we're watching this video that says Mazda rx-7 rotary engine how it works and it's describing how it works it's a very strange video were you watching this thing rolling around inside of an oval looks like a big oval engine container it's very different but it's very fast it was the one that this guy had guess like I'm saying I'm think it's 93 or something like that it was really fast and it really handled really well too but it was a very light car these things are weird when like rotary engine that's weird like how come nobody else adopted that just but it looks like a badass watch you know see I didn't have a car education but by selling cars and Boulder I learned a lot now I forget that stuff I'm not gonna lie there because the the level of intelligence in Boulder from the University when they would come in the end I'm a boulder let's at the end of the day University Colorado you don't want to be an astronaut you know that is that where does like that's that's heavy-duty Boulder they have like a whole thing back there so those people move into town between them and the Japanese that move there they come to Subaru and they ask very intelligent questions completely different than a guy like you me or Jamie will ask the same weird um yes compared to what they will compared to what they'd ask like what kind of questions no velocity this that this and I'd have to find these answers for them because they were like astronauts I'd have to go in there was no computers in any fucking ate like that I could go on so I have to go on a brochure and really go into it and then they take the calculator out like there is type of people so that's why I remember learning as much as I could because there was so intelligent when they'd come over specially the Japanese guys they couldn't speak that good English but they would look at cause what's this what's the wait that's what's really amazing if you stop and think about the creation of cars and how they've evolved they keep getting better for a long time they did it without the internet a long time well some of them up the greatest cars ever created pre-internet you know there's just think about all the various forms of sports cars and 911s all those different Corvettes that came out all that shit was before the internet they were just looking at each other's pictures and looking at magazines and everyone was competing against each other to have the best handling car the best looking car best fuel efficiency things kept shifting over the years like for 10 years in America they didn't make anything good and for 10 years what would what would you use the years from American muscle cars when I say anything good I mean like something that like a muscle car lover other than the Trans Am the Trans Am is the exception to the rule Trans Am they made some you know those smoking the Bandit cars that people to this day still want that was in the 70s but from the 1960s like say 65 ish to like 70 America couldn't be touched those muscle cars were insane they just kept pumping out cooler and cooler shapes what did classic driver drove he drove a 1968 fastback Mustang got a bad mother phone yeah how bad a motherfuckers well it's a beautiful car the design is put the back end of the 68 Mustang is one of the most underrated forms in all of automotive design that's a 68 Shelby that's different that's a gt500 is a totally different shape the Shelby had a completely different set of rear taillights they had altered quite a bit about the Shelby like the way it looks in the front end as well there's regular 68 Mustang it just has this beautiful like contoured rear end look at that look at that that green car that is that's like a real modern looking like updated version of it real pretty you know with a phenomenal deep green paint job but look how good that rear looks that's what he drove that's what he drove motherfucker look at that that is Americana baby look at the tail end of that fucking vehicle man with the chrome and the chrome bumpers and the red headlights and the black behind look at that fucking car man no seat belt well they had those ones around your waist you like in the back you know waking up but no there's no seat belt about you bounced around like fucking rock back how many horsepower it's not that much not that much man of a really powerful car back then had like 350 horsepower like let's find out what was the 1968 gt500 that was their mo powerful one I wanna I'm gonna imagine this had like 400 horsepower say 1968 just Shelby GT 500 horsepower 1968 Shelby GT because that was their what they would do is they take it to Carroll Shelby caliber we take the regular Mustang just juice it the fuck up more power better handling better looks we're on it perfect yeah now who were they competing with like what was this is Ford right yeah they were competing against the Camaro at this point because they made a garbage the car in the cold back sort of the court that was like a little bit of a different category because it was a pure sports car where this car had back seats so that's a 400 horsepower it's so to compare to the Mustang of today the regular GT forget about the new one they have a new gt500 that has like 760 horsepower the new gt500 goes zero to 60 in like three seconds it's a monstrous one where they're making for that movie that just came out that was it the Ford verse Ferrari Oh for the moment I don't know I think it was that about race car I didn't see it was about it was Shelby it was him making that car I think like they had oh really make it or two days demand fuckin I didn't see well probably for the movie they got juice that up right I don't know the I told I thought they were race cars though I didn't think they were like these kind of cars it's like a GT car hey I don't know oh yeah this is the gt500 maybe that's what that was for yeah I think it's not even the gt500 I think it's the gt40 which was their race car I think it's because it's I'm pretty sure I saw in the I didn't see the move not you - no I think - aw I think it's a different GT I think it's their actual racecar racecar but the new one this Shelby has a new gt500 it's a ridiculous car it's faster around tracks than the new Corvette they have a new Corvette this crazy rear engined meet mid-engined rather Corvettes the newest Corvette it's the best Corvette ever and this gt500 is even faster than that it's bonkers right gt40 yeah it's a different kind of car that's the car that's only for the racetrack these guys these you're beat you could buy a Shelby gt500 today you walk out of a dealer showroom hi hi do you know how to drive yes sir here's my license like you don't have to hardly know shit and they'll let you just drive home and one of the most preposterous automobiles ever offered to man you just go pretty to a Ford dealership and if you have the I'm gonna say a Shelby gt500 a $80,000 how much does that cost but a brand new Shelby gt500 we really don't feel it yet already already okay how much one else cost 72 nine that's crazy 760 horsepower so for 72 73 thousand dollars you can buy a car that is so fast if you if you really can know that there's a difference between the speed of that and then the next car after that the next car that's more powerful you really should be in jail LCD oh it's dope is flaunting cluster yeah well a lot of cars are doing that now because they can get so much more information in front of you instead of just the standard gauges but do there's still something about them standard gauges see that Mustang electric car yes not bad it's not bad at all it's like a fat Mustang right yeah it's interesting right they're using the Mustang name for other shit now that's controversial that could cause a problem why not just come up with another name that's not a Mustang you know that's not a Mustang that's an SUV yeah what about it makes it a Mustang if it's alright why you'd like that they're talking about doing that with Corvette - the Corvette could branch off and become a brand like Cadillac is you know Cadillac is a brand it's you know it's synonymous with luxury you think of Cadillacs but it's a GM car and if they decide to take the Corvette model and just make it a brand and so have core dope SUVs like fast racy SUVs fast racy four-door sedans whatever sells cars man cuz did you see that Tesla's now valued at as much as GM and Ford together combined yeah whoops guys fucking dummies he's a super cheap yes just back off it's hilarious right yeah so going up today like God makes amazing cars he makes amazing fucking cars we're talking about Elon Musk Tesla is worth more today than what is it what's the stock Yemen for it's like it's over 500 now but like the market value is their combined yeah and everybody was saying it was gonna fall apart I think it's a beautiful car guys but I got to give more time especially the self-driving shit my brother has it's beautiful he's got the electronic one it was one login which one who I don't know yeah that's gorgeous but he was telling me to go to San Diego he's gonna stop in Commerce City yep and plug it in for 20 minutes and sit there like a bump on a log yep you do you know there's just so many different charging places I took an uber a couple weeks ago I got into a car that was just amazing that blew me away a fucking Honda Accord Hybrid well they're making everything Accord is that they make some nicer corner now this car even listen you get in the Honda you get Toyota sometimes I'll tell you it as much but uh Mitsubishi what's the other one Hyundai when you close the door there's a lightness in the metal that's where you see the you know there's a light that's like to be close a certain way when I get in here fucking Porsche and I close it that's that makes a certain noise you know it's yes think noise we've you uh you never been in my little tiny one I got a 1993 964 it's a real light car but the metal in it is so much thicker it this doors like trunk when you close the door chunk like you could feel the weight to it you feel when you tap the fenders to there's no give it's a different structure totally different so I was blown away by the Honda Accord Hybrid you know what we're playing paying for jam and it's just a great little car look another couple different options I was in Huntington Beach you're thinking about going away from Subaru and adding something to my collection just because I've always said you need a Cadillac you should be a Cadillac man - he gave me a ride last week I was in Huntington Beach I took the special uber uber spell and it was that Cadillac and he told me exactly how he got it what the scam is with them how to do it he has he hasn't had a problem the battery died and that's the that's their main not the battery's time one day you wake up I go to the commies alright I'll fuckin choke it you're wrong no joke I get in my Subaru the batteries never dead I wonder if they're more reliable now I don't know anything about them I've never owned one but I've rented a ton of fucking gorgeous that's a good car and when you submit what model is that it's yes that's the CTS ESV is that whoa that's a beautiful fucking car man look at that front end the design is just so it's so interesting it's after I left here the last time over the last two times a guy reached out and said he would give me one you need a Cadillac 560 I'm want the lease to roll down take it Joey I want to see you strolling around the Cadillac I would love it bumpin biggie having a lesbian car and it hurts my feelings like why are you driving a lesbian car lesbian fuckin Subaru you love a reliable car I respect that about you I want to get in the car and started I don't want to be in service I don't think these things are unreliable you know I got free service you know that the warranties they give you now or fuckin you know Volkswagen which you nobody buys look at that what is that that's a Cadillac cts-v look at that fucking car is that the coupe it's not a four-door it's hard to tell because the picture is so dark that's a four-door it's - yeah actually that little rear window it's not like a full window wow it's a beautiful car man they make some killer you know what's a killer fucking car right now if you want an SUV a Lincoln Navigator the new one is insane I wonder what happened in Lincoln they still in business they only make the Navigator and then they one other one or two other luxury coupes Lincoln which are very nice nice gorgeous then they went away like they just well there's this big 10 million of those palermo drivers and they stopped production on him so i didn't know what was going on with lincoln garden i know they just tapped out you know what's the shit is those 1965 s with the suicide doors come on son you know I'm never that bold I could not buy one of those cars you got rolling around in one of those 1965 Lincoln Continentals with the suicide doors like holy shit Riaan wanna drive dijon continental see what he drove Jamie you used to get out open the door sideways whatever his name was the black beauty Chrysler Imperial crown a beautiful for Wow let me see a picture of that 1966 Chrysler look at that thing we're looking at picture one ladies and gentlemen it looks like it has machine guns to poke out of the hood well that missiles that was the black beauty tell my god that's hilarious but I like I always like that's a car you had a fuckin car who made that one now that's a restomod Green Hornet now the new one that was the new one with Seth Rogen right yeah I didn't see that one no no the one we dropped that one look at that one people don't understand we're a little too young for it but people don't understand what an impact Bruce Lee had when he was doing the Green Hornet when people saw him do martial arts moves the way he did on screen like people wanted I mean you have to think about how many people would watch a TV show back then like if you had a TV show there's only like three different things to watch right like if you had a TV show you had the entire country watching one of three things and if you had a big show if The Green Hornet was the Green Hornet and on Sunday nights so was it was like stealing yeah everyone home you had you either had lawrence welk on fucking channel 7 on ABC look at he's p8 you didn't see this looks like I dropped and he just traumatized NBC NBC was traumatized only did 6 episode look how bad their fucking fight scenes are these look at these white guys faking punches oh my god it's hilarious to see like old school bad TV like fight acting like well you know the punch didn't hit them in the hair goes flying it's so weird especially because we're not playing any of the volume so we're just watching it so when you're watching with no volume you get to really see how preposterous it is how many how many TV shows that that guys you know that Spanish dude did about a thousand episodes of different TV shows from the late 60s all through the 70s who isn't I don't know what he's the guy that was starring right there right there that guy you know character actors were like fucking so huge back then but then Bruce Lee came on Sunday nights I still remember driving back from Miami with my family I like being pissed because I miss Bruce Lee then they cancelled it you didn't see nothing about Bruce Lee again bro how long was it between that and the big movies it was about a year and a half that come for movies were mainstream Five Fingers a death came out no the yeah Five Fingers at that it was all about the iron palm technique the guy would look at you and this pawn would turn pink and that started with that and then Fist of Fury came huh but I'm not gonna lie to you and tell you I went to see Fist of Fury in the movie theater I don't remember when Chinese connection came out that's what changed the ballgame but see it pisses me off today you know when I see fucking people with twenty years old talking about the impact of Bruce Lee or whatever first off let's get this straight Bruce Lee was a tough guy but he wasn't gonna beat Muhammad Ali that was so silly he wasn't gonna be Bob Marley he was whatever Bruce Lee Bruce Lee meant that the little guy had hope Bruce Lee gave the immigrant hope you know that's what all these guys all we fucking it changed everybody put a little bounce in the step he chose martial arts he changed martial arts but he gave you hope the movie theaters were packed martial arts schools were packed black people were going crazy because nobody sucked it anymore you see dolemite yet no I don't know again you know you gotta watch these shits if I'm gonna come on the show when Dolomites do you see it when he's no one you mean the new way to walk first over fucking my our boy stole the show our boy the dudes were you were gonna fucking MMA Oh whistles oh the fucking movie okay bad motherfuckers bad motherfucker bad motherfucker oh you know I'm sick and tired as people don't walk what happened to him nothing happened to him well well well Joe what happened to Dave Attell David Tao is getting stronger every weekend what you're looking at some fucking idiot jumping up and down on Netflix David Tao is getting stronger and stronger when you go see Dave Attell it's like people going crazy right now about uncut gems shit Adam

ain't no fucking Hemingway just to make little adjustments from the night before yeah that's it well you know you got this time when you're on the road and you can use it in a way that's gonna help you it can be it could be beneficial or you could just use it just one or two things right you got to figure out like what's optimal for you when you're on the road for me I always have better sets when I work out you have to work out always you have to work I don't like that weird fog that I feel when I fly into somewhere and then I just like get ready for the show my chest fucking there's something about like it's hard to get everything going but if you just get on an elliptical machine for 20 minutes it points listen to some good music and just say there's no option you have to do this just fucking do this once 10 minutes gets going then you're sweating you're having a good time then you're fine for 40 minutes or more we've been friends the 23 years you've been taking me on the

be a meet or is by me doing somebody one time and then you go that wasn't right and then I'll never meet two again for me I was weird adjectives all I started out with it I opened up with it to really put myself in the fucking hole of that is that there was a class an adverb what is that me too and is it a verb if you meet you somebody has to be an adverb yeah second yeah the only way you learned out of me the only way you learn how to not beat me to meet or is by me doing you shoplift a candy when you were a kid right yeah and your mother told you smack nice because that's not right same time with me doing this la is a fucking me too was invented here they fuck Marilyn's Martin Monroe to death they did that a vaginal thing looks like fucking that fucking Embassy in Tehran whatever they bombed what was that famous Fatty Arbuckle case where there was a disgusting people is you know between the Bikram documentary did you see that one I didn't see that filthy fucking animal getting women to suck that fucking 90 degree weather six yoga session dick that's just cruelty to animals you could put you in jail for just sucking that desk you know the Harvey all that shit happens here but as us as men we've all made some money when you were a kid my mistake for me I was in love with this lady named fate she was 37 at big juicy tits she'd wear hot pants I was about 14 I had never even seen a vagina no titties nothing and we used to play basketball and our two dogs were blind she had French poodles and she had flip-flops and she crossed the street and she was so hot she was 38 and she had an her husband that was like 60 he would just barely be alive like that dude from Texas that was fucked a Howard Marshall and he would watch her cuz he knew he was savage through things like that she had two daughters and the daughters were badass and but one of my goombas dated one of the daughters I never told him I was alive each time I play basketball failure would come on the game would you stop and she turned for us and the Sun would shine through a halt remember all the time in the seventies and she had really yummy titties with the nipple stick another drove me crazy I was 13 14 I love who that I'd see her in the window with pants on she looked delicious and finally summer of fucking 79 I'm getting all fucked up with some friends of mine I've been drinking fucking nips we started some angel dust and we're listening to Led Zeppelin - if you're gonna fucking his body Led Zeppelin - is the album to give you it starts off with a whole lot of love that just gets your hips moving and then it goes into the lemon song and he's talking about squeeze me baby - the juice runs down my leg I'm like that's it the juice is running down my leg my mother was a flower chicks yet flowers everywhere I put on like a shirt I swear to god it had to be about that because she would walk the dog at night but the husband called you 15 the dog would sleep that the husband would pass out by 8:00 so she would take the dogs out for the 10 o'clock the last she would pull him down and you know they were kind of blind French poodles and she was still wearing a fucking tighty whities you know the defense Dixie deuce is in the 70s before days even it was invented she already had the Daisy on with the shirt and I remember being on that angel dust hiding in the weeds exception like fuck and with the flowers that flowers for I was gonna bring her flowers but my plan was to attack it like his jumper in the thing throw it down and get with the flowers is how crazy she was gonna attack her like I couldn't take it normal like I wanted to marry her like that's how fucked about anywhere not an angel dust and I was on edge of this it was what I would tease see crystal call it what you want it's animal tranquilizer no matter how you look at it and I remember that I ran up on her and she turned and she goes Coco what's going on I go and I just stopped when I go fight I'm in love with you I said what are you talking about I'm I fell in love with you for two years I want to run off with you fuck my mother I'm like I just let's get a job let's let's leave Wow and she's looking at me like wait a lot like I was retarded first of all she's gonna be like this kid is fucking snapped and she have you been drinking and like I still love you take the flowers and she was I'll tell you what if I divorce my husband I'm considerate and I was like okay I can live with that can I give you a kiss I like kissed her on the cheek I like to feel the heat going up my head and finally as I went to turn away I looked at her like she had the juiciest legs in the world I know can I touch your thigh and she goes go ahead Jerome and that's like her kneecap and my dick just exploded that sperm I ran away like Steven Seagal honestly Steve mister got run he runs like a fucking retard put that little lip be Steven Seagal run there's a couple for you ever see him run and he runs very straight and was very tall what's the first one he did that's really good love the law look at him look at how he rise he runs like a fucking retard look at him look at him can you imagine he's just built odd he's just really tall he does run a little loose with the hands which is kind of confusing which one was this one this is that's a sector that's above the law it's cut no it's got no oh it's all it's a bunch of different movies now because now he's got more hair right because people goof on them because of the way he runs yeah he was married to Kelly LeBrock dog at one time dude one time he was the man how many times I jerk off to Kelly LeBrock and woman in red one of Gene Wilder calls to her he this is what it is his steps are too short and his wrists flip around because he's used to do in Aikido right you still like Jojo don't put that going please don't protect them no don't throw ice you know in there those Japanese people work 3,000 years to put Aikido on the map and now you're gonna set the back that poor aikido school and Burbank has moved eight times they keep losing students it down to two students wearing a smock and a fucking sword who's gonna go for Aikido as someone who doesn't really want to fight and you want to you want to be able to passively get someone away from you which is not realistic but the sword part the sword part could come up if shit hits the fan if we go back and you know if we get knocked into the Stone Age nuclear war with Russia we gonna see a beat now and he's joined again no dodged sticks yeah they moved their bird back and I've thought about when I was a kid I went to Aikido for about two weeks it's probably fun the guy's name was Richard ball he was I supposed to be a big time and gottenberg New Jersey mm-hmm and he taught that deflection stuff but Steven Seagal and above the Lord took it to a different level that out that a harm that throat slam oh yeah he's got the deflection throat slam that's fucking beautiful I had a meeting with a guy in a in a movie there's this like my agent sent me in to meet with this guy they were looking for someone to do like a Steven Seagal type movie they were looking to they were gonna try to create an action star and we actually had like a argument about this movie that move right there but the less poisonous throat I got carried away of the law and the one we fucked up the Jamaicans oh yeah which one was that without swords then sword fighting and hard to kill wasn't that that's the one that pissed me off as well oh you're in a coma for four years into these two days later you throw in a sidekick yeah and he's putting like Jesus Christ Jesus Christ yeah I loved it I'm on time I love to do I loved in to I like the thing about him man is I think in that first movie it was one of the more unique martial arts movies like above the law like it's almost a shame that he made a bunch of movies that weren't as good because if you go back to above the law in terms of like martial arts history and above the law is a legitimate historical movie in terms of martial arts movies because it was the first movie where you got to see a real Aikido practitioner with a hybridized system of martial arts like he was doing our Kido but he was also throwing a lot of punches and knife hand strikes and a lot of strikes it was a showed the bodega feed and above the law just split play this out that's the bet all y'alls this guy look at all the bullshit I mean I've made fun of him as much as anybody but listen his Aikido skills were very legit he was very legit whether or not that stuff's real or not that's a subject for debate whether or not it's really effective when you look at other things like wrestling and jiu-jitsu is it the most effective way to grow or judo is the most effective way no it's not but no one knew that back then and he at the time in the 1980s and 90s was a world-class martial artist he just had a style that ultimately didn't really prove to be the best style but so did I I was doing this is this is hard to kill a lot of people were doing kung fu a lot of people were doing things that they thought were legit but they really wants the UFC came around we found out oh this is not the best way to do it this is 87 that's a kid in this scene that was just in a movie with Clint Eastwood Emile he's been doing movies for fucking 30 years I can't right now that dude with the tattoos how many fucking movies is he's been a bad guy in right there the second guy that guys in every fucking bad guy everyone great quiz he what's his name he used to live in Vegas I heard he had some a restaurant and they not even sure I love a good shitty drama a good shitty cop drama like I love I love like going back and watching some 1990s cop dramas they're fun Kojak Oh pop at the end how about beretta but rather how about that fucking you know which one was good bro that they gotta bring back but wise guy what was wise guy a good-looking dude with the fucking he was undercover with the Mafia but he really was a cop from the CIA like a Donnie Brasco type situationally good-looking dude really a good-looking this is it right here he fucked people up no no this is a movie wiseguy was a TV show is robust isn't it Robert wall Robert good-looking dude he came out with Paul Newman and uh Fort Apache the Bronx oh why is God the TV series what am I looking at here Jamie just fell back remember that guy yeah you remember that do Rock who's that dude does it say see go to just a regular search of it instead of watching the video of it that's right there are so many of the number wings wings forget and Jan Michael Vincent yes was he sure that's no no no wings was the TV show on NBC right yeah Jan Michael Vincent wasn't in wings wait Jan Michael Vincent wasn't some show about fuck and war Ken wall Kenton Jan Michael Vincent was in some movie about a TV show about pilots in the air that hunted you down on CBS that's when he went fuckin that's when he went crazy that's what he wanted crazy well he went crazy like straight from the the mechanic like he went I think it was famed that probably did that guy in write famous alcoholism yeah but a lot of that is probably the bear wolf and telecare werewolf yeah seasons that guy in the mechanic if you go back to the the original Charles Bronson version the mechanics he was slated to be the next big superstar right he was he did a movie for Disney with the Kurt Russell called the world's greatest athlete and right Dave fuck things up he was he was a Disney guy first you don't know the world's greatest happily uh he went to pick up the weights in his arm stretched him and fucking that was his first movie it was a Disney movie and then he went on to become Jam Mike when the mechanic look yeah look at him dogs who's handsome dog he was the first Brad Pitt he was look how gripped he is - he was the runner up it look at this science fiction where he's out sprinting black guys there's a science fiction movie this is a science fiction this is why he was the greatest the world's greatest that with beautiful hair this white guy is out sprinting everyone else looks like they're straight out of Jamaica right out of Jamaica track to you this is a ridiculous film look how much further he is ahead of than those guys who you know would beat him in a real race he would the black people cheering for me even the brothers at Rikers he did look fucking fantastic back then though like look what kind of shape that guy was in look at the guy from good times Howard this is a great movie this is one of his first movies that blew him up Danny got the mechanic and fuckin that's how they kill him people today with the rock good times dr. T Beach a member that fuckin saw an audition about 15 years ago the wander the neighbor oh that's an she still look good she's the neighbor lady yes Guinea door pull up the cast of the good times dude this this show JJ Walker still to this day is known for one saying dynomite if he won't say unless you'd give me three grand then I'm gonna send them back I don't know Chloe's had given him 1500 a week and he's like who you want me to say dynamo yeah but wait give me that like that the names of everybody just go to Hall yeah look at that fuckin show 1974 first episode this was a show like every that was interesting right because there was a Jackson it was a quite a few even though there wasn't that many television shows there was quite a few big-name black shows Sanford and Son good times The Jeffersons like during that era even though there weren't that many TV shows there was quite a sizable show Oh shadow tremendous yeah I forgot about that show tremendous yeah dude to this day Sanford and Son is one of the best sitcoms of all time there's some fuckin episodes of Sanford and Son that I'll listen to or watch rather to this day and I'll still laugh at Faso fuckin raw and I wish Network television would look at that and go it's time for us to take the sticks out of our ass again they can't they're stuck well somebody has to do it first it's just gonna be their own demise no you know what comedians you're a comedian i'ma come and I try real hard this was our early education this class and a better education than watching and here we're watching remember watching Paul Mooney write these lines mm-hmm Paul Mooney was one of the writers on this so we had Richard Pryor on one hand but then you had this sick fuck he hated Puerto Ricans I don't want no border regions my house he hated the other name the other neighbor Kyle America this is Friday nights and then it was followed by Chico and the man yes you know Freddie Prinze CBS had their answer a fucking of Archie Bunker which will never happen again every year they try to do under different aren't you bunker they're never gonna do it cuz it's not coming from the heart yeah they can't sell it like he did that he does a sane when when he hit one Sammy Davis jr. has to kiss him like there's a scene of fucking when Sammy Davis close the actor's name again Carroll Carroll O'Connor telecom Michalka he grabbed Cal O'Connor and kissed him in the fucking lips that you know melida forget right here all this shit you know what's crazy Carol Connor was like a great actor an actor for his whole life but he's known for sure more than anything for being Archie Bunker right here look at his face yeah like it was supposed to be funny that Archie Bunker was racist I'm by the way just for the record there would be always thought he was a black Jew you better throw Cuban in there - his mother was Cuban Sammy Davis jr. yeah his mother was Cuban I'm afro-cuban now look at everyone laughing at him because Sammy Davis jr. kissed him he freaked out look at everyone laughing at him you kid like gay jokes black jokes white jokes Puerto Rican jokes they they talk shit about everybody on that show you go back in TV male ten years and you never see the difference you go back and film and there's some films that write off this start there are offensive oh yeah they 'z world a very offensive I just saw something that was on like regular TV of me and my wife and I would this wouldn't fly today it was just something that was on like at nine o'clock wouldn't fly but what about Ace Ventura pet detective it was all about a guy who was trans a guy who was pretend it was cross-dressing at the very least like pretending to be a girl but it turns out to be a guy the whole time and everyone's disgusted because they kissed him thinking it was a girl so everyone's throwing up and like you would never be able to do that today it would be transphobic people would freak out do you remember that no there's that pretty lady who was in a bunch of movies back then but then just like went off the rails Shawn young remember her she was in Blade Runner she was the beautiful young robot in Blade Runner she was in a bunch of movies man but then she just went off the rails she she's one of those Gen Michael Vincent type characters for a bit I think well just a pressure of it all was just too much so this is the scene at the end of it does that Courtney Cox with the gun yeah and there's Sean Young that's that lady and so we find out in this scene that he's really or she's really a guy or I don't get it or she's how do you say it today you can say it's a guy pretending to be a girl but you don't say that anymore now now you say what she's trans so but we're supposed to believe that she's got a giant hog under there where's the scene oh yeah he's got a lead up to he's explained yeah I think to them so he tells them all that that's a guy so this is like some bad guy they've been looking he's the famous kicker from Miami Dolphin that's right oh that's right Wow that's right that's right and he's angry because he fucked up but you know all these cops know about this one game yeah boom there's the part so she's supposed to have a tucked in right there rights or something and they all flip around tone lokes in there too there's Captain Winky no he's good he's gonna turn her around so everybody can see that she's got a hog turn around what's it yeah cuz it's the big reveal there it is look at them all throw up everyone's throw it up like tone locusts clean his tongue up your dog's gone up strung up now he saw a woman with a dick so let me ask you a question a couple of weeks ago Disney Plus for me mmm two days later people drawing fits what do you want them to do to go back and take all this shit of is all movies well that's a good question what do you do you ever go to Disneyland you have that one ride what is it a Splash Mountain yes that Splash Mountain ride is based on a movie that you can't even watch anymore Liz it was a really racist movie Walt Disney was racist was he not I don't know I don't know this Splash Mountain was places this is it's called the song of the south that was the movie and it from what year is that Jamie 6 1946 probably people were different animals back to her we're not even the same species was about the lady who sang the national anthem at the Yankees somebody found out that 30 years before that you didn't know about that no you gotta look this up she sang songs that were like totally racist like spooky get out of town like shit like this please look it up right nationally right now so two ball fields took her version of the national anthem now you had to read this shit she was handsome ence god bless america out at Yankee Stadium over racist song listen to the song she said whose kids I'm fucking fat chick from 19 2013 19 31 song yeah that's why darkies were born wait a minute she sang this in 1931 yeah how old is this bitch is he still alive it's like the recording of God Bless America from back then that they used to just play during right she sang that but when did she when she was record in 1937 the way did she sing the national anthem no no it's the god Bless America is what they're talking about here okay but when did she sing god bless america 1929 1930 something I don't know back then but she also song sang a song called that's why darkies a boy I was confused I was thinking you were saying that she sang it at listen to the lyrics someone she pick cotton someone had to pick the corn someone had this be a slave if somebody had this thing that's why darkies were born oh that you know I mean all these things the song which has been called a satirical take on racism was a big hit for Smith and also was recorded by a Paul Robeson hmm hmm so she wrote and sang god Bless America so the version that you would hear like God she sang it so that recorded it so the version that you would hear would be back then right so yeah see that's a that's why she gets weird you know there's been a lot of great people over the years that have had some horrible ideas oh so you have to wonder like like if we just cut out the guy I mean how many people different people who have invented incredible things that we use all the time we're also really shitty human beings like you know about that Fritz hopper guy the guy that he created this ability to this method to extract nitrogen from the atmosphere and then use it as fertilizer because the air apparently you think of the air is oxygen it's not most of what you're breathing in most of what our air is is 80s I think it's like 80 something percent nitrogen and so this guy figured out a way how to extract nitrogen from the air and because that population boomed because we had more food because they could they could lay down more more fertilizer so he did something good yeah but he also invented nerve gas he was the first guy to propose and implement a poison gas strategy against against Europe when they were when the UK and when the whatever the the whole group and what was was how World War one or two where they did that I want to say it's too right is it to whatever war it was in they were the first people to get so this guy who had created the harbor method for extracting nitrogen at the same time was wanted for war crimes because he figured out how to gasps gasps the the enemy and he was working for the Nazis and he was a Jew the whole thing is crazy it gets even crazier they eventually started imprisoning Jews and kicked them out of the country and he's still there and so he eventually winds up leaving his tail is fuckin crazy but that guy also invented the same gas they used to gas the the gas the Jews and concentration camps he invented it but he invented it with a smell to it so you could detect it and they were gonna use it as like I think it was a pesticide or something like that you talking about a monster yeah I thought I think it's a chemist he's John Lennon he he wrote Benny and the Jets please Maggie Yoko I'm saying no misdeal a monster but he's one of the like that he's seen fifty percent of the nitrogen in our bodies today are from the Harbor method fifty percent so he invented something that literally changed the way people couldn't eat I mean they probably saved billions of lives I mean I don't know I mean I'm just guessing but I would imagine one of the biggest problems that people had back then was when you couldn't grow things places when you didn't have enough food I mean it was a real touch-and-go situation before refrigeration and then before you know large-scale trucking and agriculture everywhere like we have today and how much of the nitrogen that we use came because this guy figured out otherwise they would just use like dead fish and things like that they'd have like compost that's what fertilizer was bones would grind up bones but he's also a monster also you know they figured through his work how to kill people with gas they just gassed entire troops fucking crazy shit man when no one had never done that before I mean you got to think back then people would I mean think about this the the the war the independence war right the war for independence against England when they would wear the British where those crazy outfits with the white right across their chest they were perfect targets they'd be walking to the forest and these Hillbillies just pick them out because they were walking like they're in some sort of old-timey war like they used to do wars like they had rules for war now there's rules for engagement and then when a general would lose he would hand his sword over to the other men sometimes they wouldn't even take it because they were trying to be polite and they would have these rules like gentlemen rules for killing people and then this guy came out with a method hey how about this have we were just gassy some other fuckers just drop gas on them kill everybody just you let them choke to death in their own blood literally your body just vomiting blood it's coming out of your eyeballs everyone around you is dying from the same thing you just hemorrhaging just dying because some genius scientist who also created a method to extract nitrogen out of the air that fed millions of hungry people also figured out a way to do this awesome fucked up it's fucked up you just breathe me out yeah well sometimes great people have done horrible horrible things but that guy invented something that we all use it's a it's a tricky thing being a person you know people are slippery there's a lot of good and bad about us it depends how you use it yes it depends how you use it well that's why being a comic is like one of the most fulfilling things of all time because people get something out of it like if they go to see you like the reason why you're willing to eat dick it's because you want to develop these bits and have them crush get them to that point or when people come to see and they pay money to see you boom you lay them on them and like that feeling that you can do that you can give to something when you see someone just laughing so hard there's one of the greatest feelings a person can ever experience and not a lot of people get to experience and you imagine how important laughs there is in your life so have for a certain point like it's urine it's like you know you need sleep yeah you need food and if you really have a laughter but you also have to learn how to laugh at yourself yes and once you conquer that your life changes completely yeah that's 50% you know you know the number one killer is stress that's number one you think I could kill you yeah is you being stressed out but humor I mean I love getting high at night doing edibles and finding stupid videos this is watching that whole stand-up real yeah I'm just laughing my fucking ass off I love it I love it I'm enjoying it more every day when you have kids you really laugh at this shit they talk about you know did I laugh at kids movies I watched Dora the Explorer the the live-action one one the new one we remember it's hilarious this summer was legit laughs in that movie I got bad movie people the last couple of years I've gone to see maybe seven or eight mainstream films by probably seeing 20 kid films yeah and I leave those films blown away so you know what's fucking great Jumanji I had a new one it's as good if not better than the first one the first one was fucking great those damn great well at least you leave there feeling something you know some of these movies I go watch I'm like what the fuck was fast Jumanji hits a perfect balance between it's like it's a family movie but you don't treat you like you're a moron it's fun and it's it's you know they're trapped in a video game so it doesn't have to make sense it can be crazy and so it is crazy but it's a fucking great movie it's a great movie both of them are great they're fun you leave you feel good you laugh your ass off good and they ride the edge perfectly of it being enjoyable for old people but hilarious for kids kids think Jumanji hilarious so you could sit there why you know I took my nine-year-old the other day we watched it for the second time just me and her laughing ah that was so funny the rock is great Kevin Hartz great that chick who plays I don't want a spoiler alert and then she plays more than one for some strange reason I can't I don't spoil it but she's fucking fantastic that uh the Asian lady that was in crazy rich Asians what is her name Ayane FINA yeah how crazy is that name she make that name up she must have was a rapper too she's a rapper yes she was also no yeah really yeah no well that make sense yeah I can't say without giving it away why she's so good but goddamn she's hilarious yeah well I like the most that has really given me a great bond with my daughter that some of these Pixar movies use music from our era oh you don't know how many times she's I'm gonna car driving I'm listening to classic rock and she's in the back saying it and I'm like my dick just got hard she knows my music you marry me she knows yeah music yeah and it's because of those I don't know what Pixar movie are exactly but they use music from our era and she'll go Daddy I know that song let me see the video well they do that with some movies like Marvel did it the best with guardians of the galaxy Chris Pratt's character is into cool old songs like if you ride the ride at Disneyland they have a guardians of the galaxy ride and in it there's all these cool songs like Jackson 5 or slow ride like crazy cool old school songs that play while he's going through his adventure so part of guardians of the galaxy he's got headphones on what is that song he's listening to yeah he's got this one song he's got a old-school cassette walkman and he's got the headphones on a shit and he's kicking the shit out of aliens while he's listening to this badass on but it's like those old classics there's something about songs that are from a different time that it's it's not just that it's a great song but it's also that its history like it's both things you know using my total business to I want to kill myself hooked on a feeling that's it blue suede all that music drives me fucking crazy fucked my life that one

and they will fucking tremendous I mean fucking tremendous Tommy Chong gave me this yeah it's too big listen it's all cute it starts off cute like you burn me you know you burn a ninja bit of two laughter I don't want to light it though I'll miss it I like keeping it right here on my desk as a kid when I was little big bamboo my stepdad they've had a big bamboo but I listened to it when I was like I mean I couldn't have been more than nine I was nine years old and I was listen to that I'm the have system aerial phenomena I don't remember I remember it I think big bamboo was the one whether like Dave's not here man I think that was that one just to know those guys fucking genius is that Tommy Chong is a goddamn genius and so Cheech that they still put they put a rolling paper in the thing and yeah the album was wrong page yes it's system elephant yes Ralph and Herbie let's make a dope deal that's right let's make a dope deal if you want me to tell you something this is why I got into podcasting this was my biggest appeal about podcasting that guys like you and I grew up listening to prior yeah John yep Carlin and I'm like I listen my my albums of choice as a kid were there were three by Richard Pryor this one and I like the Lenny Bruce live from Carnegie Hall for some reason hmm that's my album collection of stand-up comedy I love a Bicentennial negative niggas crazy as if something was it something I said that's Richard Pryor's best work those are great creates rich all rises much more great great alamos but just raw and it makes you listen you know this year was the first time since 1987 that albums outsold DVDs they're making a big comeback really we made a big fucking mistake 30 is we all drank the fucking kool-aid and there wasn't worth it there was some jerk-off people you know again what Iman we were we were doing great with the album the music industry was doing great with a thing called the arm why because you want to buy kiss on Saturday this fucking guy wants to buy Led Zeppelin and I want to buy REO Speedwagon you all got paper outs on Saturday we got to walk down to the fucking record store look around he changed his mind he went with Jethro Tull then we went back to Yost cuz your mom worked on Saturdays and we got two joints and we rolled them up in the album and it was a process you put the Almonte and you rolled and you read the lyrics and you read the things that they put in it then they took that away from you and they gave you the first dudes with the dudes what to the reel-to-reel oh yeah I didn't know anybody personally yeah nobody was buying you know you got to be on a show up with a movie thing to listen to fuckin Julie and you got a Spruill it in the hotel so that one out fuckin quick then they would they switch to something else in track then we said oh no the 8-track was already gone pretty much yeah that's my track started to move out cassette was big cassettes were big everybody dies what's that many discs many discs many this Wow and then I remember the CD but then I still remember buying like movies like going on me but buying a movie opening up the thing and it just be like an advertiser and a fuckin CD oh and that's when I stopped I go this is what I'm getting for my money now so when I buy a fucking CD from a record label I open it up and it's a CD would have didn't even don't even put time into the cover anymore when you buy Pink Floyd's wish you were here out Jesus Christ they must have put a year just into the cover hmm the guy shaking the guy's hand and Warner Brothers the other guys like on fire yeah they put time in so I think that and everybody kept saying sound well the sound CD didn't listen just to put that fucking needle on again I wonder how many fucking turntables are sold in America last year for the album to come back and I have one in my office and I go to I go to two different places he's my son headphones would you listen just the speakers when I listen in the office I put them on with the speakers at the office it's when I listen to it at home I got the headphones it's um it's a different experience right you're like you're sitting down like you're watching a show almost to think about music when I'm streaming it as I'm almost always doing something I'm very rarely just listening to music I'm always listening to music while I'm driving or listen to music while I'm working out or wild flying I don't hardly ever just listen to music sit down but when you have an album when you have a record player I think that the it would definitely make you more inclined to treat it like an event you know just have a cup of coffee smoke a joint sit on the couch just listen to it just listen to it listen to some bars you know listen I get anxiety about 20 to 8:00 every night 22 8:20 date right around that same time yeah because for years that's when I was thinking about when I was on the score coke so till this day that's the PTSD I got that at 7:30 I start giving Zionists or getting itchy I really want intended to do was to maybe lower jujitsu it but sounds like wash you know my boy just got a 5:30 class I've been trying to make him for three weeks 5:30 it's just rough I'm at 10 o'clock in the morning type of guy yeah well the latest ice to always take 8:30 class at night that's that's that's at this age yeah it was hard to go on it was hard to go on after on stage afterwards - that was no no I like I don't mind all that it's just gonna have a rolling and everything - kid what you're not fucking killing yourself for an hour and I have you should you know you warm up and you drill the technique and then you fucking you know for me I'd do three rolls and I gotta go after that I'm just it's a little demotion when I was training in tenth planet all the time with Eddie's nighttime class 8:30 class yeah it must fill with murderers most it was it was killer be killed and they need go all nice guys so I don't want me no no nobody they're just really good but you would go from that and then go I'd go on stage I feel spent sometimes I'd go on stage afterwards I have flat sets because I was just too tired I was just to mail it out I'd you know I've been spent 90 minutes with guys on your back trying to strangle you and try to it's just you get there like you you don't have the same pop and you work out at night still I'd like to work out about all different hours of the day that's what I like to do well I like to do me who worked on at night all the time like three days ago maybe what time late 10:30 I could do what people are asleep that's what I like to do when people are sleep I put fights on put fights on just you know got all the shit there kettlebells there I got a bar there got chin-up bars we got you know things do that glue paint glute-ham machinae do sit ups off of that and back extent I would just do like nine sets of kettlebells like swings and leans couple goblet squats and I'd be happy like at 10:30 it says it's a zone at 7 o'clock though 7:30 8 o'clock I got a rush but not it's not really it's kind of exercise but I gotta get out of the house so I usually go by the office I'd do two bong hits I listen to one side of it out mmm I just pick them out so nice it's comedy some nights it's fucking rock music and once the album is over I shut it up with the album back on the cover my get in the car I go I'm like nah most of the nights I do that I really don't have nothing to do so I got a half-hour window but I put her in the tub I leave by the time I come back nobody knows not let me ask you this do you when when you're writing comedy like when you when you're working on bits are you how much time you spend in offstage and like how do you do it like are you are you one of those guys that just has an idea and you drive around I know a lot of guys are looking like right and shit down they just have an idea and they just bounce it around while they're driving around and then like maybe they'll remember some bullet points or they'll bounce it off a friend and then they'll try to do it on stage how are you doing it now because I'm very serious about it it starts with a pad and a piece of paper and pray to God that that I could just remember the idea to get it out of me at the Comedy Store right I just want to get the idea let's worry about the joke later mmm so that's the first thing right get so you have a premise so you get the structure of the prep let me get this out I want to talk about that that Netflix show don't fuck with cats I keep forgetting don't fuck with cats there's wires rule number one that they told me when I moved from Cuba through a rock to the cat woman and a black guy go yo I'm fuck with them motherfuckers some dude on the internet decided to fuck with cats and have you watched his doctor series no it's gonna blow your mind it's gonna blow your mind it's a Netflix that likes 10 episode documentary that's something you go it's called opiates what did you get me involved Jodie's it's called don't fuck with don't fuck with cats it's like three episodes I watched two of them last night actually like a bit yeah it's like remember the old school Internet shit from the early 2000s where there's weird shit online yeah people were discovering who the fuck was doing some of that and like fall they fell down some fucking weird holes oh really this is crazy shit yeah yeah disturbing is fuck is it three episodes because I think that I have I believe so yeah watch three yeah yeah I think it was more it's called don't fuck with cap don't fuck yeah that's it that's it don't cuz this is how the party starts oh my god tremendous and you know what was on TV last week the reason why I called you but I didn't want to tell you until afterward I wanted to talk to you about on the show i Boyd made it come back he ain't gonna lie he got another week and a half left to live who Michael Bowden made a comeback because of the abstain family Michael badan badan yeah the Epstein family yeah I'm just doing I did okay that's my boy yeah boy survived that show you and me both oh my god cuz I should remember having conversations about with you about saying you can't come in a crime with that guy around dogs too good because once he gets on it the most memorable thing he ever busted was you ready for this G he found they found the torso in New Jersey belonged to a woman the guy did a great job he kind of waist he cut her arms her head and he threw a whole body into the ocean the Sharks got everything except the torso torso just washed up in the seaside I to some jersey short time you remember this episode I'm kind of her man and she fucking had fake tits ah so I had sort of a serial numbers from the tits I found out who she was but none oh it gets better he went deep into the murky waters he also went into his stomach and the food that she had eaten admin process so there were a certain clam it was a certain type of clam that couldn't be found it wasn't there and it could either been Boston in New Jersey I'm not putting the blame on those right right I remember so he too found out her whereabouts and he found that he called like every restaurant on that area to see who would have that specific type of clam hmm and he fucking caught the killer because he paid for when his credit card whoa so he went and found that the specific clam what restaurant in that area sold it and that's what she had in her stomach they weren't cherry stones or the other ones there were the other ones there was the most horrific story from that one one episode where they had this guy believe he was a doctor and he was infatuated with this woman who's his patient and when she died he I think he had married her one time down or something like that he it's some kind of relationship with her he'd dug up her body and kept it in his house and it put a tube where her vagina is so he could still have sex with her and he was buying cases and cases of perfume and I think that's what tip people off this guy was buying cases of perfume because she was rotting in his bed so he would cover her with perfume showy autopsy autop HBO autopsy yeah fucking great show great show and they would come on like at 1:00 so he studies Jeffrey Epstein and he finds out that there's breaks in jeffrey Epstein's neck that is he's never seen ever in a hanging they only seen from strangulation only see four murders you know they said that he hung himself yeah am i retarded am I missing this they're trying to find it's a four foot wall yeah he threw himself against the wall mm-hmm really all right the the neck had blood but the fucking thing then that blood on it it's such a horrible fucking thing yeah the cops the overtime they had been working the tapes got shut off how about the fact that they deleted the first tapes oh so he went he had an original attempt on his life and then they had a second one and they they can't find the tapes for the second one and then they activated leading the tapes in the first one I mean this it's not 1930 it's 2020 if they can get away with that in 2020 I mean I don't know how far anyone's gonna track this down how far like how many they are well the reason why he got arrested in the first place is because people did talk about it and they did get motivated to do something because they're like how does a guy get arrested for having sex with underage kids and then only get like 13 months and then during that 13 months he had a baby but basically he was like he just had a return at night right he didn't he he had the ability to travel and go wherever he wanted at 16 hours like work release for the day could go to his office we do what he did literally all you do is sleep there every night so was it an inconvenience an inconvenience for him and everybody's like what and then when you start thinking about the stories and the jet in the island and all the craziness like this is not a movie this is real this is not a movie there was an island where an intelligence agent would take scientists and heads of state and they would bang chicks that intelligence thing is I'll just say strong rumor because it's only been mentioned by a few people and like that ABC report didn't mention it at all maybe they left it out I don't think they can prove it so when someone says something and then that I mean is there a recording of that guy saying who remember the guy that said that he was told that it wasn't that Epstein was intelligence news above his pay grade Acosta yes his name again yeah I don't know though Alexander cut to Jim we got fired though or he had to resign after they went and looked into this and you got mmm RIA rested I have not seen bombshell have you seen bombshell that's the new shop please they're wrong she plays megyn kelly right Roger Ailes yeah and it's all about the the sexual harassment and I was watching the ladies watched it together the actual women that were that lived it and then they afterwards they talked about it they talked about what was real and what was not real but one thing that was really laid them stand in front of him and twirl around so they could see their ass so he could see their house and like so imagine you're a woman you you get this job you're gonna be an anchor like I'm really excited to work for you mr. Ailes thank you all right this one I want you do I want to see your ass I want you to spin around and so he I mean that's a weird is that a real picture Photoshop for press release doesn't look fake doesn't look a fake picture they probably weren't all next to each other huh what is he making Kelly complain about she was sexually harassed oh yeah everybody was they're all box yeah yeah yeah apparently this guy Roger that's his name roger ailes right what they're saying is that you know he would say I want to see you naked I want to see you in lingerie I want to see naked pictures of you it's just a dirty old fat dude who just harassed the fuck out of all the women that worked there and that was how they did it is that in the movie yeah that's in the movie yeah that's John Lithgow right they put him in a fat suit right they didn't make him get that fat I don't think so that's a lot of weight yeah that's some heart attack shit he's a fairly healthy guy but uh that guy's dead right didn't he die I think Roger L died I'm pretty sure look at him go back to those pictures go back to images I mean look at that one the one in the middle look at the one in the middle up top with his the red tie out yeah right there look at that I mean if he was alone with her what the fuck do you imagine you would say what kind of creepy shit do you imagine that dude would say women always think like a guy like that that looks disgusting that you would never have to look I would never have sex with him he knows that the guy that's that rich and that powerful like n looks like that he doesn't even probably know that he doesn't have any game I think he probably thinks that he has game he probably thinks this is a part of why he became rich and famous in the first place these powerful men before all this stuff went down these guys that ran these gigantic companies and that's just what they did so they all did and they got away with it everybody knew right I mean how many companies are like here's the big question how long has this been going on how long have men and women even been working together like that doesn't Jordan Pearson talk about this that hasn't really been that long like but you know in the 1800's men and women didn't work together in offices like this I didn't watch Mad Men but in that what that whole show is kind of about I think I didn't want to either secretaries wives and the husbands and yeah it's real recent for people for men and women to be alongside each other all day that you don't even know each other and you're in an office together throughout all of human history when people got together and work together there were a tribe they were a community wasn't strange random guys that just got hired by fucking HR to come down sit next to you in your office and ask you questions how you conduct yourself and like I know everybody in those days work with people they knew right like if you were in a blacksmith's office like a blacksmith's workshop everybody fucking knew everybody they work together one of my nieces just had a go and she got summoned to talk to somebody yes you know where she went she's going to medical school now but where she's got a regular you know pedigree degree couple weeks ago she had a go she got a fucking letter in the mail and they asked her about this teacher on what she thought she had a spill her guts and they haven't gone fucking at this teacher fired you know it wasn't doing anything sexual was what he was saying same creepy searching him oh he was 60 something you know and it's probably doing his whole life how to confront them and you know well that's you have to think about priests right they've get they're still doing it right they still they still keep getting caught but they've been doing that their whole life and the people before them did it to them and there's generation after generation after generation of child molester priests it's one of the craziest things that Catholics just accept that people are nothing because most Catholics are not pedophiles most Catholics are good people that want a bunch of great you know great people to live together with certain rules and they think if you do abide by these rules then you're doing the work of God but the people at the top there's a certain percentage of them I don't know what the number is that are definitely pedophiles and it's a high number in comparison to every other job if 25% of dentists were pedophiles we would all have rotten teeth you know I'm saying I mean think think about all the different professions lawyers or 25% of lawyers were pedophiles we like their buildings on fire the fuck are you talking about but for some reason I don't know what the percentage is I don't think it's 25% of priests we think it is here's the fucking thing with the priests thing that kills me the priest thing works pretty much it was a no-no I mean we're talking about the 60s and 70s I did a Google search on the grammar school I want to just a look just to look at what the sacred art school for boys and one there one there one night I was high and I was just one on a Google search and went out of foxhole and one of the couple reddit pages of people saying different things and you know what I swear to god there was nothing about Sacred Heart School for Boys and that you couldn't find them but I looked up a different church that was close to my house and it was 200 cases well nobody gets prosecuted and they move you to another Archdiocese and you start your little charade again and then when you start like say you fuck up for fucking different states but let's say you go from Jersey to Minneapolis to San Diego then to Louisiana then they ship you overseas once too many letters start to come in about this situation then they ship your overseas and they'll put you at the fucking Vatican well that's what's got me fired up I grew up in this then I get molested as a kid no then a priest bother me now I wish I could sit here and tell you was I an altar boy no I worked the bingo so I didn't really have much contact with the fucking priest you know when I did Vinny rent brands wrong we did the fat-ass stress factory one of my friends sat in the front row he was my neighbor he lived two doors down next to us and after the show we were laughing and we were laughing about the pedophiles in the neighborhood how we would torment him like we knew there were PTO's we had a guy that played two-hand touch with us with no underwear on Puerto Rican Nelson and then his lure was ice cream we should take the ice cream and then we tell me go fuck himself fuck you when I going back to your partner will fucking kill you you know you knew they got pointed out the story I tell about New York about the fucking the guy that used to chase little kids and shied that that's at your store it's not a joke it's a joke on stage but that's a true story you know who the kids the people were in your neighborhood they've gotten called out in the 70s and 80s you know don't fuck with that dude yeah you know there's a there's a cop in my neighborhood where I grew up and I just found this out I just found this huh that there's a cop in my name was I was dear friends or that I grew up when he had two younger brothers that were twins one of the younger brothers went to jail for murder he killed this fucking gay guy what just came out was that that gay guy was molesting him he gave him a summer job oh well he was in the eighth grade and started molesting him and they still reduced a sentence you know he went back a murder there's an adult he came back when they when he was 30 fucking murder my giving him six years for involuntary manslaughter he pleaded it down but this is you know it's you don't want to help me when it comes to my dorm trust nobody and you said a joke up on stage the one that I know it's not a joke oh I'll keep shooting yeah I'm gonna keep shooting and whoever your mother your wife I'm going I'm going that's why it's better that like Cuban parent you can sleep over here we can send them my kid nowhere because this is how it starts you watch never-never-land Norton okay never never my hands this turn now what is it escape from Neverland what are you talking about Hey bye yeah sukar it's Monday that's something for the spirits I have to light another joint not you my dear you have to get another joint cuz I'm ready to rock and roll you got one of these blunt yeah I'll go grab one hold on sorry about that for children oh no I've experienced it before no I've had a I had a one of those whey protein I can't even I showed you I'm sorry I was looking for a percentage number I just trying to find out the number of priests versus accusations but Los Angeles it seems like 10% of the priests maybe about 600 priests and I said at least 70 of them or so I've been accused oh god damn it that might be high I might be low I don't know that's a lot if that's the nationwide thing it matches that's the same it's mirrored or even worse well now the three billion to them have you seen it running an ad have you been molested by a Boy Scout or a fucking priest call this number it's never too late blah blah blah blah blah blah you know now you got they paid out three billion mm-hmm five hundred plus just in Los Angeles oh my god ten years ago that was ten years ago so they might it's just crazy that no one ever says hey maybe this isn't really what God wants maybe you know I'm saying I mean the people that are in the church the people that are believers the people that love to dress up nice and go and behave kind and and and see all the people in the community at the church there's a good feeling that people get from going to church but the fact that it's connected to that is it's it's so insane that it's still there it's so insane that it hasn't been rooted out that this is still a giant problem and relatively few people are going to jail like relatively few like you know who they wanted but they wanted that a Ratzinger that Pope Ratzinger it's one of the reasons why he had to step down and one of the reasons why he stays in the Vatican I was reading some article about them bringing up charges crimes against humanity against him that other countries wanted to do that because this guy used to ship kids or he used to ship priests to places where they wouldn't get in trouble like yeah this one guy was accused of molesting boys and so he shipped him to this place where he worked with dead deaf kids and he molested over a hundred deaf kids it's like what did you do like you shipped a child molester to a bunch of people that wouldn't be able to talk about it well like she'd be able to get away with it easier there if they settle the case that means it doesn't get prosecuted right so that's why they won't go to jail is that why they haven't gone to jail I don't understand it these reports on why aren't they going to jail and I like if you settle a case you don't even call it like they don't keep prosecuting I just I guess if you make us like the person decides to drop charges there was a guy Boston they were gonna fucking give a hundred thousand to the jail there was some time Boston I read about you using another jail now I keep it simple I'm still a Catholic I just don't go to church I don't want to deal with none of those people I don't want to deal with another yeah and any religious level I don't want to deal with them the problem is whenever people get into a position where everybody for the most part is like humble around them and scared of them and they have power like I remember when my grandmother died we went to a funeral and the guy couldn't remember her name my grandmother's name was Josephine he kept calling her Geraldine and the priest who was delivering the service we had to interrupt him say it's Josephine and he was like annoyed that they interrupt him was like yes Josephine like he he changed the net like he didn't even know her name and when he's there to deliver this God's message for the last you know last time the family's gonna view the body he there's no her name and when he was corrected he was angry at us like he had these Gin Blossoms all over his face he's just some weird old guy who got tricked and did this very strange life and now it's at its end and he's been living with robes on supposedly being celibate his whole fucking life while people kiss his ass and pretend to be something special because he talks about the word of God but you could just see in that one moment where he wasn't even embarrassed that he said the wrong name he was upset that people were correcting him because you don't correct priests so he's used to that so there's no one checking him there's no one checking them at all everyone who goes there is in this state of worship and they're the ones who deliver the Word of God dressed like wizards like they're the only people in society that are allowed to dress like wizards in modern American society they dress like fucking wizards and we're like yeah that's how father dresses father dresses like a wizard like do you know people are gonna look back at that and go why didn't they think the outfits were weird why didn't they think it was silly that this pedophile dresses up like a wizard and you're not supposed to say anything to him what is that like what is what is with the outfits the fact that all that shit's still around like there's nowhere in the Bible that says priests have to dress like that no where there's no where the whole thing is so bizarre it's it's you're wearing stuff that made you look like you were very special to really poor people 500 years ago that's what you're wearing you wearing stuff that would impress people that didn't know any better that probably couldn't read and so before Martin Luther translated these the the scriptures so that people could read it like a phonetic language before that people had no idea what the priests were reading they just relied on the priests they relied on the priests to tell them what the Word of God was but now something they could read it for themselves and Martin Luther was saying he should probably interpret it yourself too and they were like oh my god so I said where are they view old enough to go to church when it was still in Latin oh they would say something only be in latin until like 70s or 60 or something really yeah I remember they would say some things in Latin cuz I remember I'd be five years old going what in the fuck are these peoples what type of kid were you between the age of five and ten were you aggressive were you quiet no I did much more introverted okay from the ages of five and ten I went to the white changes until I got hitting there with a lunch box but I believed I really did believe Joe I really did believe I believe in God I believe that my father was in heaven I believe that I polish it yeah then I got introduced to Catholic school and that just fucked me I'm completely because I believed but I didn't believe on the tail end of it it was supposed to be loving risë is non smacking me why is this nun hitting he would have fucking rulings I am and then I saw the anger in their heart and it turned me off completely like I didn't like it today I'm still a Catholic in some boards yeah when my body goes I'd like to go to a fucking Church you know right but I don't hold it I remember selling cars and Boulder but a guy came in and we started talking and he was 50 wasn't a good-looking guy look like that fucking guy am I just a year old chick with him and obviously have to take him on a demo right I figured out that he could fuck her and shit no I realized that he was fucking her she was like his receptionist or something okay but after when we got back I also realized he was my father-in-law friend oh so I asked my father bother me he's and he's on the board of the church rule is he's a great man you know and I still remember him this was Sacred Heart Church in Boulder Colorado in fact that's the same church the head of the football team went to bill McCarthy and all that should I'd see his fucking family there and and it all sit in the fund this fucking scumbag would sit in the second pew with his fat fucking ugly wife you know she had ugliest fucking wife in fucking Church they would hit her with the net with that money that they would just hit her with it like fuck you just ugly but the point was that I never respected it that you cheated on your wife but nothing in here right there playing the fucking I'm a good guy that's a classic story you know the classic stories the big one is the anti-gay pastor that turns out to be gay there's so many of them there's some it wasn't there one where a guy got busted on because he was trying to use an Arby's card wasn't that the case that's a common one the anti-gay pastor that turns out to be people preach the word of the Lord yes stay away from the Kay folks Missouri church leader tried to pay for sex on Grindr with Arby's card [Laughter] look it's a hustle that they got away with probably forever there's they probably hid like who they were and what they were doing forever with this act and this smoke screen and you could kind of get away with it for a long time but that you can't get away with that today and if you're you know like why you so aggressive in stay people can file what they sent you to get anything yes gay but they always they should take and they take the Lord into you touch your dick is what they do the people that have been to those pray the gay away camps this is the claim that like guys were hugging them with full hard-ons behind them telling them it's alright that God loves them like this guy was pressing his dick against this guy's buttocks like they they made him sit like almost in a rear-naked choke position where the the guy who's the counselors behind you with his dick against your back like hey what are you doing is this really God's plan there's a South Park episode about this where the gay weekend oh my god it's called Cartman sucks it's from season 11 episode 2 2007 perfect yeah there's been a lot of those there's been a lot of like real recounts you know recounting where people went to those camp they're like oh my god everyone was gay who like everyone was like even the counselors the guys who were saying they were gonna pray the gay away they were just trying to fuck you I don't know how much fucking they do or how much they just hang onto you back with a hard-on and pretend that nothing's going on I don't know what really goes on but whenever you got someone who's that adamant about it you got a wonder yeah anybody ever try to make a move on you oh yeah when you were a kid yeah couple times from five to how old the the scariest one was when I was 13 when I was 13 I was in Boston one time it happened before but a librarian saved me I was like eight I was in San Francisco and I was really in a monster books back then I was in the monster movies and monster books and I was looking at these books and this creepy dude came over to me and he said do you like monster books and I said yeah and he said well I have monster books in my car do you want to come see him I said okay so I was 8 years old that was dumb started walking behind him and the librarian screams out Joseph you get away from him he just got out of jail I'm like oh my god and the guy ran and I ran to the librarian and she hugged me and I was crying it's very scary I got a call with a guy who's freezing huh bus wasn't common whoa had the basketball I was that same Michaels Jim I got County Boulevard next thing you know fucking there's no number one bus I'm that fucking that one happened and below you know I pulls up you want a ride yeah I get in there and I still remember how he acted like from the beginning from the minute I got in something wasn't right as energy wasn't right and he thought he had he thought he had pray yeah we're on a stick he was like we were we were 18 and we were taking a girl back to our apartment you know what kind of clumsy he was clumsy I had the light he went for the boy he liked playing basketball he went football they touch my dick like he slipped Oh Kelly's facing you like it and I was like do I fucking like it and Joe open the door hope it was like God opened the fucking door I just got out and ran Oh he kept saying come back I was just teasing you come on I'll give you a ride I was already home I was over at the top of shits and barking when I give a fuck but that was basic and I always think about that like why didn't people approach Brian I knew today looking back I still remember three guys and my high school teacher that would come on as a basketball guru and I found that and I always thought a little weird about him I married you know and then years ago somebody said yeah he was sucking shit I had a guy slow playing me at a lake there was a guy that used to run around the lake and talk to us with more efficient but probably like 13 me and my friend Josh in particular we'd go this one lake it was in our town and we'd fish there all the time and this dude would come by all the time and visit he was always friendly started off real normal what do you guys up to catches a fish like southern accent seems I got an old gentleman and then a couple of times he came when it was just me and then he just sat down next to me and talked to me and I was naive I was 13 I just thought he was a real nice guy like almost like a older brother type figure it's gonna give you a good advice he talked about cool shit he was a teacher he got kicked out of his position for some unfair reason he wouldn't really be specific about it but he said you know they didn't like the way he taught and so anyway this dude just becomes my friend like nice and slow nice and slow brings me lunch I even went to his house once and then one day I am fishing and he's drunk and he tells me he loves me and I said I think I said something I really like you too he goes you know there there can't be love without sex and I remember thinking what whoa like what did he just what happened and then I might remember thinking what a dummy I am I thought this guy just liked me he was I was his buddy that he's gonna teach me things he just likes teaching people it's just really smart but I had my hand on a knife I had a Swiss Army knife from them little red plastic ones you know the ones with the camel yeah they have all the kind of shit and all I was thinking is I put it in my hand in my pocket like I held on to it and I remember thinking god damn it I hope I don't have to fucking try to use this because I was thinking it's like he was a big guy you know I was 13 I don't know what I weighed 120 pounds or something I'm like fuck this guy might beat the shit out of me and raped me here in the woods like he was bigger than me and he was always jogging you know it wasn't in bad shape and he I told him get the fuck away from me and he told me to not be upset and then I left I got away he didn't chase me I you know he didn't want to be violent he wanted to trick me into a fucking um he wanted II didn't want to rape me he wanted to trick me into fucking him I got real lucky that that was the case but then years later I got a letter from I'm at my house that was creepy because it showed up in the mailbox like he had figured out where I moved to and sent me a letter oh whoa and it was like real like friendly and professional like a real professor like a scholar I don't even remember if you ever apologized but it was real weird it was like whoa I dodged that bullet how many guys that are like that but aren't nice they just want to get you clothes and then rape you that's much more likely probably that is some horrific shit man the Puerto Rican Nelson I went to his house that's a name that's what we called him he was born Rican and his name is Nelson they believe I'm giving that terrorist say he lived next to the old teen house but in the back and I think he raped guys with a black dude like there was a black friend of his that would come over there and then they give you beer uh-huh and all that shit so he took you in as you like pussy type the kid like you always think you want to see some good pussy and then that's how it started then they'll bring you over there you go in and he'd start with the porn first whoo yeah bring your buddies any time you want then it was a porn and they would get a Snickle bags of weed he started with I'll get you weed and then he introduced our black friend tool and I said this black friend just looked too fucking retarded like his afro was cut weird he had weird hair and I remember him distinctively speaking about the Rock of Gibraltar I had just come back from Africa movie young kid it's like wow and then once he showed us the porn it came out like a week later somebody said bro that dude is no good ask what's his name he went over that he had man he asked her fingers suck his dick so were like what are we doing that we call the cops or do we tell carmine we're like no let's just play the guy cuz he was selling us weed he was like a bartender in the city it was so sweet and then he pursued the porno thing with us he's like you guys to understand you know and then he talked us into he like I'm gonna fuck my girlfriend come over and listen we would come over there at night and listen that he would leave the window open and it was his girlfriend and him fucking and she would be saying give it to Kimmy milk daddy daddy and we like get creeped out right out there one day and then one day we actually fucking went back then they'd be he got normal I think with the misunderstanding with the one guy he got normal like we somebody checked them and he got normal and then like the next summer wasn't he would come out and play football with us with a robe Arlen no underwear just his dick guy and we're like what the fuck is this guy though like he went the desperate measures of aversion and I think missus and Adi said something to him you can't be doing that around hand with you dick and he's like no no I just want to get exercises something like he told us something we did and that was the end of that you know what's the classic relationship the classic relationship with with crazy old gay guys is the crazy old gay guy in the young guy that's having sex with them for money right there's a lot of those cases is that more accepted in the gay community that is in the straight community because like if a straight community if a guy is paying a girl for sex its prostitution and everybody's upset but is that how it is in the gay community like do guys give a fuck like how many gay prostitutes get arrested is it even close to as many as straight ones I got what assume ice I would assume like no one's getting arrested like is that how many gay prostitutes get arrested I think they do you think there's no but just less number so it's probably how it courses a lot you think there's less of them probably less than overall process for the numbers yeah we live in a place it's made of dreams on people fucking that dreams don't do anything fun do anything from Joe I mean look at all the situations we've discussed just play alone RV Erica Epstein Bikram you know Marilyn Monroe that guy two weeks ago that two people died of speed in this house that fucking nutcase that same guy that's right ed buck that more people died there no I'm just finally Oh oh my god it's such a shame that that's what you do for a living this fuck with people's dreams well I think that Ed Buck guys probably had just a serious addict he's got some money right you know taking him home was God and shooting him up with drugs drugs really you know when I first got his a hot book was you'll never work in this town again hmm there was a hooker who fucking did a tell-all book about Don Henley calling her up to a house and they had a bend over and Don Henley would snort coke off to her asshole whoo and then get up plug him once and sit back down and just sit there so you had to go to Don Henley's house he has a fireplace for women he would just say bend over naked god damn don't snort coke get up fuck you for a minute and sit back down snore Marco you know all those stories at different movies I'd be shit like that would you be disappointed if you lived any other way I would think that if you're living back then to rock star back then like you almost were required to do something ridiculous like everybody was doing ridiculous shit like no there was no like clean and sober rock stars back then we're there like that hadn't even happened yet where people cleaned up right people clean up regularly now it's a big part of society like people improve how many people cleaned up back in the day right like artists artists that were like really into drugs they just died yeah no Kurt obviously a suicide or whatever depending on which documentary was 1983 you know put 12 fucking 12 feet pipe in your truck the wiring screws and there was just one fucking drive around that was 45 years old and his wife was 15 whoa and he would bring out at work with her Jesus she'd be in the front seat she did not go to school do you wanna know everybody knew he if you looked at him you could tell he wasn't all there yes and I'm a masculine once I just this to your daughter it was that that's my wife I go she's 15 14 he was you had a parents older tell me oh Jesus Christ I forget what his name was away he led no he will live the Western yaki was a white dude from West Nile but he that you know but Don Johnson married Melanie jumped Matt Melanie Griffith's before she was 18 really yeah looking up she was nobody said dick was that uh look at the other boy look at you that dude they're gonna throw him on the chair when they finish with who are Kelly if you think how he wine stands in trouble at least how he got some Marvy ha ha ha we Harvey at least he's got some money left Arkel he's done and like we were fuckin nobody said nothing our Kelly used bribe to marry Aaliyah when she was 15 charges say he bribed government employee in 1994 so that he could obtain a fake ID for the singer Aaliyah mmm yeah this is 20-something years ago right he's gonna they're gonna throw him under the fuck in jail he was holding woman captive fuckin with the hedge you're not allowed to talk to your fucking parents you know was it all that age is it all like in the 15s that's what he's into is that what yeah yeah they've got the video of him pissing on a chick which I never saw I don't want to see it I mean I had no fucking desire to see that shit what do you think that is you think he's basically like like running well I was a little bit of his last week and he comes across to you he is professional is but listen some people know wounded deal when they see him and that's what these woman is saying that his professional his skill is the art of the wounded woman and then he plays wounded but you know who do you talk to him that within the first day I'll tell you they got sexually harassed not too many people so as soon as he starts at that you start with your story about your uncle and he's gonna take care he's gonna do this and this that's how he went in Oh the stories that these woman is saying I just fucking crazy like it's just other level fucking craziness my manipulation you know it's just deep old-school pimping me you and I want to see American pimp yeah and we went to that barbecue place you took me to a good barbecue place next door with American papers that use brothers just that mentality I was spotting those type of woman's you know it's fucked up but it's horrible and I feel terrible about it and it just makes me feel sick hearing the story but what makes me laugh is if we found out that JLo had been capturing 15 year old boys and pissing in their face we would think it was hilarious if JLo went to high school and she got all these sophomores and she brought him back to her place for a gangbang we would think these kids had a good fucking time that is well it's it's one of those big giant differences between the way we feel about men and women this r.kelly thing is horrible but it is it is kind of funny that if our Kelly was like a really beautiful woman and she she was doing the exact same thing the 15 year old boys making them live with her and eat her pussy and she would say it's hilarious we would just think it's hilarious dollars doing it yeah Madonna's doing it he does not read or write exceedingly well except when it comes to amazing musical tracks his his turn he said okay he doesn't read or write well that's sad the whole thing set if it it is weird our ideas of sex based on gender it's fucking very different very we feel very different about that story there'll be a hilarious story if there was some big tittied freak singer who has their little sex call and she brings fifteen sixteen-year-old boys over we wouldn't really we would be like wow but we wouldn't feel like a crime got committed were hypocrites because yes I make jokes of it on Twitter I see it another 16 year old teacher sucks a dick you know but then you think Jesus Christ I have a daughter this swings both ways right so we're hypocrites and we're hypocrites on who we you know for years we heard about Michael Jackson there's people I'll look you in the fucking face and go Michael Jackson never touch the kid yep yeah we'll look you in the face today and say Oh Jason didn't kill that bitch mmm there's people that are gonna think what they think you're broken so yeah I don't obviously have any idea what happened with Michael Jackson but I would assume that there was something wrong just based on the way he behaved I would say like what other things are weird about the way you behave the way you talk is weird like everything about you it's like you're so so shattered by this whole Fame thing and you're constantly getting plastic surgery to the point where nobody can even recognize you anymore I mean we never saw that before that's the first superstar we ever saw that like literally became a different human being like changed his face changed his nose changed his chin changed everything the complexion of his skin the color resides like everything just kept fucking with his face his nose would collapse and we were all aware of it we're like whoa you when you watch never Neverland I want you to watch it alone I don't want you to watch it from the perspective of what you've seen as a comedian it alone was it actually called escape from Neverland whatever fuck never never I don't know Finding Neverland don't worry I'll take the fucking napkin you know I'm not a pagan on the napkins bother no it doesn't bother me know what I'm gonna say to you that I definitely well when you watch this movie you're gonna get it the same way I got it the lucky thing is that people like you and I didn't drink the kool-aid you and I have been at the store and you and I have had discussions and you and I have seen it's 2020 whatever the fuck it is I know you since 97 98 we've seen a thousand comics come and go yeah some of his addiction some of his this lifestyle wasn't for them but there's a percentage of them that one day you were talking to them about writing jokes the next day they were talking to you about scripts and producing they just lost their fuck my and drank the kool-aid and because they drank the kool-aid now they come back to calm me and it's been four years that they've been playing their little fucking stupid charade mm-hmm and they lost all the steam listening there's a lot of guys who are promising comics who wound up doing that and they when they're bringing these scripts to Comedy Central and all these different places I'm executive producing this and that and that and this and then it all dries up and then they direct is not good anymore so when you watch this never Neverland you're gonna see people who got caught up people who lived in the same evalue man they michael jackson came to your house and paid your bills and said you know i'm gonna take you guys on the road with me you're all included it starts off with the room down the hall and the next thing you know he's in the room next to you no there's no more rooms on levels in the same hotel so you're in that hotel next door to you but your son your daughter really wants to sleep with Michael Jackson's your own daddy oh because you're getting thrown you know you getting thrown money to go out to dinners a limos picking up to go see you too you're gonna leave your two daughters with fucking Michael Jack's think I'll hold up this town is about getting caught up I'm sure Marilyn Monroe Lynn come to this town thinking she was gonna be sucking Kennedy's dick Sam Giancana's dick and fucking the baseball players deck yeah you know they passed her around she was sucking she was passing mob information to the Kennedys and back and forth did you ever think about fucking that yeah I mean I'm not Marilyn Monroe yeah yeah what the fuck I am talking about one of them one of them was fucking Canada oh she did yeah Marilyn Marilyn this town has you know it's always been that way we were talking about Fatty Arbuckle earlier what we pick and choose you don't think that nobody no Behav wines name nobody know by Harvey Weinstein nobody knew that's what you're telling me have you seen the video or Ricky Gervais jokes around about being friends with Harvey Weinstein in the last Golden Globes and then there's a whole series of people thanking Harvey getting up there and thanking Harvey all these including people that have accused him of things getting up there and thanking them and talking about how they wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Harvey Weinstein I mean it's like fucking 10 minutes long it's all these famous people thanking Harvey or God lol and everybody's laughing like people people were just giving him so much praise all these like super famous actors Daniel day-lewis everybody you name it everybody Faye Dunaway whoever they're all up there thanking Harvey Weinstein he's amazing Harvey you're incredible it's it's great then it's crazy if you stop and think about how recent that was and nobody knows I don't think they knew unless he did it to them what it was you know I think there's there's a an innocence to a lot of people's perceptions about people like that is that like both parties are in on it right like the girl wants to go to him because he is gonna offer her a role in a movie and he wants the girl to come to him because she's hot and he wants his dick sucked and they both know it right there's those cases but those are very different than the ones where he holds a girl down or he takes off his robe when she expected it to be a real script and those are very very different things and I don't know if people knew about those I think they thought it was more of the former than the latter I think they thought it was more like creepy deals he made with actresses but kept his word and they sucked his dick but then when you get the other stories makes me go okay it's probably because they knew but the people around him knew he's a pig but probably didn't know what the the worst accusations were you know I just didn't wanna know job that - that could be a commit they know but they didn't want to know I had to go to his parties they had a heat of this meals they how to attend this functions but they didn't really pass a line yeah there's those people too right and then in the amazing movies too in it in a way it's just as guilty if I tell you right now I'm going to shoot Redman and you sit here I shoot red band you get prosecuted oh that's right yeah you get an accessory your knowledge so you know when one Epstein or Weinstein or one of these fucking guys are doing what they were doing you hadn't known I take you to a bar with employment you look at me and go do these guys don't right or wrong true right I go to fucking Dan Tana's to eat and I see a guy I see a guy work and a fucking I see a chick work of a guy for the small nickel I even heard the guy look at him go 500 it was that first row were you sitting there bars right there about three four months ago must have been you know it's it's this is it yeah well remember when the guy from the Clippers got in trouble what's that guy's name the owner yeah what was his name sterling sterling Donald Donald sterling right when he got got recorded saying the chick yeah it was a girl that he was banging with this girl he had bought her a penthouse he bought a Ferrari bought her a Bentley it's just and she was for him super hot like look at her that is a pretty girl and he's a disgusting looking old man right so that was his uber side piece so he would just buy her everything but after a while she's like yo enough yo pretty hot though and like that kind of trash away now is that in me to situation no that's listen that's it that's was he was clear and she was clear they were both doing it for very specific reasons he bought her a bunch of really nice shit and he was rich and she was hot and that's is that her now what's that the state of her face like I started wearing if you wanna get seen oh that was back in the day when pepper Otzi yeah let me enjoy now let me ask you let me ask you you bump into this broad ah okay at the last or is it a meat to situation if you don't listen are you working I think they have to come to you first what if okay 500 fell on my pocket you sucked me you know like right is this a you soliciting prostitution are you soliciting an agreement or is that a meat to situation it's all the above I think the only way people would be comfortable with it and even then they probably wouldn't like like if if you believe in people's rights you have the right to do anything well you also have the right to be a ho if you wanted to be oh so if the only way would ever be okay is if she made it clear that she was willing to have sex for money and this was her choice she could do with her body then people probably leave you alone but even then they'd be mad at you they'd be willing to pay for sex you fucking disgusting piece of shit you know you're supposed to pretend that you don't want to have sex with her and then you wouldn't be willing to pay for it it would only be okay in everybody's eyes if it was the woman's choice but every time we think about if you think about sex for money everybody autumn at least I do I automatically think about sex trafficking which is like the worst possible case scenario right if you go to a prostitute that that prostitute is that's that's a sex slave right that was the thing that they got the craft guy they were they were using a false accusation against that guy that got jerked off you

world looks like one of those fucking hosts from an eagle Jitsu I try to hide it with a bad thing but it cuts right through the band-aid it's horrible I don't know what else to do I have to take a medication but I don't know if my kidneys can handle it because the blood pressure medication oh you can't you have to take a fungi thing that zaps it but I took one that I tried the zap and it still didn't kill it is there anything you could apply topically or does it have to be a pill they talk I've done everything I've done everything the apple cinnamon cider Clorox I dip it in I wrap it in a fucking Cloris and it's great because I cut it what the best thing I do is I cut it like some nights when I'm bored I got it and when I take the grinder to it and I grind it into like coke powder and it grinds down you have to smell that powder to believe it well it is so stinky and I just touching on with Jesus Christ and I have to wipe down the fucking counter and throw it away but I will grind those first two toes it's like a fucking thing like like your standing your toes oh yeah it's a sand that I got the extra rock for like I had my wife go on Amazon and get like the fucking auto Bahamas stone yeah yeah bodies and I just fucking sad that fucking toenail down I don't even know Jesus Christ I don't know where I got it it's internal and you know its internal yeah because that's how the fungus is coming out of you oh so it's in your body and then it just comes out through your toes so it can come out other spots yeah but I'm not getting it on my nails and nothing like that it's just on that one fungi toenail what if it came out on your balls no point we only want your wife to suck your dick it's an ironic then that sack is fucking longer than that it's a fucking nightmare I don't know how women could suck an old man dick does that look at my dick in the mirror when I go like the Vegas they got those good mirrors when you get you're at home you look at your different looks the way it does everything cuz you're used to that mirror right it's not that you going away you walk back your walk past fucking on a vacation or something when you're on the road working you walk past a mirror and it catches you like I'm getting a little fat like the real hotel mirrors don't fuck around is that there's a lake there but when you look at 56 my dick has been through hell it's got olders you haven't helped it smells like Newark Staten Island it's kind of like the pee is different I'm you smell you pee lately I'm trying not to open the old machida was saying drink his beer give him a shot of might beat this motherfucker this will poison you when I wake up in the morning that first dose of P is the worst smelling thing in the world before I go to bed I drink water a little bit of Thai cherry juice and I'd take a fucking baby aspirin because the high level after 50 is to get the heart attack between 5:30 and 12 I was making a mistake and taking my aspirin at 7:00 it's too late you gotta ball it if you take that before you go to sleep it's better for you I gotta ask you this before we stop doing this the before the podcast we were talking about the bedding line for this weekend right sir for Connor and cowboy right and what we saying what we saying about the over-under you guys are both talking about it you're talking about the over-under it's like 1 1 & a half is the oh yeah they're trying to get people to better so what they're doing right now is they what they did they did something spectacular for starters when you gamble you don't gamble on the venue have to look at what happened a week before and what's gonna happen the week after that now is the prime time of you're a gambler because you have college basketball pro basketball you got action every day bitch this is wrong this is when people whose houses this time of the year is bad you got football playoffs tonight's the fucking national game that's big Johnson dollars college football tonight's big big big money fake so tonight's big and then we have playoffs are on Saturday correct sir sunday so we got Conor McGregor so right now the fucking ESPN two-minute tape where they just showed Conor tonight the UFC preview as at 8 o'clock to 6 and they'll show you both training camps and other people on the card or whatnot everybody's forcing you to port that Conor McGregor after this weekend nobody not even our man Jaime had fucking the Tennessee Titans to beat Baltimore nobody nobody nobody ever been their mother but Baltimore no even John Rael to said something the John rival to say something it was like it wasn't gonna happen Baltimore had been on a hot roll Baltimore there was another upset to Kansas City that beat the Texans right here this late 2014 they were down 24 nothing when you pull up the UFC card for this weekend so I could see who's on the card that's right there's the okay so what everybody's gonna be trying to bet Cerrone well that what's the line that's around right now so you could I get what this is plus two sixty four plus two sixteen over under one and a half rounds mm-hmm but then I go over one and a half what do I make I make a little more money than that the over the under would be the little bit plus the plus 105 for under so that I guess the money is on the over right now it's minus 135 how can the fucking money be in the oval piece of light it's very slight though okay look so this Diego for Hara is the favorite over Anthony Pettis mmm that's an interesting fight right there for right there they know something we don't know hmm that's interesting Diego is very good it's a very good fighter but Holly Holm Rachael Penton yeah that's good fight Holly Holmes given right excuse me she's a favorite Holly yeah yeah yeah Rachel Pennington is tough man she's very tough painting is one of those chicks it like she's had some last-second wins like against Ashlee evans-smith one of the like wildest endings in a female fight she gets her in a bulldog choke and chokes are unconscious with blood spraying out of her forehead it was a wild finish man see if he could find that finish Ashlee evans-smith Raquel Pennington finishes Ashlee evans-smith so right now what does that look like Donald Cerrone against Conor what's the money looked like I don't understand money like I don't know I would I would be just talking out of my have spent a hundred bucks on cowboy to win and he wins the fight you'd get to 60 so you'd collect 360 and if you bet a hundred on Conor you'd have to bet 320 bucks to win a hundred on Conor all right minus 320 the only way you can win this weekend is with Connor and you see Connor go on and then knocking him out in the first round in the under what if Connor if fucko wrestles them and it goes five rounds I don't see a lot of people betting Connor in the over final looks so good that people are expecting common going that this is come right out this is Raquel Penningtons fight so just go to like towards the end of it it was a wild fight then and Ashlee evans-smith is the woman who beat Fallon Fox the transgender fighter she stopped her in her fight right before she came to the UFC it was just a wild fight man these girls were going to war and so at the very last I mean I think it was like the last second of the fight she's locking her up in this bulldog choke and this is why like a blood is spraying out of her head oh they don't show the finish that's UFC it's sneaky like that they don't even see the tap or the knockout like I don't get it guys I work for you I love you show everybody the choke why are you hiding the choke anyway maybe it's just a time constraint but she got her in this bulldog choke blood is squirting out of her head and then at the end of the the buzzer she lets go and the girls out cold and it was just like whoa it was one of those fight just whoa what's happening you like holy shit you know you see something that's just primal there's moments and fights that are just primal you know it's sometimes those moments are like they're almost surreal like when Francis and gone to knock down Alistair Overeem boom oh just primal just what who cut his lip who fucked up oh Rosen strike oh my god Rosen strikes now gonna fight Francis Giardino Rosen strike and Francis and Ghana where Columbus Ohio god damn that's a crazy fight I almost wish more people knew how tough Rosen strike is you see the fight with Alistair Overeem and you go well ouster was kind of out pointing him and then he caught Alistair slippin really with like 10 seconds left to go in the fight and hit him with a bomb and broke his lip open that's true but he still absorbed everything that Alistair threw at him did never look like he gets shook at all we're talking about a guy and Alistair who's knocked out Junior dos Santos knocked out you know it was the k1 grand prix champion no tremendous really knocked out Todd Duffee in prize fucking knocked out our boys riser he needed your boy there fucking the great white hope you know what's his name mark hunt you know he's great white hope he's Australian Oh Brock Lesnar raucous that's a perfect example of him but meanwhile rosin strikes just walked through all that and I'm not suggesting that the the Alistar of today he's had a long career that he's as as durable and as big as he was when he fought Brock Lesnar there's really two different guys at this point but still Rosen strike he's a fucking beast he's so strong man and he's got legit kickboxing skills what do you see he can fight we can do money this is what it seems to me it seems to me that Conor McGregor has an advantage in being able to close the distance and maybe a speed advantage this is a perceived thing based on seeing them fight different people cowboy when he's at his best is remarkably well-rounded and I think he's more well-rounded than Conor I think cowboy has a lot of tools that people forget about particularly his takedowns are excellent cowboy can submit the fuck out of you he submits a lot of people he's nasty off his back he's got wicked triangles I could see if this went to the ground Connor getting submitted by cowboy in the Triangle what I couldn't see is cowboy getting submitted by Conor in a triangle I could see I could see Cowboys submitting Connor I would I don't think it's impossible for Connor to submit cowboy but I don't see it I think Connor can win by knockout yes he's very fast yes his left hand is a fucking piston and he's sneaky and he's got nasty uppercuts and he's got a killer instinct when he has you heard he fucking bombs on you and the idea of the Eddie Alvarez fight is the best example that Eddie Alvarez was a world-class fighter and Conor McGregor took it to him like no one has ever done in his career tuned him up made him look like he had no business in the cage with them now for Eddie he said like he just fought about fight and I believe I'm in the eighties a world-class fighter but the point is in in go time Conor McGregor handles as better as much or better as good as well or better than anyone who's ever lived he handles pressure so well kiss his Floyd Mayweather with an uppercut in a fight where he's so outclassed he has zero boxing matches and he's fighting the greatest boxer of all time in one of the biggest pay-per-view cards ever it's nuts right so he can handle pressure he lost that fight because Floyd's a way better boxer but he handled the pressure pressure against Aldo talked so much shit for a year going on tour together tearing pictures of him stealing his belt gets in front of him flatlines I'm in 13 seconds perfect punch perfect execution like it measures him with one left hand before that steps back he dives in with the lab bang catches him coming in it's perfect under pressure he's not the kind of grappler that nurmagomedov is he's not in that category have pressure on this fight oh he's got so much pressure he fought he fought the guy who everyone's terrified of and at least he made it into the fourth round right was in the fourth round submission yeah and he probably wasn't really prepared for that fight you think about how much time he'd been off of MMA how much time he'd be working on you know just boxing and then spending all that money because he made like a hundred million dollars the question for me is who is Conor right now is Conor McGregor the same guy that knocked out Boston Dustin Poirier when he was a savage is he the same guy that knocked out Diego Brandao is he is he the same guy that knocked out Jose Aldo is he the same guy who knocked out Eddie Alvarez or is he just some new thing cuz all this money and all this Fame and all this attention he likes to party and I what does he know if he's the same guy and physically there should be no reason why he isn't he hasn't taken any terrible beatings even the number comment' off fight he stopped him with a choke if he is the same guy and he decides he wants to let the fucking world know that he can still do it and who gives a fuck how much money he has in the bank he wants to let the world know he's here to fuck people up and he's here to reclaim his crown if he goes into the fight with that attitude I mean we could certainly see a resurgence the question has always been whether or not a rich man has the motivation to work like a poor man and he's a very rich man we don't know everybody's different mayweather fought hard to the day he died or he excuse me to the day he retired and Mayweather when he was during his career it was rich like from like a couple years and he was rich he was rich so he was always rich and still fought like the best of the world and still trained like you have to train to be the best what type of gaps was he taking him between fights guys this has been a long gap before no my god it's not fair yeah before no mega mega wolf it was a long gap you know this is true the game has evolved a lot hmm you know you know in a real world I can get what you heard me telling Jamie was basically this in a real world you know sir wrong what's he done in the last five fights around he's gay he's had some ups and downs ups and glossa kg lost to Maz Vidal lost real bad - Darren tell the Dare until one was a battle so how do the last five fights he's two and three is where you tell was lost to Tony Ferguson beat al Iaquinta though and looked real fucking good doing it so he's lost to the gauge he fight and he beat Mike Perry which was a really good fight for him because Mike Perry is a big scary guy throws bombs so he beat him lost to Leon Edwards I think he was sick coming into that fight but you know lost either way and beat Yancy Medeiros in a while Rama is saying that in a real world he should take em out people look at him I don't think this is gonna be that easy of a fight I like it I like the over I love the over I don't I can't pick a side yet yeah but I love the over I could see everybody betting McGregor the wooden round one and something crazy happened I mean in a perfect world you know his chin has been a little suspect lately Donald I don't know I don't think so I think he's just been fighting werewolves has been fighting the the toughest guys in the world look everybody's chin suspect if Darren tail is smashing your fucking nose open with an elbow that dudes an animal and he's big as fuck when Darren tail fought cowboy he's so much bigger than him there was the difference between a really big welterweight and a guy who came up from lightweight Darren tails a giant dude I mean his nicknames the gorilla so here we go yeah he beat Iaquinta he beat alexander hernandez that was a fantastic fight that was a fantastic fight because right this kid Hernandez is a young tough guy was talking mad shit but there's a giant difference between no disrespect to Hernandez and a Conor McGregor yes Conor McGregor is used to those bright lights man he shines he shines in those bright lights to me the question is really just whether or not he has the motivation to train and fight like a fucking madman again like he did when he was younger when he was smashing people and for cowboy it's whether or not he can survive the early storm I think getting his leg kicks working would be very big because Conor likes to take that long stance Conor takes that long stance and he fights right leg forward he fights southpaw and if Donald can fuck up that right leg he can figure out a way to attack that right leg knees to the body coming in he's got to avoid the punches though yep he's up there with uh who do I say he's with he's with Sergio Pettis is coach up there he's training yeah you should do Rufus Rufus sport if he's a walking sport for this camp they're probably working on a lot of kickboxing but I guarantee woodlings Woodley and Emma doing some wrestling takedown because he knows that's where the money literally has a big fight coming up Willie's gonna fight Leon Edwards and Leon Edwards is a dangerous man it's like that's a that's a big fight and Leon Edwards for whatever reason is not known as much as he is skillful you know he beat cowboy like you said and he's the guy that got in that crazy brawl with Maas Vidal backstage Bosma doll hit with your two-piece in the soda but that's that guy's a tough tough tough guy super highly skilled guy and Leon Edwards and tyron woodley that's a very high-stakes fight that a lot of people aren't talking about like that's the fight for the number one contender because if tyrant emerged or if Leon emerges and it's and it's a big fight and it the fight goes well that person is almost certainly at least considered other than Mozgov doll who's the fan favorite and then the rematch those are those are the two possibilities the read the rematch with Kobe a new smart other than that you want to see you want to see the winner of tyron woodley in Leon Edwards it just makes sense it make sense that that would be the next one or MOSFET all those those that's how I would look at it I would look at it that way I would look at it like there's there's a lot of options there's a lot of options for that division and now Connors talking about fighting us Mon that would be bonkers so if Connor beats cowboy and decides he feels great at this weight he feels confident now and dedicated he wants to make a run at the fucking champ there is a big size difference which in Vaughn and Connor who's Mon is a big person he's got a thick around those 170 guys a big that big Kobe's a big fella dead Colby's a big Feldman's Big Show is fucking Mazda without big 1:7 yep it's somebody else at 170 that's deceiving his fuck - I think Mazda I was in the sweet spot he's not too big where I said to kill himself to make the way but he's he could obviously knock out welterweight it's easily he's knocked out a lot of welterweights I mean the the Ben Askren one is fucking preposterous but of course just even the beating that he's putting on Nate Diaz Maz Woodall can fuck people up at 170 I mean I think him vs Conor would be insane you fucked me up dawg you fucked me up by not bringing back the ran with you that boy that you were telling me this I got Duran I'm gonna put him up at the compound for a week you know I went down a foxhole of his fights oh he was amazing a lot of month ago just that whole era yeah I've been turning people on just tell that hold I really a dad was we're talking my mom so because I got pissed off with that fucking Vikram thing because he said he came to the United States on the pretension that he had won three national yoga competitions in India and I'm not that stupid I grew up on Wide World of Sports we learned everything I don't want world sports I saw a dude catch a bullet with his mouth on Aaron bankses Parliament Aaron banks karate tournament yeah really in New York City we caught a bull with his teeth Aaron bankfull higher there was a dude who that's what he was known for it's on YouTube is that real Joey he did they put a glass in front of the guy the bullet goes through the glass - he put a special mouthpiece on and they shoot and then look how close was the glass watch let me go pee real quick okay play that for me give me some volume okay so it's just music that's right so his name is Ralph can I see it well this is supposedly the video I thought what's happening here maybe not I just fries Jonah in slow-mo but there's got to be like someone who Snopes is this I believe Penn & Teller do it now they do it yeah they catch a bullet in their teeth huh well Penn would be the first one to tell you it's bullshit I mean that's a hit half of their stick I should probably get him back in here have him explain how the fuck something catches a bullet in their teeth there's no bullshit might not be the way to do it but there's a way to do it that's safer then there's shooting a gun at your teeth I think I don't think they shoot a gun at your teeth because I don't think you could do that a whole lot of times see if a guy's doing that it's not he's doing it I think I can do it dad okay give it a shot son now he's done it before right he's doing this bullet thing in front of people I would assume that's not the first and only time just catching a bullet his teeth David Blaine did it - right but you listen to me yeah that means you have to practice how many times you let it do to shoot you in the face how are you practicing that that's not real David Blaine with a metal cup in his mouth Wow so the metal cup caught the bullet another guy wore I think this guy that's Joey watch - had steel dentures Oh God even if you had steel dentures I'm gonna shoot you in the face and you got to make sure that they don't hit your lips do you know how hard it is and not hit someone how close do you have to be do you wear your with a pistol is that what they using you can absolutely sure 357 oh Jesus there's no way that can't be real one person died doing it of course they shoot ling-su the most famous person to die were doing the trick always performs silently because he apparently spoke no English Heath when his final performance of the trick went wrong and he was accidentally shot in the chest exclaimed in perfect English oh my god something's happened lower the curtain at his autopsy it was discovered that he was not Chinese but an American named William Robinson but that's a story for another day his scam was he let people shoot him and he catch the bullet in his teeth and his name is Chung Ling soo and he pretended he was Chinese but then he accidentally got shot in the chest - got it and shoot him in the mouth shot him in the chest instead and he as he dropped down he said oh my god something's happened lower the curtain in perfect English so the autopsy revealed that he was not Chinese but an American named William Robinson can't do that today cultural appropriation but even back then that's a hilarious way to die was just one of the guys that was catching bullets with his ass it was a couple of fucking lunatic so that's how I know I grew up on Wild Bill the sports they showed you everything but I got caught in a foxhole they had Hagler tackling the Rabi ooh Maccabi was amazed death because in those days they used to do a pay-per-view on Saturday and then you had a wait a week yeah first Saturday Sunday Sal no next next out the following Saturday be on white rule of sports if you can hold on but I still remember dog being a fucking kid on a Saturday and watching doom come Kim and Mancini fucked out of each other because that was live on was Lobby seen Barbara absolutely you know cook him that was the reason why they changed the the round number from 15 down to 12 after that guy died was that again this was out it looks like it's outside doesn't it yeah it is outside outside yeah that's crazy Tim Ron you this had a January or February of 83 dude this is a crazy November 18 to like two months before that November of 82 Mancini was an animal remember we fought Alexis argüello I think that's this right here says he huh the Korean guy do cuddle King God rest his soul wrote on a piece of wood before you went out to fight and kill or be killed yeah that guy was a tough motherfucker ray boom-boom Mancini but what tough motherfucker this was 1979 he was 21 years old is this a duck who Kim fight so imagine he killed somebody when he was 21 years old in a fight that is hardcore man probably both things and then also probably probably how to make weight a lot of deaths in boxing apparently happened in the lower weight classes and one of the reasons is that when these guys actually enter into fights a lot of times they're still dehydrated they would dehydrate them selves pretty bad in the weigh-ins to get to whatever weight class it was like 134 but he probably weighs you know 134 out of quarters what he waited and he probably walks around like 150 ish or something like that and they dehydrate themselves it's very difficult to rehydrate the brain apparently it's not as quick and easy as it is rehydrating the body and even that takes some time so most of the deaths in boxing have occurred most of them is still very dangerous even for the heavyweight division there was a guy who went into a coma Russian guy in a fight a few years back but in the lighter weight divisions they think it's generally when people get more more more likely to die from fights and they think it might have something to do with cutting weight but it's also like you know really skillful people punch each other in the head the general mcclellan fight is a good example that they always point to because Gerald McClellan who was just a straight-up murderer when he was a light heavyweight really struggled to make weight man real bad and in one fight with Nigel Benn Nigel Benn got off the deck and it looked like he was out and made it back into the ring fought his ass off and then started taking it to Gerald but this don't come come right here again yeah and that was the end of the fight after ray Mancini stopped him everybody's all happy within the guy slides into a coma mines up dying see he's sitting there like so he's he's really battered they think again I think it might have something to do with cutting weight it's a fucking horrible horrible way to go man but kill or be killed that's what he signed up for actually wrote before yeah I mean he fought that way too you know what I saw recently there's one of the wildest fights Roberto Duran in Sugar Ray Leonard one holy shit is it Wow oh my god that's watched run right see ya the run Toronto was the first one Louisiana was the second montreal montreal yeah that's a good one what Montreal was the first one yeah yeah gods are really good god damn it was gots a really good one it was cold icy crazy for Pipino Cuevas they're crazy fights on that these guys were so fast both Leonard and Duran were so fast back then and Leonard was just I mean he was America's darling Olympic gold medalist handsome sweetheart of a guy and Roberto Duran was a straight up savage who was sponsored by a cigarette company look at that he's got a cigarette company logo on its back that was a cigarette company wasn't it looks like my bro I think he had a cigarette company sponsor him well either way maybe maybe it was just a design he was a monster and he just jumped on top of Sugar Ray Leonard wouldn't let him breathe and sugar a decided to try to fight his fight squirt up to the fight squirt up a little to fight Sugar Ray just decided to try to engage him like up close like this so they fought these kind of fights like this in the clinch total fucking chaos kind of fighting which favors Duran you know Duran was just a lovely animal love that shit so but see how he's wrestling with him and fucking under Kunder hooking him and pushing him against the ring staying in his face he's not giving him any chance to move and in the rematch obviously Sugar Ray fought a totally different fight and got Roberto Duran to quit but it was an amazing fight and historically like one of the greatest boxing matches ever just chaos as Sugar Ray Leonard taking a chance and you know his ego probably got the better of him said I'm gonna beat you at your own game or try to it and Duran just stuck to him like glue and just ripped out his body and stayed on him and then after it's over dirt sure Duran still pushed him away he's like get the fuck away from me like after the fight was over Duran was still mad at him bad movement it was a Montreal it was in Calabi cuz a couple days before the fight Duran bumped into it Sugar Ray Leonard and Sugar Ray being a nice guy that he is had his wife with him and his kids and he goes come on let's go over and say hello to Bernie was Roberto Costa and Roberto's like get the fuck out of my face before I fuck your wife in the ass read the book or the book I can't believe it read the book I'd let enter it got into Sugar Ray's head so badly that that was how he beat him he said that to him I'm gonna fuck your wife in the ass see ya look he comes running back out of my pushes and watch this look at the fuck away from me animal still screaming at him fuck you screaming at him after a war Duran beat him Duran was a monster he was so angry look at him bro even after all that fighting still insane finger rocking savage he was an intelligent savage like a savage technician you know his boxing was soap beautiful Duran was like he was he just knew how to nullify you take away out and put his will on you man animal all right leave still not gotta wrap this up Joey I got another podcast together I love you brother I love you very much I won't see you
