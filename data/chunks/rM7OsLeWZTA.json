hello freak bitches just keep keep stirring it's it's hard because it's fun it's exciting it's exciting to think that there's some sort of a giant ball of super geniuses that run the world and they decided to blow up Tower seven you know what's funny about the mountain fuck you know what's crazy about the moon is the hardest shit ever accomplished the greatest by the human race the greatest accomplishment ever was landing on the moon right right so you would think holy shitballs I don't think it does know what listen ok ok but let's just at the time at the time the Internet is the biggest ok ok but I'm just talking about like a physical achievement three dudes they got shot up in a rocket they were in a like a orbiter and then the orbiter shot out the lunar like the LEM and then it lands they played golf went doom bug riding the donuts in the sand they get take pictures they get back in takeoff dock with that orbiter and then fly back that's the hardest shit ever no one died can you imagine can you imagine that second mission six months later they did it again when when they had to break the news that that they were going to use different astronauts because every mission they use different astronauts what didn't you think they would like a show like I have the same star over no no the three dudes who pulled it off keep doing it dude oh you're kidding they did it before yeah but they don't want to keep doing it what if they were planning on using Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong but they just fucking got shit they started going to clubs if late the contract because I probably went to the moon for like you know seventy thousand dollars they've got that government check they go get you one the second album or on the second it just like the record business you know what I mean we make that much tape of course I say listen we'll get you on that second on the second and third landings you know much money you're gonna make you're gonna come back you're gonna be famous you're gonna be fucking doing all sorts of press think about the bitches think about the coke they probably got blowed out and got too cocky and wanted to renegotiate oh my and then NASA said we just got to go with some new dudes they made $8 per diem when Uncle Sam fucks you raw dog he uses sand Uncle Sam uses broken class on his dick do you remember that that this one always got to me man that those brothers that shot their their parents the Menendez brothers one of them had a wig on remembering it likes glorious fake head of hair they may have take it off when he went to jail it was a really crazy story cuz they shotgun their own parents alright woah man how the fuck does that happen the you know the one on the left has a total weight I mean oh I get it now the one on the right was just blessed if just straight-up blessed with some curly locks what the fuck man those those those sons shotgun their fucking parents man you know Kirk Fox used to teach them tennis oh that's right that's right I do somehow vaguely remember that so he has a whole story about teaching them terra tennis dude that scares the shit out of me that people could do that it doesn't scare the shit out of me nearly as much if people can get so angry at someone they could shoot them but it scares the shit out of me that someone could do that to their dad was their mom to reading they shoot the mom to Jesus you're adopted right were they yeah I think the Menendez brothers were adopted oh really yeah and I think I think they're just trying to get money Oh what is that sexual and psychological abuse they had suffered at the hands their parents are well there you go I know it's like you always want to immediately blame it on the kids right they killed their parents but the parents could have been fucking monsters yeah you never know oh well it's God they have to be monsters I mean if you think about it how do you make a kid that is capable of shooting you in your sleep you got to be you got to raise that kid horribly unless you just by dumb luck have to complete genetic psychopathy from birth that you could have done nothing to fix you've got two guys that are willing to shoot you while you're sleeping and you raise them from them time work they were babies that's crazy yeah anyway I was gonna say their house yeah I wonder what happened to their house burnt that fucking thing to the ground probably I wonder what happened to it like Nicole Simpson's house Oh somebody lived there wasn't Nicole Simpson's was that a house or was at an outside an apartment building sector condo that's a weird one because that's like it's a public building you got to just deal with it people just deal with it is that apartment like still empty hers and I he killed them on the street all right he killed them outside but every time you go home you have to step over a crime scene to walk into your house and you've seen the pictures yeah you know the history every time Oh Jay documentary comes out or every time they have an old Jay series on TV or when his parole hearing comes up you're like I can't open for the doorway into that house so I wonder like I want to talk to the person who's like doesn't give a fuck sprint would ya listen she should have been nicer daughter did you ever see the autopsy photos did I don't know if you haven't don't it's not worth it you get it I saw the murder scene photos it's just so hard to believe that someone could do that to someone yeah it's pretty thick haired about that they had babies with right just people but just rarely that's what it is it's like every week it's the game of Thrones it's normal and a Jonathan hight who's a social psychologist overdone why you hit a really good piece for the Atlantic in 2015 about this phenomenon this kind of safe space trigger warning phenomena on this idea that you must never be forced into a position where someone has an idea that opposes yours and what he said is it basically makes people crazy you know it actually makes you crazy that the idea in psychology is that if you have a chain of thoughts leading to a bad outcome if you're depressed or if you're depressive then you have a chain of thoughts leading to a bad outcome the way that psychologists deal with that is with cognitive behavioral therapy they say okay we're in this chain of thoughts are you going wrong are you attributing to somebody a motive they don't have right is your wife really being nasty or is it you just attributing nasty to her and that's why you're getting depressed you're spinning off right try to control your own train of thoughts what the microaggression trigger warning culture does is it actually grants value the more you are offended the more value you are granted and therefore you have actually an interest in being offended we give you awards if you're offended right you're you're treasured if you're offended because it demonstrates that you're woke right you're the more you are offended the more we can show that you are woke and because you are woke therefore you're granted this virtue you get to lord it over everyone else I mean I say my speeches if we could somehow identify like the LGBTQ half black half Hispanic 1/4 Native American little person you know then we would finally have the the person who we could go to to answer all of our questions because their identity would be unquestionable the biota right if we could find Yoda we could just get rid of democracy in discussion all together he just ruled from on high he she I don't want to put a gender on Yoda right I don't think his gender deep voice maybe we're being rude but no but yeah you're absolutely right is no one is uh no one's left enough yeah it's it's I don't know where the limit is and it's they're so far left that they've actually made calm and crossed with the people they hate right so then they talk about safe spaces and say it yet Missouri yet all these black students protesting and they actually said we don't want white people who think like us and who want to help us in our safe spaces we feel insulted by that I just thought to myself oh the KKK agrees like if you want to do safe spaces for separate races I can find some Jim Crow races are totally up for that from like 1962 well there's the the really bizarre statement that I've heard over and over again that black people cannot be racist against white people because they don't have any power over white people yes Wow which is just it's an inane I mean it's in the naiton statement this idea that you have to you have to have power in the superstructure in order for you to even to be erased I can understand the argument if they said look you being racist is not connected to racist action if you don't have the capacity for action that affects people then your personal racism is not as important as the racism of people in power then at least is an argument right the idea that you can't be racist at all if you're if you're black because black people don't have enough power first of all the idea that black people have no power in the United States is utterly crazy I mean it's utterly crazy well especially when I was going on more well Obama was president the Attorney General was was president I always said this about Baltimore we kept hearing you Baltimore right were they the riots they but with a dry 'its and they were saying well the Baltimore PD you know they're they're cracking down on black people okay the chief of police was black the majority of the City Council was black and Democrat the entire day the the deputy the district attorney he was prosecuting the case was black the majority of the police department was minority the Attorney General of the United States was black the President of the United States was black but up here in the majority of the city of Baltimore is black but apparently it's the white guy's fault like I just at some point you're gonna have to make your ideas actually work in concert with reality I can't like do this with you do you ever step back and [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
