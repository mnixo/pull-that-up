give a shout-out to one guy who I met he's a guy named Matt Ruskin right and he was in the Marines in Iraq and they had these fight clubs in Iraq and they would the Marines and they were for like Force Recon these were tough motherfuckers and he was doing this they had these fight clubs and they would fight the fucking returned and he he's like 200 pounds and he would fight guys were 250 he would fight guys are 150 he was fighting me would beat them all and he came back and he started doing MMA he started fighting MMA and he hooked up with this guy one of the Gracie's and and you taught him resilient Yuja to who of which he was I believe five-time world champion the Gracie which guy forgetting his fucking name is way like an amazing amazing guy Gracie yeah he's a Gracie and I went down Roger Gracie well wait is he competed a heavyweight heavyweight he was heavy was five-time world Brazilian jiu-jitsu champion and see I'm gonna call this I was great know how Hollis Gracie is very famous but well Hollis the son of holes right it's Paul screams gonna get in shit he's a real good looking guy he was a model real good-looking guy Hickson greatest of all this guy was actually a model in Brazil and Matt Ruskin if you can if you could tweet me as they yeah model and a great structure at Sears and five-time global your new YouTube champion we are now in a swamp of disinformation let's do know Wikipedia if someone could tweet us right problem we don't have a great Matt how are you I'm here with Joe Rogan we're talking about the Gracie's and I'm saying Gracie Daniel Gracie that's well Daniel Daniel Gracie world jiu-jitsu champion how many time three times yeah so he's a global jiu-jitsu champion Daniel Gracie yeah I'm gonna put you on the rogen hold on saying talk to him by the way Matt reskins fucking awesome dude and Matt what's up Matt well how do you know powerful Shane Smith from vice.com first of all how rude how about how about hey settle down first of all how about you tell them first and foremost that you love them you don't have to go right indeed you're you're a fat fucking you're gonna die he knows how much you love them you say that but is that judge alleviate the own that's you love it oh no gay stuff this is a late-night podcast there's a lot of dudes that are listening to this in the shower I'm sorry keep going Matt no gay stuff bro but we went tell me when we went down with Daniel Gracie yeah Daniel Gracie here's the thing about Daniel Gracie Daniel Gracie is a very very very talented brazilian jiu-jitsu fighter but his real last name I don't believe was initially Gracie think he sends his cousin yeah and I think his mom's name was crazy but his dad's name and his birth name was not Gracie right yeah I believe this is what I believe I believe he's a very talented fighter but I believe this whole idea of connecting yourself to the word Gracie is is ultimately very self-defeating and and when a guy does that I almost want a poem Assad if you love Daniel you're a bad motherfucker whatever the fuck your last name is it doesn't matter you know you need to get your your head wrapped around the fact that that's all bullshit Gracie is a great name but in its 2013 and when he was competing eight nine ten whatever the fuck it was mm it doesn't matter what matters is how good you are and adopting the name Gracie almost makes people think like oh well this guy's trying to get a little extra attention for no reason the world championships into the World Championship so you either mount a guy you take his back you tap them whatever you do you either do or you don't do and it doesn't matter if your name is marcelo garcia who's unbelievably respected I mean Marcel Garcia is the top of the pyramid when it comes to Brazilian jiu-jitsu in the world today in 2013 or gracie it doesn't matter so whatever his name was what was his real name man how many times you've been hiding your life don't lie to me have you been high in your life more than 10 is it more than 10 yes okay so we could probably go camping together how many times you eaten pot brownies and thought about chicks you fingered when you were 14 you were really upset like IRA gate Gracie more than time that's why I love talking to you Matt let's keep it together Matt but there was a few guys that did that the Gracie thing where they used the word what I'm gonna say is Daniel Gracie's when ago when I'm gonna say he's a bad motherfucker but by the way he took us around Brazil he took us to the valley to toe gems he took us to the gyms he took us with Matt and I gotta say it was fucking I gotta say you see a different level of shit down there then you will see anywhere else you never end a story by saying like holy shit a very good story I was with however you leave us I'm gonna say this give us a respective of the end I was I was with Matt on that and there was there was 14 year old kids don't lie to me Matt say yes okay listen bro I feel what you're saying and I was only fucking around I was feeling some dead space we were trying to recalibrate our reality due to your circumstances and your story being paradigm-shifting I'm not that fucked oh listen I want to tell you bat man I'm giving you a shout-out I love you this guy fucking is an awesome guy ex-marine and a fighter I love you mad man I'm very sorry they got dragged into a podcast it was just a phone call for you and all of a sudden shane swiss talking about some crazy shit and you're like god dammit I gotta tell the truth cuz I'm mad but but but then Matt Ruskin I don't give a fuck but Daniel Gracie is a badass motherfucker yes unquestionably was his real name Matt Daniel Gracie was his real name and I completely by the way I want to let everybody know there's no judgement involved Matt whatsoever I completely understand why someone who especially was in a situation where they were a very talented guy and they were trying to maximize the the sort of the the spread of their name as far as possible and the word Gracie because of hoist and because of Horry inand what they were they accomplished in UFC one it was one of the most important moments in the history of martial arts would you agree Matt it's it's for people who don't know the history of it or weren't there when it's happening as martial artists it was one of the most important moments ever it's like all of a sudden we found out what really works right and those guys that name that gracie name that shit's like q-tips or Kleenex you know it's synonymous i don't give a fuck about your tissues if you have tissues made by kraft macaroni and cheese if they're right next to Kleenex I'm taking the Kleenex okay cuz they dominate as does the NFL they dominate as well you know I'm saying Matt Jesus Christ back me 100% thank you man thank you in what way like Daniel Daniel was a you know why do you know why do you know why cuz they're smart motherfuckers cuz they're smart motherfuckers and they know how to make that paper son Matt don't don't freeze up on me now we're in the deep end of the pool Matt and we're not close to the lip hang in there are you with me buddy I'm sorry listen man I need to apologize to you as a human being you didn't know what the fuck was going on here you got dragged into this conversation Shane Smith calls you it's East Coast West Coast or Mountain Time what I'm just what I'm trying to say is Matt is an awesome dude do you hear this man he said Matt is a Shane Smith just said Matt is an awesome dude and then your grace he's an awesome and Daniel grace is awesome dude and what and what that showed me was also credit we're not trying to discredit any of that Matt you understand this correct no not yet in three minutes listen what's important Matt is you understand that I respect and adore Daniel Gracie and anybody gets in there I just think that if I could be have been there when hens oh and all those other
