anybody because you know she had a great crowd she had transvestites and mothers with the grandmothers with their grandchildren audience yeah collecting if they do you know what that security told me if they ever saw a single straight guy along this thing and he look straight they would they would track him all night because no no guy along goes to a cher concert if he's straight well that's a gay

liked her do you have like friendship with her do you contact her not anymore but you know she's very isolated yeah a good person and yeah she was like she asked me about the world like she wasn't really in it because she wasn't really in it to go what's it like Angie you know she asked me about people and then one night we went to I said I talked her into going out and watch you all I said look why don't you drop the outfits stop wearing a top hat than a cane and like maybe nobody'll notice with the fucking back and forth and she you know so we got an ice cream place and some like old like with French guy hey aren't you dude the famous one what's her name that's all she had to hear yeah who could ever forget all what's your name so then you know now that validated that she can't go out you know but I did one guy that's it yeah yeah but we had a good time you know we said it was a funny thing in the casino we would meet when I like in the in the arenas I would do my act then they'd have a break and then she'd come up so we'd never see each other except when she had it like a team prayer and then sometimes I was in that but one night when she's we would cross each other one night her grandmother and grandfather were there and she said to me she goes you just did a jig joke my grandparents there I said and by the way your ass is out and your grandfather's looking at

said what the fuck are you doing that was great that was maybe they worked with her for all those years you know you think she would good stage what was this song who are you singing I forget but it was pretty look is a good rock song you know it would be something like give me shelter or something I'm like enough oh wow but now how many different gigs you do Whitney Houston just the weekend was a long weekend and I I think I opened for her three or three nights and then it was like a long like how it like Memorial Day July 4 something like that and then I did a my own headlines the first of my headline was on the fourth night and I did a whole bit about her like making fun of her and singing and stuff and then the crew was crying laughing that's hilarious and her father was such a good guy and he felt like he said to me you know I really like you you're I said no thanks he goes I'd love a little work with my daughter again I said thank you I'm thinking no fuckin way I'd rather be a

ran up the thing and did like flips over do you remember I'm told right it's kind of maybe he was like maybe mulatto or maybe from an island or something he's kind of a light-skinned black kid and he was phenomenal he was he was leaping in the air like eight feet and and I'm talking about you I do I can't believe it all have his name on the top line but he was you it was like they sped the camera Loney away watching him it was a you know he was the one that knocked the guy out yeah I have to I have to find out what his name is right now because he's fucking brilliant and he's an up-and-coming kid so just give me so while we're waiting let's talk more supplements hey Dom what was it like meeting Johnny Carson was do you have any stories of anything cool that that that happened all of you the thing about it is and that was like in 1986 so that's when the Tonight Show is still really big and it was not fun it was a it was an experience was like a an imprimatur of comedy it was an experience John John shit sorry Kiko Johnny shit but Carson I I wanted to I looked in the hills in Burbank and I wanted to run away I wanted to run away and start a new life like in the hills because I was so fucking afraid of going on that stage when they cuz Jim McCauley they got a book that comes in talks to you and then they pull it back and there it is John Dawson sorry you know what's his name John Dodson that was a kid yeah he's amazing Tom buck what an athlete he moves like a cartoon yeah fly through yeah yeah it's just super town but he was doing that flip he was like walls yeah he's incredible yeah he's incredible he's uh yeah he does like cartoonish shit it's like so like so gifted you know he's just got like almost like an acrobatic ability let the other story whatever you say you were terrified so you're terrified to go on this stage was there curtain go back and it's unreal that you hear Johnny Carson laughing and Ed McMahon oh ho and see I had not a joke about Ed McMahon and when yeah when I saw him backstage he pulled me towards him I think all fuckin heads gonna slide me right before I go on Oh is he and I actually I didn't know that he loved the joke but you remember the joke yeah yeah yeah yeah it was like you call them what I call I said I met Ed McMahon he's you know he's been in show business for 35 years where do I go up to him and say hi ed I call mr. ed mr. e mr. Eddie McMahon mister you big fat lucky talentless lump kissing Johnny's ass for the last 30 years you Budweiser sucking ALPA was slinging nothing what do you do I don't mean that in a bad way that was a joke right now you know not a nice joke but hopefully and he took it in the spirit that he was a big success and I was a new comic and that's the way it took it you know that's awesome I watched Johnny Carson every single day I never missed it and I was a kid and that was there was no VCRs when I was a kid but I would sit there and watch it every day I think I remembered you from that when I first moved to LA I met you at the comedy store and I was like from Johnny Carson sure saw young Carson I saw a bunch of guys on Carson that wouldn't be in great comedians I saw Jenny on Carson he was a great committee he was a great comedian because that's what we always needed right yeah I mean Carson was the thing back when you were coming up if you got on Carson holy shit you fucking made it I know you would see a guy like Richard Jeni at like 18 Carson's or something yeah and you really already brilliant and and just such a great comic and you'd see those those credits and go Jesus Christ that guy did Carson 18 times and you would go see him and of course like Huey at the time when I first saw Jenny was like in the 80s he was a master yeah just a master I remember just being in awe and there was a bunch of other comedians that were at the Eastside comedy club member Eastside in Aruba Devine yep rich him intervene II me and Kevin James were sitting around after the show and were shaking her head we're like god damn he's good god damn it he apparently did two different hours on like Friday night he did two shows in 8 and 10 well good twos completely different hours completely top-to-bottom and they were like is both of them were slaughtering he is just a destroyer Bremen writer I remember feeling like what he could take premises that you didn't think there was anything there and you could turn him into like one of your favorite bits like he did a premise about buying a Corvette and the guy trying to talk him into all sorts of stuff in the Corvette and I remember thinking while he was doing this Wow how was this guy gonna make this funny he's talking about buying an expensive sports car and he's gonna figure out how to make this funny remember the rough thing he did I had a bunch of well you know we have problems him and I and it really was because of him I'm not saying that kind of yeah I'm sorry dad because he's dead no but what happened was we were like getting different things at the same time you know like they like each other well he was competitive with me and I think it's because people pitted us against each other purely because we're short Italians well I'm short Italian as well but you've never been anything but support of a nice time Thank You Joseph but I mean you know he one time I said to him because there was somebody was talking I said why don't we go out on the road together yeah we'll fill up theaters and he goes why would I want to do that I said I don't know make money to have fun you know he didn't understand the concept yeah he said to me one time he goes watch your comedy festival you think I should go there I said go with the idea that you're gonna meet beautiful girls go to great restaurants and if you happen to get a deal you do but have fun and he goes fine he looked at me like what do you mean fun this isn't fun that's just Terra he was tortured Wow he never enjoyed it you know that's the saddest part of it he was he never knew how good he was or he never enjoyed how good he was I first met him in Montreal yeah I first met him and like doesn't that worry you or yep yeah I met him in 94 just we were both passing each other and in the front doors just said hi and nice to meetcha ba-ba-ba-ba-ba what shows you doing that kind of thing just you know and he seemed to me like he just was a just a brilliant brilliant mind like I'm always thinking but just always you know yes on head maybe almost too much I saw him on a plane I was getting I was complying back remember they had three cabins and American no he's in first class he was in coach with Lenny Lenny Clarke no I let Clark Lenny and forgiveness Lenny Schultz crazy Lenny crazyland no not that crazy land that's one more pigs more shit Lee yeah it's a fucking Lenny's a comedy but Lenny you Dave Hawthorne his friend that you would know them okay but anyway he spent like I walked back to say hi and he goes you know I usually played first myself but I'm plying him I said it's okay I said you know no I went it's all right I didn't fly ABC flew me and he didn't like that either I'm thinking I didn't do that to rub it in and then I probably said to him rich what do you want me to do you want my cookie I'm just at first-class it's not a big fucking deal you guys are so Italian that's such an attack give me my fuckin cooler is good salami over there that fucking Soames get two nitrates yeah it's um it's a tough it's a tough lesson for those guys that are super competitive and loners it's a tough lesson as you start getting older that none of this shit is fun if you're not friends yeah you know like what we're talking about last night we're all hanging out is you me Kreischer and Josh Martin and all the in jessimae Peluso we're all hanging out that she's great she's so great but we're all laughing and having a great time and you know we're all comics you know yeah that's what it's all about supposed to be like that supposed to be we see each other we hug each other I'm excited I remember when I went to see the premiere of Batman the very first one Jack Nicholson was in it and he was at the bar and just fucking drinking and there's cheers everybody and Prince was there this little little you know kind of faggoty Prince guy how are you safe agony vexatious shit but anyway he's sitting there Joe he's got two bodyguards sitting in front of me sitting there and I'm thinking what fun is it why don't you talk to somebody feels a royalty though I mean the guy named himself Prince how shocking is that he wants to be treated like royalty with giant men guarding his flesh get these people either way I gotta get to my car I have an idea he had some high heels on - I guess he wrote the music for that but anyway it just struck me about there's Nicholson easily just as famous if not more than him and and he was like miserable yeah Nicholson's all having fun well yeah person yeah I took fourth grade and I know those kids are grownups Wow and that's really cool because some of them told me it was the best year of their lives they come to see me do stand-up oh that's amazing what worth great you know everything but fourth it's like different than science everything I mean yeah it's different than what you did because you went to some people who had like an interest and a love for something and wanted to explore it eat what you were doing but mine is different they had to be there so I'm I thing was self not self esteem I figure I can't teach these subjects are gonna come and go in their lives but teaching him self-esteem and some of the most rewarding things were like had this one kid he was real shy he was so shy he's real tall and he was embarrassed by it and he would stay in the clinic cloten cloakroom they'd call it you know where all the coats he just stay in there won't come out I go this guy used to calm Sky King because he was a space cadet go sky you gotta come out he can't stay I can't let a kid just sit and you know and by the end of me just like working his self-esteem and all he was in the middle of the class just what everybody else waving his hand and his mother came up to me and she was like really touched by and told me that I changed his life and you know that kind of shit school and now I got like a couple of the girls come to see me as she goes one of the girls goes mister why did you let us do so much stuff you know like I said because you were smarter than me I said she wanted me I said look you know I always had more knowledge because I was an adult but you know you kids Lonnie you had more brain power to me I know I wasn't I was smart enough to know that I was in that's why you ran the class so you were an easy teacher that's what you taught really easy I told them at the beginning of the year I said look I want this to be the most fun year of your life only you can mess it up I said a fucking awesome opportunity that must have been and I said I want to go to the gym this is what I was playing basketball I said I want to go to the gym more than you do so the read you know we thought we're gonna have a party every Friday afternoon I would have we would have like kids that would do breakdancing and stuff and really yeah it was that's awesome that was great did you ever try to pitch that as a sitcom no but somebody else had an idea for a couple times would be hilarious sitcom it seems like a natural yeah you as a funny teacher because you really did it it's legit and if you really stop and think about it that would be like for a kid that's like one of the greatest rolls of the dice a kid can get for a fourth grade teacher yeah at a girl down where our for your fourth-grade teacher she still calls me mr. I rarer she's 26 years old right when I said whatever and they calls me mister I rarer all right and I go Theresa first of all you're taller than me she's a hot blonde like oh you stop with the mister are you gonna call me dumb because I just can't call you dumb not funny like she's got you got me damaged mr.rai rare that's good that'll keep you from being a dirty Birds whoa she's a little girl what I call you mr. barish trying to stablish boundaries somebody said why do young I go cuz I can
