the girag an experience I'll tell you what the problem is grandma Hancock is the children well you're ignoring is you're endorsing drug use to children and I think that's incredibly irresponsible that's exactly what Ted said when they banned my talk one of their one of their statements they said that we we can't allow this talk to be on the air because some young man might go off to South America and drink ayahuasca that's so hilariously dead cannot be seen to be endorsing the drinking of Iowa is that the there wasn't a huge issue with you and by the way your issue was after Eddie Wang came in here and told his grouse story that makes you just go yo Ted yeah apparently John Anthony West has a TED story as well yeah and I think that there's a lot of beautiful things that come out of Ted a lot of interesting tools but it seems like any organization once people get into power and once people have the ability to you know tell other people what's cool and what's not cool it sounds getting weird and you start telling Eddie Wong he has to attend all these different things and meet all these donors and like some kind of freaky cult yeah well that's what he felt like yeah evelio was really strange now your your thing got pulled and what was this scientific explanation for why they got pulled um you you had an exchange with one of the guys on Ted I read the comments and you presented all the things that he had said and said please show your example of when I said this I never said this yeah what were the very what was the thing that he accused you of and what was the respond to of us who got our talks deleted Rupert Sheldrake Rupert Sheldrake is the other his talk was called the science delusion my talk was called the war on consciousness he can't be shitting on science like that call the science division Rupert how dare you poke it was as though it was as though Ted felt that these talks must automatically be wrong and that they had some kind of preconception about what we were saying so they didn't even bother to sit down and listen to the actual 18 minute talks not that much to listen to you know before deleting it from their YouTube channel they just said this is pseudoscience it's full of and they've listed a series of false statements that we'd supposedly made but the problem was neither I nor Rupert had made those statements so they never even bothered to look at it I just read complaints and then responded recognized and responded on basically those so when we challenge them okay please go through in my case go through my talk and and find where I say that ayahuasca allows you to communicate with an ancient mother culture where do I say that I never said that in my talk I never said any such thing in my talk they actually couldn't do it and something you've said before no I've never Sara said I've never said it right now I heard you well what you what I clip in there and what I talked about was the mother goddess right the experience of an encounter with the mother God is by never said it allows you to communicate with an ancient mother culture like a lost civilization they knew I'd written books about lost civilizations so they thought I must be bringing them my lost civilization be fed to thee into my TED talk which I did it that didn't have anything to do with lost civilization it was a talk about talk about consciousness anyway them and the real the original version was giving up the green bitch we were tourism recently I originally called the talk giving up the gree that's when I watched because I was giving my personal story of you know why I gave up cannabis I changed that title because a lot of people pointed out to me that that's deeply disrespectful of cannabis and that for many people cannabis is a Green Goddess and cannabis was a green goddess for me and I accepted that sell to those people I'd say fucking relax okay because I love cannabis - it didn't bother me yeah it is look I've got really upset I realized that to be UPS I realized that there is in fact a cannabis orthodoxy as well which I which my which is my talking about my my quitting of cannabis I had upset this orthodoxy but when I looked at my talk my talk was much more about the war on consciousness than it was about bad that's what it was really about so for example I made the point that our society doesn't object in principle to altering consciousness I mean what happens when you put a kid on ritalin you know that's a powerful pharmacological drug which is altering consciousness when you when you over prescribe Prozac or say Roxette for conditions of depression that those drugs are altering consciousness we value alcohol we invest you know have multi-billion dollar alcohol industry people don't primarily rate drink alcohol because of the taste they drink it because it alters their consciousness in a way that they like and and so we don't object to altering consciousness in principle but we object to altering consciousness in certain kinds of ways which threaten the status quo and that's what psychedelics do they alter consciousness in ways that lead people to ask profound questions about the nature of the society they live in and that appears to be the line that I crossed so Ted tied to tried to dress it up as pseudoscience and when I called them on that in the end because they realized I think that they were they'd got themselves into some kind of danger and it's still there on though on the webpage that they were Rupert and I call it their naughty corner then created a naughty corner of the Ted website where I totally put back online and with all their reasons why they've taken them off so first thing they did was they crossed out all their reasons so you can find that everything they said has actually been crossed out and then they published our rebuttal selected completely we know it we insisted that they they accepted that nothing they'd said was true uh-huh but we insisted they leave it there on the public record but put a line through it oh wow so that so that and they did they did that they did they did that oh my god they did that and then they have a cool victory I know I know and they published our rebuttals in full but it wasn't a complete victory because what they didn't do which is all we wanted was for our talks to be reinstated on the TEDx YouTube channel no no no only that but you can't put your touch your talk online yourself well no I have put my talk online myself and then and and so have about a hundred other YouTube channels oh and and I think Ted took such a massive beating over this for big because it clearly was an act of censorship however they tried to dress it up that they've decided not to go and pull the talks from from YouTube which probably probably they could do so I mean my talk had a hundred and thirty two thousand views on YouTube where on their Channel when they pulled it but since then it's had hundreds of thousands of more views all over the internet so you know they the rather than actually suppress the talk I think it's called the Streisand effect you know rather than suppress the talks they ended up multiplying same with same with rubens let us try so in fact apparently apparently that's I think it was Barbra Streisand tried to stop some public statement that have been made about her and it ended up multiplying this tape you know when you try it this is the great thing about the Internet when you try to suppress something it grows it doesn't get suppressed the Internet including dick pictures it is in a I don't want those out there coming back around Graham Hancock I'm gonna find you I've never had my dick photographed congratulations how about you I plead the fifth Freaks and Geeks look
