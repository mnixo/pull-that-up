trained my dad Joe Rogan podcast by night all day he was think there was still that kind of prestige of patos like after he lost that and it's like now fucking yeah looking cold shit but they always Hawk saying this as coaches were saying that his own MMA coach after he knocked out Brett Rogers said that phaidor one with his old tricks but he would have liked to have him for more time training sure and he thinks he's not he's not approaching it correctly and he just won by being phaidor but he also caught a four doom with that old trick he caught him knocked him down and then the mistake of Fedor made was he jumped into his guard but remember he jumped into pounder but he caught him really really well knocked him down with the exact same timing that he did to everybody before that okay maybe ya start maybe or maybe ver doom goes down on purpose the moment a punch hitch them so he could drag you into his director which he does yeah he's a smart guy ver doom is a very smart car yeah fight smart on Saturday definitely did not like the fuck would you face first cuz he got tagged if you watch the stoppage if you receive you can find the highlight I'll show it to you cuz this is something that I wish somebody brought up during the the actual commentary he got tagged right before he got knocked out he got tagged doing the same thing with the right hand he moved forward he was making these advances he moved forward he got tagged with that right hand and I think he was on queer Street and I think he went running at steep a on queer Street and got knocked the fuck out and the way steep they did it was a fucking work of art the angle it was like Anderson Silva and Forrest baby step to the right oh there's a better even best better his angle was sick off his right hand was nasty it's also ver doom dig it they hit early and in ver dooms training if you've seen him train it there's this competition within that gym when you get hit it's like whoa got to get him back I think it was morning he it's hit and he's like go charging bones like fuck this man I think it's probably a little of both I agree cuz I definitely do both he got cracked cracked and I'm like well that is a big right hand that he got hit with and it's in the same manner same manners charging 40 got hit that's how although got knocked out against McGregor yep you gotta be fuckin real careful charging 400 weight articles and you know you see Bay's not got some great guys but he's not a knockout artist per save comparing like the mark hunt and who else and he's not knockout artist when the guys charging in like that and then you're counting with right hand it makes it seem way worse well here's my take on steep based power I think steeper has big power but I think he fights economically and intelligently he's a smooth fighter good boxer he's a very good boxer Golden Gloves boxer but he's like smooth and relaxed in the way he spars it's one of the things that makes him so dangerous is is he does things very correctly you know and I think you know DC was on on the commentary for the UFC recently was talking about getting the rub you know he was talking about that experience when you have a tough fight with someone you get the rub and he fought Junior dos Santos they went to war but I mean Rob this is what I mean what he was saying is like Daniel says when you fight someone that's really good and they're better than you even if you lose you it elevates you you get the rub like just by sharing the ring with them just by being in that rib eye competing with them you realize how good you are to get when we actually get better and you realize how good that person is yeah I think he got the rub when he fought Junior dos Santos in a way because he went five rounds with a guy who was one of the toughest to the tough guy was one you know a champion and knocked out Cain Velasquez with one punch and he went five hard rounds them and the decision couldn't went either way and and took his best shot yeah and I also think that to go back to DC's point your point with the rub I I think at the UFC level especially when you in that top echelon you know you're good people are telling you you're good but like when he beat Orlovsky you know he starched them you don't learn much from that man when you go up to a decision with a world class guy and then you know like you're doing something right right your camp you're doing it right you had good gas you realize what works what does it so you learned so much more yeah and he's going to like you said war with JDS and we see him getting better and better well what's really interesting now is here's the dark horse and nobody talks about Stefan Struve is only 28 years old that fucking dude is gigantic he's seven feet tall and if he could put it together and he put it together on Bigfoot silver the other night knocked him out I know the guy has a bunch of knockout losses I know he does but he knocked out steep a Struve not stupid hey how's this lasted as his only lock-on he up see ya dude dude Struve do not count that guy out yet Struve to the inside leg kick and then he's got that heart issue and stuff well I don't know what he's got going on physically but I'm saying that kid if he puts it all together when you're seven feet tall how long does it take before you even get coordinated right I mean it's like you're sending a message and it's got to go so far before it gets to your fucking hand yeah and then I mean have you thought you fought guys are super tall like jack man those guys I mean well yeah but like the thing is is steep a would be are not steep a Struve would be such a fricking handful if could learn to use his reach but you do guys like Roy Nelson when you get these upper echelon guys you know nothing gets Bigfoot but off TRT or whatever the case he actually needs it off it it's mean I think anyone the top 20 kind of fucks them up but what's true the real testament who they give him next well Struve got fucked up by over him and over in those Roy's super intelligent fight the way fought it took them down beautiful take down on top I'm just ground-and-pound the thing about strews you got to realize that kid is I think 40 fights yeah there's a shitload of miles out well that is is Mark Hart and the mark what it does not zosh no beats I don't know what he's got what is the medical condition I forget we have to say manager so mark deals with all time that Mark Hunt knockout Jesus Christ mark hot with that leaking left hook shattered his face oh dude mark on hit so fucking all you've been caged I'd seen that right oh it's fast - he stills a fast I think if steep a um can get I'm curious to see if steep a can get but with in boxing distance of Alistar and take away any of those kicks and how he sets it up it was gonna be interesting Alistair can box man he can't oh yeah for sure better than this I'll be I'm not gonna tell you knocked out junior with one punch that's good he's the best striker in the UFC heavyweight division maybe of all time so so so steep a steep a then is gonna have to close that distance and knocks him not necessarily note steep could crack him look Ben Rothwell knocked him out in the first round DP has better for thinking happen and about footwork and bouncers been stopped a lot by no guys chins the question this is the thing people forgiving with Alistair and motherfucking grapple oh yeah in wrestling grapple his ass off yeah so you want to go to the ground with him you me in a world of trouble well he won the Abu Dhabi European trials and in Pride he submitted Vitor he's gotten he also submitted mark hunt he has a nasty guillotine dude his shoes Nia Tina she always forget about it just as a striker but you want to get a ground said I don't think steep a has a lot of submission work under it yeah so steep and I trained for two years together that kid has submission defense so you know Rashad as his black belt if you ask for shod to show you like omoplata a real specific offensive move its I don't think it's that black belt level but his defense and that's steep A's defense is nasty super nasty it's just what he's really good at defense yeah he's a very smart athlete yeah you know and very good and it's when you have a guy who's like who could probably be a professional ball player right you listen a he could probably be a professional ball he didn't make it yeah I didn't make you know but he's at this level of an of an athlete now what I'm saying is it's rare that you see a guy like that who comes over to MMA and fights like super technical super smart who's also really really tough like a firefighter yeah the foot professional phase ahead of his head is the biggest head I've ever ever seen him too large that nicest guy ball time he's a great guy but he's he's got a rare set of attributes meaning that he's at pro sports athlete level like as far as like like his ability is movement and his intelligence and his approach and his training and then on top of that he's tough as fuck toughest tough as fuck like in this fight let me tell you something dude I watch this fight very careful and one of the things that I was noticing was like how calm he was through everything through the walk when they watch understand each other down one of the things you can really pay attention to is the shortness of the breathing if you watch people breathing during like nervous situations a lot of times even if they look calm you could sort of see this uneasiness in the way they're taking in oxygen you're sensing tension not saying you don't sense any of that shit look at you know it's impressive - is he doesn't come from like a mastermind camp no it's just his boys in Cleveland well he just might have a mastermind cami there's a lot of masterminds out there that don't have the right pupils I'm saying he's not from like a Jackson's a K the ATT he keeps his shit within Cleveland does work and then ghosts and bees and then saves people from burning buildings who else is in that um that camp is it the worst style MMA there's also the isn't there a Leslie Smith from there no it's not Raquel Pennington right yeah I know it's just guy Jessica so they have tough fighters it's just like if a guys are like a really skillful trainer and you know you've only been doing it for a few years you have to wait for the right guy to sort of walk through your door I mean about then walking through the door I know that mr. dealing with lady Bravo with Eddie Bravo took forever for him to find someone who could do his style and and prove in competition that it's very effective not just with him yeah a unique study base brother or dad the guy with the moustache look at that guy with the mustache guys awesome that looks but you talk about Steve a being calm remember he's fighting right now that guy's not that old Brian why call that guy his dad looks like it's his older brothers four years older brother I guarantee it okay but just some fucking thick dude you know um Eddie Bravo had a real good point about this we were talking about on the phone he was like Fabrizio looked too relaxed he like he was coming up to the to the ring he was making that face that he was I yeah I'm so sick of that face uh well he's being funny it's being silly I don't think there's anything wrong with a fighter trying to stay loose I don't at all you know I think that's one of the things that Fabrizio does to have a good time he likes to make that sillies also been doing it forever he likes it he's the man he's bullies Fabricio Werdum if you won the fight made that face no one say a fucking word if you went out there and head kicked steep a Miocic you know no one would say a word yeah but it didn't work out so when it doesn't work out that's when everybody comes shitting on you what's the same I was the same with Conor with the Conor name gars walking out like you have Rousey you know same with Ronda when Rhonda lost everybody's mad at all the shit they loved her for they loved her for don't be it do nothing bitch and fuck you I'm making it to the top kiss my ass they hate her right now David now we think she's arrogant same with Connor oh you with your wit shit yeah he's in Venice right now drive around the Royals Royce yeah whoo Wilin out look I just you know it's just what comes it's part of what people love about people bragging I they want to bring you down though man I'm a cop look how loose steep it looks look how loose I mean he's fighting for the title nice and loose look at that moves away getting argued he should I got title earlier too but he's like he's just such a nice guy and a lot of checking - a lot of good checking of kicks my kids Moines ties very good a lot very educated with his movements and look fabbrizio has got some fucking nasty kicks man and hit like right there his striking is much improved we saw it in a Travis brown fight man all four ratios maintained just on the feet yeah their last kiss fight dude his striking is fucking legit he's long as shit and he's got confidence in it that nice switch kick there yeah bits of beast I think in order to be that dangerous of a fighter you're gonna have to open yourself up a little me then when you fight a real strategic guy like steep eight you're gonna get a little bit of trouble well I think what happened in this fight in particular is that he forced it yeah I think he's in this gigantic soccer arena it's the biggest crowd in history and MMA in Brazil look at that beautiful leg kick though Knoll doesn't know yeah the inside so that yeah it's all nice like the technique is real nice but I think Fabrizio was just so ramped up because there's all these people in Brazil and I think he's a confident man I think he thinks he's the fucking best in the world he just has to get a hold of this dude there's a right-hander nailed ray tried to see so nobody can take a shot yeah but now but but now look he's forcing it he's forcing it cuz he landed it yeah so watch when he starts to force it he gets hit real hard and then he gets hit hard and knocked out he tried that knee tries forward and when sees he got a terrible single attempt there that was like such a you're not getting steeping on that what was also I mean he might have been just trying to make him work but or maybe open up possibilities excited to drop for single I think you just say - just keep it up right and range so he's not afraid to just be right in your girl's not dopey he's not riding range all right but he's real relaxed like even the ways throwing that jab top top top yeah like he's economical and when you're economical in a five-round fight super that'll Chad I was a very nice leg Fabricio he's timing that jamming yeah great inside leg kick in the the jab also is super light like he's just floating it out there pop there's nice locks 20 jabs - he steps to the to the side there like that so I look at that jacket see how light that is - you know he's not there's no tension there you know I'm saying like it's like flowing they checked that leg again nice leg kick by steep a nice switch so right now for me SEOs realizing like okay this is there it does an easy fight okay courts it that's the more part that's the one you're right out right here bang that's the case now back it up again watch just just back it up just a little bit - the words chasing them so watch these chance he got rocked the idea player is really never crying your crap hella problem you're right I saw the direct though Joe I didn't see that until and he got mad and he came at yes yes he guys whack yeah he got tagged hard with that right hands right and then he kept charging and then he got face planted with the second one that that first right hand had him on queer Street I guarantee you because he's moving forward and steep a drop sit in on him and it's the same punching knocked him out with and it's when swen steep a throws a punch and this is how you know he's good at me obviously was fucking good but this is how well you you notice his techniques at a real high level his arm is like loose huh and then he throws it and then as it gets to his face he tightens it down and just this smack like as he's moving away he sack like it's uh super efficient like really technical punch to the throat that way moving back back in that sense it's very much like what Anderson did Forrest Griffin is also calculated kids do it twice mmm and they both land in their boat you can tell they're working on it so she threw he threw that the left hook twice right right right right yeah moving back moving back and some is he stepping to the side when he does that or we have to yes it doesn't even necessarily have to be that he planned it out and it was a part of the game plan I think she paid does that I think he's a really good striker if you're looking at his movie yeah and I think you're looking at a guy who's super fucking determined man steep a is super determined and when you're a guy that's that focused you're gonna get fucking really good at everything so after he gets that fighter that jab see that jab yourself looks like an uppercut yeah it is - it's so like everything he's doing is so relaxed and efficient you don't see a lot of jab and for bridge okay I don't see a lot of jabs like my all-time favorite fighter probably if I had to tell you who I was most excited to see fight is probably Vandelay there right now boom boom see that right Angelis first russian his fucking hurt here he got mad he didn't just get mad his legs jolted he had like you could see his legs tiffen up when he got hit by that first right hand he got hurt and then the second one faceplant some steep a is a dangerous guy who's not gonna mix Hayes all your Lake mistakes hey Cleveland let's get our boy a goddamn parade no one went shit no shit hey LeBron you want a jacket other UFC fight us how would you tweet out about steep a your boys from your fucking hometown he jumped off the fence he goes on the world champ a little world champ yeah man here's like it was like like coming into his mind like is this real information hey LeBron did that just happen fucking game up fucking yeah I love it I love that get to it man I love him I love what he stands for I love watching him as a fighter I love that he could do that I love it I love that he did it in Brazil look at that me too watch this watch how a fish doing see it's like tink oh yeah he just dropped it in on to be able to time it that good - look at this watch the timing dudes like push timing dude he pushes his hand away yeah douches and then put the same hand did you see over in Jesus do you see over hims tweet crack yeah yeah he wants to find him yeah said you're next and he did have bloodsport meme know him see them that way showed both that that was that highlight right there was the perfect highlight to the right because he showed the first one how much impact the first one had on him the first punch was a big fat there man that first punch had him Co weird up unbelievable man so cool I like that you could still say queer Street and you're not a homo queer streets fun so straight you know like we're that way yeah it's just strange you're like what we're am I at the heavyweight division is fun right now man because I don't think we're gonna see a champ reign for a long time
