the Joe Rogan experience yeah that's the problem those guys aren't woke once everyone's all wow it'll be looks it dangerous word to use I feel like people gonna mock it in the future woke woke yeah I feel like using woke now like on ironically it's super slippery let's see a trap coming you do the jiu-jitsu practitioner in me it's like I don't like this move this is I know where this leads yeah I see that way I'm like what are you woke up you woke up what are you 12 well it comes for my 16 year old so yeah kids today but what is welcome beam it means your brain is open you're open to some your problem is there's no real quantification there's no real there's no test you take the show that if you're woke right right like mathematician you have the fucking show that you know to do math the professor's check your work but you get through like yes congratulations Tom papa you are a mathematician your PhD in mathematics it says right here on the paper like goddamn it I'm gonna put this shit on my walls you understand I know how this stuff works yeah but woke miss yeah anybody can claim to be a master of woken us it's like kung fu without fighting it's very dangerous yeah no no you find what's Woking what's preposterous no one's defined by what's what's just not racist and not sexist and not homophobic but open-minded and aware of the the failings and the misgivings of all sides all right and with no bias right is that what cuz doesn't seem like it is isn't that woke I think he just described what I thought it was I would like that but too many people could jump in there's no there's no real clear understanding of like what makes and constitutes someone being woke like yeah how many of those boxes do you have to check stop Tom Papa had awoke Academy right and you took these people do you like bread or not like bread claiming woke you super slippery what's this James 62 New York Times Magazine Wow crazy if you like God dig it look if you're woke you dig it Oh Matt's the perfect definition right strain if you're woke you dig it that is insane that was my Fox man and you were copying my taste and grit don'tjump salty on me whoa look how they talked back then they were trying to talk people into talking in a way that made them seem more interesting I'm gonna say it the way I would say if I live back then hey could you be the guy on the left Jimmy no don't scroll we could read that whether his comments yeah what he's saying up top yeah okay that was that was my Fox man and you were holding that my grace and great so how would you say that now that was my Fox man you a cop in my taste and of course its girl that's my girl yes we sing no that's what they said Oh would use what words would use today yeah yeah he would say the fuck he doing with my girlfriend dickhead and he said don't jump salty on me I would say we're cool no worries no worries stop being such a bitch it's all good it's all good yeah and then it'd be like what someone's a bitch and then next thing you know people be hitting each other that's a darkness no men I think what you're saying is of one very important point that we need to move past the military gatekeepers of Technology right not just military though though it's it's big tech which are at advertising agencies in social media things that are constantly predicting your next purchase right yeah because if you think if you think about it and I mean even in a semi democracy look like we have in the u.s. I mean those who control the brainwashing of the public in essence control who votes for what and who controls the brainwashing of the public is advertising agencies and who increasingly are the biggest advertising agencies are the big tech companies who are accumulating everybody's day and using it to to program their minds to buy things so this is what's programming the global brain of the human race and of course there are close links between big tech and the military like logout Amazon has what twenty five thousand person headquarters in Crystal City Virginia right next to the Pentagon and I mean China it's even more direct and unapologetic right so it's a new like military-industrial advertising complex which is is guiding the evolution of the global brain on the planet which found that with this past election right with all the intrusion by foreign entities trying to influence the election that they've these giant houses set up to write bad stories about whoever they don't want to be in office yeah in a way that's almost a red herring but it I mean the Russians stuff is almost a red herring but it revealed what the processes are which are used to program oh because I think the whatever programming of Americans Minds is done by the Russians is many minuscule compared to the programming of Americans minds but I got the American yeah American corporate and government elite right so it's fascinating that anybody's even jumping in as well yeah so my dad my dad danced limbo right my dad was the baddest nimble dancer on the planet really um and he did some crazy crazy stuff you might need to try to get it didn't Oh probably when I closed my phone okay um there we go waiting for Jamie to grab it I'll leave it open um no my dad used to dance limbo and Limbo's when you go under the stick yes yes and um he I don't want it I don't want to ruin it right but he was the best from like 88 like the year before he died Wow so like I don't know it just

hold on do you eat they damn how the fuck is he doing that you don't kind of core strength that takes yeah it's blowing fire but this right here now this is where it gets ridiculous this is like I see this and I'm like yeah that's my dad right he's gonna go what so this is on fire folks and this this thing is I'm not bullshitting and he's got two flaming pizzas in his hands and he's like that that might be what 13 14 inches off the ground and he's going under it that's insane and he's spitting fire while he's doing it holy shit you weren't joking no my dad was a badass that's crazy how crazy is looking at those old VHS footage right digitized it's not that long ago man no and that's a different world and that that that kind of thing my dad kind of I mean I was always with I used to love being with him you know he's like my best friend i remember i was telling my son this story about him so i had this this thing with my kid and i'm recording this conversation me and my son and i'm like what would you do if you go back in time he's like what i was like if you had a time machine go anywhere where'd you go he's like I don't know the 1900s and I'm like I grew up in a 1900 you talking about last week and I told him this story I was like you know my mom I was little my dad used to I used to bring me on stage to do that I was like four five years old no I was like four years old and he'd pick me up and carry me under the under the bar right and one time he brings me on stage she's like this is my son and he presents me in the spotlights on me and I'm like shy and I'm like oh and he was kind of disappointed you know he's really disappointed me that day I met um a couple weeks lady I was with him again he's like I was like that he bring back on stage and he brings me on stage and I'm he's about to pick me up and I'm like moonwalk away can I go back to my seat and he loved it he loved it you know and I told my son that story my dad was like he people afterwards we walked through the hotel to go back and he has me on his shoulders and he's just so proud he's like you see my boy he's like you know I told my son about that my son was like this is like 40 minutes later in the conversation and my son is like that if I had a time machine I would go back and hang out with you and your dad Wow I was like that was like that was like the best moment of my life Wow message it that's done you examine your fucking brain and that takes some hard work and suffering if you're not really do that I'm sorry and it's usually there's no way to do that as a bystander no you can't watch it man yeah you gotta get out there like oh this hurts this hurts real fucking bad I don't think this is smart and then guess what happens the body will just it will adjust if I goes well then the next question I get but is you're a time when it doesn't adjust I guess some of the stupidest shit man like don't don't take with the grain of fucking salt people's those questions are people that are wanting to quit yes yes that's what I say when should I quit yeah like did you ever like feel like no shut the fuck up stop stop I know what are you like that there's always that next question no don't take it like go out there and run through a brick wall as many times as you can no I'm not saying be me don't run towards in five miles at one time I say and do that I'm saying start to learn the mind is powerful it's powerful man it's unbelievable but if people need they need a thing to get them going right they need a thing right I need a goal they need they need a like it's what sometimes the first step is the hardest like it's hard to take that 1 million step to but sometimes the first step is the moment there's something about those they start going over the phone they start calling people they don't let it out of the house right it's and there's something about procrastination it's like you know it's painful oh yeah I know you should be doing things but you just keep doing it you keep each in that step i procrastinate like a motherfucker man every day I want to do this shit that's what's so funny man people looking like I'm some damn superhero that came down from the guys from the heavens of Earth no man I don't want to do this shit I'm looking at my shoes for 30 minutes sometimes they can fuck man people people look up to you Goggins fuck them I might want to do this shit man but guess what you do it I'm gonna do it as long as you do it and that's what I know about it that's why I stopped doing I'm thinking oh man you're gonna fuckin sit here you look at your shoes for 30 or 40 minutes you go you're gonna think about all day long you go do it anyway and sometimes you don't have the time to look issues for 30 minutes no those are the those are the beautiful days yes as you know you just have to go that's right and so like there's no room for procrastination and that's when I when I was in the military I loved my schedule cuz I knew it to be work at seven o'clock so you better get your ass up at four o'clock man you get your shit in brother because I had to get my shit in before I got my shit in right you know so that was my mentality back then man you know like I I had to get the miles and get everything in man and get to work man I'm competing with the alpha males [Applause]
