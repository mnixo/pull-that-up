hello Malcolm hey Joe how're you doing I'm doing very well you sound like you good good that was a good time but it's through headphones it's very interesting because I've been listening to talking to strangers uh-huh I like that you narrate your books it's very frustrating when someone who's a great speaker does not narrate their books so thanks for doing that no I actually I kind of enjoy I used to hate that process with my first one and then I've grown to enjoy it because of you when you say your book out loud you see in a different way oh well I'm a giant fan of your work man particularly outliers I've really loved that book yeah very illuminating and it sort of peels away the the mystery of talent hmm and so tell me what you're doing what is this talking to strangers I'm into about I'm in the second chapter right now oh I see well that was that was a book about I was struck by how many of the kind of high-profile cases that we got obsessed with were at their root about the same thing which is that individuals were two people who didn't know each other well had an exchange and they got each other wrong so you know everything from Amanda Knox to Bernie Madoff to the - Larry Nasser at Michigan State to Jerry Sandusky at Penn State and then to the signature case which the book is organized around which is the Sandra bland case remember the young woman Texas it gets pulled over by the southern road yeah they're all at Roode fundamentally the same problem which is there's a there's an exchange between and the exchange just goes wrong and the question is why that's what I began to get really fascinated by is you think at this point in even of a human evolution we have got this thing about talking to strangers down mmm and we clearly don't and we're being pushed to talk more more to strangers right in a kind of globalised world and if we're bad at it that doesn't bode well does it well I think there's also an issue today with people not learning the necessary skills and how to talk to people because so much communication is done digitally yeah that's it seems to be a giant issue with young kids there they're more awkward initially talking to people than I think I remember yeah yeah no I think that's probably you forget how much I mean adolescent adolescents used to be this one one long rehearsal and how to be a normal human being right conversation and now the rehearsal it's like they were also got cut in half and you know instead of getting to the point where we play basketball with basketballs we're still just doing wind sprints there's not you know right no it's actually playing game you know playing the game butchering the metaphor I know what you're saying nothing the Sandra bland case how does that one fit him because that one that that girl was pulled over the the cop was she it was failure to signal right yeah I'm it's a bullshit thing it's a bullshit thing yeah and she started lighting a cigarette she told it told her to put the cigarette out and it all escalated from that she said she doesn't have to put the cigarette out and then he says he's gonna light her up he's screaming at her he pulls her out of the car he rests her and then is there controversy about whether or not she committed suicide in jail there is I don't get into that okay because it seemed that seemed unlikely that she was killed that yes it seemed likely that she was killed versus she committed suicide I didn't think that someone would commit suicide being in jail for three days especially one of the things you highlighted in the book and you actually played in the audio version of it her little sort of affirmations you know and she was she sounded very positive and upbeat and calling everybody kings and queens and it was everything thanking God and being very thankful and being aware of of life and humility and just graciousness and gratitude it didn't seem I mean obviously you don't know what kind of dark things can happen to a person when they're incarcerated for three days for a bullshit reason how maybe that's the straw that broke the camel's back but she did have you know she had a complicated emotional history she had previously I tried to commit suicide oh and she had she was emerging from a quite a difficult period in her life and went to Texas to start a new leaf and so there is an interpretation like I said I only have strong feelings on this particular part of the story but there's an interpretation that says here's a woman who was emerged from very difficult period in her life goes leaves she was she was in Illinois she drives hop across the country to start over and on the first day that she arrives in Texas to start over she gets pulled over by a cop and by the way she had thousands of dollars in outstanding tickets so she had a history of this bullshit stuff with cops where you know the the same trap that many poor people in this country get into which is they get the police use people has an ATM right they like set them up for done trivial things and when they can't find when they can't pay the fine they get another fine and when you know you how that goes she was part of in that trap so here she is trying to start over after a difficult time gets first day she gets to Texas she gets pulled over again and she in her mind it's the same she's like oh my god I tried to start over and I can't no and then she's in jail and she can't make bail and you know there's a scenario where you couldn't see that she just began to despair don't they take away your shoelaces and into Old Town Texas yeah are they doing things by the book I mean I find the whole thing about I went to that town when I was reporting the book and you know the it's kind of hard to be to kill kill someone and get away from get away with it requires a level of expertise and forethought that struck me was not present in that little town in Texas I mean a serious heart it's just not I don't they're not like they're not thinking this is these are not people playing chess right I think they they just encountered it with this cop and he's not very good at his job and he gets way over his head and he completely miss reads her and he pulls her off to jail public deeply regrets the whole incident and they're all embarrassed and sitting around and hoping it'll just all go away and meanwhile she's all alone in a prison cells spiraling deeper and deeper into depression I mean it's I think it's almost more tragic that she committed suicide it's insane that you can keep someone in jail for three days for failure to signal it seems like there should have been an initial review of the circumstances that led to her getting pulled out of the car in the first place and the cop should have been fired immediately you're screaming at her because she lit a cigarette yeah in your own car me well this is fascinating and I feel like I don't know you you and I are probably the same age there's this to the cops 29 if you grew up with cigarettes you have a different understanding of the meaning of lighting a cigarette so what's happening in the encounter is he pulls her over what he does is he sees her coming out of this University campus and while she's still on campus property she rolls through a stop sign and then he notices that she's cut out of state plates and she's a young black woman and she's driving a Hyundai like Donna not a Mercedes Benz and he thinks huh I'm gonna check this out so he she pulls onto the road and he drives up behind her aggressively he speeds up behind her so what does she do well what any of us would do she gets out of the way thinking oh he's a he's going to he's going to you know the scene of an accident or something I better get on his way she pulls over to get out of his way and he goes oh you didn't use your turning signal and he pulls in pulls her over and pulls it behind her no by the way whenever I hear a fire department truck or a police car coming and I pull over to get out of the way I do not use my turning signal right you just get out of the way it's relaxing right so her immediate thought is what he does this is like oh this is bullshit and he tricked me and he knows what he's doing that's exactly what he wanted he wanted to get her in a situation because it's all a pretext he just wants he thinks oh maybe there's something weird with her so then he we have this all on tape of course because this is this is one of the sins that was captured entirely on the dashcam the officers dashcam he goes up to the window and he says he looks at her and he realizes she's agitated why because Alvin she's pissed off and he goes MEMS or something wrong and she's like well you know I want to know why I'm below Barbuda and then he goes back to his car and he comes back to her and he later says in a deposition that when he goes back to his to his vehicle to check on her license and registration he begins to develop suspicions that she's up to no good she's got drugs or guns and so she comes back and it commenced to have this increasingly heated conversation and she lights the cigarette because she's trying to calm herself down and this is my point you and I who grew up in an era where people smoked all the time know that one of the principal functions of lighting a cigarette was to calm your nerves and in her mind I think in her mind she's trying to signal to the cop let's deescalate this and I'm one of the ways I'm gonna show you that I wanted to escalate this is I'm going to take a moment and light a cigarette and just take it down a notch and let's have a real conversation he doesn't understand the meaning of that gesture and he thinks oh she takes several things he thinks when she's messing with me she's defying my authority by lighting a cigarette she's gonna blow smoke in my face or something you know nefarious or she's gonna like take the lighted cigarette and put it out of my he has always kind of weird crazy fantasies this is what he said in a deposition oh yeah he so even on the level I try and identify in the book all of the different ways and this is when I come back to the case at the end of the book I go through this in more detail all the different ways in which he completely misunderstands her and one of them is he doesn't understand the meaning of lighting a cigarette in a moment of tension and that's you know still more evidence why you need if you're a cop or anyone dealing with a stranger you need to slow down and jot not jump to any conclusions because there's so much you can miss what it seemed to me when I listened to it initially and then I listed it again in your audio book there's a thing that happens with police officers and I've never been a police officer but I was a security guard for a brief period of time and I recognized it and myself and I recognized in a lot of people that I work with is that you start treating the other people like the other like it's us and them it was us I worked at great great woods it's a performance center in Mansfield Massachusetts like this and we would catch a lot of people smuggling booze and things like that and there was an attitude that you got and I was only there for one summer but there's an attitude of they were they were the bad people and you were the good guys it was us and them and we stuck together and they weren't us and cops get that a hundred times worse because there's guns involved and they can get shot at we've all seen videos of God cops pulling people over and he says can I see your hands please the guy pulls out a gun and shoots at them we've all seen those videos those are this is all always in the back of the mind of cops yeah and I think that was just a guy who as you said 29 years old is a young guy he's not that bright not good at communication and he is this attitude that he's a cop and that you have to listen to the cops because he's them and you're you yeah and that that's like when he's telling her to put the cigarette out and she's saying I don't have to do that and he's saying get out of your vehicle and she's saying I don't have to do that and then he's screaming at her I mean that's that's all right there I mean yeah so it seems like to me he wants compliance he won't sir to listen he does yeah he does what he gets it's funny the what's remarkable about that tape which I must have seen 50 times and which has been viewed on YouTube you know even a couple million times is how quickly it escalates you know the whole thing is it's insanely short yeah you you would think if I was telling you the story of this you would think oh this unfolds over 10 minutes and it doesn't it unfolds over a minute and a half and that what I remember years ago I wrote my second book blink and I have in that book a chapter about a very famous infamous police shooting in New York case of amadou diallo I remember that remember that was shot like 40 times by cops yeah and one of the big things I was interested in talking about in that case was how long does it take how long did it take for that whole terrible sequence to go down so from the moment the police develop it suspicions about amadou diallo to the moment that amadou diallo is lying dead on his front porch how long how much time elapsed and the answer is like two seconds it's boo boo boo it's like and I had a conversation with them actually here in the valley with Gavin de Becker has he ever been on your show no fascinating guy was a security expert security expert incredibly interesting guy's friends with Sam Harris I know that yes yeah yeah and he was talking about this question of time that when you're a security guard guarding someone you know famous a lot of what you're trying to do is to inject time into the scenario instead of you don't want something to unfold in a second and a half where you have almost no time to react properly and what you want to do is to own it to unfold in five seconds if you can at all I'm making this up I can't remember his exact term but basically what your job is is to add seconds into the the encounter so that you have a chance to intelligently respond to what's going on and so he was hit this great riff about um how good is really a secret Secret Service guys are and one of the things they do is they're there they're either not armed or they don't they're trained not to go for their weapons in these situations because this point is so say you're guarding the president you're a body man for the president you walk it through a crowd somebody comes up to you like pulls a gun wants to shoot the president his point is if you're the secret security guy and your first instinct in response to someone pulling a gun is to go for your own gun you've lost a second and a half right your hands got to go down to here your whole focus is on getting to your own gun and in the meantime the other guy whose guns already out has already shot you've lost you need to be someone who forgets about your own gun and just focuses on the on the man in front of you right and protected the president but he was all in the context of time is this really crucial variable in these kind of encounters and everything as a police officer you should be doing is slowing it down wait I you know analyze what's happening and that's what he doesn't do the cop in this instance speeds it up right he goes to DEFCON you know she lights a cigarette and within seconds he's screaming at her this is like you know a parent shouldn't do that I mean let alone a police officer by the side of the highway right but the difference is he knows she's not a criminal I mean he must know it's bullshit he's pulling her over because he's trying to write a ticket and the way he's communicating with her when she lights a cigarette it's like she's inferior he this is not someone who's scared he's not scared of a perpetrator he's not scared that there's a criminal in the car about to shoot him he's not scared of that at all he wants other total complete compliance and he's talking to her like like he's a drill sergeant but can't you can't both those things be true how so well in so in the deposition he gives which I get till the end of the book and I got the tape of the deposition is bad it's totally fascinating it's like he's sitting down with the investigating officer in looking into the death of Sandra bland and he's cut I don't know how long it is two hours now he's walking them through what he was thinking that day and he makes the case that he was terrified that he was convinced he says he goes back to his squad car comes up and there's submit there's some evidence to support this so he pulls her over and he goes to the passenger side window and leans and says ma'am you realize why I pulled you over bla bla ands are you okay because he she doesn't seem right to him she gives him her license he goes back to his squad car and he says while he's in the squad car he looks ahead and he sees her making what he calls furtive movements so he's like furtive movements also he thinks she's being all kind of jumpy and you don't know isn't he just says I saw her moving around in ways it didn't make me happy and then when he returns to the car he returns driver's side which is crucial because if you're a cop you go driver's side only if you think that you might be in danger right he doesn't if you go driver's side you're exposing yourself to the road when you reason you do that is it when your driver's side you can see the it's very very difficult if someone has a gun to shoot the police police officer who's pulled them over if the police officer is on the driver's side right you have an angle if they're on the passenger side so why does he go but if he thinks she's harmless there's no reason to go back driver's side I think this guy I think these two things are linked I actually believe him he constructs this ridiculous fantasy about how she's dangerous but I think that's just what he was trained to do he's a paranoid cop hmm and then why is he's so insistent that she be compliant for the same reason because he's terrified he's like do exactly what I say cuz I don't know what the what's gonna happen here right and she's I you know I I don't know I I I don't think those two those two strains of of interpretation are mutually exclusive mmm that's interesting it didn't sound like he was scared at all it sounds like he was pissed that she wasn't listening to him yeah I didn't I didn't think he sounded even remotely scared I felt like he had I mean we're reading into it a try right I have no idea but from my interpretation was he had decided that she wasn't listening to him and he was going to make her listen to him yeah that's what I got out of it I didn't get any fear and I thought that version of it that he described just sounds like horseshit it sounds like what you would say after the fact yeah to strengthen your case well they so there's another element here that I get into which is I got his record as a police officer he'd been on the on the force for I forgot nine ten months and we have a record of every traffic stop he ever made and when you look at his list of traffic stops you reason you realized that what happened that day with Sandra bland was not an anomaly that he's one of those guys who pulls over everyone for bullshit reasons mmm all day long so I think I've forgotten exact number but in the hour before he pulled over Sandra bland he pulled over for people for other people for equally ridiculous reasons he's that cop no and he's that cop because he's been trained that way right that's kind of quotas strange strain of modern policing which says go beyond the ticket pull someone over if you if anything looks a little bit weird because you might find something else now if you look at his history as a cop he almost never found anything else his history as a cop in fact I went through this I forget how many hundreds of traffic stops he had in nine months if you go through them he has like once he found some marijuana on a kid and by the way the town in which he was working as a college town so I mean how hard is that I think he found a gun once misdemeanor gun but everything else was like pulling over people for you know the the light above their license plate was out got that's the level of stuff he was using he did this all day long every day so he's like to him it's second nature yeah pull her over like who knows what's going on she's out of state she's young black woman was this comparable to the way the rest of the cops in the force and his division did it well I looked it I didn't look at the rest of the cops on his voice what I looked at were state numbers to the wherever there several American states give us like North Carolina for example will give us precise complete statistics on the number of traffic stops done by their police officers and the reasons for those stops so when you look at that so I have the I look at the North Carolina numbers for example in the North Carolina Highway Patrol it's the same thing they're pulling over unbelievable numbers of people and finding nothing but night you know one percent less than one percent hit rates in some cases have being hit rate being finding something of interest so like they're pulling over ninety nine people for no reason order to find one person who's got you know a bag of dope or something in the car you cannot conduct policing in in a civil society like that and expect to have decent relationships between law enforcement and the Sicilian population yeah no question but doesn't that sort of support the idea that he's full of shit that he was really concerned that she had something he'd never encountered anything well or or this was the one the fantasy in his head is so what so the questions why does he keep doing it if this is a guy who day in day out pulls over people for no reason and finds nothing and continues to do it now there's two explanations one is he's totally cynical and thinks this is the way to be an effective police officer X mission number two is this is a guy who has a powerful fantasy in his head that one day I'm gonna hit the jackpot and I'm gonna open the trunk and is gonna be fifteen pounds of heroin and I'm gonna be the biggest star who ever lived I think there's also a rush of just being able to get people to pull over this the the compliance thing which is another reason why he was so furious it what she wasn't listening to him yeah and she kept a cigarette lit yeah or she was listening but not complying yes yeah um what are the laws I mean are you allowed to smoke a cigarette in your car when a cop pulls you over how does it work like that yeah I mean of course yeah he can't stop you from engaging they can't tell you to put out your cigarette there's no law no he could have said I mean no there's no law I mean the car though two things the historically give enormous leeway to the police officers in a traffic stop as opposed to a person-to-person stop but uh but no I mean right this is about what he should have said is he could have said ma'am do you mind I would prefer if you put out the cigarette while we're talking or I'm allergic to smoke or whatever I mean he's a million ways to him to do it nicely he's he's a jackass about yeah but he he's basically doing the job like a jackass he's doing a jackass version of being a cop well so this is so this is one of a really really crucial point in the argument of the book which is I think the real lesson of that case is not that he's a bad cop he's in fact doing precisely as he is was in trained and instructed to do he's a he's the ideal cop and the problem is with the particular philosophy of law enforcement that has emerged over the last ten years in this country which has incentivized and encouraged police officers to engage in these incredibly low reward activities like pulling over a hundred people or defying one person who's done something wrong that has become enshrined in the strategy of many police forces around the country they tell them to do this I have a whole section of book right go through in detail one of the most important police training manuals which is you know required reading for somebody coming up and which they just walk you through this like it is your job to pull over lots and lots and lots and lots of people even if you only find something in a small percentage of cases why that's what being a proactive police officer is all about right so they are trained that that phrase go beyond the ticket is a is a term of art in police training like you got to be thinking you sure you pull him over for having a taillight that's out but you're look you're thinking beyond that is there something else in the car that's problematic that's to try to find so there he was being a dutiful police officer and the the answer is to re-examine our philosophies of law enforcement not no I mean you can't dismiss this thing by saying oh that's just a particularly bad cop not great but I don't know if he's any worse than you know he's just doing what he was trained to do that's the issue he should be trained to summon deference right that is the issue right the issue is there this is standard practice to treat citizens that are doing nothing wrong as if they're criminals yeah and pull them over and give them extreme paranoia and freak them out yeah how do you find something I was home I'm Canadian and I was home in Canada small-town Canada a couple weeks ago and I saw in the pack you know how these cars always have there's often had their slogan on the side of the car the back of the commune so in my little hometown in southwestern Ontario sleepy you know farm country the slogan on the back of the police cars is people helping people so Canadian like the external understand this is a country with very very low levels of gun ownership which means that a police officer does not enter into an encounter with a civilian with the same degree of fear or paranoia that the civilian has a handgun right which is a big part of this regardless of how one feels about gun laws in this country the fact that there are lots of guns mean makes the job of a police officer a lot harder and every police officer will tell you that in Canada the you don't have that fear but it's also Canada and its small town Canada and so when you encounter a police officer in my little town he's like he's people helping people he's like he's like driving like a Camry and he's you know he's like this genial person who was a really camera he's I forgotten exactly what the drivers not like they're not driving explorers yeah explorers painted black with like big bull bars at the front right and then you go you know I was you go I mean even in LA you know I like the cars are painted black and white they don't really look ferocious I mean the whole thing that what it is still look ferocious do I just look they identify as police to connait to a Canadian looks to me it looks a little why do they have to paint them black forgets nothing Oakland Raiders I mean it's like what do you think they should pay something mild in like bright yellow something lovely something lovely like a nice can you imagine a teal or a climb green well that would be yeah because there's a lot of black cars a lot of white cars on a lot of teal cars it's good so it would yeah it would stand out like oh it's cop this paint car but you know this kind of symbolism right matters right right you wanna see an image sheriff joe arpaio who makes all those prisoners wear pink yeah yeah that's kind of thing but I mean to against his point though how many women shoot cops isn't that an insanely low number yeah I mean insanely low I mean what are the numbers I mean it's probably almost non-existent yeah well guys pull over women I don't think they're worried about being shot I really don't I think it's horseshit I think it's all after the fact yeah he was trying to concoct some sort of an excuse it's gonna excuse for um is he still in the force I know he he's kicked off for I've forgotten the precise language they used but for basically being impolite to a but yeah I don't think there's a lot of but I don't know whether I mean I still think we're saying the same thing which is the thing that's driving him his motivation is now rational right and if you were a rational actor you would never engage in an activity where 99.9 percent of your police stops resulted in nothing right yeah he's he is off in some weird kind of Fantasyland and for a reason which is that's what in certain jurisdictions in this country that's what law enforcement has come to look at look like yeah that's that's problematic it's a huge problem yeah the powertrip aspect of it I mean you know I've only often said what would they do you know because they're certain that there's certain areas where police officers do have quotas or they have to write a certain amount of tickets what will they do if no one broke the law for six months welcome to see they should that's what small-town Canada yeah what would they do I mean I really be curious like what would happen to the number so I because what you're saying that they use people as an ATM they really do I mean people are they're glorified revenue collectors they're pulling people over trying to write huge tickets and I believe is North Carolina where you're talking about that's got this creepy law that they've recently I think they've recently changed it where you're allowed to just confiscate people's money because if you see like I pull you over hey Malcolm why do you have $3,000 on you yeah you have $3,000 in cash what are you doing with $3,000 give me that money and they take it and you have to prove that you weren't going to buy heroin or buy illegal guns or whatever and then most of that money wound up going to the police department yeah so they used it to like build a fucking gym for the cops or whatever means literally they had an incentive to keep the money and is that North Carolina they did that there's a new civil for people lost yeah yeah and they're really gross do they still have that or I mean I know it's check extremely controversial and people are up in arms and furious that you know their money has been stolen people on their way to buy a car for instance you know and they get pulled over and a cop will just take all the money this is what um I talked a little bit about the Ferguson case in my book later on tonight this is what Ferguson was ultimately about the focus in the Ferguson case was whether the officer in that case is Darren Wilson what he didn't didn't do to Michael Brown but the real story when the department justice investigated the real story is not being counted he knows to it is that that's that the police department in Ferguson was being run as a revenue-generating arm of the city government and people in city government were directing the activities of law enforcement to maximize revenue and this is incredible stories of there's one story where there's a guy who's just been playing basketball and he's sitting in his car parked by the basketball court like cooling off after play basketball cop rolls in pulls up behind him and ends up writing eight tickets including accuses the guy being a pedophile gets him for one of the things he gets him is putting a false name on his driver's license when his driver's license his real name was like Michael and his driver's license said Mike like that's the level of eight tickets right that was routine practicing so you you know you there's a reason why a kid like Michael Brown in Ferguson is gets really angry at law enforcement because law enforcement was a completely discredited institution in that city for years and years and years and years and years they had been basically praying they'd been preying on the on the lower-income community of that town and so of course relationships between the population and the cops had reached a low ebb that's a real you know there's a it's funny the one of the reasons I want to write this book was then the the kind of conversations we have around these things frozen's a great example ninety five percent of the conversation about Ferguson was just about trying to break down what happened between the cop and Michael Brown and the issue when we finally look at in a systematic manner we realized oh no no it's not about that it is about a system that had been in place for years and years and years and years in which the the the african-american population in that town had been preyed upon by the police department that is the broader and you cannot come to an understanding of what happened with Michael Brown until you're willing to engage that case on that much more broader systemic level hmm when you make the title of this book talking to strangers are you do you have a goal that you're trying to achieve are you trying to illuminate certain aspect of communication you're trying to highlight issues that people have had with these stories like the Michael Brown story or yeah I mean I'm trying to I wanted to start with the premise of why are we so bad at you know like I tell the story in a book of the Larry Nasser case at Michigan State which ones is the guy remember the doctor for the gymnastics oh it turns out to have been millena file yeah you Jennifer so there you have a case where everyone thinks they know this guy he's their friend he's this gifted doctor the parents are willingly bringing their kids to to be treated by him the parents are in the room while he is abusing their kids and they don't see it the kids are saying something were to happen and the parents are dismissing it so I wanted to that's a good example of a phenomenon that I wanted to try and explain which is how is that possible how can we think we know someone and be so completely wrong how can you take your kid to a doctor and think the doctor is the greatest possible doctor and in fact what he's doing is abusing your child in front of you right and that's a very similar kind of problem to Bernie Madoff people invested their life savings with this guy not not little old ladies in Dubuque sophisticated savvy incredibly intelligent investors handed over millions of dollars to this guy who was not even true I mean the Madoff fraud was so outrageous he didn't even bother to and he didn't even put it in t-bills I mean he just spent it it was just like crazy what's T bills Treasury bills oh I mean he was David he was he was a 100 percent sociopath fraud yes and people over the course of 20 years wrote check after check after check after check to him thinking was this brilliant investor you know that's a puzzle that's what I wanted to get my people did recognize as something was wrong right there were financial analysts that were saying that this doesn't make sense a few of them but it's funny there's a my favorite story on the in the Madoff chapter is the greatest hedge fund in the world is Renaissance technologies these are the guys out in Long Island who have had like 30% returns for 25 years they're like all PhD are you know AI genius literally geniuses and they found themselves yours before betaf was busted they found themselves with I think thirty million dollars you know madoff fund because of some complicate transaction and they're all geniuses so they look at what Madoff's doing or like and I don't look good like that doesn't make any sense to me and so like what should we do we have thirty million dollars stake in a fund and we don't understand what the guys doing and you would think logically they would sell their stake they don't cuz it's returning no it in fact it's not even returning that their own legit returns are twice his illegitimate returns there may be only they actually make the point that his returns are really low for us like there's no reason for us to keep their money but they don't sell what so that's what I was trying understand like they can't even you know there's this notion I talking on because it's called default to truth which is this idea from a researcher called Tim Levine which is as human beings we're trusting engines we are evolved to give people the benefit of the doubt and once you understand that and why do we do that because it's the right move 99% of the time most people are being truthful and if you have as your strategy I'm gonna believe what people say it makes you a fantastic friend or wonderful person to work with it means you can you know scape through the world with a minimum of fuss if you're the paranoid person is a person whose life is a nightmare right because they are suspicious of everything that moves so we evolved to be trusting engines because that makes your life easier that's the best part of human people want to mate with you like if you won't talk in evolutionary terms about who passes on their genes nice people pass on their genes given the choice between having a child with a crazy suspicious paranoid person or a loving trusting person you choose the loving trusting person a hundred percent of the time so multiply out times a million years of human history you realized trusting genes beat paranoid genes every other week right so that's what we are we're credulous by by by evolutionary choice so those guys at in the Renaissance they're they're no different they may be smarter than the rest of us but they're not constructed differently their inclination is to believe people and like well I don't know guy says he's a good investor man why not let's hang on to it see what happens right that's their motive they don't they don't you don't get to run a organization as successful as Renaissance Technologies if you're some crazy paranoid person right how would you even invest in anything if you were crazy and paranoid there was a lot of people that were really intelligent and invested in Bernie Madoff hedge fund to Steven Spielberg was one of them he lost a shit ton of money oh yeah I mean look at the roster list there isn't it you cannot point to an unsophisticated investor on the list of people who lost the most money from every one of the most smart that's strange it's so great it is great like think about it like and by the way getting a decent return in the market is super easy you you go to you know Vanguard and they you know they'll give you the market return you're in your si tard but these people like they wanted to do something fancier and they and that's what happened well he when you realized what a sociopath he actually was he is in the interviews after he's caught or he's demanding certain things and complaining about certain things he doesn't seem to have any remorse yeah then he wants better treatment he wants better food he doesn't seem to have any remorse that he's you know literally robbed people of their retirement yeah ruined the last part of their lives where they thought they were gonna have a considerable sum of money to sit back and just enjoy their grandchildren no now they're broke you know there's another poor yeah and now they have to figure out a way to get by and eat he doesn't give a shit he did he doesn't in fact what's weird there's so many things weird about the Madoff case one of them is we forget that he doesn't get caught he turns himself in right and he turns himself in because not because he's screwing up but because he's quote-unquote so good remember the financial crisis hits in 2008 and his clients are losing so much money on their legit investments that they go to man up and say can I have some of my money back from you I got to pay off all the stuff I've done that it's gone sour so like in effect no one ever caught him he gets caught by a once in a you know one-in-a-million circumstance where he's the only one making any money for his client so they come after him my point is if you if you're totally rational and you look at this you say here's a guy who managed to bamboozle the most sophisticated people in the world to the tune of billions of dollars for 25 years he only gets caught because we had a once-in-a-lifetime financial meltdown isn't the rational lesson of that that we should all be Bernie Madoff's right he's like super easy it's like not that hard I could all I have to do is you know he dressed really nicely I get really nice office space on the east side of Manhattan what what did he actually do nothing it really didn't invest in anything he just moved other people's money around and he ran a Ponzi scheme he spent a lot of it and how does his sons not catch on to this that's a good question cuz they're not being but one of them committed suicide Breyer that's right and then so it's an open question of how much they do how much anyone else knew I you know the older I get the more I believe in the powers of particularly within within family denial is something now I don't find hard to believe hmm so your ability I've now heard so many stories of you know a parent is some kind of monster and family members just won't see it they just can't bring themselves to go that so did they know something everyone knew there was something slightly fishy and what Bernie was doing but it never went so far as to think that he was just making it up so they knew something was up but they didn't know it was a hundred percent horseshit they thought that he was so there were some people thought that he actually had investments but he was there was a suspicion for example he was front-running that because he had a larger business managing the the deal flow and the Nasdaq that he would get advanced word of where money was flowing and he would jump ahead of the queue buy stocks before other people did and profit off the when the stock would rise he would just sell and profit off that difference so there was a feeling that he had a dubious kind of illegitimate strategy that nonetheless legitimately made him a lot of money so people like well if so long as he can get away with it and I could profit off it I'm fine right but the truth is he wasn't doing that at all and truth is he was just he was he had as he had some Confederate in the Attic of his company essentially making up trade orders from scratch I mean they were just making shit up did how many people got arrested I forget I think they took I can't remember the exact number I think they got he had two Confederates I think and went down with him that's it I think that's what it was in retrospect it's a really it's one of these crazy it's one of these crazy you'd think it you know that whole institutions would have fallen yes no did you ever hear the conversation that he had I believe it was recorded somehow on a phone or something or maybe was after he was in jail we was talking about trying to get money back from one of his biggest investors the guy had gotten like a billion dollars from him over the years that's right yeah he's like you got to give the money back he's like fuck you I'm not giving you shit yeah and you know that this is crazy conversation where he's basically telling this guy look you knew this was bullshit and you were making money off this and now you know yeah yeah so so this is like the clever so you think about this that guy I know you Zack were you talking about yeah so so game the Stu let's let's just do it let's do a um a a hypothetical scenario okay you have a friend who's an incredible salesman and has gone around Europe and Saudi Arabia and raised a twenty million dollar fund 20 billion dollar fund and they're promising a twenty percent of return a year on your investment right so you give him a million you're getting two hundred thousand dollars a year back from this thing you know it's all bullshit but no one else does what is the rational thing for you to do the rational thing for you to do is to take your on your million dollar investment is to take the two hundred thousand dollars that is May made in quotation marks every year out of the fund so you say most people you know when you invest in stock not only what you do is you check the box I want my I want any dividends or earnings reinvested in the fund don't check the box take the real cash so if you're investing with this phony friend of yours for 20 years you're gonna get $200,000 a year for 20 years that's four million dollars you will make four million clear of your out of your 1 million initial investment in in 20 years right that's smart if you know what's going on so that's what some people did with Madoff they're like yeah I don't know what he's doing these returns are pretty fantastic I'm just gonna take all my earnings off the table every single year so they are the ones who the real winners of this whole thing with those people yes this money is not real that money's coming from other investors it's nothing's being made actually what happens with them like if a guy does make all these millions of dollars like that one guy he had to so give some of it back yeah so what happens is they appoint remember they appoint a after the scandal breaks and made-up is invested they bring in a kind of supervisor financial supervisor who has the power to clawback winnings from the money from the people who took who took cash off the table so but not everyone had to claw back and the question was how far back do we go so if you were investing if you were investing with Madoff 25 years ago and you took you know 10 million off the table between 1990 and 1993 do you have to give that up to like it gets complicated also how can you prove that he was doing the same activity but exactly exactly oh it's a conversation I really wish I could remember where I was hearing this conversation but somebody had recorded Madoff talking to this guy telling him look you got to give that money back yeah yeah yeah my Schwab fund looks better and better a little time it's just so scary to me that mean finances in the stock market and all that stuff has always looked like magic like what is going on there what do they do moving these numbers around like when you see the ticker tape roll by like what what is all that if you don't have any understanding of it it's like a foreign language yeah and so you're hoping that all these geniuses can't be duped all these people throwing their tickets up in the air and everybody there's a buy-sell they all know what's going on you don't know what's going on but hey there's a lot of things you know that they don't know and this is just how the world works yeah turns out no turns out the people that were involved in this crazy very difficult to understand thing didn't know it either yeah like they barely can understand it and this guy was just stealing money in some weird way and if the stock market didn't crash if we didn't have some sort of a depression who knows how long he might still be an operation today he would so without without the crash of 2008 there's a very very strong possibility that bernie madoff would still be going gangbusters all he has to do to keep surviving is to take in enough money to cover withdrawals yeah so there's some like we said there's a some portion of people who withdrawing their winnings he just needs to make enough to get new enough new money to cover their withdrawal so he's got a fifty billion dollar hedge fund and let's imagine there's a billion in withdrawals coming out every year he's gotta raise a billion now if you're Bernie and you already have 50 it's not that hard to raise another and particularly because he had people all around the world and he was giving them the huge fees to raise money for him so that's the other way that the people who really made money from him were the people who had I forgot what it was but you would be say your your your Joe the financial guy in Zurich you have a whole bunch of wealthy European clients Bernie would let for every for every million you raise for Bernie Bernie would let you keep I forgot what it was a hundred grand that's a nice business that's real money yes you just kick back 900 to Bernie and keep a hundred grand and that your feet free and clear no one's calling that back right those guys got very very very well very very wealthy oh that's weird money you're sitting in your house that stealing built that's got to be strange so what can be learned in terms of communication from the Bernie Madoff story well the the Brody made-up story and all you know all of these ways but this one in particular goes to this question of we really think we're good at spotting liars and we're not so virtually every profession that is invested in you know in an investigation of human beings has some belief that you know we know how to figure out is like yes and the truth is nobody does and if someone tells you they are good at spotting Liars there's a 99% chance that they're lying the evidence the the so if you could think if we did an experiment here where I had a hundred people parade through this office right now the studio right now and every one of them made a statement in front of you and some were lying on someone to tell the truth and I asked you Joe tell me who's lying is not yours accuracy rate your success rate would be 52 to 54 percent in other words slightly better than chance you might as well flip a coin it's slightly but if you don't and that's not about you anyone in that chair watching these people parade in front of us is gonna do a slightly bit better than chance and the reason was slightly better than chance is there are a small fraction of people who are such epically bad Liars that there's just we're not gonna lose those people like we those are obvious one thing that you can tell those if it's an area of your own personal expertise right like if someone tried to talk to you about what it takes to write a book and get a book published and get a book on the New York Times bestseller list and they were just making things up you would you would okay so that so this is oh he said now you we talk about a separate thing he's specialist that's content-based so if I pretend to be a UFC fighter you're gonna spot my liar my lies in five minutes because you know more about the content than I do but let's remove but there you're not catching me because I look like I'm lying you're catching me because I'm saying something that's bullshit I have a good story about that I really I good story I used to think that I was really good at spotting liars and then I met this guy I met him through a friend and that's I've given myself a pass and then I met him through this friend he was a friend of a friend so I just assumed he was okay because my friend is a very good friend and this guy was claiming to be this Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt and he was writing for this online magazine that was like a well read magazine in the martial arts world and it was the Abu Dhabi combat club they were responsible for this big the Abu Dhabi submission World Championships is the biggest championships in the world is very highly regarded high prestige this guy was talking about these fights that he had had and you know people bullshit a little bit so you give people a little bit of room for that but then he was talking about this particular particular move that he had pulled off in a fight that he had just learned from my friend and it's a very difficult move it's called the twister it's basically a guillotine from wrestling and it's set up from position called side control it's really complicated you have to wrap someone's leg around you have to roll onto your left shoulder you have to get behind them you have to grab their arm put it over your shoulder grab ahold of their spine and it's essentially like a spine lock it's a very difficult move to pull off and it takes a long time to master to the steps it takes a long time to understand the position so this guy learned it and then a couple days later claimed to have pulled it off in Thailand and it was like it's like one of those scenes in a movie with a wretch record scratches and everybody just goes what and I remember we were like what's going on so then my friend winds up rolling with him rolling his sparring it's you do Jiu Jitsu rowing and he comes back to me he goes there's no fucking way that guy's a black belt it doesn't even make sense he goes he's like he doesn't know what the fuck he's doing like this is really weird so he winds up having this confrontational conversation with him on the phone while I'm in the car he's talking to him he goes I want to know what you are because you're not a fucking black ball so tell me what's going on he says hey no no my black belt in Japanese jujitsu it's it's now time goes out wait he tells this guy to go fuck himself time goes on the guy winds up killing someone he winds up murdering this girl that he's having sex with murdering her husband and he gets caught driving around hurt his car the guys car after he's killed the guy and then he winds up trying to recruit a friend to kill someone there's like this whole big thing and he winds up going to jail and he's in jail now but I remember thinking okay you don't know shit about catching and spotting Liars cuz you didn't you didn't spot that guy's being completely full of shit like I thought it was a little full of shit but I didn't know he was a like a complete sociopath and a murderer yeah yeah so this is an interesting question using that scenario would you have done a better job if all I gave you was the transcript of this guy speech so there's this is a there's a lot of interest in this question the community of people who study deception so there's many different I can suppose I'm trying to improve my ability to spot lies I can we can do three things I can listen to you face-to-face as you're telling me something is either true or false I can we could do this entirely on the telephone so I don't see you I just hear you or I can just read the transcript of what you say and try to decide whether it's true or false and it seems to be the case that we're better when we just when we remove sight and sound and all we have are this the word two plain words on the page hmm there was that there is what being present does is it introduces all kinds of of noisy information that just distracts us from the core question of whether the truth is being told so maybe it was maybe if all you had was a transcript and as this guy is describing this particular what was the name of the movie it's a twister the twister maybe as you're looking at the way he just doing is focusing on the precise way in which he describes this very very intricate move and you would realize Oh he actually doesn't understand what he's talking about and you would have seen it clearly in that moment if you but maybe there was something about his presentation that threw you off the scent it was the move itself see because if he just said oh I got I got the guy in an armbar well a lot of people catch people in arm bars it's it's a very common move you learn it first day of jujitsu yeah you can catch someone someone makes a mistake in you're a white belt and they reach up and you grab their arm you can catch an armbar yeah twister is very difficult to pull off very difficult yeah it's only been done in the UFC maybe once I think chan-sung Jung the Korean Zombie pulled it off once he may be the only guy maybe one other guy ever yeah this guy was delusional so it was horseshit and the only thing that we were taking into consideration like he was fight supposedly fighting in Thailand which turns out there was no fight at all he's a complete liar yeah the only thing that we were taking into consideration was maybe this guy fought a scrub like he could have fought someone who really didn't know anything he said let me try the twister on him but then that's like you'd have to be beating the guy so badly you just would end the fight you wouldn't do a twister on him the only time you do it twisters if you're a highly skilled grappler and you think you could put someone in the position that they don't understand it's a confusing position it's a position that there's a common position called the back mount where you would choke someone or you would transition to other moves from there and he was almost there but not quite there because you're caught you're kind of on the side so even seasoned grapplers occasionally make mistakes and get caught in a twister but you have to be a fucking wizard to pull that off on somebody yeah it's not something you have to be really good it's not something that you can just do so when he said he did it we were all like what if he said he had kicked the guy in knocked him out oh that well that happens all the time he said he punched the guy hit him with an elbow and cut him the referee stopped the fight all that stuff is real that happens all the time he chose this one signature move of my friend Eddie and we were both like there's something wrong here yeah something wrong here there's a hilarious version of this on kind of a runner and on all the the running message board is one called let's run which is sisters and they're constantly catching people who lie about their marathon times it's hot it's a hilarious well there's all kinds of reasons but a lot of it is it starts with the eyeball test so they'll be up you know because a lot of marathons have they take pictures of the participants at various points during the race mm-hmm and someone will claim to run like a 240 marathon now 240 you do really good run it's not world class or name to be serious to run 240 so they'll eyeball someone who claims to run 240 to say now but I mean you start looking at them 10 pounds extra pounds right there they should be they should look like they've been running they look totally fresh as a daisy right now they're what are they doing wearing no shoes no 240 marathon you know it's like is that kind of process and then goes the second order where they do complicated analysis of splits and they do all this kind of thing but it often begins with the same thing it's like these guys trying to claim to be this no no no right that's not working that's like a I love those in cidery well I have this thought about how much culture shifted through the internet and how much culture will shift again in even more astronomical way once we can read minds and I don't think we're far away from that I think we're a few decades away from some technology that allows people to establish intent and to see thoughts and I think they're very there's some sort of theoretical work they're doing on this right now and there's there's different models that they're trying to achieve I think that's going to eliminate a lot of the bullshit of communication and I think it's gonna happen really quickly just like Google sort of eliminates a lot of the bullshit of people telling stories about something that someone goes why what happened wait a minute what year and they go good that didn't happen and they can find out like almost instantaneously I think we're gonna be able to figure that out with people I think there's going to be a way where you can where we can see intent and we can read minds I don't think we're far away from that yeah I mean I known this neural link thing with Elan mush is very Elon is very hush-hush about this is different sort of electronic brain interfaces that they're trying to experiment with yeah who wouldn't wouldn't you worry be that if we read we're able to read someone's thoughts mm-hmm intentions what we would in fact discover is even more confusing than what we know now in other words maybe what's inside my head right now are 35 different thoughts and intentions warring at with each other murder scenarios yes mercenary then Malcolm just sort of keeps everything normal I think it's totally true think about it most of us there's any number of things think about that yes the list of the list of possible things that could come out of my mouth at this very moment is infinite mm-hmm right it is evident there are at this very moment God knows how many scenarios swirling around my head about what should I say next right right and why is my intention to try and make you laugh to impress you to piss you off to disagree with you to agree with you I mean it we can go on and on yeah all those are in play so you really want to look inside my head and get you're not gonna get clarity yeah it's gonna be a mess or we're gonna realize we're all a mess yes like it'll make us feel a little bit better like oh everybody's out of their fucking mind but what you want that yes you would yes come on endlessly curious about I know my mind is such a mess and there's so much chaos going on there I want to know what's going on in other people's I want to know how fucked up am i or am i normal mmm oh yeah is it so standard here's my fear I had many fears about this kind of thing but my fear would be as follows that um I cannot count the number of times where I have had reactions to things that people have said in the moment that turn out to be wrong deeply and badly wrong right and one of the things that I have learned as an adult is too deeply distrust those kinds of reactions and to wait and very often what will happen in my case sometimes the waiting takes so long I'm the kind of person who sometimes a month will pass and I will think back on a situation and I'll think oh my god I totally misunderstood that this person who I thought was a jackass is actually someone you know a lovely person who wanted to give a second chance to or whatever that comment that someone made that I thought was stupid is in fact extremely thoughtful and insightful this will happen in weeks months later whatever if you were able to read my mind in a moment you would judge me for my mistake and not give me an easy way to correct it and it was you would trap me in like what if this would have had a reaction to something you said in this conversation in which I said Jesus I can't believe that that's dumb and then I'm driving back to LA tonight and I think oh actually oh that's really interesting I thought about the time I don't want you to short-circuit my learning process about you I want I want to give me the privacy of my my six hours of thinking about what you said and allow me give me that kind of time to come to a reasoned and insightful conclusion about how I feel that's interesting but we're talking then about only one person having the technology because if you both have the technology and there wouldn't be any issue you wouldn't be confusion as to why someone was saying something you'd you've a much clearer path to understanding their thought process and their intent behind it really yeah I mean if one person has it right then yeah I get it yeah if I could read your mind oh I said something and Malcolm thinks I'm a retard like you know there's that but there's another there's another possibility that both people have it and this is also one of the things that would be fascinating about this is one of the things about forbidden words is forbidden words carry with them intent they have automatic intent right but you can say the exact same word and have different intent behind it if we could understand clearly what your intent is mm-hm then taboo words would automatically become meaningless mean it's not about sound you make it's not about forbidden sounds always what it's about is thoughts yeah and what you're trying to convey and what's happening to you as a human being who are you like what what what is your process for the way you communicate what is your process for the way you're trying to develop these thoughts in your mind and express them to people well well part of the problem with that is language right and part of the problem with making certain aspects of our language forbidden is you limit people's ability to colorfully communicate and express themselves in certain ways mm-hmm I think that alone just eliminating that alone eliminated and confusion and also highlighting you know you could highlight real problems with people's thoughts and the way people communicate but also eliminate many problems and say oh he doesn't mean that like you could see what he means like this is what this is where his mind is you could see you could literally see the thoughts yeah yeah I guess I would also I mean let me get let me throw out another complicating factor it still leaves the question of cultural context yes so of course one of the things I got really interested when I was writing my book was how are kind of cultural frames of reference profoundly complicate our attempts to understand other people and so in your scenario where I have some kind of window into your thinking and intention I still need to know in order to make sense of you I still need to have a very clear idea of the the cultural kind of rules of the road that you use mmm and they're likely to be different from mine sure particularly if you know I mean I'm in Canadian you're not but imagine if the difference between us was more profound if our eyes you know then you you're still like like I was there's a really cool thing I've been obsessed with um with memory I'm doing only seems I'm memory in my in revisions history this coming season and I was reading about this really fascinating experiment which is done with Korean and American college students adults essentially and what I do is I give you circles paper circles and one is past one is present when his future and I say those are three concepts represent those three concepts with these three circles so the American kid has passed here present in the middle future over on the right right three independent circles the Korean kid puts all piles all three circles on top of each other now what does that mean I don't know what that means I mean something interesting right it means that they don't they're not separating these three modes the way that we are they're certainly coming at experience with a very different set of assumptions so maybe so I think of the Civil War's a long time ago but if I'm Korean maybe the Civil War is as present in my kind of consciousness as something that happened last week is that maybe that's not what that means I'm not exactly sure I'm sort of guessing because I don't know that I haven't fully investigated but the point is there are I've just given you one random example there are way way incredibly different rules that different cultures use to organize experience so if I'm looking at you and reading your thoughts I have to know those rules because those rules are sorting out how people so this is only this is not not - I'm not dissing this notion of that you're talking about I'm saying that it needs to have another layer as well a cultural level a culture of l'air we just kind of alerts me to how you're organizing experience that certainly makes sense it's it's interesting when you think about like the Tower of Babel right like this this idea that one point in time everyone spoke the same language and God sort of set it up so that it was we're never going to be able to really communicate with each other because everybody has a bunch of different languages and we'll never figure it out that's the sort of mm-hmm crunched up version of it if there was a way to change the way like all languages are essentially little symbols that are written down on paper or typed out and then sounds you make with your mouth and they convey intent if there was a way to do another version of language a universal version of language that's eventually adopted but I'm reading this book about these people that were kidnapped by Native Americans and they were assimilated into the tribes that learned the language and this happened over a course of a couple of years and I was thinking like what would that be like if you you know that's how you learn a language you're kidnapped by oh you know I mean yeah like you got it but if there was a new language how long would it take for adults to learn a new language if someone came up with a new language of completely universal characters and this language is conveyed through this technology rather than through your mouth so it's your your your thoughts your thoughts interface with some sort of technology it creates whatever hieroglyphs some sort of visual language that we all agree upon and then this is universal this is universal throughout all cultures yeah and the only thing that we'd be confused about assumptions and rules as far as like what's okay well you do that can't we kind of do that already in a sense that we could have a universal language and then we have a device you know sitting on our phone or something yeah that when we I'm in you know I'm in some for I'm in Bulgaria mm-hmm and I'm ordering coffee I speak it into the device and it simply translates either translates me directly into Bulgarian that's actually not that hard no or it translates this into this common language that the Bulgarian translator services and if you think of the technology at a sudden more advanced level that is now it could be done in a very seamless way like he doesn't have to be some bulky box mm-hmm it could literally be that I am speaking in English and what you're hearing is there's a filter and what you're what you're hearing is this other language I mean well don't don't Google buds or whatever they are the air you know the air pod version of those Google things I think there's something some technology that actually enables you to instantaneously translate that yeah I'm doing for you yeah although you hate for Google to have one more thing over us right it's like not enough that they should control nine-tenths of our life yeah well we're also gonna let them control our communication I remember as a kid reading I used to love doonesbury did you yes and there's a hilarious thing in doonesbury where I forgot who hung chol Duke or somebody is going to China and his uncle Duke Hunter as Thompson yeah it was and he was appointed ambassador I think he was imported American ambassador to China and and that was a joke and he would go and he would meet with like they had a you know the president China and he would say the most incredibly incendiary outrageous things and the translator never chance anybody said would turn he would say this a radius offensive thing and the translator was saying you know the flowers are blooming today yeah Jamie had a thought once that hieroglyphs for 2019 are essentially emojis yeah well it's kind of what's your sort of was saying it yeah like the internet you have to translate English into bits mm-hmm and where for the computer to translate it into an emoji it's almost I feel like it's almost what you're saying although it's not exactly it's a being is a beginning stuff yeah it's one - yeah it just seems like this is not the best we can do noise noises with your mouth and then you know learning English is incredibly complicated for someone who speaks Mandarin advice averse yeah it's all very what if we we all said hey look this is some new version of a language like whenever there's uh whether it's contact or whenever there's some movie about extraterrestrials is always a team of scientists and linguists and geniuses to get together and they go look we're gonna establish a universal language they communicate with these people and Close Encounters of the Third Kind it was music dude dude dude and do that they would figure out some way we're gonna figure out a way to talk if we had some enormous financial incentive or some enormous crisis was in play and we had to all communicate with language and so remember when they were trying to push them while you from Canada the the metric system was actually real over there you know when I was in high school they were trying to push the metric system yeah and I remember there was like a concerted effort they're like we're gonna have to learn the metric system because a universal system that the whole world uses and they gave up the United States Divac why did why was this possible in Canada not possible in United States because we're assholes you guys are 20% less assholes at least 20% there I don't know how's that possible I've always thought the exact grew up in Boston which is also cold I always thought cold weather made assholes cuz it's like you just like fuck it's called fuck that fuck you fuck you cuz Boston is filled with people that want to get drunk and fight and then a lot of them are really mean which is a great place to grow up you develop a thick skin and particularly as a comedian it's a great place to start out and do comedy we're gonna learn how to do it right I don't think Boston is mean because of the cold I think yeah I think it's Canadian well the coldest parts of Canada like the you know I know lots of people lots of members of my family are from Winnipeg which is seriously cold nicest people nicest people yeah it doesn't make any sense that's why I said it does that my theory sucks yes I think it's the children of very rough immigrants and they stayed in these communities and there it goes yes exactly that's what I am yeah so the the immigrants of these people that were willing to take a risk and get on a boat when there wasn't even YouTube videos to watch yeah these are savage people that made it over here and they're really rough and they had rough childhoods and they raised rough children and the echoes of that persist on the east coast of the United States see the amount of drinking that went on in Irish immigrant communities is there's it's funny because I stumbled across years ago I was I've always been obsessed with drinking alcohol I think I've chapter that on it in this book but um so years ago turns out that the place in America where alcohol studies as they're called we're really birthed was New Haven which makes pretend attitude yeah makes perfect sense so in the 50s a bunch of people get really really interested in understanding how drinking works and it in New Haven of course you have the perfect model because you have two very large groups of immigrants you have Irish Italians right in all of New England you've got those two to work with and of course they could not be more different in the way they drink so even in immigrant Italian communities in the 50s these are people who are in terms of volume of alcohol consumed way up at the top they are drinking with every meal they're making you know wine and have been in your backyards they are but the levels of alcoholism are infinitesimal the amount of like social dysfunction associated with drinking camp I mean it's just not it's negligible these are the healthiest drinkers you can imagine side by side are the Irish and I don't need to tell you that story is very different why is it it's super interesting question you've got so they're not one groups not richer than the other they come to America not at the same time but there are 19th century early 20th century come to American large numbers there are some you know Irish culture looks a lot but it was Catholic right now there may be Catholic in different ways but there's a sir on the surface these are you'd think that they would use the bottle in the same way no the Irish are the the Irish the men are slinking off to the pub and in Italy everyone's gathered around steaming bowls of pasta and drinking like one and a half glasses of wine mild homemade wine with your dinner it's like night and day yeah it's unbelievable is it because one is a whiskey culture because whiskey's rough stuff I mean you really can't have much before you're off the rails yeah there there's some of that yeah the the attachment to wine in the Italian community probably saves them a good deal of their of alcohol-related heartbreak I don't know too much about the actual the is there a difference between the way different alcohol effects is that does the wine alcohol actually affect you by volume by by the actual percentage of alcohol does it affect you differently than beer or differently than whiskey or differently in tequila cuz that's what people always say oh if I drink tequila I get crazy like people always have these stories but is that true if you have you had a certain percentage of alcohol yes we equalize the the alcohol concentration is it all the same in you yes because for me wine makes me warm and friendly and it makes me sleepy and it mean it doesn't make me energetic whiskey makes me crazy like I think it's a crazy drug I think when people drink shots of Jack Daniels they just want to go whoa they want to get correct they want to do dumb shit it makes them want to do dumb things shots in particular makes people want to do dumb things makes people get crazy makes you Balad that makes people Irish right Ben are you saying well I mean quarter Irish get away with it for a little while only a quarter that's it yeah mostly Italian oh I see you're at the cusp of these two drinking today yes yes well I see but Rogan you're foolish you're fooling this was Rogan yes yes because if we would think that you were majority Irish with that yes yeah and I could be dark Irish if you looked at my view yeah I'm well I'm you know I'm a reserved English and Jamaican Jamaicans not big drinkers you know in the same kind of the difference actually fascinatingly of the many weird alcohol facts if you look at young people it's like looks like a college-age young people in America and look at their drinking habits the black students drink and get drunk markedly less than white kids real differences in drinking behavior by race in at that age Asian students don't drink much either drinking is like a cycle it's like a white thing it's like a crazy white thing increasingly you know or problematic drinking I've always thought that was fascinating his first name I don't know I don't know the I don't know why that's so is it it's revered in our culture more it's uh yeah I mean getting fucked up is celebrated in white culture well this you know in the alcohol chapter of my book the I talk about all the strange things that have happened with drinking patterns on campus and I was struck in doing that chapter I was interested in the connection between drinking and drunkenness and sexual assault on campus because all of those the overwhelming majority he talked to people who study sexual assault on campus they will tell you that you almost never see one of these cases where both parties aren't drunk right it's which doesn't explain them entirely but it's a huge factor in making sense of what happens and when you dig into that you see these like really weird patterns first up when I was in college I did not know and I went to college in Canada not a teetotaling population I did not know a single person who had ever been drugged blackout drunk and then now if you talk to a 20 year old college student in America they will name friends of theirs who get blackout drunk on a weekly basis what is the drinking age in Canada and what was it when you were in college when as ecology was 18 yeah I think that might be a big factor I've been talking to friends about this about Europe about how in Europe particularly in Italy and France you're a lot of drink wine at a very young age yeah and the taboo aspect of it forbidden fruit all that goes away it's a just it's a I don't think young kids should be drinking because I think it's terrible for your brain development but I think there's a thing in keeping them from drinking or making it illegal where it becomes so taboo and so intoxicating that they can't wait until they can legally do it or they try to get a hold of it before it's legal and it has a certain excitement to it that just doesn't it doesn't have in parts of Europe yeah you've given it up kind of so there's all kinds of the things that are new are way less beer and way more hard liquor so yeah hard liquor when I was in school in Canada in the eighties 95% of what we drank was beer not there wasn't any whiskey or even or tequila or vodka in our party such as beer beer kegs take parties yeah really hard to get blackout drunk on beer I mean blackout to get the blackout you've got to be here you gotta get to like I forgot what the exact number of 10 drinks or something well it's point you got to blow like 0.18 or something I forgotten with is a sort of magic number where people said for everybody because some people they just get gerbil eyes like there's some dudes they'll have a couple of drinks and they get shark eyes you know those those dark yeah like expressionless eyes like hey man he's still here yeah they're just wandering around like like a like a person with doll eyes there's somethin there with these shoes back that is just at what point does your hippocampus shut down and you cease to have the ability to make memories and that's just that's a very narrow clinical explanation of so there may be a whole different set of manifestations of drunkenness that have to do with it alcohol's effect on other parts of your brain right but blackout is just about your hippocampus and past a certain blood alcohol concentration your hippocampus just goes offline essentially you just pull the plug on it and then so nothing that's coming in is being stored Wow so you can continue to communicate I could be blackout drunk right now but does it vary with people does it the number well so it would it would vary depending I think on drinking history and yeah but I mean is a there is it's there's a kind of a there's a consensus figure where most people I wish I it's in my book I wish I could remember I think it's something like 0.16 or something like that if you think of the if the the love the level legal level for drinking forums for driving is 0.08 I think it's roughly 2x that level and most people at that level will be at risk we'll have at least the beginnings of memory impairment mm-hmm so that feeling when you get really drunk at a party and the next morning you can only remember little bits and pieces of what happened that that's because your your hippocampus was posed at your moment of peak intoxication your hippocampus was starting to shut down it just wasn't taking it it's really interesting too because some of our most interesting minds and some of the best communicators relied on alcohol heavily Mike and it made that like Hitchens made it made him a more interesting communicator when he was drunk well he would have a drink you know I mean right like he would be on Bill Maher you could tell he was lit and and and he was so eloquent and so articulate but that beautiful phrasing so remember though that's this is an interesting point and a crucial point about blackout which is your hippocampus doesn't necessarily control your your how articulate you are or how fluid your speeches it's just about memory so Hitchens could have been the most articulate person in the world and just and but the next morning he would not have remembered a single thing he said on Bill Maher I mean I'm assuming if he was blackout no but you don't know there's fascinating stories in the literature about when people were discovering blackout in the 50s and they would there would be these stories like they would some guy would come in he would wake up in Las Vegas and he would say what am i doing in Las Vegas like I think he would go and he would see his clothes hanging in the closet and he would say what what's going on and then he would like go down to the desk and say what and he said well you checked in last night and he would look in his wall and he would see he had a plane ticket from Cleveland and they would reconstruct and there's a in fact this very story was told in the you know one of the big sites medical journals in the 50s the guy reconstructs he's a Salesman living in like st. Louis who gets really really drunk and then his hippocampus shuts down and he continues to function so it goes gets in his car drives to the airport buys a plane ticket goes to Vegas does he doesn't know it is in Vegas does whatever he does in Vegas and then wakes up like two days later oh my god hippocampus is suddenly back online what am i doing in Vegas that is two days two days so what is like what is he you can you you like that was my put I would be blackout right now and still communicate you wouldn't know it I don't it's not like you can tell I can't tell whether you have a headache can I write no clue so you don't know what's going you mean until we come up with that machine that you were talking about you can't tell that my hippocampus isn't working except if you answer if you ask me the same question this is how you the only way you can do it you had a party you think someone's blackout asked them the same question over and over again and see if they respond like say why you asked me so literally I would say wait did you say your uh your 1/4 Irish and then I would just have to wait like say five seconds and I say Joe did you see her 1/4 Irish and in a certain way you're gonna say Malcolm why to stop it if you don't say that you're blackout drunk but if you do if you could you be blackout drunk and still have like a tiny memory no you may just ask me that okay so the hippocampus doesn't shut down all at once so what it does is it shuts down slowly so let's imagine we're both doing shots so after I mean I'm quite sure your capacity I'm I mean you're like I'm half your wait am i but I don't know what you are you're like 200 pounds I'm 126 ok so we're gonna deal with alcohol very differently but let's assume we're doing shots of tequila there's a point of where things start to get hazy so you might remember that I asked you that question you might not and then as we keep drinking in our blood alcohol levels get higher and higher at a certain point your hippocampus will completely like the off switch has been thrown so it goes from being sluggish and impaired to just being down like and what brings it back well your blood-alcohol level has to fall to the point where it can work again so you fall asleep and over the course of eight hours of sleep you know your alcohol is processed by your liver blood alcohol Falls hippocampus snaps back into action wow what a ridiculous drug to be our most socially acceptable drug yeah totally and then the Vegas thing where they give it to for free Christie in a place where you can gamble which is really sneaky yeah that's one of the weirder laws ever that if a person could literally lose their house while they're black out drunk crazy I mean in retrospect imagine you were were we let's do a little ranking thing here we have three vices and I'm I know exactly where you're gonna be going with this but we have three things we want to prioritize dope alcohol smoking right cigarettes cigarettes you can ban one Vashti rank them in order you could start from scratch I'm saying Joe we're starting over okay what you say goes rank you weak so right now the way we have dealt with these is smoking is is becoming the most taboo of those three cigarettes mm-hmm marijuana ii and alcohol is the one that we have the least inhibitions about right my argument would be that that list is exactly backwards that it should be alcohol should be the most taboo marijuana should be actually not exactly backwards it should be alcohol the most abou cigarettes the second most marijuana the third that's how I would do yeah I would agree with that yeah yeah so we're basically we have it completely upside down but I think for some people like look there's obviously obviously terrible things that happen to you when you smoke cigarettes hmm but every time is it Potsie I've smoked a cigarette or two before shows like I've smoked to see I mean I mean or two I've never smoked two in a row but I've smoked a cigarette before I've done shows like Dave Chappelle gave me one of his cigarettes recently Tony hinge clips give me a cigarette I'm not a cigarette smoker but there's something cool about the head rush that you get when you smoke a cigarette I hesitate to say that and this is a person who's done a lot of drugs I've done a lot I've smoked a lot of pot and I've done psychedelics and I'll talk about them openly I have hesitation about telling people that enjoyed a cigarette well because because it's because I think it's so bad for you it's it's it's I think when I talk about doing mushrooms I think mushrooms are good for you I think it makes you freak out I think it illuminates parts of your consciousness that I think a lot of people guard and protect and shield and I think sometimes doing something that breaks down those walls is good for you ultimately overall there's a little bit of an adjustment period but I think you learn something about the normal state of consciousness I don't think you learn much when you smoke cigarettes I just think there's just a little bit of a head rush that you get out of it but I know so many people that are sick from cigarettes so many people that can't quit them so many people that have died from cancer I mean I personally have known several people that have died from cancer from smoking cigarettes yeah so I hesitate in saying it but I don't want to be dishonest I've had them yeah I don't smoke cigarettes though I've never bought a pack I've that's a cigar of smoke cigars I like um sometimes I just think it's a terrible it's a terrible thing to get hooked on yeah yeah and as I would say the same thing with alcohol I know people that have had real problems with alcohol that have been alcoholics and they have to go to meetings and you know they're on 12-step programs and you know I would never offer them a drink mm-hmm but if you said hey let's do a shot right now let's celebrate we this is a wonderful conversation let's have a glass of whiskey I can have a glass of whiskey and not drink again it doesn't bother me okay I don't I don't have that whatever that is yeah but some people do yeah I hesitate hesitating glorifying that - yeah and for young people it scares the shit out of me if I see I probably drank for the first time when I was probably I was in high school I think is probably 14 or 15 the first time I ever got drunk with my friends you know we got ahold of some Jack Daniels or something and made me throw us the Irish drinking age yes well it was just friends you know listen in the classic rock and getting drunk in fosston but the it's it's something I occasionally enjoy I think I enjoy alcohol I like having a drink of wine with a glass of wine with a meal I like having a drink with friends occasionally but I don't have a problem with it and I know people who do and so I feel weird talking about it knowing those people that do have a problem with it yeah yeah with pot though the people that have a problem with pot it's rare and it's usually people that have some sort of and I do believe there there is an issue with people have some sort of an underlying schizophrenic issue that could come from especially high doses if they smoke a lot of pot in one night they can have a schizophrenic episode I've actually seen it particularly from edibles I've seen it but that's to me that's absolutely the least taboo and I think there's a lot of benefits to pot I think pot makes you more sociable I think it makes you friendlier mm-hmm I mean some people get paranoid from it but I think that's what that really is is marijuana illuminating how vulnerable you actually are yeah you know that we sort of protect ourselves from this overwhelming existential angst that you get when you get high on pot yeah and people say oh I don't like it it makes me paranoid well you know the reality is you're vulnerable we're all very very very vulnerable and we just somehow another make it to like how old are you 56 I'm 52 we made it we made this age somehow or another despite all the paranoia we don't have to I mean it's really you know life is crazy we're in these metal boxes with combustion engines you know like trusting the people next to us going 60 miles an hour or paying attention not looking at their phone you know it's like it's very left in them we get in planes and wells the fuck's going on with the engine this guy's flying it over the sky it's we're very vulnerable all the time just diseases and you know not to mention you know war and all sorts of other things that could float we're like yeah I mention everything earthquake fire yeah yeah fires yes no my my thing on this is simply the collateral damage yeah so leave the individual out of it and ask how much social damage is caused by any of those things Oh in alcohol and ass number one just by a fire by a bullet yeah yeah you know what's amazing to me is how the people who make alcohol have get a free ride it's incredible to me like if I said to you that I was on the board of Philip Morris you would say that's Malcolm that's pretty screwed up yeah and you would you would be you know a problem with it if I said that oh I'm you know I'm on the board of anheuser-busch you probably would hit me up for tickets to the Super Bowl mmm right is that the same whereas there's no in terms of the amount of social damage what al caught anheuser-busch has created has produced a hundred times the social damage than what Philip Morris has produced Yeah right like or you know so it's like it's a it's always puzzled about I don't know how he got it in our heads like to treat one like it's completely taboo and the other we kind of shrug you know the there are bunch I was reading about this recently how many colleges except not just accept alcohol advertising and sponsorship but you go to a college football game and you know Bud Light will have will be an active sponsor of the event we'll have some huge relationship with the school this is crazy we it's crazy right it's like this is the drug that is causing so many problems for young people particularly on campuses and the schools are hand in glove with the manufacturers of it because it's socially acceptable because they don't have to worry about repercussions because we gave it up we give it in a way that they would never have Marlboro Marlboro yeah oh my god people would pick it yeah where is it's not you know I don't know that's true it's a strange kind of we're so messy people are so messy and that is that's a very good example of how messy we are the UM I'm now I'm I hidden real efficient means I hadn't realized you were from Boston why are so many comics from Boston it's a hard place is that what it mean women drunk guys first of all am i right am i right in thinking there does seem to be like why is it every time I turn around and I've listened to some comic and they say well when I was growing up in Boston of course a lot it's a lot there's a lot and there are a specific kind of it's like the audience is there have a very short attention span they they're they're not gonna coddle you if you suck they will boo you off the stage it's terrible for your self-esteem when you're young yeah but it but it's it doesn't just build character it builds the correct approach towards an audience that you have to realize these people do not let these people got babysitters they they spent money they're here they could have been in the movie they could have done a lot of the recreational activities they've chosen to come to the comedy club stop fucking around get to work like like treat this like this is and the consequences of bombing are horrific right the feeling is - it's one of the worst feelings a person can have yeah so when was the last time you bombed it's been a while since I bomb bombed but I've had jokes that ate shit yeah well that's this is there's a process that i go through every two years i put out special and then i write a new one and during the process of writing a new one you don't write it in a vacuum you write it and then i bring that stuff to the comedy store and fortunately with the Comedy Store you're doing 15-minute sets with you know 15 other talented people and so you you don't have to be up there for a long time and you get it in the comp the the Comedy Store also the audience is very unique in that a lot of them understand that they're going to see these guys like Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock and work out comedy hoist they know it's they understand it and like you could joke around about it like that bit sucks I swear to god that's gonna be good in about four months tip puts that bits in the oven right now because there's concepts that you have there you go there's got to be a way to make this work but that way that I just did is not the way I will always trust the reaction you get in other words you don't tell a joke it bombs and you say actually I think it was their problem not mine ever that's never their problem there's not a chance in hell you can have a bad audience where a good joke doesn't go over because they're drunk and they're not paying attention to their heckling that's possible yeah but that's the anomaly the its if you have a bit and you think it's a great bin the audience doesn't laugh they're right mm-hmm you know maybe another audience would laugh maybe you're doing it in the wrong demographic or what-have-you but most likely that joke sucks yeah and most likely you have these ideas and you need to figure out how to rework them like Chris Rock told me that that he says that famous bit that I love black people I hate the n-word right that bit he said took him a year to work out a full year he said it was bombing he couldn't get it to work right he'll fuck up his act but he knew there was a way to do it and then it became one of the greatest bits of all time it became this incredible classic bit but that was from him grinding just chipping away at it reworking it bringing it onstage it eats shit you bring it back you go over it you ponder it you ask questions of other great writers like what do you think you know No maybe then and then you try it again and it keeps doing it he does does it a hundred times or 200 times and then eventually it becomes a bullet proof and then he gets it down to that form that you see it on his comedy special where it's just boom punchline BAM punchline boom punchline BAM and people like because it's so good but there's a process to doing that and sometimes you have this idea in your head and you're like I think there's something there I just got to figure out how to get into their head yeah and then I got to figure out how to make it in a way what's the most palatable way for people to digest this idea because comedy is essentially a mass hypnosis right you're getting the audience to allow you to think for them for a brief period of time and so if you're at your best the punchlines are sneaky they come where you don't expect them you take people on this ride they're assuming because they're letting you think for them that you're a thoughtful person you're not gonna make them feel bad for liking you and that's one of things that people really hate you say something mean or something thoughtless you portray yeah you betrayed their trust because they've trusted you to think for them yeah so you have to be considerate about people's sensibilities and feelings you know and when you're especially when you're breaching a sensitive issue like it you have to you have to dance you have to do you have to figure out a way to make this thing compatible into people's thought patterns it's funny I you know I don't I'm not a stand-up comedian but I gave a lot of speeches like in in conferences and corporate settings which is a very in some ways a very different animal in some ways quite a similar animal I've been doing it for 20 odd years now and the thing I'm always that blows me away is how different audiences are hmm like and I one thing that you after doing it for about 10 years you start to get a little bit smarter about reading the room at the beginning to know who they are and what and it's you know it makes a difference like there are some some audiences are generous and they'll if they see the in my case the punchline is not necessarily a joke but it's the the payoff to whatever story I'm telling some people when they see it coming if you think about it as a line mm-hmm they'll reward you the minute they see it they see it off in the horizon yeah oh it's coming and they encourage you yes some people will wait until the last possible moment and then some people will wait a beat after the punchline is over and then think about it and reward you those three audiences may that makes a world of difference in how you tell the story in your expectation going in in you know because if you if you think it's an early rewarding audience and it's a late rewarding audience you can get you'd be ten minutes in and you're totally bummed out because you think it's a disaster but in fact it's not like and then you get I develop all of these short hands about audiences I don't know if they're true or not but in my experience I remember once giving a talk to a group of engineers on a early on a Monday morning in Minneapolis in February so it's freezing it's 8 o'clock in the morning they're engineers and they're all white guys they're like regions right an incredibly thoughtful interesting audience listen to every word but they are not gonna reward you until they have thought about what you said and they'll wait like you know there's a five-second lag between whatever payoff you give and their response right if you go I've also given a talk to like a group of teachers in New Orleans so there you have a room that is largely female that will be much more diverse so maybe 50% black for example 20 percent Hispanic 30% white just way more they're gonna reward you the minute they see it coming their teachers first of all so their whole thing is about listening rewarding you know seeing the best in something and celebrating it yeah I mean completely different and if you go into the engineers in Minneapolis and the teachers in New Orleans with the same expectation you're gonna it's going to be a disaster yeah right yeah teachers just want to find a way to love you right and and also they're women women I think my experience are far more generous than men as audience I don't know overall yeah probably yeah but uh so that like I'm I took a long time to figure that out because you for the longest time I would walk away from someone I would think from some talks and would think I just did committed the worst possible offenses you're doing a different thing though it's your dance is very different right you're first of all you're giving these speeches and you're doing it in these corporate environments you're doing it in conference rooms I would imagine and a different kind of halls and yeah bright lights yeah I'm doing it at comedy clubs theaters and arenas so comedy clubs they know what they're getting into they're in and it's set up like if you go to the Comedy Store or The Improv right it's a low ceiling it's a great hot mic is great sound system there's opening acts that warm everybody up before I get there the stage is set and it's a an environment that it's been established for decades this is a place to go to hear people tell jokes yeah you're doing it you'd say you don't have an opening acts you're doing it they don't even know if you're gonna be funny they don't know what you're gonna do you're gonna talk yeah you're gonna talk about that I've been sitting in the same air-conditioned arena for six hours one small break I mean it's there and listening to really doing work yes you know so it's a yeah it is it very very different yeah it's a super interesting I find it route it incredibly rewarding and I also find it it's sort of it reaffirms my my my kind of faith in humanity for some reason interesting I really I'm very very happy that I started doing it so doing it years and years ago but just to communicate with large groups of people that reaffirms her faith in what way because I'm always struck by how open I I think a lot of the rhetoric in our society now about how divided we are and blood I just think it's I think we're divided on line I think we talked to people person to person yeah we find a way to find common ground yeah and you go to these meetings and you know that half of the room voted one way another half voted the other way and that it doesn't come up it doesn't block half of you from appreciating have them appreciating what you're saying they're totally open to to as long as you are respectful and take the time to explain what you think and why and what and how it matters to them then people will listen and engage and ask really good questions and I don't see so funny that Washington is divided and online is divided I don't I just don't see it else mm maybe I'm not getting an accurate picture of the whole country but in in these you know give a talk a group of whatever educators in New Orleans you don't see this I think when it comes to political discussions that's when people get really divided because I think they feel like they're supposed to be divided it was really interesting video that I watched yesterday where Donald Trump jr. was getting heckled by these alt-right characters for not being right-wing enough I was like holy shit like this this but I took it a lot of pleasure and watching that play out not because I want Donald Jr to heckled but because I this is what I've always said there's people that are just extreme and it doesn't matter if they're in an tyfa or if they're in the proud boys if they're far left or far right it's the same thing they're just finding an ideology and they're taking it to the extremist level and they're angry that people weren't woke enough or they're finding an ideology and they take it to the furthest level and they're angry people that are not separatists that aren't white supremacist they're angry people that like Mexicans at all than any Mexicans I mean there's there's people that are that racist that are mad at subtle racism they're mad at people that there's just people that are extreme and you can't make everyone happy it is impossible and some people don't want to be happy they want to find ways in which you're not woke enough they're their concern is not the overwhelming good of the world harmony peace love compatibility communication and community that's not where their concern is their concern is finding ways you're wrong so finding ways that they're right and ways that you're that you're wrong so they'll they'll find some reason why you're not woke enough and so it my response to that was a was slightly different although I think a lot of what you're saying is accurate the reason they got upset with him was that he wouldn't do a QA yes okay yes okay now as someone who's on his book tour and has done been doing this for 20 years let me just say you have to do the Q&A yeah the Q&A is symbolically crucial it's like everyone says okay I would seize you get up there and you do your prepared bit and it was like okay fine I know you can do your prepared bit but you're asking me to spend $28 on a book and on what I want to know is are you someone who is meaningfully engaged in the ideas that you're talking about in your book right so Q&A is where you prove that to me yes prove that you're thoughtful prove you care about the stuff prove that you wrote this and someone else didn't prove all those things he wouldn't do it I'm sorry find it weird because he just did the view which is like the worst way to have a Q&A I had fun of you but I'm saying and that's a choice there's everyone's talking everybody over everybody yeah you you really don't get a chance to express full thoughts yes yeah if he if he could do the view he can certainly do QA at you it was at UCLA was it was it really was it but what was interesting too is that what he was using as an excuse was that the the left-wing media is going to take his quotes and take him out of context dude I've no sympathy for him well in that case no didn't make any sense doesn't make any sense like any sense just say something intelligent an eyeful and you'll be taken seriously that's the way the rule works well there's a whole video I mean if someone takes it out of context you could always like show the entire video hey that's out of context why is he playing the helpless credit stopper this Tainted well I mean is someone who's in you know like I said look I got no sympathy for that either listen I have no sympathy for him either in that in this case I do not I think it's it's not I found it very amusing his wife or a girlfriend forgotten what she is which of those things she is she she then this is the crowd about how the only the only way they could get dates is online because nobody would do you see that it's like rule number two after rule number one is do the QA rule number two is don't dis the audience by by telling them they're all losers like it's just not what do you well there's people you know that's a thing where people want to just get get you you got them so they want to get you people are booing fuck you you lose no no no you're a loser you know it's just noises instead of gum love love yeah you have a good one guys take care but instead you're right do the Q&A yeah don't don't don't even you know it's not that hard to answer questions I think there's a real problem with answering questions in front of a crowd though where people screaming out things I think real thoughtful conversation should be had one-on-one and it's it what if like we you and I are having this conversation it's great but if there was a third person there talking to we would have to work that guy in or that girl in we'd have to figure out when she's talking when we're talking and if you got another person okay now you've got a real problem now you have four people and yeah it's it's very difficult if you watch those panel shows some for some reason the network news shows post election pre-election their election cover they still haven't figured that out they'll get seven people on they think it's like more than merrier I mean like the like the pregame shows on NFL yeah like they got so many guys each one of them says one set yes and they're talking over each other and everybody's trying to get a sound bite off everyone has this prepared thing this is zinger I'm gonna get that Trump guy with this one and they're ready for it and they're trying to interject it and someone's talking over them and excuse me I'm talking and then it degrades wait I want to use the opportunity of being on the show to issue a challenge to don't a jump junior Oh like just call me up dawn and I will accompany you on your book tour an interview on you on stage respectfully will do let's let's do a Q&A you and me we'll ask you questions I'll do it do you want to do that yes that's something you want to do why do you want to do that I think I'll be fun what do you think would be fun about it well I think it would be without saying anything that's gonna net him to not do it okay so let's be clear about a couple things okay this not it would not be a stunt I'm not doing it to do gotcha I would like to read his book thoughtfully and engage with him in the ideas in it and do we see for myself exactly thing I was talking about before is is he does he want to meaningfully engage with those ideas with someone who doesn't necessarily share them right right and that would be for its I would ask for an hour mm-hm and we can do it in lieu of audience Q&A if he likes I will just have a conversation with Wednesday so just a conversation in front of an audience Oh mmm that would be interesting I mean you see that would you pay to see that yeah I would do his book title is the same as my 2016 Netflix title it's triggered I got there first oh don't be cheers that's question number one I'll say done I noticed it time of your book is the same as why are you biting Joe Rogan stuff what's going on over there he probably didn't know it existed bill almost released his HBO specials triggered - really yeah I was gonna call it trigger - but at least he sent me an email apologizing you know I'm gonna get it you want to get there early well it's you know it's not my term I wouldn't really care if bill used it or if Donald Trump jr. used it he did obviously is he doesn't hurt dawn he's done he'll come dawn uh that's a good question isn't he Donald Trump jr. on line but they think they distinguish the dad is Donald oh so they call him I don't know that's one of things that could happen presumably in our face off maybe we should do why am i limiting it to an hour oh yeah let's go Rogen rule let's go like two hours yes me and Don G right in the second hour we really get into it yeah because that's what happens you could keep it together people can keep it together for 45 minutes you can't keep it together for three hours in three hours you know who a person is you know I couldn't give a talk in Colombia and the Colombians are take themselves in the best way very seriously right they consider themselves the most cultured people do that America yeah and there and there they think they speak the most beautiful Spanish and I'm told they they may as well they may well do and so I was talking with the was gonna go this little kind of lecture tour of major Colombian cities and I was talking to the organizer and I extend a question you asked is well how long I should talk for some period of time and then we'll do Q&A how long do you think I should talk and the guy goes I don't know house three hours he was dead serious and you realize like this is the same soap when Fidel Castro would give those six hour speeches you realize it's not just I mean Castro a little bit crazy but there's also the art puck there are cultures that have an expectation but if you're gonna go and hear somebody speak it's not going to be over in 40 minutes right you have to commit to the to the experience and they literally wanted me to start at nine and end it noon weren't the early campaign speeches for people running for president and the early days this country weren't they like that as well I believe there were long affairs yeah and then you get the Gettysburg Address which is what is it six minutes or something hmm oh no no or is it the inaugural I forgotten one of Lincoln's most famous speeches very brief is incredibly brief and you realize in now context where people are used to hours and hours and hours what an extraordinary I mean it is think about Lincoln as a kind of badass entertainer not entertainer performer mmm-hmm so he walks into a world where everyone's thinking they're gonna be there for two hours he sits up there and he's done in five minutes mmm he was what up just a Power Move that is its elastic like it is a good move imagine him so he comes in to his like aides and says this holds it up and it's you know you've seen in the in the Lincoln monument on the mall it's two paragraphs ya know Ford what is it I'm not Canadian four score years ago yes blah blah blah blah two paragraphs on they must have been like what these people traveled by horse and cart for hours near you speak yeah right yeah that's it such a great move it is a good move right we're still talking about it today yeah it's unbelievably beautiful I every time I go to the Lincoln monument and read that I am moved to tears it is insanely gorgeous prose as a writer you must appreciate like economy of words using the right words in the right place and having the the right impact and you know my friend Ari he has a piece of paper that he has glued to the top of his laptop from Hemingway to quotes as the first draft of everything is shit it's true and there's something about someone nailing writing someone just writing something that you go god damn you just fucking nail that yeah yeah there you have to mean the trick is always even though it's false you have to you have to hold in your heart the conviction that there is a way to say this perfectly and beautifully yeah right you you so even when you're in draft 1 or 2 or 5 and it's not there yet you have to believe it's possible and the minute you lose that that it's possible it's over when you when you write do you write on paper first and then start typing like how do you how do you type oh and then print it out because there's there's certain things structural things you can only see I think when it's on the page and you've kind of put all the pages in front printed out though you don't write longhand at all dude I'll print it out and then we'll I would know then it will annotate that draft with a pen mm so I will do longhand absolutely there's a there there's a I I'm very I think that our thinking is actually quite sensitive to the the mode that we're using yes so you think differently when you're typing on a keyboard than when you have a pen in your hand and I think it's neither not one is better than the other they're both good they're just different and yes makes sense to use both yeah I agree it's particularly for me my notes before I go onstage I always write out longhand I mean right out I write my comedy though all my thoughts essays I write them all out on a keyboard I'd write typing and then when I'm about to go onstage like the hour or so before a show I'll write out index cards and sometimes I'll write out entire bits if it's a bit I'm working on and it's kind of new I'll write it all out and it helps tremendously with my memory yeah but something about writing things out but writing to me on paper is so slow it's so slow for me to actually write the words for me to get the thoughts out I want to get the thoughts out with a keyboard because I can just type I can do it quickly I can get it done what I don't do what a lot of people do do is voice to text I don't do that never done that no but we I have a question that occur to me when you saying you were talking about that schedule that you're on that you do us every two years yeah so are you starting when you when you have to sit down and write new material are you starting cold or do you have in in the previous year were you kind of building up little bits and pieces that you're now putting together yeah I always have little stuff that I lay aside like I have I have pages and pages of shit that never went anywhere and so I'll go back over that and go man this maybe doesn't take that out there and then I'll introduce all so usually there's a window of time like say if I'm I film it in July it might not air until are or into October rather so in that window I have those four months to try to create material so what I'll be able to do in that window say I have a bit that I know works because it's something special I'll do that bit because the people haven't seen it yet and then after that bit I will sandwich in and some new stuff and I'll try to make that new stuff come alive and then I'll add a bit after that that I know is good then I'll sandwich and some new soap you can make like a like a club sandwich of shitty jokes it's sandwiched in between like legit bits and then one of them will catch fire no Mike all right this one's alive now good and you go back can you see a trajectory in your comedy like when you go back and look at something you wish you were a joke that you may have done I don't know eight years ago do you how do you react to it does it I don't work I don't but if I did I probably somewhat I would I would definitely see flaws oh my god that's too wordy or that's that's clunky or that's fit for store I don't like how I acted that out or I don't like maybe that wasn't done yet you know there's a there's a cooking period and everybody has a different take on it I've been my friend Anthony Jeselnik has a three year cycle and he might be right he he takes the first year he just does clubs in LA and develops material the second year he goes on the road and he goes to comedy clubs in the row the third year he takes at the theaters and then he's ready to film at the end of the third year yeah and you know his last special was excellent but he's just a very good comic very good writer but his process might be right there's some guys that were doing it on a one year cycle they were doing a new special every year and I don't think that's right that's gotta be yeah it's too hard it's not just too hard the material suffers it's half-cooked a lot of is gooey on the inside it's just not ready it's not done me some of the bits are really good then some of its aren't and you have to fill the whole hour and the problem is also when you're doing a special every year you have your own audience so those people love you so they're laughing at stuff that's not even that good like you have to you have to be doing that in front of a bunch of people that didn't expect to see you yeah yeah yeah that's that's hard to do so a lot a lot of weird tricks you could play on yourself as a comic you know you could think you're better than you are or that the bits are better than they are or that you you don't have to worry about things anymore you don't have to grind you don't have to throw yourself into the gladiator pit that is the Comedy Store on a Tuesday night but you do you do there's no other way if you want to be top notch you have to do the things that top-notch people do there's a sinister mean there's no there's no books written on this there's no university course but all the best people will tell you there's a process this is the process yeah it's one of the weird art forms and that no one teaches it there's literally anybody who does teach it is terrible there's no one who can it is I've never seen like a we're a real world-class headliner sells out theaters who teaches a course on comedy never seen it mm-hmm you know and I couldn't teach you how to do it anyway because your way of doing it would be very different than Jamie's way of doing it which be very different than Steven right which is very different than Sam Kinison it's like everybody's got their own weird little thing that makes them funny it's a matter of what is you the process mmm how do you how do you get it out who is your candidate for I always love in any particular field there's the insiders choice and then there's the popular choice like the most hilarious one is if you ask an architect who their favorite architect is 99 times out of a hundred you will never have heard that art it's always some obscure German guy from like hmm the thirty you know or it's some like you know experimental Dutch guy who did he's done one building and it's like amazing if you know it's like some you did a church outside of Antwerp and it was it blew everyone's mind why was that so who's that who's who's your insiders I would say the insider a pick is Dave Attell because Dave Attell is probably one of the greatest comics of all time and doesn't get enough love because he has no social media presence he wears the same hat and the same shirt and the same jacket in the same pants every day he does no thought whatsoever about his look all he does is just write new and better jokes constantly he's one of the most prolific comics but he still he'll still have a hard time selling places out and it doesn't make any sense although lately he and Jeff Ross have done this thing called bumping mics where they go on stage and they sort of work together and they talk shit and like Jeff will say something funny and then Dave will say something funny and Dave will do his bits and Jeff will make fun of them and they'll go it's really entertaining and they do a series of shows doing that and that has elevated his profile and that I'm very very thing how long was he serve in the wilderness he's been out there forever he's that was show on Comedy Central way back in the day called who was a hominid act yet insomnia thank you yeah and it was like he would go out after shows and they would you know go do weird things in these towns and he would get blackout drunk and he was an alcoholic at the time and he was getting hammered drunk and then he quit he got sober and rare in comedy that someone gets sober and becomes much better but that's what happened with Dave he's a much better comic now than even was then and what so and what's your when you see someone like that perform and you're you know someone who's extraordinary talented and good what is your emotional reaction to it do you run home and re-examine all the stuff you're doing I mean what's it was certainly inspiring yeah when someone's really good I always want to write that that is the feeling I always a Cocker go to work work but also I've cherished and held on to like a like a sacred ember that I'm trying to keep keep alive my fan oh my my my my love of being a fan of stand-up comedy like I like watching it I'm a fan I love it a guy I like going to see it like to this day like I'm working with my friend Joey Diaz tonight who I think is the funniest guy alive I'm happy I'm gonna go see comedy I'm gonna see him like that I'd still like watching I still enjoy it I didn't for a while in the early days it was too I was too ambitious and I was judging myself versus them and if someone had a really great joke I wish I thought of it instead of enjoying it I'll go God why didn't I think of that and that's a it's poison and then I realized luckily well I got very lucky that I figured this out early on like you know couple two or three years and I was like I used to love comedy like why am I not loving comedy because I'm doing calm that's the dumbest fucking thing in the world the reason why I got into stand-up comedy is because I loved watching it now all of a sudden I don't like it because I'm jealous or you know I or it makes me compare myself to them and I don't like the feeling or it makes me you know what is that that's so dumb and then I realized it thankfully and I had a shift and I caught myself yeah and I have managed to cherish and and nurture that being a fan that feeling of being an actual fan the enjoyment of stand-up comedy I nature that so that that to me is critical so when a guy like David tells on stage I can enjoy it I enjoy it I just can I can sit there like an audience member and just laugh but are you and the next question is when you sit in an audience of cefotetan you're singing ads with watching Dave Attell okay are you experiencing him differently than the audience is because you were professional like him I'm sure somewhat but I try to shut down the analysis part of my brain as much as possible I try to shut down like why did he run out like that why doesn't he do it this way I try to just be a fan I try to just watch em you know but I'm sure I know some things are coming or I know the way I would do it or I know Dave very well so I know how he would do it I'm sure there's some sort of a difference between but that's like the same as immediate musician right if you're a musician if you're a guitarist and you're watching an amazing guitarist even though they're really good you probably like hmm okay I see what he's doing he's doing this thing like you understand technically I can't turn I was my worry as I get older is that increasingly my reactions are simply versions of I would have done it that's not how I would have done it right right as opposed to so if say punk comes to me for advice my first did I think about oh that's here's the advice I'd like to give on this piece of writing my first someone actually was talking a friend of mine yesterday brought to me an essay she's working on credibly interesting essay about the role of women in cinema and I give out so we're walking around and I'm telling her my response to it and after I give it that my first thought was wait did I just say if I was doing it I was I would have done it this way in other words did I you know did I just simply impose my own standards and preferences on her which is not advice that's actually the that's the worst thing what you have to do is inhabit her mind and fix it according to her own intentions and yes I'll and I I my I'm constantly paranoid about the notion that I am NOT being truly empathetic at the moment of giving advice I'm just projecting my own and I think that's that's something that happens when you get so when you become so sure of your own methods and professional personality you know that's the kind of I wouldn't have done that when I was 25 because I didn't know what it meant to be to write a Malcolm Gladwell thing where I was just kind of reacting as a human being but now I kind of have this thing burned into my skull yeah you have a method I have a method I mean I try to mix it up but he probably still overhead and everybody's method is dead particular with writing right everybody's method it's very different yeah everybody's voice is very different there's some key things with comedy one of them is as I said before the economy of words it's very important in comedy if you see the punchline coming too far out it loses impact with the more words you use but if you can get the punchline to the people before they see the punchline coming in as a gigantic impact that's what my friend Joey Diaz does better than anybody mm-hmm he he does he does it better than anybody he sneaks things in on you yeah yeah this room I speak along these very lines I've often thought this was the one of the greatest jokes I'd like to see you probably know this joke a lot in terms of economy this is the most economical great joke I've ever heard my life and it's from oh my god his name this is appalling I forgotten his name but I know I was Dillard Park he was he was in a Lake Bell movie Lake Bell yeah he's an incredibly he had his own show on it'll come to me the joke was you know those signs in bathrooms in restaurants you know all staff should wash their hands after using the bathroom right especially Earl it's two words that transform is a tricky to race no no it's especially Earl especially so it's like I cannot go into about them anymore without thinking of that joke it's so fantastic it's like you know you did like it takes this you know I don't need to explain the joke too it's just a mate two words have created this lasting image of Earl its averted the whole bathroom thing it's it's I can't go to the bathroom in your head it's burned into my head oh is it Jamie its I cannot believe that's so humiliating I can't remember his name it was in New York kind of indie comic okay but I just like that bro girl I know but we're getting close even close you know it'll come to me but he um but that's like I'm sure I am amazed by the two words part mm-hmm like it's just that you can do it with two words just strikes me is the same reason why I'm obsessed I've always had an incredible love of television commercials for silly yes because the good ones the idea that you can communicate something emotionally powerful or funny or meaningful in 30 seconds is so badass like 30 seconds is nothing right and there are people whose job it is to communicate and some of the like not the run-of-the-mill like 80% of them are relatively straightforward they don't but there are there's a handful that are just magnificent there was one uh I mean there's a million examples of great ones but there was one really beautiful one which was a Heineken ad I've got no I've forgotten again the song they used we're a bunch of kids jump in the back of a cab and they start singing a bell dev DeVoe song and the cab driver they're all young cool hipsters they're all crammed in the back and they're all like a little bit tipsy and the cab drivers it's like crusty old school guy and it comes to the chorus and he chimes in and it's just this moment it's 30 seconds and it's fantastic cuz you don't you're not expecting that you're thinking right you see that crusty old it's like a Boston cab driver right like some grizzled Irish guy who's like 70 years old and this we get you think oh you must hate these kids because they're young and beautiful and they're tipsy that's a Friday night and he's driving a cab and then the song comes on the radio and they all start singing along and they're kind of drunken way and then he just joins in and is right it's right there with it's fantastic and it's 30 seconds like somebody a really great and funny like that remember the Wendy's lady where's the beef oh yeah you'll never forget that one three words where is the beef and an image old lady screaming open it up a cheeseburger looking for the beef yes yes I mean how could you not how can you not take off your hat the person who came up with that yeah right if I gave you if you're if you're sat was thirty seconds it's all right yeah right and you have to make a point you're trying to sell something yeah Jerry Seinfeld was going to open up an advertising agency for a while he he had thoughts about I know he had done a couple of commercials and apparently he had written some of the commercials and he had decided that he was gonna write commercials yeah he was gonna do that I think he's got so much Seinfeld money he's like fuck that why am i working my doing I've got a billion dollars in the bag I just go buy a couple more Porsche I mean his his he doesn't just have a billion dollars in the bank his more coming in coming in yeah it's like constantly coming in yeah there's no it's like a yeah it just seems to agree to does he did he get did this Larry David had the same deal that he does I do not know yeah I would love to know that I would like to know that too I don't think he does I know I would imagine he doesn't but I think he's probably extremely wealthy but he has in my opinion the most underrated sitcom of all time and Curb Your Enthusiasm there's times that I've watched that show where I've been literally weeping laughing like holding my side laughing yeah and it's so odd the way he does it you know do you know how he writes things yeah they have like a place where they like okay you're trying to sell me a toaster and Jamie's trying to stop me from buying that toaster but you're you're mad at Jamie and you're trying to be persuasive at me at the same time that's how they write so it's they just do multiple takes with really talented people and they find magic yeah it's correct meaning it's crazy how open-ended it I've talked to different guys that have been on the show yeah you know about how they do it it's it's amazing yeah that you have to love the the amount of trust you have to have in your fellow actors yes yeah but it's kind of that's lovely yes particularly contrasted with this incredibly tightly controlled email writing process right that's in place in so many of those shows yes yes yes but it's also why that show seems so organic yeah you know I mean there's talking over it sounds real it's like you know I had trouble watching it because it was too real to me I was just cringing with all of the social awkwardness just constructing one socially awkward situation of yours right and I couldn't because I couldn't distinguish it from real life yes I just I just very much it was good about it did you ever see the one where he has he's over the rapper's house krazee-eyez-killa you see though the rapper has Scarface plated 24/7 I mean it's Larry David with this rapper it is fucking Magic Man it's magic it's so good yes yeah oh he's a legitimate genius there's no doubt about that and you know he's also like a real legit oddball like he drives a Prius you know like he is that schlubby guy is probably worth 500 million dollars or something crazy but you know he's that kind of schlubby guy that's the way he me that's who he is yeah those guys were in am i right they were in New York like barely scraping by forever yeah yeah well he was a stand-up and he and Jerry knew each other from back then and you know he was a weird stand-up like it just was an acquired taste it wasn't it wasn't you know it wasn't yeah burning down comedy clubs who which comics are not to your taste I'm not saying that you don't like I mean that are not to your taste that is whose humor just doesn't kind of know you mean nothing I could think of offhand I don't I wouldn't pay attention one things I've gotten really good at as I've gotten older is not paying any attention to things I don't like yeah just just letting it just slide right out of my brain and onto the floor I'm not interested it's just I I spent so much time when I was younger and stupid or worrying about things I don't like being upset if things I don't like well that sucks why do people like that what the fuck's wrong with them and then realize like what a gigantic waste of resources that is just a huge waste of energy yeah that uh I don't care anymore you know as long as they're not stealing material as long as they're not you know doing something terrible to other comics victimizing as long as they're not doing that I really don't care it's like they're doing well good luck is in yeah I tried you mean it's not I'm just not I mean it's not a hundred percent it's it's constantly a work of process but my philosophy is rooted in some sort of a pragmatic understanding of how my own brain works yeah like you don't you only have so much time and you only have so much energy and if you're wasting your time on things that you don't like that have nothing to do with you if people like something like that's how I feel about music and and movies and so many things there's so many things that are I just like them at all but some people do I mean you know some people will that I think their music is dogshit but they'll have full Staples Center if people are rocking out well I must be wrong it's not me it's not them it's just like everyone's different people have different tastes some people like really cheesy rom-coms and they like it they really enjoy it they seek comfort in this movie where you know it's gonna work out in the end it's going to it's not like in the end the fucking meteors gonna land on the building and kill everybody and the the screen is gonna splatter with blood because you know their bodies explode you're not gonna see that in this movie in this movie everything's gonna work out great it's this is like by that I've that feeling about law and order in fact what am i I have no idea why anyone ever watch that show and one of my secret goals in life is at some point I would like to be appointed executive producer of Law & Order and I want to do ones that completely subvert yes so we get you through you're all everyone knows exactly how every one of those shows is always gonna turn out right and I want to get to minute 47 and then just go on some savage you turn that just appalls at outrageous absolutely and then I'll be done I'm quitting and I'm like yeah fuck and don't tell anybody that Malcolm Gladwell's taken over no yeah it'd be totally honest I would push just gently push Dick Wolf aside and say let me have this one and we're gonna like completely and we'll have it you know the the villain that will actually be one of the prosecutors that's what we'll do or something right along those lines in every episode ends like No Country for Old Men style or this it's over you're like what the fuck but there's something there's a drug in those where they're comforting and that people know that the bad guys gonna get caught and the good guy I don't know this is a random thought but I don't know any men who watch them and I've come to the belief that they are there's something there actually for women and there are a very comforting kind of reassuring fantasy about how the world works that that you know there the system is so I had cutting a mite this is an incredibly complicated theory that I did points about these kinds of things oh so there's we all know what a Western is yes a Western is where is conceptually a world in which there is no law and order and a man shows up and imposes personally law and order on the territory the community right so there is also a eastern what is in Eastern and Eastern is a place where by contrast is a story where they're like I got this straight it was four types the Eastern is where there is law and order there is so there are institutions of Justice but they are have been subverted by people from within so an Eastern would be the Serpico is an Eastern it's a crooked cop who is it's the bad apple who has you know screwed up there there's lots of tons and tons of of Hollywood movies are Easterns the northern is the case where law and order exists and law notre is morally righteous system works law know that show law and order is a northern it's a functioning apparatus of Justice which reliably and accurately produces the right the correct result in confronting criminality every single day when it's on TV the southern is where the the entirely the southern is all John Grisham novels or Southern's they are where the entire apparatus is corrupt and where the reformer is not an insider but an outsider so in in every John Grisham novel the same they all precede I love John Grisham to speak Lear but they all perceive from the same premise which is the system is rotten to the core and only this white knight who comes in from the outside can save us so in the Western there is no system in the northern there's a system it's fantastic in in the eastern the system is reformed from within but in the southern the system has to be reformed from without huh that's my complicated so I feel like anything you can place all art about law and order about the criminal world criminal justice into one of these four categories and the so the Brits love the northern so what is you know all of the the famous British detective stories or always Robocop's Sherlock Holmes yeah is it northern it's like the system is like and the you know that there's no corruption on the police department they may be bumbling and Charles gotta help them out but no-one's you know off on some there's no there's never a case where there's a rotten cop who's selling out every is there a modern version of the Western because westerns all seem to take place between the time of like fifteen sixteen hundred and eighteen there is so leach how do you read the Jack Reacher novels milu child no but I watched one of the movies those are letters does the westerns there's you'll never the whole thing about a Westers can you find the police can you find the police officer you know I you to find a police officer in a leach odd novel they're not nowhere to be found Reacher is a retired the hero is a retired Army investigator he's not even in the army anymore and he's just roaming around the country solving crimes on his own and he'll confront some massive criminal conspiracy and he never calls the cops right that's the whole premise that's so Western you can't call the cops in the classic Western because there's no cost as we found right now you're in Montana on the border but reach her it's a it's a 21st century Western so he doesn't call a cops cuz he doesn't feel like it it's just like they never up here like and he just murders everyone on his own and then he gets on the train and goes to the next place they're amazing I love them so much do you write fiction no never I mean I I read so many thrillers I read like I mean I'm probably read how many I read here 50 60 70 really I read it you know when you go in the airport that's a lot into the Hudson news and you see all those there's a whole like wall of those trailers I have read every single winner that means you're reading more than one a week yeah easy Wow and then I write on top of that I read by serious stuff but I devour people send me publishers send me these things in the mail just because I don't have to buy them anyway they just they know that I'm obsessed like Lee childs although he didn't with his most recent Lee childs publisher for yours you'd send me galleys I mean I didn't say anyone not recently happen I think they'd forgotten me fucked up what are you consuming all of it reading ORD is it any of it book on tape no I'm reading you know yeah I mean I'm reading the mean breakneck speed and I'm but I do there's a guy I'd love I love one of my favorites is Steven hunter who writes - you know they made some movies of his stuff Bob Lee swagger these sniper movies they're fantastically well written and those the minute he comes out with a new one I I read it the instant I mean I have to it's just like there's just such delights I've never heard oh he's so good really yeah so good mmm anything with the word sniper in it is generally one of his books oh and the shooter with Mark Wahlberg was one yeah and see that was a good but they're the books are fantastic mmm I would recommend him wholeheartedly um how do you have the time to read all these books well that's my job not reading thrillers but but my job is reading books literature yeah you know I read very quickly I suppose but I I don't watch a lot of TV I just watched a little bit of sports I don't really watch much so it's not a lot competing for my attention but um you know I know the book that I will read tonight it dinner so when you set out to write a book do you have a premise stewing in your head where it's just like throbbing where like that's it that's the one or do you halfway in I get it I'll start oh so you start a book with a little kernel there'll be a story I'm interested in I'll write it up and then I'll see where can I go from there mmm like they'll be every one of my books began as a very very simple one chapter but I didn't I didn't know what was surrounded the chapter but there was something in the book in talking to strangers I got interested in these spy stories he's that story of a telephone Amon tez the Cuban spy who rises to the top of the American intelligence establishment I began with that and I went and talked to the guy who caught her and he had such a fantastic interview with him and that just got me incredibly excited and that got me this whole thing about here's a woman spying in plain sight for Castro at the top of the American intelligence establishment for 10 years no one catches her even though she's not some master spy she has the codes that she's using in her purse and the radio she's using in a shoe box in her closet like we're not talking about James Bond right I think she does it and no one even comes close to her they all like really really smart people and that was such a fascinating notion that even in the most sophisticated and by definition paranoid agency in the American government they're spies that get away with all the stuff like do you think anybody ever gets away with it to retirement and then there's never thought oh absolutely in fact really so I go and I interview the guy who caught this woman Ana Montes and I'm leaving to go back to try back he's in a small town in Wisconsin and I you know as one does I turned off my tape recorder and put it in my bag and I'm walking back to my car he says I'll walk you to your car it's like okay and we're walking down the street and he begins to tell me another story even better than the one I went there to talk to him about which of course my typical is no longer running so I don't have the story anymore what the fuck and the story was basically oh there's another bigger spy out there I now know I now realize there is there's one out there right now well this was three years ago there was one three years ago that's out there was actually just retired at the implication was they're still there they're bigger and I real it was one of those things where when he put together all the pieces to catch this one woman Anna Montez he realized oh there's someone else and then he retired Wow he's like the implication was he couldn't get anyone else interested in finding the other bigger one but he knew there was someone out there they didn't know specifically who there were no he knew there was someone III forgot of course because it was this tragic thing where I turned up I can't find him back how didn't you just hold on stop stop stop let me put this back on do you think he would have told you the story if your tape recorder was running don't think so oh fuck it's kind of great it's a great he was incredibly that's where Siri comes in hey Siri record this yeah that's right he was it screw but I think you know if you're in that world you just assume yeah they all assume they're spies like we have them we have them in there so it's like they're not as maybe they're not as worked up about it as we are I don't know yeah there's there was a story recently where Iran assassinated some people that they suspected were CIA spies and I always wondered like how many people are spies and like you know homeland style living in some other country assimilating into their culture getting jobs and organizations even even in terrorist groups yeah infiltrating what a crazy way to live your life well there was a story I told him one of my podcast episodes richest history season two I think that I ran across I loved reading these memoirs of like mid-level retired intelligence officers and there's tons of them and people don't really read them and I love their just because invariably like in the middle of the book they'll tell you some they'll just drop some crazy story and this guy it was the former general counsel the CIA wrote his memoirs really interesting memoirs and the middlee tells a story about how the CIA CIA a guy who was a really big deal terrorists in the 70s and 80s really big deal um has a change of heart and comes to the CIA and says I no longer believe in what I'm doing I'd like to work for you and proceeds to work for the CIA for some period of time unknown period of time and he's the he's way up high in Middle Eastern terrorist organization and that fact leaks to the New York Times and a reporter for The New York Times basic the price a story outing him and the CIA French Lee tries to get in touch with him to warn him and he vanishes they think he was killed fuck that reporter because there he was a barely interested you if you're a reporter and you have something like that though that's what the episode is all about okay because your whole job is to release information your whole job is to report on things so here you have this bombshell of a story that'll make you look like a hero but it could get someone killed what do you do fuck what I didn't realize is that there's a established pattern of people at this intelligence services and editors of newspapers talk all the time yeah about things like this it's like so they have arrangements yeah they ever put that in this case the arrangement didn't work Malcolm you're awesome let's wrap this up thank you really appreciate I really appreciate you work I've like I said have been a gigantic fan for a long time so this is a real treat for me and would you do this again I would be delighted to thank you thank you very much appreciate it bye everybody fuck [Music]
