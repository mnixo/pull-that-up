and we're live what's up heavyweight champion of the world how's that feel man submitting you know it's a big blessing just happy this is it seem real it's still yeah of course is real for the first few weeks the first few days I was pinching myself safe those throws a dream or nothing but you know I'm just really blessed to be here wonderful situation right you got like how many weeks out did you find out about the fight I think it was like a month a month in two weeks Wow month in two weeks I message eighty Hearns I tell him you know what give me the opportunity and what do you know your message back me and my girl were just all happy like well it was crazy Wow and you were already in camp right mm-hmm so like wasn't like heat they called you out of shape no elbows after my fight against Alexander damnit Renko well that's right how much time did you have off to recover I just took like a week and a half off well that's night I went back to the gym and I was just ready and loose so it was it couldn't happen in a perfect time that's amazing do you like it like that where you just experienced a big fight so you're already kind of used to the the being in the ring being on television the whole moment of it all and then boom it happens again right afterwards yeah of course you know cuz I was already loose I was already in fight mode so especially from having the heavyweight champion title you know the opportunity to get that it's it was amazing it was incredible fight man was incredible thank you it was really amazing was amazing was when you got dropped you kept your composure you got up and then he tried to move in for the kill and then you started landing bombs on him and dropped him and I remember jumping off the bed while I was watching oh shit it was wild man yeah I don't fight it was my first time getting dropped and you know what I don't feel super her you know because I have when I got dropped be hidden with a good right hand and I took like a champ but I got a man and I just throwing bombs you have fluid punches man I mean it's it's really interesting to watch you're so efficient like the way you throw punches you're not like grunting and fucking digging like there's a lot of guys that you see there's a tremendous amount of energy that's expended every time they throw punches but you man your punches just come in bunches its power you just moments the combinations that we've been working at in the gym many robliz that's like I had a trainer who throws a lot of combinations as good at working speed so I think we click really good together well it's such a big asset for heavyweights because most heavyweights they're throwing big bombs and they're looking for that one punch yep yeah and you you just pile them on man and you're throwing them in all these angles and especially when you get in tight with dudes you know like when you're in tight with dudes in these dogfights your punches are coming at all these different angles and so fluid it's beautiful to watch man thank you man especially with these big guys I love fighting bigger guys you know some one time I fought a guy that was sort of the me and it it was kind of hard so imagine me pressuring bigger guys and throwing these combinations it works for me really good it does and you're the first-ever Mexican heavyweight champion of the world man thanks to God it's crazy man I mean you are in the same league as Cain Velasquez the first ever in UFC heavyweight champion that was Mexican yeah I mean that's that's just incredible honor man mm-hmm thanks man I'd let her say that the love you must be getting from all the metas oh my gosh I can't even go to the store without taking so many pictures people are on the lines they get off like say if I'm gonna drive through some where they get off of their car and tries to take pictures but it's a blessing you know I really appreciate all my fans all the supporters it's amazing man and you know what was really cool was the post-fight press conference when you're talking about it were you like Tamm you know we made it and you know we're saying we're saying my mom yeah your mom that was beautiful yeah and because a lot of people don't know that we're we're struggling a lot even before this fight you know and going through a lot of the stuff with top-ranked with Bob Aaron of me not getting a lot of fights waiting waiting because I had one more fight left with them so they didn't want to let me go so I had to pay my pay it off so thank you know yeah everything's turned around so quick sorry Bob fucked up yeah well there's a lot of dudes who were not interested in finding you you know I see it was one of those things where you were incredibly talented and incredibly skilled but you didn't have the biggest name yet so there wasn't like a lot of money in it yet but there was a giant risk and a lot of the insiders were very very aware of this you know guys who really follow boxing were very aware of this and coming into that fight like I talked to a lot of people that are like big boxing fans and they're like that dude is a live dog that's a live dog like it mean for sure Anthony Joshua was a bad motherfucker he's a big giant muscular dude looks like Adonis but I feel like any Ruiz's a live dog he could win that fucker because when they see me they're like look at this chubby kid Manny he's gonna get tired really fast he's he's gonna get knocked out but the real people that know about boxing they they know the skills that I have the movement yeah I could get a little bit more fit and more leaner you know get the like the extra fat turning into mush so I'll love to do that you know but the thing is people love you because you're kind of chubby yeah because I mean well it's also you you like you like hey you know people that go to the beach and don't want to take their shirt off you're like fuck man Andy Ruiz is kind of built like me yeah and he's the champ of the world yeah give give this big guy is confident it makes a big deal like you member went Butterbean mulatto beam was obviously never a champ but you know people involved a lot of bean because he was this big fat guy would fuck people up you know what I took a picture with butter bean when I was like then I was like five years old six years old in Tijuana he fought over there and he was a big guy man big guy he was a tank man that dude had some fucking power yeah starch people you know he really couldn't go past four or five rounds but he would put a fuckin beatin on you for four rounds I've ever seen when Johnny Knoxville from that crazy asshole decided I'm bleed or something but he thinks he let him punch him for some crazy reason he decided to try to box with butter things just brained him it was this was not good mmm don't do that to people no no I'm gonna sign a waiver so you're sitting pretty right now man I mean you're at the top of the heap you're the champ and you're the most popular champ right now because you're the guy who pulled off the giant upset over the Olympic gold medalist the fucking the man Anthony Joshua you knock him out and like that everyone is sitting there chomping at the bit there's Wilder who's you know probably the greatest knockout artist in the history of the heavyweight division and then there's Tyson Fury and Tyson Fury and while they're trying to figure it out and Tyson Fury's now in a different organization it's a hard to make the matches work now it's like what happens next for you you know what's gonna be next as the the rematch against me and Anthony Joshua we're still negotiating but there's definitely gonna be the rematch this year exciting fight but yeah but uh while there you know while there and me and him are on the same team I had a little interview with him over there at the Pacquiao fight and really cool dude he's very cool yeah he's really cool we respect each other and but that I'll be a good fight you know between me and him I love that well I mean people knew who he was before but goddamn that Tyson Fury fight put him on the map was really good I was there too I was like man I want to be in that position I want to be champion it kind of motivated me you know yeah there well you know and then his the fight with Brazil afterwards where he flatlined at one punch he's an interesting guy man he's so interesting you know his story that he didn't even start boxing until he was like 20-something years old and he really started doing it because of the daughter because the daughter has medical issues got it a limping team won a bronze medal a year and a half into boxing that's crazy yeah it's nuts man lays blessed you know yeah blessed like you man mm-hmm this is it yeah it's gotta be a crazy feeling now you're like six months ago you're the struggling boxer you know try to make ends meet you know working your way up very respected we don't have that big name yet and then boom you get the opportunity of all opportunities I think that's what I need is just the opportunity and be hungry you know at from having nothing to wanting to want something you know in life it it's a big motivation especially me I have five kids so damn I'm 29 Wow it started early I know Mexican style yeah Mexican style yeah well hey man you're five kids are sitting pretty now man yeah that's the frame okay so you there's a rematch that is in negotiation now how much can you tell us that isn't a be in December sometime December [Music] there's gonna be is gonna come out pretty soon you know told me I did tell you about telling anybody no don't know the cameras are off okay yeah but it's gonna be this year's and be an exciting fight me and Anthony Joshua rematch but the the words gonna come out soon wasn't a bit if anything I'll message you and be like oh yeah you know actually you know well so now going into this rematch is there anything that you're gonna do differently I mean you know obviously now that he's well aware you're a big threat mm-hmm you know he's gonna think about you me I'm sure he was aware you were threat before but when you stopped him he became the first guy to beat him I mean that I mean that changes history mm-hmm I think what we're gonna do we're we're getting a big house over there in Mexico somewhere in the in the nowheres you know so we're gonna have a the suited a camp you know close camps so we're just gonna be really focused for this fight we're not under estimating him or anything you know we just got to work hard and do it again so show people what I'm capable of now how much change is now that you're the champ do you have do you change anything in your camp and as far as your strength as far as long as we have all the team you know the stuff that we need the nutrition is the chef the coach is you know the all the other stuff that I need to to win this fight especially training you know though that's the main thing training same discipline and and I'm you know praying to God now I'm coming into the fight with Josh with the first time did you have any Trishna stid you have a strength conditioning idea that I did have one the plan was not to loose too much way you know because the guys really big you know I have wanted to be heavy so I could carry his weight and you know it worked for my favor but I think the main thing that I'm gonna do I might do a little bit of ways just to tighten up a little bit but just stay busy that's the main thing do you worry about like if it's not broke don't fix it like there have been guys before the main changes in the way they prepare and those changes like maybe fuck with their confidence or they didn't feel as good they didn't they didn't perform the same way no I don't think we're gonna be changing too much of that stuff you know long as rich training we have the good sparring just just exactly what we did for the last fight I think that's what we're going to be doing just more intense now do you have a guy that monitors your heart rate do they take like logs of like what your resting heart rate is when you get up in the morning and your heart rate variability and all that kind of shit no they don't they don't know that I'm kind of just also you know old school you know work hard wake up run train he good for like four or five days and we have our little cheat meals you know but you know just just have a happy camp you know this is heavyweight camp like it's everybody yeah heavyweight camps nice in a weight cutting now what kind of food they have you eating right now I'm just just eating like you know sandwiches time with steaks yeah I just ate a sandwich before I came on so well the beautiful thing about being heavy ways you don't have to worry about your weight but it's in terms of optimal performance and like when your chef has you in camp oh when we're gonna defeat well everything chicken me I try not to eat too much meat you know and it takes so long to digest I get constipated can't share comfortable but everything you know vegetables a lot of white rice they tell they tell me not to eat too much white rice but I like white rice now do they have you taking supplements or anything like that you know what for this fight I wasn't taking a lot of supplements just multivitamins something to get me through the the training yeah basically and what kind of strength conditioning should they have you doing you running running doing explosive stuff a lot of network a lot of network I think that's one of my favorite things at the gym sparring beating people up and doing my work yeah of course right now you you had an extensive amateur career too man which is I think a lot of like how you're so well schooled you know that can that helped me a lot you know um I first started training when I was 6 years old and now I trained for a whole year and when I was 7 years old I had my first amateur fight I was always this big chubby kid where there wasn't people had my age at that weight so I always had a fight bigger guys and no older guys so my first fight I won but they gave it to the other guy at 12 years old fighting a 7 year old so then I got robbed uh-huh I got robbed I feel like I'm your first fight and I and I have the video - oh you put that shit online yeah let the internet decide mm-hmm Wow so you first fight at 7 years old that's incredible man that's there's no substitute for that guys who get into combat sports young that's the guys who have what I was talking about that you possessed before that sort of fluidity the efficiency to punches it's like you're you develop throwing punches I think it's all muscle memory type of you know a lot of male work and just working hard man working hard and this is a sport that I love and I've been doing this is the only thing that I know so thank God that it paid off well it's just it's it's such an amazing story I love a story like that it's such a rocky story such a Cinderella story a Cinderella it's amazing well yeah everybody underestimated me they're they're just waiting for me to get knocked down and they only when they see me getting locked down they're like oh and it's crazy that the announcers where we're saying oh Anthony is a great finisher how he's gonna finish home and what do you know end up getting them with a hug yeah it was crazy how many times you watch the fight like 30 times every time then I still got more more to see you know because when he coming with the uppercut and the hook I was kind of I was kind of being on the lazy mode you know I think I need to put my geared up more and move the head more well he's a big powerful motherfucker but he's an outside fighter he likes to fight on the outside and drop big power punches and that's where it became apparent that like when you're in the dog fight when you guys are in tight you have that advantage the fluidity and efficiency and I think I think is a speed that I kind of messed them up no and I'm not I'm not just the 1 2 3 fighter punches you know I try to throw more than 1 or 2 punches so no dude you know throw hailstorms yeah shit come anyway from all kinds of angles it's awesome man so you're in this amazing position now when you're you're headed into this fight how long did it take to negotiate the rematch I'm sure you had sort of a contract clause right yeah we had a contract clause which has been going back and forth you know with my team and their team because I think they were trying to get you to go to England yeah but I want to say in America but there's some we don't we can't say what's gonna happen I'd love to have a backyard over there at the Madison Square Garden you know it looks to run it back and but how about the Staples Center in the Staples Center that's what I said too and when one of the interviews but for Vegas Vegas would have been great too yeah alright but wherever it is is gonna be an amazing fight an amazing venue so but tune in is there the announcement gonna be in soon now is this gonna be on the zone again on the zone beautiful um it's so nice you could just watch it on app yeah watch on a laptop and when you see the rest of the heavyweight division me what a crazy exciting time for boxing Lansing comes in these waves right and we're like there's waves of awesome shit happening right now is a hot wave Canelo's hot you know Manny just won the title at 40 years old you know triple G and canal they're talking about having another fight it's so amazing right now it's like boxing is on fire that is you know and I'm just blessed being there and in the top ten you know and having the the unified heavyweight champions but you know I'm willing to fight anybody as soon as I when the the rematch I'm willing to fight Tyson Fury Walder or anybody you know that's all listen there's never been a time that I can recall where there's four legitimate heavyweight champions that everybody thinks of like look Anthony Joshua could have been the man you know Tyson Fury could be the man while there could be the man you could be the man who's the fucking man it's like no one knows it's not like during the Tyson era it was like Tyson and everybody else was just just waiting to get murked yeah you know like there's been times where there was a standout fighter but when you when Joshua beat Klitschko it was apparent that Joshua was the guy but then as Wilder started piling up bodies it's like damn maybe Wilder's the guy and then Tyson Fury comes back you know a lot of people have written it heissen fury off after the Klitschko fight they were like you know he kind of went crazy almost committed suicide and all these mental health problems now he seems super happy and healthy and so it's this incredible incredible time for boxing when you have like in terms of star power and in terms of like the public interest I can't recall a time in my life where there's been four dudes who were at the top of the heap like this yeah Tyson freeze a good guy so you know I love his personality as energy and you know what if I if I want to see that fight again while during fury you know I was a really good fight I think it was really close if Walter what are gonna knock them down on the last run I think Tyson Fredo was winning in my eyes I think so too and I think you could make an argument that he's still won even though he got knocked down twice in the fight yeah it's still you make a good argument that he's still won the decision mm-hmm I know a lot of people think he did but I didn't have a problem with the decision just because of action and the ways Wilder knocked him down in that final round what the fuck how get up that was what was crazy like and when while they're like who was a thumb across his throat and I thought it's over and he's shaking his hips like and then Tyson Fury just rises from the dead like a fucking zombie it's just it's crazy man in the heavyweight division you know it only takes one punch to change the whole game the whole the whole fight you know and that's the beauty of it it is the beauty of it now what is it like like getting accustomed to all this recognition now I know you got this new ice you got a AR hanging phone yeah spending a little that heavyweight ravage a jeweler yeah I mean dude you're I mean you your whole life is like shifted like what does that feel like it feels good you know just getting the stuff that I always wanted you know seeing a lot of famous people having nice stuff you know thanks to God now I could just get it for myself and for my family for my kids my mom kind of car you driving now I have a rolls-royce you stepped right up didn't even fuck around you didn't try BMW first not already heard of that before what were you driving before you won the title I had a Porsche I had a Porsche Panamera oh those are nice yeah it's not a Rolls Royce no Rolls Royce is a king car you know what the the car that I love right now and I bought for my for my fiance Julie it's the new G Wagon zat 2019 yeah beautiful knows that shared yeah yeah the shit she's lucky doesn't know man it's a crazy car it's they redesigned it they made it so that the old ones they had like that old truck suspension with the live rear and front axles and it was kind of bumpy and shit I love it man when you move it when the car moves they like the seats hug you hmm yeah that's a tank - yeah those doors were a thousand pounds it's crazy we shut those things like a bank vault you know yeah but there's something about a Rolls Royce man that's like a suitable car for a champ you know you run around early man my dream car I even had pictures before I was even any nothing I said pictures on my on my wall of all the cars that I wanted a Lamborghini Rolls Royce you know just dreamy big right and that's what I tell a lot of these kids managers dream big have have write something that you want in life and just keep keep praying for it you know keep wishing for it and it will come true you work hard yeah if you work hard some people just want to wish now you have to work hard there's a lot of shit involved yeah do you use any sort of a sports psychologist or anything like that no not really no no just motivation and my kids you know just a person that wants to do better than I do better right and so when you are preparing for a fight do you do you ever have moments where you you know you find yourself feeling down or you find yourself not the answer and to play now there's a lot of times like that you know because I'm missing home I'm like man I want to go with my kids I'm gonna go with my girl I'm a man man I haven't I haven't fucked or nothing so I'm fucking angry and you know stuff like that that's what a lot of boxers go through you know because this is a lonely sport you know this is a one-man sport and you know you got to do everything on your own and not on your own but when you go to the gym you have your team but you just after the gym is what you do you know I usually just rest watch movies try to get a show find a show just relax just chill out do you get regular massage or anything yep I get massages from AR therapy from LA he hooks it up like every I probably when I'm in camp I'll get one like two two times a week three times so basically it's normal stuff just normal strength conditioning food it's the grind of camp is something that boxers always complain about it's like it's the one thing it's just the day-in day-out just hard work constantly you know what sucks for a lot of the fighters too is going in there and you know your coach wants you wait you after training every fucking time and you're like man and it was crazy but you know just working hard it's it's it's erotism a payoff what do they like to keep you out like what weight do they like to keep your my thing like a 250 5 to 50 what you feel like you know I'm at my best at 250 divided 250 but I gained 2 what are that way like 267 for Joshua really purpose just because he's wrong yeah I kind of worked out devon worked out now what did you do differently um nothing when I was idiot no it was very good just more portion you know a little bit more portion and I was just happy through all this camp you know I'll just focus motivated I kept telling everybody that I'm gonna win that I'm gonna pull out the upset and you know just having those good vibes inside you in a fun camp you know it was fun I enjoyed the camp a lot the only thing that people worry about when someone finds success and you know obviously Tyson is the best example of it because he's documented in his documentary and he talks about it all the time was how things got out of control once he became famous how things just went off the rails and he just lost his fucking mind how do how do you prevent that from happening I don't know ease I think just having the right people around you you know having the right people around you that want to do good and want you to do good you know bring you good opportunities you know stuff like that and you know I'm a family man I'm always with my kids with my fiancee so that's one of the big blessings that I have and if that would have happened I think my dad will grab me by the throat like way he's always on me so but you seem like a real down-to-earth guy which helps a lot mm-hmm you know I mean that that really does it's the dudes that have feeling like sometimes the ego is what gets you to the dance because you believe you are the baddest motherfucker of all time but then once you are there and the challenge is met then there's no other challenges in front of you like with Tyson and each fight is kind of like a done deal before it happens and you just start getting Tigers and doing crazy shit you know personally with Tigers yeah now then the main thing just remain humble you know I I was praying for this opportunity for so long so I'm still gonna continue to keep praying and thanking God for all these big blessings that he gave me and you know just continue to work hard and enjoy my family to the fullest and you got a good crew of dudes with you too you could tell I know this is you're saying that's the biggest entourage I had and I never ever got in here I never wrote with the lot of entourage you know yes just was a few of my best friend's you know friends close friends that were from high school and some of my cousins and that's awesome the five badges and people who know you the beginning now this newfound celebrity like are they giving you like there's other distractions that come your way like like movie type offers and television share you know what I did my first commercial for sweat away exhales and and it's a let's go brand what is it a sweat o X sweater wax yes what a way this it's a drink you know like like Pedialyte oh but it's a Mexican version and it was fun man it was really fun I love doing commercials have you been to Mexico since you won I have remember I met the President of Mexico I went to los ninos and that was amazing man I'm that is Lopez he's a president for from Mexico amazing guy is it wild being in Mexico was the first ever Mexican heavyweight champion it was super wild so many so many fans you know little kids of all types of sort of people come in my way and it's just crazy how how they react you know how to react they're screaming like it's crazy that was must be the the wildest thing about this is this shift and how people perceive you versus just a few months ago mm-hmm and now like you're the fucking man it's right it's crazy does that mean it was it look what goes on in your head while all this has happened that this is just the beginning no this is just the beginning and you know I don't wanna I don't want to lose the title so the main thing I just gotta stay focused and get prepared for the rematch you know because there's more work to be done so and you know I want to be the Mexican okay so I want to continue to keep winning and defending on my titles that's beautiful now Joshua is the first fight and so this will take place in December and given if you win what would you like to who would you like to face nice because it looks like it's going to be a while before they could sort out Tyson Fury and young they were all there because a contractual shit when I win and CEO skater I win for the rematch I love to fight Tyson Ferryman's I was in fury I know well there Walters there too he has about that that I want you know because I want the WBC Abell why do you want that belt because I'll be undisputed if I have that Bell you know I have all the belts in the heavyweight division and I'll be the new king so what do you have now you have WBA I have the WBA WBO IBO and IBF damn I know damn that's crazy I should have brought them to my shadow do what you have laid out on your bed no they're actually a my a my dad's house that's why I buy my dad's house must be bizarre just looking at them right they are man I was crying man like I said I was still pinching myself for four weeks I can only imagine mm-hm I would imagine skin the last years or really really really sinks in so Tyson Fury seems to you to be like the the best matchup after that Tyson Fury I think he's one of the biggest names out there you know I like didn't dealing white so you know he was coming up but he got caught up oh stop it what did he kept would he get caught with I don't know I think I was PD or something some sort of performance enhancers I don't know why they do that I know why they want to win yeah you don't need it man look at me I'm it doesn't look like if I taking anything in a legit yeah all natural well you're consistent and even though you you carry body fat you're always in great shape you know you never have a problem with fatigue I have so much yeah I mean that's deceptive you know there's quite a few fighters like that that you look at them on the outside and you can get real confused and you know but you have always been consistent like you had consistent amateur career consistent professional career some fighters just like they maybe they just feel like they need something else you know they just don't feel like they're doing enough and they want it they want a shortcut you know it's usually it's usually a bad sign you know and in today's climate it's look there's there's Vata testing and there's a best you know that was my first time getting tested by veda and they're fucking strict man they go there they'll go look for you wherever you're at at your house at the gym anywhere and they take blood out piss out I like that yes I think it's the best way in you sada is what works with the UFC very similar same sort of deal they wake you up six o'clock the morning hey buddy yeah time to find out what's up you know and they've caught a lot of people that way they caught a lot of people it's great it cleans up the sport you know I mean this this is a dangerous dangerous sport and when people are taking things they there's a potential that they can hit you and they wouldn't be able to hit you without it and I mean this is something that we all want to avoid we all want to avoid anything that could pretend mean it's already a dangerous enough some boys out there already trying to kill each other and all that you know yeah so Dylan white is I mean what how long they suspended him for I'm not sure I seen it on Instagram but you know things have been but you know hopefully he gets clean and or we don't know what really happened you know maybe I was a team side that put something in head or we don't know yeah it could be when we catch this a lot with the UFC we're guys buy a supplement at like a vitamin store and it's tainted or even like a diet one haul then they been that soon yeah yeah anything that has like a diuretic or things along those lines yeah it's it's a shame but you know it if they're not using Vata testing and they get caught then they're just dumb cuz then doesn't means it that's what it's kind of scary you know fighting over there at the UK we don't know what they're gonna be letting I think Josh will be taking or whatnot or I don't know didn't take some shit I don't know tell you what he looks like he does he does looks like it but looks like what you would think a movie fighter would look like you know like he's he's just he's built perfect like he's got a perfect body like you wouldn't to change anything you know if you're making a sculpture you like damn you know but that I don't know if that's natural mm-hmm what do you think I don't know if you took something you know I didn't work okay if he if he doesn't work if he doesn't use it for the next fight I don't know who knows how the body's going to react or if he doesn't have it so or maybe I reacted wrong when he wasn't using it when I fought him or that's possible no that's definitely happened before that's definitely happened you know you've seen fighters that look different because of stricter testing and then they don't perform the same way they have like real problem and then also it's confidence if you know you've been cheating and then all of a sudden they take away your secret weapon and then you just need like I'm fine I'm fine but you in there's a little lingering I yeah so you worried about that if if I if the fight takes place in the UK you know somewhat but it it's not gonna be over there so he's never tested positive before right he's never have so you just gave up the ghost you said it's not gonna be over there hmm so now it's people narrowed it down is 197 countries now we know it's not gonna be in England no that's not okay 96 yeah it's uh in combat sports I mean it's always been a problem performance-enhancing drugs yeah everybody's been using it a a lot of Champions you know from the heavyweight division to a lot of war a lot of people yeah but I don't know I don't want to try it I don't want to get cut uh well it's it's beautiful that you you haven't had it and you could take pride that everything that you've accomplished is from hard work to intelligence yeah so when you look at the landscape of boxing I mean right now what fights are exciting for you I want to see that Pacquiao and what's there derman know the guy that fought many Mikey Garcia Oh or else parenteral Spanish girl spends yeah like him he's a bad motherfucker who's yeah shut down Garcia like that Garcia isn't mad motherfucker it was I was over there in Vegas with him well wouldn't Garcia look I give it up to Garcia cuz after that fight he's like that guy's the truth yeah that guy's the real deal you know that's beautiful when a guy doesn't make excuses and says hey man hey guys he's everybody knew Errol Spence is a bad motherfucker though I mean there was no surprise as well once you have him fight like the really elite fighters I think that's when I was telling says in a show oh sure yeah I mean it's such a great time for boxing Earl Spencer versus Manny Pacquiao would be incredible yeah they're working on it is that what they're working on I thought they were gonna rematch with Thurman I don't think so no no ever wants to see that man yeah yeah I want to see you don't want to I think Pacquiao bitch-ass didn't work yeah it was crazy when he knocked him down the first round Wow I think he got too confident in Manny Pacquiao got to confidently got here with punches that he shouldn't have you know and I don't know I think Thurman was just surviving the whole time but either way he was connecting really good shots he connected me good shot I mean he hits hard the crazy thing is manny is the oldest ever guy to win the welterweight title 40 years old he's won titles in how many different weight classes now it's more than eight something but it's like eight did more than eight different weight classes which is nuts like who the fuck does that and then maintains his power all the way through and he just takes care of themselves you know the amazed I am white rice it's something you know in the Philippines so it's amazing but yeah that's a great fight and then there's Mayweather who shows up at that fight and still talking shit and mm-hmm how can that be a good fight against Manny Pacquiao Mayweather Oh watch it apparently according to khabib no matter how khabib nurmagomedov is the UFC lightweight champion bad Russian motherfucker he's he's saying that that Floyd Mayweather's people have been trying to get him to box him that's crazy well void may be that easy money off Conor McGregor it's that's crazy he probably thinks I do too mm-hmm I mean it was a crazy well Floyd played that perfectly' - you only gave Conor like six weeks to prepare you know he you know he took the lion's share of the money but gave Conor shitload you mean a lot of money off that fight yeah I met with her smart man like I said having the right people with you and that gave you good opportunities those are the right people you want to around you now when you were coming up who were you influenced by like who are you a big fan of um love Chaves you know all the Mexican fighters Morales but I got to me about red I was my first time I was a good honor over that the Pacquiao fight uh you know my tyson you know all the other big guys all the Mexican guys as well - yeah um so you're 29 so when you were when you first start now who was who was big Fernando Vargas Hills my friend for nom de large now with Fernando on a plane once yeah I used to have the same haircut as him I painted my my hair it was crazy ya know he was a bad motherfucker he was a lot of fun to watch didn't he he had some reality show he was doing with him and his family what is he doing now do you know um he's training fighters I was in tennis kids - they're really talented we're at in Vegas oh yeah nice no they really good people nice guys um Oscar De La Hoya your fan of hands yeah boss girl oh yeah this I mean there's so many great Mexican fighters if you think about one country that produced amazing boxers I mean Mexico might be the top of the heap mm-hmm I mean really think about it I think I think we're missing one champion I think we have champions and all the divisions except for one I think like everywhere it may be probably cruiserweight crews away I mean I think so but you know what at least we got the first Mexican heavyweight champion yeah that's a feel man it's so crazy you know just by saying I'm gonna be I'm in the records you know um hopefully nobody forgets my name but you know there's always gonna be the first Minsk in heavyweight champion of the world especially for my kids you know for them to look up and be like well forever yeah my daddy would be number one you're the first ever there's no one ever can take that from you that's it forever a blessing my books there's what I've been working for for so long you know my dad pushing me embarrassing me with my friends how do you better just by kicking me out by telling me come on we had to go try and get the fuck out of there I don't know is this crazy man my dad's always been there behind me so I don't think I would have been in this position if it wasn't in the role of all this is you dad a boxer no but his dad used to train fighters and my golly Oh a long time ago I never got to meet him but and he never boxed himself no it was just in the streets city train no he'll just see he'll just see his his dad trained other guys I didn't think he had the discipline I think he was it was more like a hustler basically so what was his thought when you first started fighting well he's one who put me into it Ria's yeah because I the destroyer I used to destroy everything all that the toys my mom's stuff everything so I had so much energy as a little kid he just took me to my first thing was karate I tried karate all six years old didn't like it it took too long for action or whatnot and he put me into boxing I was six years old and what do you know I fell in love with the sport so what do you mean by it took too long for action I think we were practicing too much or something like Tatas in Chile taken in the air in the first two weeks when I went to a boxing gym they made me spar on the kick kicked the shit out of me man they beat me up over seven I was no I was six and a half your member says I trained a whole year and so I turned the right they beat me they put me to spar my first time and I was leading and I told my dad you know what I don't want to fight no more like what do you mean you just gotta keep training and you end up beating everyone up and what do you know a year later I end up beating everyone up so your nickname came from you fucking things up as a kid fucking things up destroying things I could never have a toy or or or even like the Gameboy or anything for like more than a week or something cuz I would end up breaking it crazy so did your parents give you that nickname yeah that's a larious huh that's what a great nickname then because it seems like a tough guy nickname but then when you find out it's because you're a little kid you break your toys that makes it even better every not just toys but everything classes I don't know it was crazy so it must be wild for your dad to see you come up from a six year old kid and you know because of his pushing you and trying to keep you in there that you eventually start excelling and winning amateur fight after amateur fight and then he's really happy man I was really happy and I guess that he's really happy he's really blessed he's over here and over there just enjoying life as well now when you were coming up to wizard fighter who style you tried to emulate was there anyone that like really stood out for you you know I sparked a lot of guys and they all of them tell me that I have a my own type of style you know they tell me that I have a calm difference the hell then than everyone else and you know I like that well that is one of the beautiful things about boxing and all martial arts like there's a lot of people that don't like that term martial arts because they don't think it's really an art but it is an art I think it's harder man shit from being in the ground and fighting up it's a lot of things you have to learn oh for mixed martial arts yeah but I mean even boxing is a martial art and what I mean is that like the way you knocked out Joshua that was beautiful it was beautiful for a person like me who loves boxing it was art like you expressed yourself in art I mean that's no different than a badass movie or a rap song or a symphony it's art it's just art with your fists and you know I mean you saw I'm sure you saw that video that I posted up on my Instagram who was the guy that made that video that video where he hits Joshua and Josh's soul leaves his body right goes on the airplane I was a funny man that guy's amazing what is this - what is it five four what we're gonna find out his Instagram and give him some props because seven for a rod seven for seven put that put that up so we could watch that again this deck guy is a goddamn genius cuz I didn't just do it with that he did it with Deonte versus Brazil he gave them fan OSes power fist this guy does amazing animate this one's not on Jaime the guy does a amazing animation I mean I don't even know how the fuck he does I'm flying down him what program but this is my favorite plate play this Jaime here boom what do you see the soul just leaves his body a blue soul he gets the roller bag he's on the he's on the escalator he gets on the plane and a little Tweety birds are flying around his head that is hilarious man that guy's a goddamn genius ray rod 747 thanks a lot buddy no he's Gino's funny how many millions of views that should get I think you reposted it I got a lot more views than his paid his got like seven hundred thirty-six thirty-seven hundred thirty five thousand but on mine is yes millions yeah no it's crazy he does a lot of great shit in MMA and in boxing there's been a lot of that right a lot of meme yeah I like that you know and now they have my own one so it's it's amazing to have your own one what like the the Mimi's that they put I love me hitting uh acting Joshua you know stuff like that yeah having me there and looking at it I'm just like wow man that's crazy yeah wild right so you you didn't emulate anybody when you're coming up is not like Chavez or Barrera you you like try to imitate their style or time yeah of course like Tyson you know everybody wants to knock everybody I like Tyson and chive is always going to the body you know I'm one of the heavyweights that I like to hit the body a lot you know get them tired but like I said I think I have my own style you know I like I like my style have you had the same train in your entire life no I went through I learned from a lot of different trainers you know my first real professional trainer was Freddie Roach that's when I mainly yeah that's when I made many pets yeah Freddie Freddie with me to some great guy Freddie help me out through my whole professional career until like the my tenth or twelfth fight and he had me so I learned a lot from him why did you stop training with him they send me to Las Vegas top-ranked send me over there and then so we have there Jeff somewhere Jeff Graham OSHA some big guy was training me over there then we moved from there when we went to Abel Sanchez when I fought for the for the world title for the WBO you end up in big debate well Abel I was in Big Bear for I think for like a month and a half to the Joseph Parker fight was the only fight you've lost and we had a close decision exactly what's your what was your thoughts on that fire um you know I trained myself for that fight a lot of you know a lot of people don't know the the training camp that we had Abel Sanchez had like eight different fighters fighting at that same time so he was always flying out so he'll just leave us a piece of paper and be like you know what you guys do this do that and on our own you know so that kind of sucked why'd he do that ah bluegills obligation to go to the spread himself too thin yeah that sucks I'm a fan of Abel Sanchez - he's a bad motherfucker yeah he sure is you know I appreciate everything that he's done for me I'm so knowledgeable but for that fight I think I needed the right trainer and moving with many Robles and it state that I was the best thing I could have done you know cuz those guys are really on me just to two guys just pushing you and one telling you this I'm telling you that and it's just good you know it keeps you focused and so when Abel was training you and you trained by yourself you're up there in Big Bear and training by yourself how are you going nuts I was going Helenus man oh fuck am I feeling up here there's shit to do this is that one movie theater I was back and forth from my hometown you know cuz i live in Imperial Valley I live like four hours right three hours from Big Bear and I was just going back and forth and I wasn't really focused for that fight you know so a lot of people don't know that we're in the UK no I thought I'm in New Zealand Wow and it's hometown - oh wow so I think if I would have been over here with many robles I definitely would have won what was a close fight it was a good I was a good fight but when you think about what what went wrong I mean this is it's it's always so important for a fighter to have to experience a loss because a loss sort of lets you know like a man you don't want this feeling you know and and I didn't want to lose no more and that's one is that less when everything went down and me having child rooms with top ranked and they're not letting me go and how haman helping me out how him is the the man you know he's a man right now and he helped me out through through everything to get me out of the the situation and and giving me this opportunity so top ranked did they make you train with able like how did how did that set up yeah we end up going over there with Abel Sanchez you know it was a good good idea at first about waiting oils gonna be like that Brian because it's just got too many too many fires too many obligations and triple G wanna believe in him as well right a triple G went with Jacobs Anthony Jacobs or something like that um but uh but triple G is a good fighter you know I seen him over there at the fights too so he's a man got it were good friends no he's amazing and you know I'm really interested to see his rematch if they try to do a rubber match he's strong and me and him wrestled over there big bear wrestling literally wrestling and this guy picked me up and she's dude those Russians are a different kind of that built different they got different tendons or something he's strong no he is a bad motherfucker he's he's a really friendly guy tunes always smile and shit he's humble yeah I get along with him rather over there going crazy together while we arrested it was just some something that some some drill to warm up and and grabbing our fists by I mean our hands like shaking our hands to get to get strength in our forearms and shaking your hands yeah those like can't can we oh just just squeezing oh yeah we get like cramps right here really yeah it's how fucking big oh I'm sure long but why not like do like a wrist roll where we did that one too but I guess I don't know that's just their style of doing it picking each other up and how where is this shit so was able Sanchez gone with him to or did he was he focusing no triple G was in training at that time he had different other fighters he had to go oh okay so he was just in camp mm-hmm so then you left Abel Sanchez and now you're training with with many robliz in a street at the legends boxing gym in Norwalk so that is where you feel like is your best fit yeah that's I'm comfortable right there you know the gym is beautiful facilities really big you have everything that you need but for the Reis Joshua to the Train camps gonna be in the mountains somewhere private and you know so we could just focus and get ready for those Mexico right let's go nice did you like training at altitude the Big Bear was that the first time you were trained at altitude no I went there a few times and you know I liked it you know the first few weeks is it's hard you know it's really hard to get tired fast and but I did like it but when you come back down the sea level you you feel the better I feel the the benefit I can last more you know more oxygen in your body your brain yeah for sure now when you go to Mexico do you know what altitude you're gonna be up up there's gonna be I announced it because there's like a point of diminishing returns so people feel like once you get above like 6,000 7,000 8,000 the idea is that you can't work hard enough because there's just not enough air like they think that 5,000 is like the perfect line there's there's a lot of weird there's there's you know people have had different philosophies when it comes to training at altitude and now many people feel like you should actually live at altitude but you should train at sea-level because they think that you when you train at sea-level you could put out more output you could do more work and then you go and live up at altitude so your body acclimates to the low oxygen and you develop more red blood cells and that make sense yeah so we thought about doing something that stay up there yeah I'm just gonna stay out there just for a few months you know and a few months and come back down finish finish it up finish the camp for like a month and go where I'm gonna fight that I can't say well you're in such a great position man and you're only 29 years old so like you're athletic prompt particularly as a heavyweight is like you only three or four years away from your prime which is really crazy and that's a good thing you know I'm still young I never had big Wars you know I never been hurt thanks to God you know and every fight that I have you know I always pray for me and the guy that I'm fighting no cuz I want both of us who go with our families because I have two friends that have died from one from Italian one from Costa Rica that I know personally so it's scary man it's really scary it most certainly is I mean there's no getting away from that man it's it's so fucking scary when you think about your career do you have long-term goals do you have like a day that you like a time where you want to get out you know what I wanted to retail when I was 35 years old and I said that on a piece of paper like I like I was telling everybody to if you want to do if you want a goal or something write it down and all that and I said I won't I wanted to retire when I'm 35 so we'll see why 35 I don't know I just had that number seems like a good number uh-huh what do you think you would do if you weren't boxing um do the houses my dad is a contractor so we buy lots and we make houses from scratch you know we sell them we resell them or we rent them out and or make a lot of apartments you know condos for the people that can't really afford what's that called my dad does it low income house low income houses dime apartments like that in my hometown you know well that's beautiful mm-hmm um but for fighters the thrill of fighting is something that is impossible to recreate it's almost like for a regular person to experience what you experienced when you knocked out Anthony Joshua and Joshua gets counted off the referee waves his arms and you like oh shit I started something like oh my god I grabbed it yeah nuts man but I mean that feeling you you you all of a sudden you're the heavyweight champ in the world that I mean if you could sell that that look at that look at you right there man I felt like so many stuff from my bag just came off you know cuz so much pressure so much oh yeah stuff that was going through my mind I mean everybody was stunned the home crowd was done everybody was and but the crowd was on your side it was really wild man when you were teeing off on him and that the roars the crowd and when it was over when the referee just shook his hand and waved it off like that high is what bleeds fighters back in the ring when there really shouldn't be they chased that dragon yeah and that's what I want to do you know make a statement that everything is possible you know all the fighters that that have low confident or something in themselves you know anything is possible just work hard and you know the opportunity will come do you think you'll ever train fighters me you know I think the only person I would train would probably be like my son or at first you know because it's not really good to be training the Sun and well depends what kind of relationship you guys have you know I think my son I'll be trained I'd rather be like a promoter or something like that Oscar I sure will yeah mm-hmm that's so in the works a RJ promotion oh so your youths and really your own oh shit well that's really that's the plan you know first I want to focus on the fight and all that I don't want to jump in conclusions of doing kinds of other stuff I want to focus on my flight and after that or when I want to retire I want to get fighters from Mexico give them the opportunity and you know learn learn like Oscar De La Hoya beautiful mmm that's beautiful man anything else anything else you want to tell people you know just to tune in December in December Anthony Joshua against Andrew Reese or and or these verses is a Joshua uh-huh you're the Top Billing now man you know champ thank you but you know I just got to work hard man work hard they stay humble say discipline and just focus on the on the rematch well Andy listen man you're a great guy and a great role model thank you no energy I think for young kids to look up to a guy like you who's a really nice guy who's also a bad motherfucker it makes them realize hey you know you don't have to be a dickhead you don't have to be mean you could be a real cool dude who even prays for his opponent and still be the baddest motherfucker on the planet mmm congratulations to you sir thank you my friend watching good luck to you thanks for having me they're gonna be there man I'm gonna give you some ticket oh yeah oh shit and I'll be there [Applause] [Music]
