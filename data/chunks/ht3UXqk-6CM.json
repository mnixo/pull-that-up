vacation now with your family yeah we're going to lanai oh I'll be fun yeah boom and we're live speaking of vacations tell me about Guyana yeah that's a good segue you've been there a bunch you know I miss twice I thought was three no I was in no I've been to Guayana twice but between there I went to Bolivia oh and did like very similar very similar kind of trip like doing a river trip with amerindians are those people weirded out by Americans because the Jonestown Massacre thing is really so funny you bring up Jonestown because there's a couple things I've been sprat like uh the so the the the main group I was with in Guyana um is the Micucci and I'll surprise one day when I was a cook they make a dish they make a dish with cassava which is a root like manioc they make a dish with that they make a flower from it and make a dish and I was one day saying that hey that's a little that looks like pizza right no all right no comprehension like no thought of what pizza is I remember thinking like wow man like something you take like such a you know use consider such a part of everyday life is he didn't know what it was yeah and they don't know about Georgetown whoa Evil's in their own country they don't know about it at all no that's just not but yeah yeah like we'll get into this we gotta like realize sort of how insular you know and the Amerindian communities are who live in the in the jungle in Guyana yeah did they have communication on any yeah they knew more and more now and there's a lot a lot change the two times I went there were through five or six years apart they discovered sunglasses and I've ever the first time I was down there trying to turn them on because uh you know they they bow hunt for fish right which one of the main ways they get fish is bow hunting for fish and when you're looking into the water polarized the lenses are invaluable I feel lost without their main fish underwater and I kept saying man you gotta get on board polarized sunglasses not handed to you didn't like it this guy roving he anything about having them on his face he just like couldn't do it but then I go down to five years later and um every one of those boys is rockin polarized glasses so you see changes but yeah that's the thing with like I've brought up Jonestown a number of times because in the u.s. if you say hey I'm going to Guyana all anybody says is don't drink the kool-aid right you know it was really cool aid it was some like kool-aid no it was a kool-aid type no no so when people look at when we had this conversation cuz there's a couple things that are important here what the poison was right so we had a conversation I'll be back up the room I measure they make cassava yeah so does a root cassava knits like boys and stuff yeah so it's the root that gives all life they think they call it no but I mean they eat fish and game okay River fish and wild game and then that's like a staple to eat every day and the other thing the every day is a half-dozen things all produced from cassava which is kind of like a yam and it's cultivated with slash-and-burn agriculture and they cultivate these yams and from it they make a flower um they make a type of grain that's like couscous they make a syrup that's used as a coloring agent in a flavoring agent they make a non-alcoholic drink they make a somewhat alcoholic drink that would be like an equivalent to beer and then they make a much more alcoholic drink which would be an equivalent like fortified wine Wow they make all this stuff from this this route that they grow um in its raw form when you shred the root and squeeze the shredding so it'd be like Majan you took a yam and shredded a yam and then squeeze the an between your hands and tripped out a liquid that liquid is deadly poisonous okay dogs chickens people anything that drinks that liquid dies Jesus and it's cyanide so the Jonestown Massacre uh was a cocktail of the best people think that it was kool-aid flavor aid valium and potassium cyanide my question coming home from Ghana was did they was the cyanide from the root were they like doing homemade cyanide but it's when I got home I looked into this and it's it ceases at that that commune Jonestown commune had been ordering actual potassium cyanide which is used in a number of mining practices and other stuff so it's an available it's an available compound i undressed they laced the kool-aid with I'd heard about this cassava stuff and what do they know what the process is like do they know like how people figured out how to make it non poisonous I'll help Wow it's just been done so long yeah in the same stuff with like different poisons they use to poison that people use to poison fish um what strikes me about it is how in the village like the villa Micucci village I was in is mostly Micucci but is also like wah fashiona which is another tribe carob is in our tribe but it's predominately Micucci village and there's about 300 people to live in this village arm and how careless they are with the liquid like if you nowadays like picture like you're like the type of person like you and me are married to and raise kids with right if you had that type of mom and you had a big bowl of a liquid that would kill you if you drank a bit how that bowl would be monitored in your household Jesus Christ they'd be right barbed wire around it electrical fence but they should just laze they just lay it out and I said I was asked this guy wrote about him and uh I kept return to this there's certain things I can't always ask and just like things that he struggled to understand my fixation on it but I kept saying to this Micucci guy Rovin who I should back up to ion communication so guyot is a it's the only english-speaking country in South America everyone's like oh no no the government functions are English so if you if you picture South America it's northeast corner opening out on to the Southern Caribbean that's guy on its bordered on the east by Suriname on the west by Venezuela to the south by Brazil it's 90 percent virgin rainforest and within that ninety percent of virgin rainforest is only ten percent of the population so the coastal peoples are a Creole cultures people mostly descended from slave trade Europeans in the interior are the Amerindian groups and the government functions sort of the power in in Guyana is that is the coastal people's and there's not a ton of inter and it used to be barely any interplay between the Amerindian communities in the government the government's english-speaking so in you'll find that there's a lot of English mixed in in the Amerindian communities in some people like this guy Rovin because he's sort of a upping he's like a he has a leadership role in his community and he's learned just standard English very well um he's at a fascinating life just how much stuff has changed for him so I you can just like converse okay and in a way that you can converse in like a in a type that the type of English we're talking right now almost which creates us weird tension between the things that you're discussing and how you're discussing them like for instance to have a guy just in conversational English talking about problems they're having with neighbouring shamans and their own shaman putting curses on each other it like creates like there's like a strange tension between like how it's being conveyed to you you know like how so like okay if you're talking conversational English I guess like a life it's almost like you'd want it to be when he's telling you this you'd almost want to be reading it in like closed caption and he'd be saying it in the indigenous language because it sounds weird to have to have an idea that's so foreign to us which would be like a battle of shamans battling over access to wild animals okay um to have that delivered in conversational English has struck me as unusual and because I usually when you're traveling you're getting all of your information like traveling in Bolivia a guy would tell a story and he'd tell a story in um simcha an no one is saying that simcha in Germany okay he tells story in cha Mon a qu a person who spoke Spanish the person who speaks Spanish would tell it to a person no no come on a guy telling someone who speaks Romani in Spanish then that person telling it to a person who speaks Spanish in English and then that person giving you the information whoa when you get it it through that it takes on a mystical quality like you're crossing some space-time thing right we're seeing like these ideas discussed in their ancestral tongue okay yeah Tamara sent you a video of a guy Tom about killing a Jaguar yes right the language you've never liked when he's speaking like I've never in all my travels I've never heard a language sounds anything like that is a video online that's online what it was you know the title of it it's I think if you type in like um sh'mon a TSI charm on a Jaguar C taxi if Jamie you know fold up it's very cool the language is really amazing soul seems so ancient yes it's not like has nothing to like the Latin languages just sound so it's sound it's very unique so I guess what I'm getting at is to hear someone talking about something in conversational English that seems so far removed from just our understanding of things it takes on a weird quality but what's nice about it is you can go to a place where life is so vastly different than anything we understand and and just get like the straight dope right from the source right is why I love it's kind of what's so cool about Guyana because you can go and converse with with people who are very much a hunter-gatherer culture today but just shoot the shit with them without ever feeling like you're missing something this is like the everything's not lost in translation and all weird and garbled and in like painstaking to wade through they just ask like hey what's up with the local shaman I'll give you the dope on local shop and so they trade spells yeah well yeah we'll talk about there but I feel like I was laying the groundwork for uh the Jim Jones poison do you find the video now I thought I'd lost the words you're spelling the TS i M a n e TS ima any what does that mean shamanic that's how they spell it I could be screwed up you know yeah you spell a lot worse when you're not actually writing it out yeah I'm terrible I don't know anybody wins a spelling bee ever Jumaane is TS i yeah so if you type in cha Mon a Jaguar TS I ma n each egg wash is an Amerindian hunter remembers his best dog lost to a jaguar in the jungles of Bolivia okay here we go let's play this because it's fucking awesome there we go following is an interview with a member of the Kimani tribe of Bolivia do their inherent difficulties of translating indigenous languages subtitles are at times approximate yeah yeah but you eat it dream on the chip being you mark I Chico up on the earcup but you miss your naughty ducky oh yeah he no no so he's explaining where he's from yes Nicole did he's saying he hunts for food I always share the mean I get with my family I'm a good provider of me and you'll be if we'd done cutting up the meat in this video yes I also enjoy the adventure I love trekking through the jungle save it day one so honey with my favorite dog in a couple of it I'll keep skipper I ran ahead barking they were going after something okay Kiki Mikey Mikey all of a sudden my favorite dog just went completely silent see did you catch it you think there were about 90 meters ahead of me cold and I got to the other dogs had gone ahead after something okay if you follow you go Cindy boo come with me Nikki heat but we could meet you before say my favorite dogs whine very dead there was a big holes right side almost look like it had been arrowed if we ain't hit up thing we get you for the first thing I did I got my dog and set him where the ants wouldn't get to his body that dog was the bravest one I had see I'm not going to translate more guys just watch the video if you're interested but you get a sense of how cool it is so to recover the did we fully cover the poison thing no not really so I got home yet so it wasn't the same poison but Jim Jones uh he grew up in like a he was involved in a Pentecostal church he's involved in the Methodist Church then he kind of became a healer and started his own cult it was funny I was reading about him when I was trying to figure out the poison I was reading about how he was kind of ahead of his time because the Jim Jones massacre was 1979 in a 78 or 79 and one thing that got him sideways with his church was he wanted to have an interracial service Wow and that caused friction in his church at the time earlier in his career and he moved out to the Bay Area and started the church and he got like kind of paranoid and thought that his congregants shouldn't be engaging in sexual activities but he had he was siring illegitimate children left and right they go down to Guyana go out to the jungle you know a thousand of them down there people in the u.s. from the Bay Area kind of wonder what happened to their loved ones they send a congressman down there to try to figure out what's going on he shows up with a bunch of cameras the congressman says you know he's like I'm gonna help anyone who wants to go back to the Bay Area go back to the Bay Area he goes to the airstrip there's a shootout the Congress the US congressman gets killed in the shootout and then datas all start kill themselves with the poison and firearms and other shit 270 some kids over 900 people yeah remember it's like the defining thing but then yeah when you talk to these boys I'm like you know Georgetown like the Jonestown or the you know the Jim Jones Jonestown Massacre never drink the kool-aid like now see I heard it was it was budget kool-aid no bestest some way it was and I get and that's a debate and trying to find like a trying to like dig around and find the source of the cyanide which became very important to me to learn for some reason um no and I think kool-aid even tried to distance himself from it probably was kool-aid but they oh that does like some archival stuff and I guess in this archival stuff images like footage taken around and photographs around people have found out that they had both flavor aid and kool-aid on hand that's hilarious what it was kool-aid propaganda that's trying to pass the buck on the flavor aid so yeah no no thing there and if you get so if you go up the main river that drains the manor of the drains guy on is the Essequibo and if you go way up the Essequibo and you'll get to in a stream that comes in from there called the Rupununi and you go up the Rupununi and then you get to the rihwan at the mouth of the riwa and Rupununi is Reba village and in Reba village you're uh isolated enough where you don't know about 900 Americans and some other people from other areas not you know dying in a mass suicide Wow that's around the time you were born that's fascinating that it's why it makes sense though they're just so removed from it yeah do they um do they use agriculture like how they get in this Kasab they grow peppers and then they grow the cassava and the cassava like it's kind of amazing you know we always hear about slash-and-burn agriculture so they'll they'll go into a slash and burn in the spot on the jungle arm but it's like it's like a recycled sort of slash-and-burn agriculture and I'll break down what that means so go into an area and slash everything in burn just to clear though just so sunlight can make it through to the ground so chop the jungle down and burn everything then the cassava I guess that looks like big yams when you grow it you just take a stalk of an existing plant and just bury that stock in the ground and it'll sprout up a new crop and so you know you're close to the equator so you don't have seasons as much there's some seasonal variation they do have times that they do have like they are wet season and dry season but it's like you always get about the same amount of Darkness is daylight and they don't have the wild fluctuations that we have in the temperate zone so they can grow year round and they stage it so you know you have a crop that's coming in you have a crop that will be coming in three months you have a crop that will be coming in six months you have a crop that be coming in nine months and once you get a certain number of cycles I can't member how many cycles you get off piece of ground you let the ground go feral give it a few years and then come in and burn it again also intermittently every time you plant cassava you before you replant you make a little fire and burn some debris in that same spot no irrigation you're not watering it at all um and that's the only fertilize you're giving it is you're burning some of the surrounding just to try to scraped up from the jungle floor that you burn there and grow it and it is a staple of life that in a river Fish and Game it's just such a wild thing that it's such a poisonous plant I don't get it I don't get it there's other stuff that there's other poisons that are extracted like people that people that people in South America in the jungles people that use blow darts so people the hunt with blow guns it's generally understood like even talking to even talking to the Micucci you hunt with bows and arrows I ask them like why don't you guys hunt with blow darts blow guns and he explained me we don't need to because we have arrow plant which gives arrows now if you were in this other area you know more up in the mountains and there's no arrow plant then you'd hunt with a blow dart so is arrow plant just a plant that makes like a shaft like makes the arrow with it what is it what is that type it's like a cane what you know it looks it looks it's like a it looks like a palm in the palm leaf puts out these long pieces in one one of those is ready you cut it green and then they can make an arrow in no time so you go out the jungle find this piece and you're like like like up you know like one of the theories on how we domesticated plant species would be that it was a very gradual unintentional domestication where you would go out but just take something simple like let's see a lot of raspberries okay you go out and you gather raspberries and you bring them home and you eat them to your home and then people are eating these seeds and shitting these seeds out and pretty soon there's a lot more grass berries growing around your home village just for the simple fact that you always bringing the seeds home and discarding them around in creating it so they have except for manioc which people don't even really I don't think it's really well understood what it came from it's been domesticated for a long time all the plants they use are widely available in the jungle but tend to also have some around home to that they've brought home and planned a nearby or they just grow up there now because they've been bringing the stuff into their village for so long so arrow plant is readily available um they cut the arrow shaft green and it looks like just a green dowel but it has some curvature to it then they'll come home and they start a fire and they heat the green thing just by turning it over the over the embers are over the flame twirling it and getting it hot it'll let off a little steam and then you bend it and then you twirl it and get it hot and bend it and you'll eventually make it well arrow straight then the they make four different kinds of arrows depending on what they're hunting for so let's say you were making a arrow to uh it gives me more so let's say you're making a big game arrow all right um in the big game they hunt would be Red Rocket deer white lip Packer eat is a favorite um collared peccary which we call javelina and sometimes tape here the the arrow they use for that so they would take that so let's say they're going to build one of those so they take that green shaft and straighten it the next step is they find a wood called bullet wood and they cut what would be like uh what's going to form the base of your tip the base your spear and that bullet would they fit into the end of the green shaft which is almost like it's on a picture to having the consistency of bamboo and they shove that bullet wood in there and it causes it forms like a base and to that they take an old machete blade that they cut out and file down to be about a four inch steel knife and that goes in to the bullet wood to forms the junction between the arrow shaft and the steel piece that's the only man-made material they use in their arrows then they take a plant that looks like yucca and they make their own string and they got little bits of rubber from rubber trees that they wax the string with and they put a bullet would knock in the part that your that your bowstring actually pushes on and that gets tied in to the arrow shaft and then they Fletch the arrow with feathers from gwon or black Chris al or crustless Caruso and that's what they Fletch their arrows with because they have they're very water-resistant so they're broad heads are made out of machete blades yeah and this is a recent innovation used to use wood and how long have they been doing it with machete blades in his lifetime it's always been they don't call me che they come cutlasses in Romans lifetime Romans 32 he's a kind of my main friend down there that hung out with both times I was down there in his lifetime he remembers people using he remembers people using wood blades which is made from like a bamboo like material so it'd be like a convex spear point cut out of bamboo and sharpened he remembers people using those but he had always used Cutlass blades hmm Wow not in Bolivia you'd see people who have core just using the old form there are other arrows when they make arrows for hunting birds and they make arrows for hunting fish the only man-made material on those arrows is hog wire fencing so basically wire fencing they snip out the hunks of wire smash it down til it's flat and then they can cut Barb's in there to hunt birds and hunt fish Wow the bow is it's not a laminate bow so they make a bow by just cutting a tree single piece a single stem tree shaving it down to what they're after and then take that same yucca plant pull out the fibers out of the yucca strands and make bow strings that goes very quickly as well like we made a bow string one day Wow yeah you just they would they you take the strands and twist it like imagine like you're rubbing your hands to warm them up you got all those strands in your hands and you roll them and it makes singles and it makes strands they're comprised of you know a dozen fibers then you start braiding up from there until you braid up a big long bowstring and that's how you string your bow so when they're shooting their bow like what's a long shot for them like 15 20 yards long shot long shot and the length of shot you're going to take sort of depends on um kind of depends on well they don't really think like the ideally like the you gonna wounded it's going to get away doesn't weigh on them very heavily right like in our culture and our hunting culture here we've come to like really uh the wound loss is something we do a lot to avoid okay there's a lot of talk where I Samba don't you know you shouldn't be surprised to get a good hit you should know what's going to happen don't take shots that are too far away right we really put a strong value on um when you let the arrow go or when you let the bullet go you damn sure know that you're going to have a quick clean kill well at least we put a lot of value on that in practice sometimes that stuff goes out the window but anyone would say that that's your goal uh not on their mind you seem take some Hail Marys right and they can shoot like if you're just if you're trying to shoot a bird all they're trying to do is get a warrior point so one of those arrows I described fitted with a long wire on the end cut out of a piece of steel fence with a barb with a couple barbs filed into it and that head is joined by string to the arrow shaft so that once the head makes contact the arrow shaft can fall away but there's a string connecting the arrow head the wire barb to the arrow shaft and that allows the tangle up up in the trees so when they shoot all they really need to do is prick that thing with that wire barb knowing that the bird or they hunt for a large aquatic rodents knowing that the bird is going to get tangled up in the trees overhead and that they can then climb up to go get it even then I think even shooting like that kind of thing were you just trying to prick the thing 30 yards be very long shooting fish you're not shooting that I mean shooting fish you're not really like bow fishing which I've done a lot of in my life a 10 yard bow fishing shot is very far yeah you're right above them right yeah because you're shooting down in the water now do they have you have to judge when you're shooting into the water you have to judge differently right the way diffraction unless that thing unless that fish is sunning unless that fish is sunning and it's back is at the surface of breaking the surface uh you need to account for refraction so you're aiming way low now if you got a fish that's a fish two feet below the water surface is extremely hard to hit because it's so deep you're aiming like you're aiming at your boot I know why me that feels like that you know you're aiming so low there's there's an equation so is low you're aiming way below the fish because refraction like anyone's ever taken a fishing pole stuck in the water right right you see the yeah yeah it hooks so that's like that's like the trick of bow fishing but were they both fish for some of the stuff my favorite thing the bow fish down there is also you're also dealing with current and there again they're shooting a hollow arrow that doesn't weigh shit it doesn't cut through the water at all so they're holding way low for refraction and holding way upstream because their arrow is so buoyant oh wow now an American bow fishing rig which I shoot has a fiberglass arrow so the current isn't as much of an issue because that arrow is so heavy that it can cut through the water but refraction is the same so that's why a point-blank shot bow fishing is still very difficult and then you got a factor that you still need to hit the thing pretty good in a place where the arrow is not going to pop out there's a fish Sabo hunt for that they use the bow hunt for for salted fish called the arapaima and air prime is the biggest freshwater fish in the world well basically the sturgeon yeah the largest freshwater fish the largest okay the largest scaled yet an arapaima is the largest scaled freshwater fish how big is it well I mean they'll get up into the hundreds of pounds I've never heard of it it looks like it's it's this scale stir a are a Pai oh my god yeah that's an arapaima Jesus Christ that looks completely prehistoric they have a bizarre relationship with these fish in the Micucci do in guyana so that's amazing I used to hunt I'm looking critter they used to hunt him to export the salted meat based on him to sell salted meat to markets okay now uh one of those is worth $7,000 to them alive holy shit that's how much that's how much a white guy will pay to catch one and let it go oh my god yeah oh so it's a guy by a month a guy will pay more the Micucci will make more to take a guy out to catch an arapaima and let it go than what you'd pay to hunt for elk in the US on a guided trip holy shit they get seven grand to catch an arapaima and when Rovin was a kid they would go on to week hunting trips where they're gone for two weeks with their father they would go for two weeks to hunt salt fish so they were if they were operating out a dugout canoes that they would have to paddle and they would paddle it would make a dugout canoe themselves paddle the dugout canoe upriver for a week to get to the good hunting and fishing grounds then they would hunt and fish for one week until they would get 100 pounds of salted fish then you'd go back downriver which would take a day or two days and then get to the mouth of the Rupununi River and paddle up the Rupununi River for two days to another town and then they would haul the salt fish including arapaima flesh and sell that 100 pounds of salted fish for 75 US dollars so 2 weeks plus work for a family for 75 dollars and now they will not touch those fish because they make a handful of people every year go down and give them 7 grand to catch one let it go so 7 grand to them must be just an enormous it's changed everything when I was talking about like that they discovered sunglasses shit there's been a lot like they were already onto this air paya thing the first thing I went down and it's changed everything about it's changed that village the arapaima fishery the way they use the hunt arapaima is there to hunt them out of trees they would so you're familiar like when a river you know a river flows in a s pattern like a repeating essence now and then uhm during high water a river will jump one of the esses you picture I'm saying yes so the river jumps an ass and it abandoned in the main channel abandons the curves of the s ok those curves become what's called oxbow lakes where during high water during a flood those oxbow lakes are connected to the main river system when the water goes low the oxbow lakes become a isolated arapaima has live in those oxbow lakes and they feed on peacock bass and other stuff so when the water got low and the arapaima 's were all kind of restricted to very small little spots in the river they would climb up in trees overlooking these places and wait for the arapaima to come up near the surface and shoot it with an arrow there was a detachable basically the harpoon head arrow and shoot it with the arrow the harpoon head would detached from the arrow and the arrow would flow on the surface connected by string to the arrow shaft you would then go take a hand line with a hook and follow that fish in your dugout canoe until you could cast your hook out and catch your arrow and then you're connected by your fishing line chew your arrow and your arrow is connected by the tether to the harpoon head and you would hand line in and slaughter the arapaima Jesus and then dry the arapaima with salt and then a still of salt fish day like when we're out fishing there's salt and fish all the time they would salt that fish and then sell it and then that became an endangered the other thing they would hunt for is they would hunt for giant river turtles and sell the meat and I'm greatly depleted because their whole lives occur on this one River and once those market influences came in and they had moved beyond subsistence hunting and fishing and they moved into market hunting and fishing they did with the same thing that we did to our own country in the late 1800s and early nineteen hundred's as they were on course to entirely deplete the resource through market demands because their village gets more and more people all time it grew considerably in the five or six years between my two visits and their environment just couldn't support that level of market hunting so this arapaima thing cut is giving gives them a way to make money to buy staples and run a school and stuff like that it gives them kind of out and it's funny because uh I'm a lot more interested like personally I'm a lot more interested in a guy shooting fish off a tree and salting the meat than I am a dude like me going down to catch an arapaima and let it go so in some ways it's sad yeah it's sad just because like it's not say it's right - they're saving the fishery but you see like just it's sad to see shit change man why did they let it go why don't they give it to the people that live there so they could use it for the meat they let it go so they can catch it again mm-hmm because they want to make sure that the population stays yapping so Rovin what here's the thing the reason had one of those oxbow lakes got lower and lower and lower and someone real one of their got one of these Micucci guys realized there's 26 arapaima stranded in an oxbow lake and their prime is running out of water and when the water goes down the air pine will excavate he'll keep excavating in the bottom to even just save a little spot for himself okay and a guy found them and they're all in there but there's not enough water to cover them up they can sip air is the thing that makes them pewter so you can always find arapaima because they come up the goal bare Jesus yes the real air and also a very loud noise they make when they come up to gulp air so they can live in low oxygen environments like if you took most fish and threw them in a stagnant Oxbow that's got six inches of water in it I mean they're dead as shit right these air pylons they can just keep excavating a little spot in the bottom and just wait praying or their equivalent of praying that the water level comes back up and liberate them from the Ox boulders then these are huge fish yeah Giants so they found 26 that were out of the water and their backs were all messed up from birds and other predators grabbing the aera trying to grab the arapaima and then they went and spent four days these are 26 air primers between 50 inches and upper 80s in length they spent four days moving these 26 air piya's into the river in a canoe full of water Jesus Christ that's how valuable fish are - now in the old days they'd been dead as shit right man like you sold yeah so they really just like a finite they have like on the river the river they call home the river they kind of control there's like a finite resource but the thing is other groups so they're mostly Micucci in my friend Romans come Micucci arm his wife is whopper Shauna and there are other Wow Shawna's in other places who will come down to hunt their area and they have very different like these other groups that come in have different hunting practices like Rovin was telling me one time that he was going up so the largest snake in the world is green anaconda the river has the largest thing in the alligator family which is a black caiman some people say oh it's not a true alligator but the largest member of that how big Emilia black caiman yeah they get big you know they can they get bigger like American alligator big like oh yeah Effie yeah yeah they get joints some black caimans do there used to be a market for those they used to market hunt those for the hides for bags boots and shit so they have the giant river otter which is a river otter like way that you know up you know river otters go 200 pounds they have the biggest snake the green anaconda they had the largest aquatic rodent in the world the largest freshwater scaled fish by some definitions the largest eagle which is the harpy eagle the Philippine eagle has a bigger wingspan but some like when you measure by weight the harpy from there and then there's another harpy that's a giant like the poeple in the Papua New Guinea harpy the harpies at one that eats sloths and monkeys monkeys and shit yeah he's like some bad we saw one really so I've been down in harpy country three times that finally saw my first harpy wow that just like it's such a stick just piercing kind of unforgettable just the face on it the male the male face you're looking at it it just is like a so it remind me the first time I saw Lynx we're just looking at it and it's just so freakishly different than anything you'd looked at like that harpies face so they have that um oh so he's going up the river he's tell me the story how the whop Hashanah will come down and hunt the hunt different than the Micucci like the Micucci aren't that big on killing tape here's but the whopper Shawna will come down in their area he says they come down with arrows that got 12 inch steel tips on them he's like you know those boys are hunting tape hears but he said one time he was going up when he sees a green anaconda and he goes to look and it's got a Arrowhead stuck into it and he said and I told my companion the whopper Shawn I are here and they go up the river little bit of course they come to a whopper Shana camp because the Waukesha knee said they'll he's like talk about this particular does Waukesha nose all over he's like this particular group a whopper Shawn is it travel ahead of Christmas because he's there like they have animist you know mystical systems but they also it's also infused as a certain level of Christianity so ahead of Christmas the wah shun will go on a couple month long hunting trip to get food for Christmas celebrations well and they'll travel overland and buy a river to come down and hunt the Micucci river and when they come down there they're there playing for keeps so they come down there hunting arapaima which these which the Reba Micucci do not they're hunting anacondas they hunt everything they eat the anacondas yeah they dry all that shit and the fat they like to render the fat down because they feel that it is helpful for they feel that it's helpful for arthritis we pulled up on a we pulled up on an anaconda one time that was 13 or 14 feet long sure just sitting on the bank you can walk up you can walk right up to it Rovin was telling me again a type of like mysticism we have our own beliefs that would seem absurd right to an outside perspective but he was telling me if I were to touch that anaconda with my bow it would die a very painful death if I just laid my Bolam on it and about how long he thought about telling me at about 45 minutes just a belief they have if you touch it with a hunting bow it will die in 45 minutes but it's painful bizarre no XD I asked about that a thousand times never got any more clarity on it than that I said can you hook touch it with a stick it doesn't matter go ahead touch it with a bowl will die so but yeah they don't eat it but he was telling me if you're really hard up and have really bad arthritis you can take the fat from an anaconda and help cure the arthritis how much fat does an anaconda I don't know I never caught it I never cut into one I've seen a rattlesnake skinned they'd seem like they don't have any fat you got our saying how big these things are though they're so big I mean way bigger new leg yeah what's 14 feet long 14 feet long was probably weighs hundreds of pounds right oh yeah no hundreds of pounds if you eaten rattlesnake yeah it's not bad right it's that good besides that sucker yeah there's there's a good one Jesus that's a heavy fucker yeah those guys struggling for dudes struggling oh that's out of Guyana did you ever see that movie with Jennifer Lopez nope anaconda it's a giant one like yes let's make a snake and uh they'll eat caimans anacondas well yeah yeah and then Caymans leaked them and they're younger yeah you know it's a vicious amount of everything eating everything um so these these gentlemen the Micucci come down no the Whopper xalapa Shawna yeah and have different hunting practices and different things that are acceptable to eat and they have and this is like a group of whop Hashanah so is this a show where the hunting and fishing Sox are going after each other no that was a different story okay now it snows it was another pissing match with someone else so um so they're not oh are you sauce what's that they're hunting area sucks did this group of wop Hashanah come down to rape and pillage on the riwa uh yeah roben explained me their hunting areas of piss-poor rotten area so why do they stay there I don't know I don't know why they stay there hmm and I asked him liked as it got does it make you guys mad did they come down because now the like the people in Rio village but the predominantly Micucci Riva village um is on to a they're on like a pretty progressive conservation program like they can just date through their market hunting practices they got a glimpse into the future and didn't like what they saw and they're on a pretty aggressive program about sustainability their eyes toward the future the wop hashanah are this group of wop Hashanah or not and when I asked them does it piss you off that the wop hashanah come down here oh they also the wop hashanah fish with poison Micucci don't fish with poison do they use the poison from the cassava no they use a poison they use a there's a root in a leaf that are both poisons the root it's in the thing used here in the United States when they have to do a fish kill like if you get a big population of invasive fish in a waterway and you just need to like wipe the whole thing clean heads yes shit like that when you're trying to do a fish kill we in the u.s. use a thing called Ronin it's derived from a South American plant and then there's another plant called bar Bothwell some people some you know it's like different people in different areas and the amazon drainage is a thing they call bar bosco and that is a leaf that you just pull and it would look like you're just like taking if you just magic a bunch of thyme or rosemary and put it in a mortar and pestle and pulped it and then you take and spread that in the water that'll kill fish both of the I think they kind of they act in two separate ways there's two types of fish poison one inhibits the fish's ability to pull oxygen from the water so I watch them apply this poison and you need to get area there's not much current because it'll just wash the poison away so you get into one of these oxbow lakes apply the poison kickback twenty minutes and pretty soon all the fish are up gulping at the surface and then you shoot them with bows and arrows Wow um what's the other way of doing an drone on and I came over which category wrote nine Falls and there's another one that has some kind of like it's some kind of neuro effect it has some kind of brain and somehow impairs some other aspect of their body but these fish poisons are classed into categories I'm sorry I'm not more clear on the store that you are but I know that the ones that just did prevent it from be able to get air and the other one case that the poison them the ones that don't suffocate them does that come up when they eat it no but they're telling me that that um if that you need to watch your if you're poisoning a pond you need to watch it make sure dogs or any livestock don't come down it doesn't last long and they were telling me usually the fish you don't shoot will recover if there's some amount of water flowing through it so they might go in and build a temporary dam to block whatever Inlet let's just say it's a it's a isolated channel off to the side of a river they'll go in and pretty carefully with rocks and logs block the flow coming into it poison it and then once they've gotten whatever they want they unblock it and let the clean water come in and it will resuscitate the fish whoa but yeah if if they said of livestock dogs people drink that water can kill that it can kill that how many do they lose people every year to that cassava water man in talking to me realize they lose there's like a handful things that people get lost to um they had mentioned people dying from anacondas they'd mentioned people dying from black caimans I know that injuries from piranhas are common snakebite snakes are everywhere in one of these I remember sitting in Robyn's friend's house his outdoor like a palapa kind of house you know with hammocks strung in it there just being a giant tarantula like a two and a half inch diameter tranche Allah and um not even doing anything to it which Rachael is they just hurt yeah they hurt they don't really fuck you up like a black widow or something along those yeah before we found a kid who'd been hit by a scorpion young kid and I'm some scorpions can be fatal he was vomiting he was very sick but just a fact of life so when they get bit by snakes are they getting bit by poisonous snakes yeah there's one I think the most debt the deadliest snake Western Hemisphere the coral they have they have all the ones he mentioned their chief getting hit by a by a venomous snake and them have to call a medevac which is not in the air for I think the Air Force came in with a helicopter a while and got him out of there and he was fine Wow just a fact Allah it that shit's everywhere man but they got a eye for it and you don't like like you're like you guys you know the not the non-locals eyes the one getting stung and bitten shit yeah I can only imagine like the first I was down there I got hit by an electric eel a couple times right that scared the shit out of me but it's like you don't even know what's happening you're in the water and Alston you're kind of getting out electrocuted there's more in tune with all that stuff that's a strong blast yeah it hurts we have those on fear factor plated rabbim it's like grab the barbel it's like grabbing a hot wire it's amazing that an animal or a living thing can generate that kind of so you just did it voluntarily for a joke just to see what it's like yeah it's not fun no I was shocked that sounds like it's probably just annoying but I reached in and grabbed it was like whoa yeah that's legit yeah it's like it's like grabbing a hot wire fence yeah with Catiline yeah I watched there was some sort of a nature documentary where something tried to eat it and the electrical eel zapped it you see this animal just lock up and fall over sideways all right yeah just held it yeah I just just completely electrocuted it yeah you know got it to the point where it just couldn't stand up have you yeah yeah I know you like uh you pull off some stuff have you seen the video of the Jaguar killing the caiman yes I've seen a bunch of that solid shit right there anything cuz you get a sense he's done that a thousand yes there's a disc quite a few of them online and here's what's what's fascinating what is this that came in with electric eel an alligator an electric eel oh wow it starts just frying yeah it's just cooking really yeah Wow no that's not oh you asked about eating snakes electric eel me is not good that's one of the many things that the that's one of the many things the Micucci like do not eat look at his body just twitching god that's amazing obviously that's a little alligator but still boy what a crazy animal that's brutal I never saw anything about Jaguars killin Caymans until about three or four years ago and there's like a whole slew of these videos came out this makes you wonder I guess maybe the advent of GoPros and all these different video cameras that people take down there and finally started catching it on film yep we missed the sighting bike we miss deciding you know narrowly missed the sighting we were down there tracks are everywhere so particularly because the time I was just down there now um the giant river turtles are nesting so they just like how we have you know just how you picture sea turtles crawl up onto a sandy beach and dig a hole that night and lay their eggs and then retreat back into the ocean um giant river turtles lay like that but so the sandbars are covered in busted turtle shells and there are vultures so like black vultures and king vultures and caracaras are on the sandbars feeding on turtle eggs and Jaguar tracks all over because the Jaguars come down to wait for the turtles to come up Wow so you've seen a lot of that and one of the more surreal that's a perspective shot but I bet they're pretty big right big with us that's the oceanic that's not a joke oh look at that sucker so how old is that fucker I have no idea God doesn't they live hundreds of years right yeah they're ancient that thing might have been around when Columbus was around you know the the Ru for the site east treaty so uh things that ban international wildlife traffic they have there's a couple turtles of the Micucci eat um they traditionally ate giant river turtles and many people still do but they call that one the site east turtle oh wow things they now know they can't traffic in this early more so they got like the eating turtle in the site ease turtle but image will be it forever burned in my mind there's two things at all that there's two like sites that'll ever forever be stuck in my mind one of them is a a whopper Shana woman in a dko DKNY t-shirt up to her armpit in a riverbank digging out 150 turtle egg giant river turtle turtle eggs putting them in a handmade woven basket Wow because you know like clothes like donated clothes like cast-off clothes wind up you know getting bundled so you see people with like crazy American t-shirts and stuff on we're like I have like a Bob's Pizza Santa Cruz California or whatever you know and it's just like something sent down there through goodwill donation centers whatever so they'll have like um like brands you know like like famous brands you see like people you know an arc and our culture wearing but they'll be like honey monkeys in them and like the laggers thing it creates that kind of tension you know so do they recognize the sight ease like regulations do they did they not eat those turtles yeah so you gather this kind of loose they don't traffic in them but they will eat them but they will eat them yeah so they will collect the eggs but they won't kill the turtles to sell so as they become more aware of conservation like with this giant fish what's official again the arapaima as if they become more aware of conservation do you see them like recognizing like hey there's some stuff that we have to leave alone we've got to let it recover I mean they obviously they're aware of the cycle of life when it comes to their slash-and-burn agriculture and leaving spots alone like are they becoming more aware of like what animals they've kind of pushed to the brink of extinction yeah and it's like I don't even know how much is coming from the younger generation because talking to guys thar new guy who's I'm 43 this guy just couple years older than I am and talking to him um and he was a market hunter he's glad to see what's happened because he in his own lifetime saw how much they had depleted everything so he in his lifetime saw like from market hunting not just from subsistence stuff but as that village grew because the village was a handful of families right then announced three hundred five people as that village grew he watched um the giant river otters they were hunting giant river otters to sell the hides into Brazil and um they would smoke them out of their dens so he watched their numbers go down this is a hundred pound otter yeah Wow freaking Giants just as the name would let you know and very vocal a large vocabulary of crazy sounds the giant river otters make they get when they see you they're pissed and they start making crazy to see them oh yeah you see them alternate squawk and I yeah like was it sound like it's like oh look a lot better net look at that sucker they're using some kind of snake or eel Wow yeah they make they have an alarm noise in a number of barks and crazy sounds uh so he watched those get depleted from hide hunting giant river turtles from hunting eggs he said he could see that the arapaima 's were disappearing and so he was really glad um this guy was really glad they'd gotten onto some other way to bring some cash into the village Wow and the arapaima fishing how do they find out about this like people from the United States or like where are they coming from you know I'm not sure you know I know that there's been a number of companies um Costa you know the sunglasses company mm-hmm Costa invested pretty heavily through a conservation program they have Costa sunglasses invested pretty heavily in helping them establish a guiding system down there to take people out to fish arapaima so these people that come down trained some of the Micucci and I'll just deal with Westerners like for instance in the time and we were out just we were out when I'm with them on the river we're out I'm with them participating in the hunting and fishing activities they do year-round on the things that they identify to be sustainable resources because they still like they still hunt several days a week right Rovin they live off Fish and Game everyone in that village all their protein is hunting and fishing protein and some chickens that they raise but that's all their protein so they're engaged in a daily sense that Rovin says he spends about two days a week farming he spends two or three days a week hunting and fishing and then he has other obligations yet is take care of but he hunts and fishes constantly year-round and it just if he kills a white lip pakery he says that's good for a week did you bring your bow yeah I brought my bow fishing bow and I brought a regular bow now when they saw your bow were they like Jesus can you get us some of these you know surprisingly not that excited about it because I think that they know they would run up against sourcing problems with the air roving got a at one point time roving had a recurve um but he lost at his house burnt down any losses recurve anyways so just for the simple fact you can make them and make arrows very quickly they don't need to worry about height eversource parts but but they have all this other stuff like machete blades and all these different things it seems like they would I mean if you get a good compound bow Jesus Christ I think if you brought one down and left it there um I think you brought one down left there or get a lot of use it will under a bluey would it be too effective like would they run into problems with you know like they have kind of a sustainability issue right I'll say yeah I think that if you went down um this is speculation I would think if you went down and gave if you head down with a dozen of these things and left them there um I think that along that river corridor you would see a diminishment of a handful of bird species for sure yeah we think because it but birds but here's the thing here's why it's a little bit tricky because I think that you would also be reducing demand because one of the things about the birds the guan's and corrosives is that they want them to fledge arrows but they're hard to get so they really want them because they liked they classify them under this broad category here in other places called poies and basically it's like edible like a term some people say poies refers to a specific curse ow but some people use poies like like a like turkey like bird like a turkey meaning a good edible bird so the birds that they fledge arrows with are also coveted food items all right I would I feel that yet if you were to bring conventional archery tackle in you would see that diminished now other people will have shotguns but the limiting factor there is how expensive the ammunition is so they'll have like the shotgun shell mm they might have a handful of shotgun shells that would last them a long time because they'll only use when absolutely necessary like the village a but they've been having a Jaguar problem when we were there they had over the previous two months lost twenty four dogs including a dog while we were there - a Jaguar who comes in at night and kills dogs and chickens he was speculating that at some point in time they will probably have to get rid of that Jaguar and that it would be a firearm issue they would have to like figure out a solution for with a firearm so even people that might have a firearm um have limited ammunition and it's sort of a legal tricky spot in a legal situation for them to have a firearm but beause I think they would knock the shit out of her sails and guan's if they had good bows but then might not hunt them as have Lisa didn't need the fletching for fishing I think their tackle superior close to superior for bow fishing why is that um because the shots are so close just isn't really necessary like it's like it's not it's just not necessary to have that kind of investment and you just tend to lose arrows bow fishing so it wouldn't make sense to have very expensive fibreglass aerials when you can make an arrow in 15 minutes 20 minutes yeah that makes sense and then you're still limited to very close range shots um the like when I was in Bolivia where they hunt for a bigger variety of stuff including monkeys uh bows would be again like like compound bows be a real game-changer on monkey huntin so they're not monkey huntin and they won't touch really that here's the couple there's a couple things are really hard to talk earlier saying like you have this large reveals have like good conversations in English and get your aunt's your questions answered right some things you really uh you hit a wall okay now one of the things you hit a wall on is if you say to someone like how many days out of the year would you guess you do X it's just like you never get there you never get there they not understand years no they do it's just like because we speak in that way it's hard for me to understand why that's such a hard question but you it would be very hard to get satisfactory answers about how often do you do something another thing is if like how much do you like like do you like hunting or fishing more isn't something that's thought about because it'd be like a big do you like to hunt more or farm more you have to do both so it's not like the luxury that we had but what do you like but I don't you have to do both you can't just do one but he was telling you he hunts two days a week he farms two days a week so yeah family me like asking the same question a thousand times and finally kind of getting finally kind of getting to a spot because they catch it because one time I push them and push them and push them how many days a year do you hunt fish and we talked about this for forever and he came up with the figure maybe 200 or 250 then later I'm like how many days a week do you hunt and fish and I asked him that a thousand times and got two now we do the math one of those numbers is wrong it's just not and also like what you like most do you like this most like that most another thing is why don't you eat X right but if I think about it if imagine if someone came from another country to here and you're driving them around and every single thing they see that's alive if they said you why don't you eat that right Maji dead spider right I don't know bro we just don't eat the spiders why don't you eat that cat that's a really complicated question like uh we don't eat house cats let me count the reasons why we don't eat house cats you know so why don't you eat monkeys he's not like Oh silly we don't need monkeys because it's just like we Stoney monkeys but they don't have any weird relationship with monkeys right now the more I press them on it wanna be and he would say because we have so many fish and they're so easy to get uh but you hunt white lip peccary now white lip peccary it would for folks who don't know and does that look like a javelina as well yeah so it's a little bigger than having the main difference from from a human a human perspective looking on the tube what you would what what you would jump at is the gregarious nature of the white lip peccary so there's three pack razors like the cheek owen i think it choco and peccary which i've never laid eyes on white lips and collared and the collared peccary a dozen is a giant group of collared peccary that's like a big-ass group of collared peccary and that's what we have in that sucker yeah that's we have in West Texas Arizona parts New Mexico right so it's essentially the same thing as a humble in the collared peccary is the javelina same exact thing the white lip pakery November I said like a dozen is a bunch red collards javelina I've hunted those in the US and I wanted those in in Mexico white lapak real run in a group of 100 to 200 whoa and white lip peccaries miles mentioned in cassava white lip peccaries are hell on cassava patches they eat them they come and eat the stalks not the root they'll destroy the cassava patch and they'll dig but they particularly like to eat this they're coming and they like to eat the young shoots growing up now can they eat the cassava the root or is it poisonous to them as don't know I don't know huh um that's a good question I wish out to ask that I would if I had a week I'll get a satisfactory answer that so the white lip peccaries will come into the village and raise holy hell everyone running grabs their bows and na start shooting and then they'll chase them into the jungle and maybe even track them for a day trying to whittle away at them because it's a great meat it's like the favorite game meat is white lip a curry they like a better than collared peccary because they're bigger but it's like a pork or something like that we over they had a scent gland so they're very yet looks like pork has a very strong off-putting the animal has a very strong off-putting smell but the meat doesn't know if you handle it properly and keep it clean it's never it would never be regarded like as as good as pork to the American palate but to the Micucci palate it's the best hmm so their whole thing like we don't hunt all these animals various animals because we have so many fish flies out the window with white lip peccary but a lot of the white lip pakery hunting is also related to the protecting of crops now as long as roving can remember riwa village has had a group of white lipped peccaries that would come through the area trying to raid the gardens and when it came through the area raid in the gardens they would kill some number of them and then they would track them into the jungle and stick with them and kill a handful and it was when that happened was a very good thing they liked the peccaries there's been a number of years where no peckers or something happened to this group of one or two hundred peccaries they have it for years they have not been through the village it's not attrition because he was saying at the most when we get when they come through and get us he would say on average we would get actually kill between one and four when they come in and hit the crops if we stick with them and a group of guys goes after me might kill between one and four and there's 200 of them so it's like it's not like that like slowly whittled away at him right they just would never account for that but they vanished Rover never wanted to explain to me why they vanished but event I kept pestering about it eventually he told me here's the deal since Rio village is now so wealthy and we have so much food other groups and other villages have grown very jealous of us and he told me that a shaman in another village got so insanely jealous ari was prosperity through fishing for arapaima and through all the good hunting and fishing that they have there that he got so jealous that he um locked up the dis shaman locked up their peccaries he doesn't know where perhaps in the mountains they're locked up now getting them out is getting them unlocked is difficult because at the time that this shaman locked up their peccaries they happen to be without a good shaman in their village they have a bad shaman yeah they have a shaman entrain mom his his trick is a young shaman in training and his powers are slow to develop so what happened the old guy don't know this guy's powers have been slow to develop he's getting there and soon he will hopefully be in a position to unlock the pakery know what's a young shaman is it like a young president I don't know look I didn't mean a hoe does not really like we brought up wanting to go talk to him arm got the sense that was the best idea to go visit with him really yeah gosh like 300 people in the villain 305 Wow God got in and I brought up a number times just got the sense that it wasn't the greatest idea to go talk to so is there theatrics involves this guy like living on the outskirts of town no he was in town but now claims mystery yes oh here's a handful things that was said like Rome was telling me and in it and I wanna say man uh I do not like if I'm here okay if you told me something that I thought was outlandish I would fucking jump on you right and I'd be like that's ridiculous right now that desire to like be right and to dispel uh wrongness like I don't have a lick of that shit when I'm talking to these guys right right I'm never like well I don't buy that right it's just like it's so inappropriate right feeling right and it's so interesting to me and also give such interest glimpse into how most cultures and societies were structured long time in pre-christian times right that it's just like it's just educational so I'm not in any way I'm never saying like well I don't buy that I'm just saying like oh okay right that's great thanks for sharing so magic yes I'm not in any way I'm never like but here's some things were explaining if you're having a problem or your your archery skills go downhill like you have a few misses the way to correct that would be to go up and take the hand hold the bowstring and punch a beehive and then hold your hand up to that hive because they don't miss and you will find you will they will demonstrate their accuracy when they bombard you and Rovin was saying that most of them even know to hit you between your fingers where it really hurts you will then absorb that accuracy in your hand and you will do a lot better shooting huh and the more you can do this throughout your life the stronger it will make you it's also helpful just even with kids northing is also helpful to be hit by like a bullet ant for instance um I had a hat me before and it's awful but to get hit by a bullet ant to absorb some of that ant strength but this shaman that fucked up their peccaries could also just be jealous of you and strip your ability to shoot accurately and what I want to point out the Roman has an email address Wow yeah you can email I email with them Wow and he's affirming his beliefs you know this is also also yeah but it also rational it's he seems fairly rational outside of this it listen it's like I'm torn even talking about it because like I don't want it like I'm talking about because because I have such a own a love for him as a person uh that I won't want to say they would make that would like dispel that idea like did he that he's not like that he's not perfect I would go anywhere with this guy extremely capable but you're talk about just like some long-held beliefs so their cultural belief systems are just deeply ingrained and there's probably some sort of a placebo effect attached to all this we're sure they've seen it in effect yes someone has cast through it what is a there's a some point angles those peccaries gonna come back into town yeah and then what we read it fall they'll probably say the shaman is relaxed like rip awesome all right a new shaman or someone want to credit it's just a way of explaining the volatility here's everything here's the other thing like like you know you could go well let me give me exact I'm gonna make a point about the way um to sort of see a culture in transition right because it's always so relative but uh the right there's a writer's a staff writer The New Yorker oh my favorite journalist of all time John Lee Anderson you might be freer this book che like he wrote sort of the definitive Che Guevara book che arm he's a war correspondent right slink troubled spots around the country around the world John Lee Anderson he wrote a piece that log on in The New Yorker about a group of people that we had just made that were were making first contact with the outside world just recently 2015 uh they had been they were regard they were initially regarded as an uncontacted group that lived in the border between Peru and Brazil in the jungle and for whatever reason they started coming out to a main river where they were having some contact with other groups and they killed a couple people both so the government was in a situation of when dealing with the first contact group you can't go in and just start putting people on trial and shit like it only leads to more problems so they were trying to it's an article about the difficulties of leading of introducing of first contact peoples into sort of constructive engagement with the outside world a trick there is some people look and they have some countries have a policy of isolation for uncontacted people and try to enforce isolation other theorists on this or other anthropologists think that's completely unfair that it's the most human of tendencies is to find other humans and swap ideas with them right it's like it's you it would be laughable that I would come to you and say Joe I'd like to prevent you from meeting the French les some aspect of Frenchness rub off on you right now they're worried about other things too but they're worried about like disease and stuff but also a tendency to alcohol can be destructive being lured into prostitution all forms of exploitation trying to protect people from this then which are also the romance of running into these uncontacted tribes that's a chance that some people yeah so some people say those photos that they took from the helicopter where they see these people they're covered in war paint they're pointing arrows at the helicopter it's amazing and that's the shit that I'm guilty of right because even though that that's what I was gonna lead up this thing or that this battle I have in my own mind right that even though I mean they are far far away they're you know far far removed from a first contact people don't even like I said the guys got an email address I'm not trying to paint this something it's not right but at the same time they make their bows from raw material out in the jungle and hunt and fish for all their protein I love that shit so much and I like laying in but if you told me you can never go back I want to lay in bed thinking about that occurring right mmm I want to lay in bed thinking about a guy having a problem with his shaman because it's just so refreshing and like like like mentally exhilarating to doesn't know that that's going on so you get caught in this kind of uh you get caught in this kind of it's almost like the OP it's like the opposite of colonialism or something where you call this thing of wine to be like all these precious cute people if I could just keep them like how I like where they stir my imagination yeah you know I just want them to stay like how they arcs thats how i like them like when i come down to visit i like to know that they're all doing the shit that's interesting to me but they're in no way are they perceiving their experience in that way but you go down and see like in the handful years as much they change all the time right in the handful of years to see that just like practices are different dress is different clothing very different so you're just seeing it happen you're seeing any real time it happened in a fast way now you might come up and be like oh I was in the US and the pre-internet days and I came to the US and the post-internet days and um and man is that place different but you're watching it like wherever you live you're also seeing that happen to so you're living that transition but to go to there and then come back five years later uh and see things different it really um yeah man it fucking like as much as I hate to admit and as wrong as it is but just be like absolutely upfront bit like a kind of bummed me out so you talk about when you talk about from a honey perspective I tend to view the world through a hunting-and-fishing perspective we talk about bringing bows my first thought is ass no fun they shouldn't do that because I like watching them hunt with the homemade bows right no it's it's totally rational and it completely makes sense yeah it's just it's as lying for nostalgia and then you find it you find it as it's changing you know as much as you know about the American West as much as you told me about the history of American West in the Native Americans to see these people that are essentially like in some ways like the Native Americans before the colonial people arrived yeah or like I guess the it would be this is a bold statement if there's an anthropologist or historian listening they're gonna pull their hair out but it would maybe would be like I'm so hesitant even throw this out just dream the approximate and full of holes and full of contradictions but some kind of post contact scenario and I don't know like let's say it was the 1890s or something right here the firearm was very much part of stuff you know but yeah this is like um but you know it's it makes it's complicated Internet age but at that time you definitely we had definitely established a form of tourism in the American West right there yeah by the you know I mean well before the Francis Parkman so you Francis part Moses figure he wrote the definitive history of the French and Indian War but in 1842 he was a historian he had health problems in 1842 he did a tourism trip out on to the Great Plains he met some fur trappers some mountain men he traveled with the Iguala Sioux uh Crazy Horse who probably wasn't Crazy Horse yet he was his name Curley as a kid crazy whore he was in crazy or like The Three Stooges yeah I think that I think that was like a name for money no and have no idea what it meant huh before he adopted the name Crazy Horse um he would have been 13 years old and Francis Parkman traveled with them as a tourist and they went into the Black Hills of South Dakota they went in there to get lodgepoles because it was time um go and fit out their Lodge poles for their teepees to replace broken Lodge poles they went up in the Black Hills killed some big horn sheep by throwing rocks down on them off a cliff went shot a bunch of Buffalo and he was out there like as a tourist okay so tourism in the American West now yeah I met the last the last free roaming the last like non confined Plains Indians didn't get rounded up till depending on your definition 1876 1877 so he was out there way before that there was still like what they described at the time as hostile wild Indians were running around and he was traveling with them as a tourist so I just bring that up to bring this idea that here's this group of people who are very much in age and tourism like I was down there I was there because I wanted to go on a river trip I want and it's something I've done a handful times I wanted to go on a river trip and and and participate in their hunting and fishing and food gathering activities as they engage in them if I the same way they might engage if I wasn't there that's why we weren't fishing that's why we weren't catching air primers let them go so there's that and the Internet era but it's like this is that thing always returned - it's like you're still you're still hunting and fishing all your own food or growing it in your yard now when you guys went down there did you participate in the hunting and fishing or you just observe no participate in it you participated with their traditional tackle or did you use your own so I've done both I've hunted fish with my own bow and I've hunted fish with their bow and in the end I wound up the first time I went down I hunted fish the second time 204 fish so bow fished with um their gear but then it always felt like somehow funny too because like there's things that happen when you're watching like goofy uh you know watch like goofy survival shows and shit those eyes the part where the host you know grapples with how difficult it is to master ancient technologies but you're trying to just pick it up and do it from scratch okay broken has been shooting that bow at fish for he's 32 years old he's been shooting that bow at fish for let's say 27 years it is not an unusual thing to him alright so when you go pick it up me like man you got to give props to these guys should be able to kill fish this bow it's like well kind of and kind of not because if you spent 27 years doing something you're damn sure going to be good at it the same way is if you took someone like one of these first contact peoples from between Peru and Brazil and handed them my laptop and said hey pull up my gmail contacts from scratch he might be like man I got to give props to you guys I had no idea right which is the third yeah so that I have this conversation some of their day where you know the first time Daniel Boone in 1760 Daniel Boone went to the Cumberland Gap for the first time dropped down into what's now Tennessee in Kentucky and he stayed there hunting hides use a hide hunter stay there hunting hides for two years ran out of gunpowder made his own gunpowder and made it out of bat guano your own piss potash right you can cook this shit up right and make your own gunpowder Wow and I always look at that as being the epitome of woodsmanship and the fact that he could do it makes him seem otherworldly how do they what kind of formula do they have for how much piss how much bat guano it's just something they knew do you know that bat guano used to be something that was so cherished people would go to war for it yeah for explosive fucking incredible not just for explosive but also for fertilizer oh no yeah that's what the term batshit crazy like the third batch that people would fight for batshit yeah they would go nuts like that was so valuable that's where all the Buffalo bones went after the near extermination of the Buffalo really but the really good shit was bone china china tableware and everything else is fertilizer Wow yeah you could make the same some of the same characters that were involved in the slaughter involved in picking up the bones they're called bone Pickers picked up fertilizer but no I didn't know that about back well I had no idea that bone china yeah there's still bone china no kidding yeah I thought China was always like some sort of ceramic there's a place in Detroit on the on the road River Detroit that of the Rouge River Rogue River depending on what dude Michigan you're talking to um there's a place there called the Detroit carbon works that used to so you know when you're watching movies including the revenue you know that giant pyramid pile of Buffalo skulls that turns up and everywhere every book every movie that photo was taken at the Detroit carbon works and what they are producing was bone fertilizer Wow is there more than one of those photos whoa yes it's everywhere Wow can't escape that picture that's an incredible picture that's that's taken in Detroit Michigan where I'll point out was one of a handful of states that never had Buffalo in the history in his history there's no Buffalo mission so they were not extirpated out of know again there's knows were nicked up those bunk bones were picked up in the American West shipped by rail to Minneapolis Chicago Detroit turned into bone fertilizer and then shipped back out for people tilling up the great plains that folk go back to that photo again the photos so disturbing dude Wow how many skulls is that in my book about Buffalo I'm describing that picture and I say that the man standing on top is like an exclamation point at the end of a long sentence about death and destruction because I look at them it's like he somehow realizes the weirdness of what he's involved in but that was post extermination there's a crazy podcast from Dan Carlin on the the wrath of the cons on Genghis Khan and they described how the charisma in Shaw sends a group to check out gin China and they got there like about a year after Genghis Khan had killed everyone in the entire city over a million people and they thought what they saw in the distance they thought was a snow-capped Mountain as they got closer they realized it was a pile of human bones really yeah those guys were hardcore cool shit whatever now that's yeah Jonestown would've been nothing if they all a minor is like we would be like a car crash he changed the carbon footprint of the human race him during his time they don't know how many people they'd have to be population through depopulation cooking fires they believe they killed more than 10% of the population like Genghis Khan and his people through his orders killed more than 10% of the population of the world and wasn't he the number one land conqueror but just never held on anything well if your Congress wars in like that conquered more than Napoleon conquered more than Hitler but it didn't hold it I'm not sure about that I don't know about that but I know that they always lived in tents and they despised people that lived in homes they thought there were pussies the press thought that after their lot they prop out they're vulnerable too yeah probably right yeah I mean just anybody listening wrath of the cons it's a five-part series and I think Dan Carlin he charges for them you could buy it on iTunes but I think it's only $1 per and is the best doll you ever seen he's a world war 1 yes yeah and not sure what else he's done he's done a lot of I mean his podcast is just absolutely amazing he's incredible and super humble guy won't call himself an historian but meanwhile has the best history educational series you can get yeah it's a buck a buck apiece and they're like an hour and a half long and they're fucking incredible yeah he's uh he's a real treasure that guy doesn't call himself in his story because he doesn't use like primary source material or something just reads popular works I don't know why I mean I know he's who owns the name yeah who owns the definition he's just really humble yeah I know I mean but his main focus of study his entire life has been history you know and when he does these things well it's like what if he calls what he does at podcasts I need to change what I do yes I what I call a podcast is just so pales in comparison because we're just sitting here talking right now what he does is he prepares for these things for months and cites different sources and does lunches and then essentially does an educational entertainment piece yeah yeah maybe that's why he doesn't like the term historian is because he's not um he's not contributing he's not contributing to the body of knowledge he's interpreting the body of knowledge right maybe yeah that's a good point yeah maybe I think he's just super humble too he just wouldn't wouldn't say that no matter what but I've somehow it's I don't know why more disturbing to see a pile of human bodies then is to see a pile of the Buffalo bones yeah I think I told you um not talked abouts a thousand times what after the Custer Massacre the guys that that were following the other soldiers who were coming in after the Custer massacre they didn't know what had happened you know then got word yet that Custer and his entire command had been wiped out by the Sioux and Northern Cheyenne and and they're riding up the valley and they're looking off in the distance in there and there see all these sort of white bloodiest things and all these dark brown things and one of the guys wrote that their initial impression looking at it was that Custer must have caught the Indians in the middle of a buffalo hunt and what they were seeing was the summertime and they were seeing fatty Buffalo carcasses that had been skinned and that the brown things where the buffalo hides laid out next to the carcass but when on closer inspection it was the brown things were horses cavalry horses and the white things were stripped and mutilated soldiers the good image wasn't one of the guys one of the Native Americans that was in the Little Bighorn Walt you know whatever event wasn't he one of the guys who toured with Wild Bill many of them so they were they had killed American soldiers then they went on this entertainment tour yeah it would be as though it would be like this is a fucking risky comparison now I'm not even do it he's a Nazi no not not that I was gonna say the X is way different it would be like uh I'm not gonna say I don't want to make the comparison it will come back to haunt me I'll try think of something that would work it would be like a people that we now fought against later became a media celebrity yeah oh I guess they're kind of dealing with it right now in Colombia where the FARC right now that Colombia has struck a peace accord with the FARC and the FARC are entering into politics entering in the media fart commanders who spent their entire life fighting against the Colombian government many atrocities were traded back and forth they now come on the the Colombia equivalent of 60 minutes to do interviews Wow okay so it's like where you have an adversary that that hostilities end and the reconciliation is so complete and so quick that you can come you can become a media personality and this guy was a touring media personality so Gaul under quite a jungle guy right yeah Gaul who owned the expels name the the historian Evan s Connell Jesus G ALL and there's some photos of this guy right yeah there are photos of him see if you can find that Evan s Connell he was he was huge yeah and on the the novelist and who wrote sir my favorite coaster history he says that Gaul went through Custer's men like a wolf through sheep and um Jew yeah so hard looking man he someone asked how long it took how long that fight lasted he said it lasted about as long as it takes a hungry man to eat his dinner wow that is a hard looking gentleman right there yeah that face man so he toured all over the country people would pay to see him pay to get their photos taken with him Wow he did selfies selfies with people wow what a crazy thing that must have been so I had some mock war that they would do yeah they would come out and reenact the battle Wow yeah so you could go down and this would have been in your own lifetime the people who the families of the men killed at the Battle Little Bighorn could have gone down and got their photo taken with and paid to watch and interacted with the gentleman who likely clothed their father's head in with a tomahawk Jesus Christ we're not as like we all thought think about how much worse we are now right is that Buffalo Bill up there I don't know if that's Hickok yeah yeah that's him but that's from his show Wow Baltar we can say we're not that far removed oh no I'm just saying like we now think we've gotten to such a weird spot but yeah you want to point out that see people must have been a tad more forgiving at the time well there must have been much more used to death and murder yeah because it was so common and it's just it was so you know because you know you're doing it with hatchets and axes and guns that don't fire very well so you know at close range you're shooting people with muskets from and there's so much more violence then yeah yeah so much more death the fact that you grow up be so old now I never see a dead person is like just a new idea it is pretty crazy you know I got people my age has never seen a dead guy yeah well it's a real eye-opener when you see one there's a lot of people that I haven't even seen a dead animal to darkest it rattle off the dead people I've seen I'm burned in my mind how many dead people have I seen yeah not ten you know what have you seen dead people from I saw two people that were not just dead but in bits after a plane crash I saw where was that fine not even a mile from my house I was looking at yeah and then um and then a commercial plane or like one of those little privates our 57 year old man and a 13 year old kid I try tried recently briefly to find to go back and find the article but the way I here's how the story went down is a the way I remember a detail that I remember very clearly is that this guy it was his neighbor kid and they he had told this kid's parents they were going on the wash the airplane and look at the airplane and he decided to take the kid up for a flight I don't know if that's true or not I was trying to find that article to confirm that aspect of it but I lived on a lake called middle lake and we everybody remembers this for whatever reason this guy balls Dar Lake a couple times really low there was a guy down on the east end of the lake named mr. Ruppert and I remember what was unusual mr. Ruppert was he would eat freshwater clams which we were forbidden from doing by our dad but my son you know it's just not as people don't regarded as a good practice at all the freshwater clams because the toxins I don't you know that's another thing I haven't looked into why that doesn't happen people just gently don't eat freshwater clams but we would go get them and clean them and I remember we cleaned the whole shitload once my dad's like no but mr. Ruppert would eat these freshwater clams and would he go raw already cook him I'm sure he would cook them he said man I saw that plane when it Dole down over the lake it went up but then douve down again and never came back up he even told some neighbors this the next day when we wake up uh the Sheriff's Posse the Mounted like our area had a mounted like a bunch of volunteers who had horses and they were like the Mounted Sheriff's Posse right like deputized individuals during emergencies such as this they were all loading up their horses to head out into the woods to look for some plane in another detail that was told to me that I wanted to verify that I didn't decide to go back and go through the microfiche where I grew up and find the article because it was something like it had a signal on it and the signal was picked up by some other country even but they knew that a plane had gone down and that was a matter of fact everyone at this point knew that this plane had gone down um and we were riding around on our bikes out the woods just kind of following these Sheriff's Posse guys they were sort of combing through the woods and eventually a news helicopter was hovering over a spot like right at where right where what the end of White Lake Drive um and there was a news helicopter hovering over there my two brothers went directly there on their bikes and I was younger and four summers I went to get my mom and then we drove over and we got to the end of White Lake Road we had to walk into the woods and there was a guy there to tried to block my mom and me from going in there and always remember he said um uh if you're going to be but ever strong stomach and she's like with my kids are in there and so we go in there and Matt and Danny ER to stand at the edge of the hole there and they're trying to sort out but trying to sort out who was who inside this plane into bags I'm not shitting you man like and yeah I have like some visual details I remember from that just like a yeah and then it's kind of a cob but yeah I'd like like and then that was and then remember we're at our neighbor mrs. muscleman um I remember we're at her birthday party in the caterer just fell over dead in front of everybody oh so like so like that very non war related things right that's what's what's interesting is we understand like but you can you can see the e these are just like half and chance things but yeah you can go through life we just have it sort of set up now or you can be hidden from it but then you talk to previous generations just a like just it was just a part of stuff yeah you know my old man talked about walking he grew up in Chicago he talked about walking out of a party one time there's a dead guy at the bottom of the stairs that have been beaten to death just like day it's just like then went off to World War Two and saw who knows what so yeah I when people talk about how now we're so violent shit there's nothing to say or that nothing no it's this safe time safest time to live ever use be able to hang people from trees and not get in trouble for it if they were the right color yeah not that long ago no that's what's crazy about this Wild Bill Hickok shit we're talking about what 1870 1880 when was it and what's funny is he was one of the combatants so some of those guys like Wild Bill Cody and Wild Bill Hickok Hickok actually had like a dispute over who got to have the name you know Bill Buffalo Bill Cody Wild Bill Hickok there's some other Wild Bill's I guess it was like it was like a popular name right but they were combatants too so they engaged in these wars and the fact that you would later get both sides of the war they'd be like if you went and got a bunch of Germans who were defending the Normandy Beach Omaha Beach and you got a bunch of the Americans who are storming Omaha Beach and you had a traveling road show in which they would pretend to inflict mass casualties on one another for paying adoring crowds how bizarre who came up with the idea for that know that have been done ever in history before no my guess would be you know there's a guy there's the thing that I've told people bunched has no one ever believes industry but it's fucking true it's true there was a guy one time you know Niagara Falls right you've been to Niagara Falls no big damn waterfall you know the st. Louis ain't Lawrence drains the Great Lakes and on its way out to the land it was a big-ass waterfall Niagara Falls um a guy one time bought there was like a zoo was liquidating its holdings and a man bought the zoo and bought a barge and put all of the zoo animals on the barge and charged a dollar to watch him send his barge full of animals over the falls yeah so right yeah not that long now I have you know no case no knowledge as they put you in a cage yeah so it's just yeah we've traveled what is this Jaime like from when the when the show started in the World's Fair he got denied from doing the the show outside of the world feeling wobbly dog you know taro sorry Weymouth Cody so I don't know which one okay but uh he found a 14-acre swath of land where he set up stands for 18,000 people to watch each show and over 2 million people saw it during like that whatever during the World's Fair that year oh that's it was like the first one and there weren't even there there were 2 million saw but there were less well under probably way less than 75 million people in the country Wow ah what year was it in world war 2 there were 150 million that's incredible 18 thousand spectators 74 Indians from the Pine Ridge Reservation of South Dakota Wow 18 thousand spectators what's been amazing back then yeah no but here but think about the numbers at that battle that they historians feel that at that battle that was the largest gathering of Plains Indians to have ever an encampment of maybe 10,000 individuals and how many people were there from what's-his-face Koster Custer he rolled into one end of the camp it that's why it's not well understood like there were other engagements going on at the same time once it when you say like Custer his command was annihilated there were other prongs to the attack that that were repelled and beaten but was only like one prong of the attack that Custer that was annihilated and how many people did Custer he rode in with about 200 people and ran into an encampment of 10,000 individuals and later some of these individuals like Gaul and others and interviews said that even at the time our understanding is that these people were all hopelessly drunk oh my god because it did not make sense what they were doing wow they just didn't know it's no one understood that's that's why Custer that's why they're still all these Custer people who just debate and argue and is like uh some of his crow Scouts okay he had some Cree re Scouts and crow Scouts who came and told him do not you cannot go down there in the morning the river plane was to attack at daybreak and they said you cannot do that that makes no sense he said we're going um they did their death songs some of the some of his Scouts sang their death songs they knew what they would be dying in the morning and um it's debated still today to what extent did he like did he believe what his Scouts are telling him okay so was it suicidal or was a huge no one thinks it was suicidal it was either that he just didn't really comprehend what they were telling him or he was so you know he was a decorated Civil War figure and probably was a very ardent believer in the superiority like of his army and that they were trained soldiers with discipline that there was just one prong of a three-year you know three prong attack or two-prong attack he's riding in the one end of the village but he just rode into the village and they were just right and in depicting popular depictions they always show cluster like his the last guy standing like is a mountain of his dead guys around him you know and he's still firing his revolver with long hair when in fact he had short hair time but uh some people think that when in looking at it he probably yet the great one is here fell Custer great image that like Jamie just pulled up a crazy picture so here fell costs at a contemporary picture did say what no no that's the old classic there's one that was on the anti corporate to the time yeah here fell cost was a little bit later but then the one that was the anheuser-busch was by a German guy think that was one you had pulled up that was like thisor Bush had a Buster it was like their poster oh my god that's here fell coaster Wow which is is considered to be a very accurate was compared to be a pretty accurate depiction of what was going on now the Nate Austin diverged also dot Custer died early they think he died earlier in the skirmish she wasn't like the land movies he's got the flowing blonde hair everyone's dead and he's still firing away for he is he's probably killed earlier rather than later in the skirmish it's so funny because see right there that he's like you know yeah different position it's so funny that that we've done that you know that people have taken what they know most likely we're historically inaccurate accounts and they pass them down generation and generation it makes you wonder like this is what we know now because this is only a hundred so years ago yeah like what you know what are we getting when we're getting some version of something that happened a thousand years ago or 9,000 years ago you know yeah how distorted insanely yeah but the problem we have as the culture I think is when someone goes to fix when someone goes to challenge our popular perceptions um it's it's branded as revisionist and somehow like loses right it becomes almost like it's credentials are tarnished remember the guy I can't marry what politician Jamie bill pulled out there's a politician who said um he famously said you actually realized that Paul Revere the the the ride of Paul Revere was didn't really happen yeah like fabricated from whole cloth right right there's a politician said I love Paul Revere whether he wrote or not well I mean when we were kids we were taught Columbus discovered the United States yeah I mean we didn't figure that out until it's it's still amazing that it wasn't like the West Indians and yeah and to this day it's still amazing that they celebrate that guy when you find out he was a fuckin monster you know the what was it a believed it was a minister or someone who was some religious person who came with them at the time left a journal about the atrocities committed directly by Columbus and his men when they you know hacked off arms for people couldn't bring them back bold and I mean just horrific shit smashed babies on rocks did it right in front of him and this guy was a first-hand account of what and we're supposed to believe I mean who knows how much of what he's saying is accurate but if any of it is accurate Columbus was a fuckin monster yeah I think that what it stems from is that from the perspective in Europe at the time he had he had solidified and put some shit together the people had been kind of pecking around the edges of right whether it's continent existed and in in in yeah just had it was like a leap forward at the time yeah how crazy is that but the fact that it becomes that all right to he like you know that in some people's minds like somehow established America yeah and that we take a day off of school because of it that's really crazy this bizarre Columbus Day I mean we still to this day in 2017 kids get Columbus Day Off don't they but now it's like here's the thing now that no one now that not that sort of the consensus right the popular consensus is that he was a one of many players involved and sort of putting together what was here and sort of outlining where it was how to get here um he's one of a bunch of players you know almost certainly not the first no one cares about that meaning what they mean is you're like saying like I uphold the idea of Western civilization's annexation of the new world as being a good thing so when someone says like when someone gets pissed at the revisionists for questioning the legitimacy of Columbus they're not actually talking about what he specifically did it's become it's become a proxy for the cultural annexation of the new world and to say oh I hate Columbus he's an asshole they take it to me and you're saying that um that you're questioning our claim on the Western Hemisphere and that it was a bad thing I think that's why people are annoyed by it I don't think people are too much annoyed by it anymore so the thing that's pretty much been established that Columbus is really bad but no one's gone in and undid it they have have they is there any bit so they kind of change him around don't they well they should probably come up with another name for it you know uh happy uh no that was Syria it's still a day right and think so pretty sure yeah it is kind of crazy though I'm not I'm not like here to defend the day but I do understand like kind of how that shit came to be yeah I understand it it just seems pretty incredible that just five hundred years ago here goes the war against Columbus Day in the Washington Post yes it's waged by the same people who are waging a war against Christmas ah this is really that's crazy indigenous peoples day in favor of indigenous peoples yeah hmm makes sense yeah give us a day off we'll take it I'm jelly like like little movements like little cultural movements like that I'm generally not uh receptive I don't try to I don't try to read too much into him mmm if I woke up tomorrow and told me that we had decided you know that uh if people got together and decided against Columbus Day I wouldn't like do a lot of soul-searching I read a you know well you know you don't work a traditional job anyway or go to school where you take that day oh yeah I think people that lost the day they're like - that's my day man yeah it's just hard to mention I thought I hit walleyes my buddy Doug every year yeah you'd be bummed it's just hard to imagine that you know 500 plus years ago they really didn't know in Europe about the continental United States that's that's amazing it yeah that that's not we're talking about earlier time about violence right violent more violent then I think that we're so tripped up by the upheaval caused by the digital age right and everything like you know I just changed our sleep practices and just everything you know it's been is major upheaval yeah but picture that picture that in your lifetime they all like you become aware that the earth that's that there are you know three times as many or whatever as many civilizations on earth is that you thought there were yeah I mean that's a huge thing to grapple with a huge thing to grapple with people that had history people that had boats they were seafaring had more history than you yeah they're crazy or to think that one day and this is not too long ago you know some of our grandparents remember this to think that one day we had devised a contraption that was capable of ending life on Earth and that these contraptions could be initiated by the distant actions of a handful of people that that's a change right yeah the nuclear era here's the craziest change in the nuclear era from the invention of an airplane to someone dropping a nuclear bomb from an airplane is less than 50 years yeah I think Wright brothers 1903 Wright 1906 1930 early nineteen first sustained flight with a heavier than air vehicle and then in 1945 they dropped an atomic bomb that's crazy that's inside my life someone's like I knew this airplane shit was going to take off but that is probably one of the biggest changes ever in terms of like the amount of in 50 years in the world to go from no air travel at all to dropping a nuclear bomb out of an airplane in less than 50 years yeah and to then have it be that it's a staple of American life then it did not just were other people like space travel you're like okay it's this flood of information but it's not affecting me but with that's like that's now how you get around yeah you know that heat like at a time when you under cross the country you would lose a large percentage of your party to death right you had to plan ahead who take many many months to being just a thing you just do on a whim now I do believe like I accept that we are in a state of upheaval right now and I think they were probably impacting ourselves in ways we don't fully understand how so digital devices oh for sure yeah just how you run your day yeah no doubt hi spending time how you run your day well ever go to a restaurant you see a whole group of people just staring at their phone yeah yeah we're laughs was their day if you're staying at the baggage claim not looking at your phone people think you're nuts that's true my friend just looking around and make conversation with people my friend Rory saw about our conversations life is having was somewhat worse I was in the Starbucks drinking a coffee just sitting here staring at the wall like a fucking lunatic yeah yeah really what person was what are they up to they're gonna start killing people they're not doing anything with their phone um it's a big thing but what are the helpful thing I guess one of the helpful just bring a full circle one of the helpful things um you know about traveling or about like just reading about history as you stop you lose some of that sense of specialness about thinking that the life you're living in the moment you're living it is this great test of humanity or some like super peculiar thing going on you realize that people have always been involved with and struggle with cataclysmic upheaval you know and then to go and into witness some other people in some version of that transition is pretty healthy man maybe in a long term like just traveling going to see how the people do stuff it's unsettling but probably ultimately pretty good for you yeah I think it's very good for you just anything that enhances perspective it gives you like another layer you could consider when you think about life on Earth we're so used to our own environment our own ways it's like you were talking about talking these people and asking them like why don't eat monkeys mm-hmm and now stony monkeys has he ever been to a supermarket that's a good question a couple years ago when I was mentioning that I'd mentioned you that that the the that a couple American companies who have a that have like some conservation spending they do they were training some guys from Rio village they were training some of them to uh just how to interface with Westerners and as part of that he went up to he might even gone up to the Bahamas to go for a couple days to a fly fishing lodge some get so yeah he flew on a commercial aircraft oh wow yeah um just what was but he's deceit but he's peculiar in that way now I've brought up to him I'm trying to talk him into coming up and going I want to take him on a ice fishing trip so I wanna Alaska the fish of the ice because what I want him to understand is um I'm so uncomfortable with him physically uncomfortable with the heat with everything biting me all the time just everything it's just extremely uncomfortable and to him it's standard yeah it's comfortable but he's never like if he hadn't done that trip or you know or just all his siblings most other people's village they never experience you know their experience 50 degrees Fahrenheit now what is it like to them when it comes to bugs so they have any sort of resistance to mosquitoes or anything along those lines they don't care about it nearly as much as we care about it do they get the same amount of bites though they get chewed up like we do yeah they complain about tick bites and stuff but doesn't generally it doesn't seem to bother them you're like we do because it's just a part of everyday life but you got to get used to you know in like hanging out Bolivia you get bit by bees and wasps at about the same rate that you'd get bit by mosquitoes if you rat like some fourth of July thing out at your uncle's pond you know shooting fireworks off at night on the edge of a cattail Marsh he's like just getting bit you just like wake up you start getting bit by bees and laughs so they just get just kind of used to it and then you'd say like I remember when I got stung by a bullet and asking like hey how many times been stung my bullet ants and a lot of would be like I couldn't even begin to guess how many times I've been stung by bullet ants but it's like but they just suffer difference so what I want to do is I want him to experience suffering while watching me not suffer so like I want him to look at me with awe okay and so to do this I want him to come up a nice fish ronger take him up I got a I got a friend who likes to go on he likes to get on snow machines in february/march out of Fairbanks and they go overnight camping on snow machines fishing through the ice for bourbon sounds like Herbet though for a called freshwater Ling's or Lord you know why they call them lawyers is when you got a burr bit his eye his heart's way back next to his asshole so they called lawyers or vent you know fish have a like a cloaca they have a uni hole you know we have like a bird yeah we have a couple outlets and they have a single outlet for waste and sexual exchange so yeah lawyer burbot freshwater ling poor man's lobster is another word for it it's a northern fish looks like if you combined a snake and a bullfrog kinda uh yeah I want to take him out to camp in a tent in 40-degree below weather right there wow what a cool looking fish very good to eat yeah very good Wow now they commonly caught through the ice or did people catch them on the street that's northern peasant Northey yeah oh yeah no it's kinda buried or not but there's in Great Lakes they're all over in Alaska yeah there's burbot everywhere so does it taste like Lobster is that why they call it a porno the reason they call it poor man's lobster doesn't really taste like lobster but it's suitable for boiling it and dipping it in butter and cocktail sauce and eating really yeah but you also should make fish sandwiches with it huh they even sell that shit commercially burbot guys that have like guys that like uh Native American so in the northern Great Lakes you have a jib while the jib wha Indians still carry on White Lake that they fish for Great Lakes whitefish they trap net Great Lakes whitefish they're able to sell bycatch of burbot and they have restaurants and like in the UPI got some friends to do it and they got restaurants in the U P that they sell their bourbon into and they make bourbon sandwiches huh fresh water link that's what I want to take him on ice fishing trip and um but for him to leave like he doesn't go into Georgetown which is the capital of his country he have to go into Georgetown and start like trying to figure out some kind of a visa situation and a passport does he have a birth certificate I don't know what he has I told about try to help him with all that but he said it's like a very daunting idea that you would let go and leave the country or you'd go in and stay in Georgetown but he has been on a commercial flight he did that trip yeah yeah so he has done it yep he has done it he said man so he had to get a passport in order to do it his passport didn't last long and now he has no passport anymore is what he's telling me when I was asking him about the feasibility of this and then you don't need a visa for there but he need a visa to come here hmm but I'm gonna figure it out I want to have him up so bad Wow his brother Dennis one of the things that's surprise like one of the things you get is um you know you're from what state reborn in New Jersey yes he is like you've been all over the place right yeah imagine that imagine you hunted and fished and farm that's all you did we're always on the land yeah and you've done it all within a 25-mile the 20 mile radius of your home so you're outside hunting and fishing or farming or gathering in the jungle every day and you're in your 30s forty's and you've done it in a radius of 20 miles well to what level you understand your spot and without the distractions of the digital ship and without the distractions of an occupation he doesn't work at all not I mean now he did he guides a little bit every year for the fish he guides a little bit but typically not like most days he's not engaged in that activity so the spatial awareness as a thing that's most striking to me in spending time with with these individuals is um everything I'm interested in what they noticin and what they never miss it's like you realize that all of the bits of information you're able to contain in your head that allow you to function and carry on right you're like a comedian and you do shit with MMA and you have a very successful podcast and you have a family and you're digitally very astute and you have opinions about fucking coffee right all the shit you're widely-read alright that's like all you sort of fill up your brain with as much as it can hold but for them it's like it seems to be from my perspective it's like all of that breadth of knowledge but crammed into the natural world to where every plant every tree what are its uses what are the other things and it's like they know as much like they know as much as we know but it's just focused in a way that our breadth of knowledge which which would probably be astounding to them if they realize all the shit we knew about but they're all that and all those bits of information are just applied in a different way down it's like a granular understanding of the jungle it probably very bizarre for them to see us like walk like out to this parking lot these little patches of like plants we don't have a fucking clue what they are we pass through them like they they're just peripheral there is no like I don't know what that is yeah Wow no they know everything and there's toxicity how many thousands and thousands of different varieties of plants there's still at various times is 1500 species of birds listen I like there was never a moment when I heard a bird call there was uh I'd never said hey what's that bird that everyone there didn't say what the bird was Oh bird sounds just from sounds it's like you can't like in the shit that like yeah it defi it's almost a something you have to go see is um the ability to just like move through the jungle and notice everything now are they like the people in Bolivia where they're barefoot for most the time yeah but you know it's another bummer is getting more into shoes man uh Roman still likes to take his shoes off when he goes into the jungle I we went into the jungle after some curse ow and uh and he pulled his shoes off to be extra quiet but yeah so he'll now and then put flip-flops on now and before it is no way Wow do they still have the weird feet that are all this calloused and toes are spread out it's very strange the way their feet look real strange I wasn't you know no and I was in the Philippines one time in the highlands where people are just hiking mountain trails like an you know severe topography on rocky ground and the feet there I've never seen any like barefoot yeah which is like it's almost unrecognizable as a human foot from your perspective of a human foot was like have uh have your your Manny's difference their feet - ah Luzon Island hot Luzon Island Highlands Kalinga ka Li ng a feet Oh God there's probably some high resolution National Geographic All Seasons create if this if he's any good at his job you will be seeing some crazy feet in a moment you know another thing I want uh uh charity I mentioned the service surreal image is a you know watching a woman in a DKNY shirt like digging turtle eggs for food um through it there's there's flowers that you know everything's in bloom right um it was just the beginning of the rainy season sort of some rain like everything is in bloom and these flowers just all flowers of all variety hang out over the river and sometimes you'll pass through it just has this like warm floral smell that just it's astounding it reminds me of you know and in the end of Apocalypse Now when Kurt's when captain Willard finally catches up with Kurtz and Kurtz at some where he's from and he mentions Ohio and Kurtz tells him about a river trip he took with his father on the Ohio River when the gardenias were in bloom you know he talks about the smell in the end of Apocalypse Now but these flowers smell like that but when the rain would come it's going on I came to see what got some feet oh you'll find some feet but I want I was trying to find something better um so it would rain it would knock the all the flowers into the river oh wow and you know like the way yeah as I'm talking about so from grasping Wow they're like almost like a gorillas feet yeah from great like from wrapping you're like wrapping your feet around thing rocks and stuff like that one of the Middle's yeah no not saw I saw I saw like a number like not yet quite a few people that had feet to resemble that from Chris from from from because like you know down in the Amazon in other areas you're just walking on soft ground no but Majan if you're just like walking on slippery rocks and you're using your feet in a way that's that's not even uncommon so we're we're looking at for people that are just listening to this it's like at the middle of their foot especially that one foot in the middle to the right it's like he's take it's taking a turn like a hard turn like a 15 degree + turn why do those seem like disembodied feet because it's just photographing the feet I guess real this is like a big article about two people from the Philippi thank from Sumeria Oh huh Oh we'll go back to it for a second Jamie because what we're seeing in this is this massive spacing between the big toe and then the first toe to the point where it's like a supposable it's an opposable toe yeah it's crazy seems like almost like an opposable toe yeah almost like a thumb now I'm sure what's that play there to is really fucked like it makes you wonder I get one point I'm was it like that that that's that's things you wonders and I don't know the answer to this but my guess would be that over time you know that they're there they're not starting out with your foot like over time that that's been something that's been selected for right in a population of people like height or like yes like it's just like select forty disguise feet yeah hole very common shit holy shit what we're looking at what looks like frogs but that's not even that's not even crazy oh that's isn't that uh that's North America power dizziness people feet and this got hu a Oh RA and I how do you pronounce her Ani Ron I'd have to check with that oh god it's bizarre but it really does show you for fucking wearing shoes you're hold on and given the different environment like that that's insane like what we're looking at here lit they literally look like thumbs like they're sticking out aside but it's the same structure as a human foot meaning that it's the same length of toes and and just you see that from using it that way they've just developed this incredibly you know what's really crazy what is one of the hallmarks of civilization that shows like the really poor choice and footwear when your feet go the other way when they go in an ineffective direction they get they get that hammer toe and they climb over each other this is these people have functional feet to the point where you know they could probably hold something with their feet yeah when I look at uh when I look at my wife's feet I feel like she's got a foot this he's very much like shaped by a lifetime of office Footwear it's awful especially with women they get that hammer toe that bunion thing where their their toes are kind of and crossed over to the side of that thing well it's so weird it's a weird choice that someone has decided that women should shove their toes and these pointy things but but uh just like with the that I saw the a group of individuals lock onto polarized sunglasses as being the shit um if you went back in five years I'm telling you instead of bringing being barefoot everything be wearing shoes what if you got those women high-heeled shoes and said this is what all the women stretch of course they can take a while but you Oh dad that's disgusting though that's footings fucked up right that's just in second until I'm lookin at ya it's your toes oh that's from binding your hand that's foot binding in China yeah boot you know soft tissue it's very flexible Phil man go go to Cirque de Soleil look what those people could do their bodies the human body is pretty bizarre in its ability to adapt but yeah you know those groups used to bind their children's head to that backboard yeah to flatten their head out well how about those people in what part of the world was it where they have that ended Incas the where they have those lines the Nazca lines you know and they've found all these skulls from people back then where they had stretched their heads out almost made their heads look like aliens yeah there you go but uh see if you find the Inka Inka skulls it's so much so that a lot of the really loony people said look they're trying to be like the aliens that have come down and given them knowledge oh yeah have you ever been downed uh um do you remember those it they're they're they're held in Salta Argentina I went to see him one time but those children that they found they were entombed at the top of a mountain and they were basically freeze-dried no it's perfectly preserved children what would happen to them well they were taken up and given as the offering so first it seems based on the stuff they had with them that they were paraded through the Incan Empire and people lavish them with gifts and when they look at the isotopes in their bodies it's like their diet their whole lives they had just had potatoes but then you can see that toward the end of their lives they're very well fed with meat and fish and all kinds of stuff and they had just innumerable treasures gold pieces carved pieces so they were taken it seems as though they were taken throughout the empire and what's really funny about this speaking of Columbus earlier is it was like yeah so Wow it's like is best that they haven't dated exactly but it seems like I mean it seems like we're talking about you know Columbus 1492 is they were talking about 1491 Wow so the the height of this empire at the the height of the empire budding up up against it's dramatic and sudden collapse with European contact but they took I want to see you know she was not the only they made a deal with the indigenous people were they only put one on display at a time she was on display when I was there and what did they have their cell in capsule so they took them I'll tell you how they came to be first so they were finely dressed had a lot of ornaments and things with them had been very well fed and the the older girl and they took them out to the high peak I can't member how they might've been 14 or 15 thousand feet above sea level then they built a little tomb for him and sat him in the tomb they were drunk they had a lot of rice wine in their bodies when they died the oldest one must have putting up some kind of struggle because she was hit in the head with a hammer or an axe and they were just laid out sitting in this thing and then capped over with rocks and it's very stable environment so they froze and then you know we use now like backpacking food as freeze-dried food yeah they used to have they used to do a very similar thing with by just taking potatoes and storing them at high elevations where what freeze drying is your liquid it's like you freeze something and then expel the liquid where the liquid goes from a gaseous or goes from a solid to a gas without passing through its liquid state so when you freeze dry food you like freeze dry it you put it in the freezer and get super cold and then you start then you start putting it under a vacuum to a point where all the water goes immediately to a gaseous state doesn't pass through a liquid state so it holds its farm but all the water is gone if it goes through a liquid state then it collapses but just hold its form in the non water parts of the cells just stay bound in their natural shape so they were in this position and eventually just like expelled tons of water without ever thawing out and when they found them you can even see the that they had been chewing coca leaves because the high elevation the kids still have dried coca leaves on their lips do this while yeah I mean my wife went there look at him where is it now it's in salta argentina Wow near the border very near the border with Bolivia I wanted to ask you something totally unrelated but it came up because you talked about freeze-dried foods I know you cook a lot but have you ever I know now you eat those mountain house things but have you ever tried to make your own have you ever tried to dehydrate some of your wild game oh yeah I've dehydrated anytime you make jerky or dehydrate right but have you ever made like chili and things like that way you could rehydrate it in the field Charlie we've ever made dehydrated no I've assembled a lot of dehydrated things but I've never did like at what point how many ingredients need to be in something before it becomes like a recipe mmm - couple hammock and that's a recipe because it pemmican that's got two things in it Hema can pulverize meat uh with liquid fat poured over the top of it did you know what that is no people fuck that up all the time what fennekin is I've never heard of it before I don't think yeah so I did it we got it it's like the original road food you dry meat into jerky air-dry meeting a jerky then you pulverize it into what looks like sawdust and then you take in stirred and liquefied fat I made something from a buffalo kill and I brought my Buffalo book I made pemmican from that and I was - and I had it in my fridge as an experiment I kept it for seven years survival food that can last 50 years but that's not pemmican it's not doesn't look like it looks like jerky sticks because it's not pulverized people just now started all of a sudden calling like different I'm not saying everybody mess hardly everybody messes up but it's like a thing that gets messed up so um was I getting that or yes about notes asking about I never hydrate I never dehydrate a bunch of different things and combine it into a recipe that I then bring with me um the reason I like the reason I use dehydrated food and a lot of backpack hunters use dehydrated food is because um if you have a dish made up of dehydrated ingredients they have different hydration times okay so if you do beans like like a piece of meat is going to be digestible to you piece of dehydrated meat that's then hydrated is going to be digestible to you a dehydrated bean might take 30 or 40 minutes before it's going to be in the condition that doesn't rip you apart but if you all fuck yourself up eat straight dried beans what happens just it's just like you're off yeah you don't know you're somebody does know what to do with it man knows what to do with it starts producing your voluminous amounts of gas right so off it's horrible but with with if you cook if you take food and cook it to a ready-to-eat state and then freeze dry it it it uh you can rehydrate it kind of like simultaneously if you do everything right now wouldn't work we're like a hamburger if you dehydrated a hamburger and then you add water to it you're going to wind up with a soggy ass bun so the trick is like finding things that are gonna in a hot water bath are going to all come back to life kind of at the same time but places that make backpack food out of just dehydrated but not freeze dried ingredients is a recipe for disaster really some people like that shit but for day-in day-out consumption um I'm a freeze-dried man and it's freeze-dried something you could do at home you have to buy a sublimation chamber so know what does a sublimation chamber what is that but it's a chamber in which subtle you know what it looks like it looks like though looks like a submarine really small but it's very heavy-duty because you're taking you're taking food you take ready-to-eat foods and freeze it right and then you put into a sublimation chamber and pull a very strong vacuum on it and the air pressure gets to a point where the liquid sublimates and goes drag it to a gaseous state and you condense it on another surface inside the chamber but it's out of the food then you take the food out it's like glass Wow you can shatter it that's freeze-dried food but it rehydrates in a real nice way I have heard we a lot of it because we do a lot of backcountry trips I've heard everyone's complaints about it but it's like it from my perspective which I will argue is a well-informed perspective it's like it's the lesser of two evils it's not that bad for day-in day-out consumption I think that the companies that are do freeze dries it's just better in my opinion mmm now when I say that these children refreeze droughts I think some people you know people are going to challenge that because not technically freeze-dried but like a similar thing going on where they're keeping their form but shedding their water and you know shedding water keeping their form of being frozen and preserved for a long time so it's trip because I was reading a podcast or reading a podcast listening to a podcast rather where this guy was talking about how he's doing that with his own food for backpacking trips dehydrating oh sure man why don't things like chili the eggs along those lines bacon chili and then dehydrate or just dehydrating the components think dehydrating the components I think he was talking about dehydrating the meat and dehydrating pasta like like something you know like taking some meat with sauce yo and putting it together with a pasta now my brother one time he's a very uh frugal man he'd invited is that the right word he just hates uh to see food go to waste he one time had a bunch of roommates now moved out and left a ton of rice and he got sick of cooking rice because it'd take too long he cooked all the rice and then spread it out on sheets and dehydrated it in his dehydrator and and reverse-engineered instant rice that's insane does it take that long what is right she's like 20 minutes it sounds like a yeah talk to him so this is the same guy is this the same guy that found the hobos underwear and stole it yep and the same guy that um one time our our dear late friend uh was getting married and his bride his bride the wedding was at his bride-to-be's house and a neighbor was away on vacation and the neighbor was away on vacation said you know since we're out of town if you guys want to use our home for some of your wedding guests go ahead and so all the groomsmen were lodged up in this house of this man we didn't know who was the neighbor of his wife's parents and uh I don't know why but my brother got the snooping around in this guy's freezer and found that he had had he had a bull elk in there that had been in there for seven years and he had like this crisis this moral crisis where he's trying to figure out is it morally works to steal or morally worse to allow this man to waste this meat how long was a bullet will blog stay good if you freeze it your fucking portion at i-70 or something is like what is what is like commonly agreed upon it depends who you ask if you ask me the way I trim the way I cut trim and wrap I don't even blink at two years two years is fine yeah the way I cut trim and wrap when you start seeing four years you get a little weird well I think that I don't let it go I've never even done it I would have to think it's going to start to go because the texture the texture will change the texture will change um seven years there's two things going on one you're borderline and two you're starting to get the idea that this guy isn't going to eat that thing right yeah so he waded out in his head and when he left he had a bunch of that meat with him and took him home and ate it because he just hated to see a bowl out go to waste how did it taste seven years old remember to ask him Wow but his standard of good is different than your standard together his standard a good is acceptable in cases like at so that is a weird crisis though makes sense but he throughout his whole life he always is running into these situations like where he just like cannot um he cannot let food go to waste so he's I talked to my knowledge probably ten more things like that that have happened to him since I talked to him last where he's like when he found like he found in his alleyway one time and he's living in Montana and both still is Montana in Bozeman found in his alleyway like a discarded a discarded cash from a homeless man and ate all that guys food and he was a PhD candidate at the University you grew up with him yeah so I've ever with here's this tandem the first time he here's where he kind of like we're not work came from but he drew a bear tag when we were in Michigan it was hard to get a bear attack at the time he drew a bear tag and the only way to hunt bears in the U P is like you not you're not gonna spot stalk on his flat ground you can't see shit right the only good used dogs or he's bait or she never knew I can see a bear um so he started bait pile the way he was feeding his bait pile head of the season was just dumpster diving so as he's dumpster diving it's like he's living off not only is he bait in the bear with the dumpster food but he's like living off the dumpster diving food that he found to because he like discovered his great richness no I'm sure he found on that shin he found his big box of boxes of expired bugles you know those little crackers yeah the people like put cheese with shoot Cheez Whiz into the open end of that bugle and I've got a picture he just walked in the walk through the woods with boxes of bugles under his arm and get out and he'd be like dumping them out for the bear and then just eating the bugles - and then he long back handle people just hate see wasted food his old girlfriend had a job cooking like the brown food in Albertsons you like the display case where they fry all those like burritos and shit and um they were she was bringing all at home and they were living off the the food that was going the garbage and they came to her and said you can't steal this food and she started stealing it quietly Wow can't stand to see food go to waste well that's probably noble you know it's extra nice as he works for the USDA so it's good to know that a person like that is involved in um you know is at least in the room with people who are thinking about food systems is it good cuz she was like you're fucking me anything dude he will he's on a different level I mean on a different level of toughness and shit he's a guy whose arm is shrinking because Mara I was trying to hook you up with yes yes got a mess yeah yeah did he do anything about that nope oh Jesus that's not good no once you get that atrophy it's very tough to get it back the ways nerves regenerate takes a long time it's like a half an inch a year he chronicles its decay by taking a he's got a 30 pound kettlebell and he was chronicling his decay by watching how many is his tricep so counting how many tricep curls he could do with that kettlebell with one arm with the other and I think last time we're talking to him it was 30 or something like 30 on one side and 10 on the other side oh Jesus that's bad so that's a neck issue then he's that's like a c3 or c4 or something like that he's gone yeah I should say he's gone no he hasn't I should say has known anything about he's probably if he's listened to this would not be cringing because he would feel that he has but um tell him if he's listening there's a couple things you need to do if it seems to me like it's a neck issue because uh when you start getting elbows and things where your arm starts atrophying usually it's a cervical disc which is somewhere up in here what what he should do is get a neck decompression device they're very they're inexpensive they hook over a door you put it on with Velcro you strap it in I have one it hangs on the thing it's like you're hanging yourself by your chin see they get some room in there for all those nerves exactly and well same principles these toes spreading out and then other also toes smashing up you can kind of soft-tissue stretch out your neck and decompress all those areas a lot of people have it from bad posture a lot of people have it from athletics I got it from jiu-jitsu from all this you know getting your neck yanked on see that thing right there that lady has yeah that's a shitty one because that one's working on a bag of water that doesn't work with a neck like mine you need you need wood to be able to hang hang a rhino on the other I had a I have a thing where I go like this click click click click click click click and then I let myself hang from my neck and the Moy it's just like that just like that see how that guy's just sitting there reading a magazine yeah and you can adjust that so there's a little cord it's tough to see in this photo but there's a cord you pull sort of like a plunger on all those old-school toilets you pull that click click click click click click click see how he's pulling it right there you know and then you just relax and you just got to learn how to go with it and sort of relax and it feels weird at first because a lot of pressure but it's pulling your neck literally pulling your neck you can feel sometimes when I'm really relaxed I feel like pop I feel like something pop little tissue separations in there does it have do you feel that it's gotten better long-term oh yeah for sure and it feels like really relaxing like after it's over I feel like ah I feel like it just takes a weight off you know sure I think there's a tremendous amount that we're in right now are exceptional because their economic chair is you use them right if you use them right yeah I'm pretty cautious about sitting up straight but from back injuries I've been very very cautious about working out all the muscles around my back I didn't really I just worked out and I figured those things take care of themselves now I treat them is like just like brushing my teeth like my spinal column and all those supporting muscles in the spine those are huge they need they need to be exercised and especially if you do anything like you guys pack out a lot of weight yeah that's a big one and I fast where he feels that dips of what he had sciatica right that's lower that's a lump that was a different thing but he he he knows he like traces that uh to a specific animal that he's packing out yeah makes sense because sciatica is what sciatica is is a disc that's bulging meaning the disc the soft tissue in between the two hard bones is pushing out and it's pressing up against the nerve and it causes pain that shoots down your ass and your lower legs and a lot of people don't even recognize it as a lower-back issue because maybe their back is not really that painful but the leg and the ass is painful yeah what the fuck is going on here I had a similar issue with my neck where I was pushing on my ulnar nerve and I was getting this elbow pain and I was like fuck this really hurts like down my arm and in the back of my tricep and then I started getting numbness in my fingers that's when I started figuring out what was going on then I went to a doctor I went to a chiropractor first was a fucking giant mistake I spent a year but do not believe in chiropractors I don't believe in chiropractors at all I think it's 98% horseshit that's what I think and I'm I don't know but I think chiropractors that are smart they incorporate things I think are beneficial cold laser massage a lot of different things but I think that manipulation that they do unless you have like some sort of significant scoliosis or something they're attempting to slowly put back into position I think most of the times just pop at your neck and it just feels good but I just like in an immediate sense I went to a guy that's a very nice guy and he was trying to tell me that I didn't have a bulging disc because he was pushing down the top of my head and it didn't hurt and like okay so I was listening to him I listen to this guy for like a fucking year I had treatment with him and I still have these neck problems and back problems then finally I got an MRI they're like yeah you got a bulging disc and I remember being angry I remember being angry because I was angry that I was being treated by someone who was a professional that really didn't know what the fuck they were talking yeah and they were treating something that was a significant issue that I was experiencing a real deterioration of my function pain I wasn't able to do jujitsu correctly there was a lot of a lot of problems that I was dealing with I was like well what the fuck is this like how to and then I started talking to doctors about it and when you have a bulging disc man they want to cut you open like like you're a pinata and you got gold inside well that's a thing that my bro is talking about is is the procedure vus about a procedure that he could or could not do well for some people it's on a bad move depending on whether or not your brother's willing to do all the different things that can but he's got a lot of atrophy already which is a real bad thing it's noticeable yeah that's not good because that shit doesn't grow back you know bas Rutten has it real bad bas Rutten former UFC heavyweight champion he fucked his neck up and went through a bunch of different treatments and eventually wound up getting it fused he's got a I believe two discs and maybe more in his neck fused together where he doesn't have any dish tissue they just screw the bones and together and remove the disk tissue and stabilize the area but his right arm is significantly smaller than his left arm yeah the point where he calls it baby arm and this is a former UFC heavyweight champion the world and what's ironic is that some of it came from fighting but the last thing came from doing a stunt on sons of anarchy he was in some sort of a fight the believe of sons of anarchy some sort of a fight scene where they were you know doing some things some guy was supposed to like throw him on the ground he landed on his head so all that actual fighting to get fucked up again fighting - yeah and it's bad man I mean he's slowly starting to come back but I've known bas to have this issue for uh we work together on a movie before my seven-year-old daughter was born and he had the issue then and so for seven years and still now does it still does no it's come back slowly but what I'm talking about is like I think there's some like the way that your nerves regenerate is extremely slow they can deteriorate quickly like the atrophy can happen pretty quick but the way it regenerates is extremely slow so they say once you have atrophy you're fucked like you got to act on it right away that's the thing they told me when I had Lyme disease is that um a thing that fucks you up is the nerve damage yeah and then people people lot of people go on to think they always have it but they're like you had a thing it's treated it's gone but it'll live with you for so long because of the damage to your nerves this is not this slow to recuperate I talked to a doctor about Lyme disease and he said it's not just the Lyme disease you're dealing with he said Lyme disease is this overall term he said you can get a tick that has a hundred pathogens in it when you look at that list of shit it gets scary it's scary as fuck and they connected it to more Gelinas you know more Joneses know we're challenged is a disease that a lot of times they think is psychosomatic because there's some sort of a neurotoxicity involved in Lyme disease and all these people that have more Jalen's almost without a doubt have lyme disease as well and what more Jones is is they have they start itching it themselves and they think they have fibers growing out of their body and they start hallucinating well most most of time is treated as a psychosomatic disorder like they'll get carpet fibers in their body and they'll claim these carpet fibers are coming out of their body and growing others you know but I talked to this doctor who was the only lucid person sort of explained it to me because he's a doctor and he has more gel ins and he was saying and he also has Lyme disease and he says like to a person they all have Lyme disease that he's encountered at least but he was saying that he was looking at himself in the mirror and he saw something moving across the surface of his eye and he knew it was a hallucination and he realized it was a hallucination as a doctor as an educated man of medicine and still was seeing it and was freaking out and then that and then he realized like oh there's some sort of an extreme neurotoxic effect that this stuff has you know and then he started doing like some pretty deep investigation into what constitutes Lyme disease and he's like well it's not like you know you know you have herpes you know no it's not like that it's like you get bit by something you get a bunch of shit in that cocktail of whatever that disgusting tick is carrying around and it's variable you know you might get it from one part of the East Coast and it has you know 50 things you might get it from another as 13 things yeah and but he's saying with the people that have more gels what he believes is they're suffering from hallucinations brought on by Lyme disease that's that's a thing about Lyme that I found was um about medicine and about people and about mysterious diseases is like I quit doing it now but I would get in arguments with people where like I was trying to deal with it and finding out about it and people were telling me like well here's happening me I know I was told that's not how it works because there's so much said to you bring up earlier about a doctor or chiropractor telling the wrong thing there's so much um subject subjectivity in the fucking medical world yeah fit it's like on one hand all these people are sort of going through this uh this regimen this educational regimen which is you know it's like there's like government oversight there's certain criteria you need to meet right things need to pass and you think it would sort of like have this unifying effect but people come out on the other end who've gone through kind of the same educational system tells you fuck wildly different shit yeah wildly different shit about the problems where one guy like you could walk in one guy's gonna like do a surgery and the next guys like oh no way yeah who was it that's like it's just like in his balls who was it wasn't steve-o right who the fuck was it said they Aussie yeah you know I think Andrew Santino he was telling me that he went to he had a cyst in his balls and he thought he had ball cancer went to a doctor and one doctor told him that he has excess come stored up in his balls sperm that stored up in his balls and that's what's causing this not he went home to his wife and said where's another doctor no he wasn't married at the time he was young man that go ahead and the second doctor said who the fuck was that doctor that guy should lose his ability to practice like you don't get calm stored up in your balls and it makes some sort of a knot like he's like that's exam who told you this in a fucking real practicing doctor told him that yeah I used to go in during when I was younger I'd go into been thinking it was like going to feels like going to get an oil change right like you could have twenty people they're all gonna change your oil like the same way yeah what we do is we drain it and put new shit in I'm like great now I realize that this fucker roll the dice man roll the dice and here's Norton you're gonna try to channel mitigate that by doing some research but it really is I love the guys gonna tell me he's not gonna tell me the same thing their guy's going to tell me the big thing when it comes to health and this is one of the things that I have a big problem with to anything dealing with the back is preventative maintenance is like one of the most important things for back health we're sitting in desks all day and most people are not sitting up straight they're not sitting good thing is like one of those balls those gym balls as big balance balls those are great to sit on because they force you to kind of stabilize yourself and use your core muscles or some sort of an ergonomic chair forcing you to stabilize but doctors not telling you hey man you got to take a yoga class a couple days a week you know you got to do something to straighten out your posture you got to do something to make sure that your spine is strong enough to be carrying your but you can't slump forward because you're putting undue pressure on these different portions of your back there's a significant amount of doctors are just not fucking telling you that like oh yeah your disc is bulging we're going to have to do a discectomy no worries it's outpatient outpatient procedure but then I'm telling you is they're they're chopping off of a chunk of this finite material there's a small amount of material that separates your discs and when they talk about oh I have disc degenerative disorder it's a disease my discs non-stop it's not disease what's going on is you're compressing your body through weight lifting through extreme exercise your body is slowly getting smushed down you're not allowing it to recover you're not stretching it out you're not strengthening all those core muscles you're not giving it some time off you're probably engaging the same damaging activity over and over again and toughing it out if there's one thing you should never fucking tough out it's a back issue anytime there's something going on with your back don't tough it out don't try to work through it just don't because you're going to fuck it up worse and then it's going to get to a point where it just does not recover and then you're gonna have to get surgery yeah man this is all this is making me super self-conscious about how I sit like Larry King man so when I had a chair and I do I used too much more I do try to sit up as much as I can now but these chairs have I've been here I went away for a couple days trying to sit straighter I just dare you sitting all nice for three hours I try man I didn't always used to be good at it I used to slump quite a bit before I had back issues I got to catch up these chairs are called capisco chairs they're from Peugeot Depot you can go to or go depot.com and get these fucking things they're the shit they're they're comfortable enough to sit in too I've been on some of them where your knees slide in and there's a pad against your shin yeah those are kind of gross these seem much more like an actual chair but they're super comfortable what's it called its called a capisco Sarika drink I know ergo depot.com no they didn't pay me to say that but these things are the shit but backs man's VAX are the one thing like when people have these heavy pack outs and everybody likes to pride themselves and all packed out 150 pounds seven miles yeah don't I'm telling I'm prone to saying those kind of things I tell everybody pack takes 75 and do it twice please and even that's a lot man I have this new things and why do people what I like to talk about cuz they want to be badasses yeah but you'd never be like yeah man jumped out from chalk and just jumped away right in time hope you tell their friends too you know Mike he packed out two elk quarters on his back you do too fucking savage and I go Mike's probably gonna have no legs hey dudes the song dumbass it's fucking legs are gonna stop working there's probably like got a massive bulge in his back no I'm guilty because I traffic in those stories and when I hear those stories I'm like right on bro well you know how hard it is that's why when you've done a pack out a real pack out you know how hardest I remember when we shot that mule deer right there in Montana and we only walked like what was it two miles maybe yeah and we had the meat split up between like three of us so it was probably only like 50 pounds on everybody's back I was like holy shit once he finally got the camp to miles pretty pretty flat it wasn't that hilly yeah if you're not accustomed to it it's lobbying exhausting yeah it's like you're not accustomed to getting bit by bees six times a day it's overwhelming so I should tell people that the outdoorsman's I know company that you you like their place as well they make an atlas trainer now it's a how you were messing with that fucking girl you got a weight you put on yeah it's a like an Olympic late its it slides in like a host and it clamps down I thought maybe you rigged that up yourself no no they're selling it now it's their thing I saw that yeah I thought it's like he said I thought you'd like gone down to the hardware store and I knew the frame buys they recognize though I know guys do it but usually they use sandbags yeah put sandbags in their backpack and get used it makes a big difference and it's an incredible work it doesn't shift doesn't shift at all and you really lock they're not gonna lace you have the risk like tweaking right like it's strength but it's not because when you shit's wiggling around then it like I don't know that doesn't really make you stronger just makes you more inclined like fuck something up yeah the twist funny yeah no I agree you know but I just think poor people just please just just exercise your back treat it like it's like brushing your teeth just to take yoga you don't have to take it even just get some youtube videos they're free they're available everywhere just just do something to strengthen your back you will prevent most people don't want to listen to this and they're not going to do it people are lazy as fuck you will prevent a host of issues that people have just by exercising your back simple stuff there there's the Atlas trainer right there yeah you could do chin-ups on if you're a fucking Savage look at this guy it's an animal but um yeah you could carry up to 90 pounds that thing so it'll take two I bet it'll take 100 pound plates to understand off the plates design for it the pack rather is designed for it that's a good idea to do pull-ups that Sun bit John yeah I use a weight belt I put like a belt and I hang a kettlebell in between my legs I put a 50 pound kettlebell on a chain and I do chin-ups like that really yeah well it's hanging where it's right between my legs like it's a big leather straps fall across your leg right in between my back on my hip like this and then there's like a chain in between my legs and the kettlebell hangs in between my legs but it's not getting you screw at all no no no no swinging low swing you got to make sure your legs are separated so it's not cracking against your knees but you know when you're doing chin-ups it's just hang in there no shit yeah they say that that's the best way to get more reps in with your chin-ups is not to try like 1920 the actual best way is do less but with heavy weights do like you know put a weight vest on or hang out you know 70 pound kettlebell between your legs yeah I've run it down three or four yeah but again you run the risk of injury because it's a maybe that's why I've never done Hey yeah you're putting a lot you got to build yourself up to it you know that's what also one of the big things that happens to people when they start exercising these try to go too hard to they go to footballs is they as I remember a various times not running for a long time then be like yeah I'm gonna start running and going a 5-mile run I'm just running now for just a little over a month I got a friend who's a runner and um that he's rec you know hobbyist but runs marathons and he never did before but he was saying uh he was taught he wrote he's a writer so he's been writing about that a little bit and you saying he just wrote a piece about um you don't run to get in shape you got to get in shape then start running yeah good idea so smart we say there are some steps there's some if you're just like a slob right there's some things you need to get taken care of before you embark on that smart is a ground there's ground work that needs to be done yeah to get ready for the run I talked to I don't like to ever discourage people from doing jiu-jitsu but I talked to a buddy of mine who just did jujitsu from he's 43 years of slovenly behavior no exercise whatsoever other than the occasional pickup basketball game for like seven years now and then he started doing jujitsu an immediate Lee's body's falling apart I'm like okay I know this is gonna be hard for you to do but if you really want to do it you got to get in shape first yeah just just start out with um wrestling and got into armwrestling Steven oh you got to get out of here 3:15 listen man you got one of the best podcasts in the world fucking awesome I love listening to it I'm so happy to do it and I think you got the
