the Joe Rogan experience another one that I remember early on early on John Jones he wasn't anything then it's for know maybe something like that meeting him talking about shit and I could talk about this now because it's not no longer a banned substance in the UFC but like talking about weed yeah and it was like yeah let's smoke bro he wasn't anything it wasn't anything and just going like he's like who's gonna go rogue ins got a piece in his hotel room and texting you flip phone texting you back when it wasn't cool you'd have to have like hip to have a flip phone where was like that's all anybody had that's how long ago and then just going like maybe it's that maybe there's early iPhone but like just going hey man are you up you know I gotta time go to sleep and we was like fuck John I think he doesn't want us up there and then like no no let's go he's got the weed let's go because some fan gave it to us right you had this fucking tin like tinfoil of weed and and just knocking your door like what and you're like you were he were two retired and it was like um do you have that we'd like to come on I wanna go sleeps like me and John want to smoke and you're like you looked at us you open the door fully he looked at me and this young fighter and you were like come on in we all smoke pot together in this hotel room and fuckin wherever it was I think Montreal actually Montreal yeah yeah and just a fun time and then seeing this guy move on to become the baddest motherfucker on the planet well we also had a conversation with him about I was I wanted him to go to a different camp that's right he was training in fucking YouTube videos in New York yeah well he's in a garage you're too good Mike you should be in a real can that's right we have that over weed in the hotel room he's like you really think so I go I know so I know I go you only have a certain amount of time in this thing I go and your time should be invested with a real coach who's gonna hone your skills I go you you could be an all-time great man Wow yeah I member tell him that he's like you really think so I go I know so I know so you you really got to move on I forgot about that part yeah how influential is that on the fucking future of mixed martial arts I hope it helped I feel like I retain enough strength to be good at what I need to so burn yourself I don't burn myself out you know because like I the oldest people in the world weren't athletes you know they're kind of people who didn't burn themselves out to write so I my theory on Ligeti is like don't overdo it I don't need to necessarily be over trained for what I do a lot of the skill a lot of the winning that I do competitively is from a skill it's not so much from being super strong having crazy cardio it's making a choice about which wave how I'm gonna approach him ride that wave and I have to get to scores every thirty minutes when I compete so it's like I got this 30-minute window I need you ready for I don't need to be like in crazy crazy shape because so what is it that held other guys back in the past I I think there's a number of factors I think you have to naturally be really competitive like in your when you were born in your home somehow you had to maybe you needed something to prove you know I I was kind of like you know growing up I sort of looked back at it and got a laugh like I maybe I couldn't get the girl I liked because she liked an older guy or you know I didn't have we didn't really have any money in my family so I wanted to make some money I had an older brother who kind of picked on me but I hung out with him and played football with his friends that were all three years older than me so I had to be strong you know I had to be tough and fast I had to be smart that's the case with a lot of guys older brothers you know the brothers that they couldn't really compete with like this motherfucker and so every night would just eat away at yeah yeah I think it I think it did and there was always that you know my brother and I have I think we have a pretty good relationship now and I don't think he would disagree with me that we kind of ding you along for 20 years or more but and then the other thing is about Huawei I hate trashing Huawei but I also kind of love thrashing well way is they have a lot of money to pay celebrities to tweet ads for wow way basically gal gadot being one of them right and you heard this story so she's tweeted a bunch of Huawei ads and I noticed that while she's a brand ambassador for a while way tweeting ads about how much she loves her Huawei phone if you look in the details of the tweet it's always via Twitter for iPhone oh and it's like whatever she can use an iPhone I don't care but I thought it was funny so I just tweeted it it's very it blew up and I had Huawei reach out to me like how did you find this how did you know where did you this is a is this a mistake like could this be a like has this ever malfunction I'm like no this is that's how Twitter works like you can see the data it's clearly an iPhone and I thought that's hilarious my screenshot and so not only did gal gadot bomb gal gadot the fucking Wonder Woman lady yeah Wonder Woman ah so Wonder Woman you fucking fake from an iPhone it's just funny because look at the picture there she blocked you not only get she blocked me but Huawei since then has tweeted all they deleted like her latest tweets and reposted them from an Android phone and she's tweeted from Android phone ever since I'll give a respect for that Wow they probably told her you know lose all that cash there's no way she's tweeting like this she has a team I get it but like whoever was on her team tweeting from an iPhone like the fact that she blocked you those got the rose that's gross no I didn't I think well I tagged her an inch per I was just getting bashed by like people going wow you're using an edge like an iPhone why I think event it was like a year later she hand blocks me it was really funny oh she unblocked blocks me thanks again so he actually changed his position slightly because when he ran for president he said not only am i against marijuana being legal at a federal level I wouldn't even let the individual states decide whether or not they want legal marijuana so in other words he would prosecute the states like Colorado and California that have legal marijuana using federal law and right there he softened his position slightly and he said well leave it up to the states and let them decide so do you think that's because he knows he'll never be President no I think he still wants to be President there's no fucking way I think he's gonna run again no I don't know if he's gonna run in 2020 but 2024 first of all the the odds of that guy's gonna make it eight more years with that FairPoint morbidly obese carcass he's moving his bond around with didn't he get a stapler did he get his stomach fuckin suit you know somebody pointed that out I didn't know that I never saw those stories I'm not denying that it's true but I just never heard it but if he did didn't work well I had a friend who ate through two of those he when you're a date that's what I'm saying anyway about food he's addicted to food that's knit like this is unquestionably he's an addict do you think nobody said that to him in his life or no look look how much thinner you go okay okay and he did this oh I guess he did this before the presidential race cuz he wanted to mm make it but then he got fat again yeah mm-hmm so he was rotund before he was like a bag of water before and then you know he he trimmed himself down yeah and it's funny because I don't think in any way he realizes the hypocrisy of having his own you know issue with food and he would argue hey man listen I'm gonna eat what I want it's a freedom choice when it comes to freedom for somebody to decide to tweak their consciousness slightly all of a sudden he says you shouldn't be allowed to do that well that's what's preposterous the idea that you mean even with what he said about alcohol didn't make any sense like would you mean alcohol illegal well we tried already it's called prohibition okay but let's pretend that you had some sort of an ability to keep that from you know going sideways again let's start from the beginning would you want alcohol to be legal or not if you could wave your hand and there would be no more problems that are alcohol associated would you do that and make it illegal versus give a grown adult the possibility of deciding whether or not they want to drink or not drink yeah he's not being consistent in his logic that's the point is that he's willing to say I'm thinking about Donuts but he even he even mentioned prohibition there but that makes my point not his point yes because that's when the Mafia got incredibly powerful because you pushed all the alcohol sales underground and they got all the power and the money as a result of it and that's when crime has shot through the roof so if you want to decrease violent crime and the drug war yeah one of the most transformative moments of my life was when I met spot Minnie in person which is one of the legged robots in Boston Dynamics for the first time when I met them I meant that little fella there was I know exactly how it works I know exactly how every aspect of it works it's just a dumb robot but when I met him and he got up and he looked at me Tara's right there have you seen dance now yeah at the dance the dance is crazy it's but see it's not crazy on the technical side it's like it's crazy engineered it's obvious it's programmed but it's crazy to watch like wow there's something the the reason the moment was transformative is I know exactly how it works and yet by watching it something about the feeling of it you're like this thing is alive hmm and there was this terrifying moment not terrifying with terrifying and appealing where this is the future right like this thing like this thing represents some future that is totally that we don't cannot understand just like a future in the 18th century of future with planes and smartphones was something who could understand that this thing that little dog could have had a human consciousness in it that was the feeling I had and I don't know exactly how it works has nothing close to the intelligence but it just gives you this picture of what the possibilities are of these living creatures and I think that's what people feel when they see basta dynamics look all awesome this thing running around is they don't care about the technicalities and how far away we are they see it look this thing is pretty human and the possibilities of human like things that supersede humans and can evolve and learn so quickly exponentially fast is this terrifying frontier that that really makes us think as it did for me I'm sure a bull rider would look at free soloing and be like what a crazy dude you know everybody looks at another sport that's great and honestly I look at fighting and I'm like duh seems totally outrageous like why would you want some other dude beat you to death in a cage like that's it's great it is outrageous but if you can get good enough or you can avoid yeah damage yeah and then the tool and the damage it's kind of the same but even landing the damage to the certain extent you're like oh you're hurting somebody else the pleasure of the crowd you think that's kind of messed up yeah no you know it's a very weird feeling knocking someone out is one of the weirdest feelings because part of you is happy that it's not you but part of you is like looking down with that guy that's just got flatlined and you're like whoa that could have been made how much the fighters like hold back you know because I feel like you kind of have to like go to the death but then if you actually like punch somebody so hard they died or something I mean obviously you'd feel horrible right well you don't look back at all with that so I'm saying but so it's like you don't hold back at all but then if you actually killed somebody wouldn't you feel horrible it's very rare that someone dies in mixed martial arts believe it or not well yeah no I mean I know that but but it's possible yes and it has happened and it's sort of like it has happened very very rarely in mixed martial arts never in the UFC but in boxing it happens more often and with one of the reasons why it happens more often in boxing because you're only punching in MMA you're taking people down yeah people are tapping out because they're paying weird yeah well it's also there's more options to defend yourself you're not just getting battered against the ropes they're also nowadays much better at stopping a fight when a fighter is clearly compromised when they're they're really fucked up in the old days they used to let guys just get battered you know that doesn't sit well with me I'm just like yeah but that's not I'm not a fighter well it's like that's about climbing is there's this real elemental appeal to just you in the mountain and its nature and it's beautiful and it's like very peaceful and calm it's like so different than having thousands of people screaming at you as you punch them down the face over and over just like dude that's just that's not my scene I was out 2017 Halloween I was a 400 pounds dressed up as a skeleton and I go to this fancy dress party in it I'm walking around and I'm thinking these are all young kids compared to me I'm 30 and I feel like I was the oldest guy in there like 29 I was like what am I doing here is this what you want for your life and I thought yourself this is not me and no matter how many people told me before this where I was going wrong walls doing you need to act your life you can only change your life if you want to change and I left and everyone said he going home early said yeah I left at 9 o'clock I went home and I got back home I didn't say anything to the wife who went straight upstairs into a dark room and I took bursts chief had skeleton suit off and I was sat there and I got me knees and I was praying and begging God to help me and at this point I'd never I've never begged or cried to God to help me before I prayed a lot all my life but I've never been in this physical state before I can feel tears running down my face my chest was wet with tears because I knew I couldn't do it on my own it was impossible for me because I tried and tried and tried and ended up back in the pub back drinking I almost accepted that that was gonna be my fate an alcoholic so I was on my knees in his bedroom after praying for about ten minutes I got up and I felt the weight of the wall was lifted off my shoulders and for the first time in years I knew I was gonna make a comeback and I called my wife I said Paris parish is a bore she fought was drunk coming home from the pub I said Monday morning I start to regain mission to try and get the heavyweight championship of the world back she said yeah yeah yeah because before this every time I'd offer beer I'd come back and I'm gonna be the heavyweight champion of the world again because it was it was the alcohol talking so I was like the man who called wolf a thousand times on this this stupid career that I was living on the past was thinking about years before glory days and after this prayer got up a said right this has gotta be she didn't believe me one second but even when I speak to her now she says that night you told me that she said you're a difference in your voice something happened [Applause]
