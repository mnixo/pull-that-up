hello freak bitches um I want to talk for a little bit about the cryotherapy because this is something that I emailed you when there was a disturbing article that was sort of pooh-poohing the benefits cryotherapy and the the article was I thought it was really poorly well poorly done poorly researched and it was also it was they studied really subjective things like how sore you felt after exercise and whether or not it benefited for them from that but but there are real positive benefits of cryotherapy that are measurable yes and that happened well first of all that article that you're referring to from that whatever website it was but the article was a Steve novella is a guy and I think what he did is he rushed to put this article out because that woman died in Las Vegas from cryotherapy and it was a really tragic incident she was by herself there's two different types of cryotherapy one of the things we should point out first of all I don't have any because I've been accused of this I just say right now I'm any vested interest in cryotherapy I don't own any of it I don't I don't make any money from it nothing I enjoy the benefits of it and I use it but this woman who did it she did the type there's two kinds one of them it goes from the neck down so you stand in this booth your head is above breathing in normal oxygen but below you is liquid nitrogen you can't read that stuff in that's why your head is not under if you do breathe that stuff in you don't have any oxygen you'll black out and that's what happened to her she did it by herself it was poorly setup and apparently she was quite short so her head was kind of below the the limit where he's supposed to be so she was breathing in the liquid nitrogen and she fell asleep and blacked out see she went to one of those I thought she was in like no full line no no the full-on ones are much rarer and what the full-on ones do is they supercool the air with the nitrogen so the air itself is pumped in really that's what I did yes yeah that's what you did and that's we're gonna do today - if you have time I love it okay so I loved it um that one you can breathe in it's just fucking unbelievably cold okay so the one that she did it was she set it up by herself which you're never supposed to do you're always supposed to have supervision it wasn't whether or not I mean she's the only person I've ever heard of this died from this and it's a horrible trick she's committing suicide I don't know if she was just work there and sometimes women will they'll put their face under it because they want the effects of a cryo facial this cryo facial has been shown to improve collagen and smile therapy actually prevents it's taught it inhibits enzymes that break down collagen called collagen Aizaz and that's actually part of the reason it helps with arthritis because our collagen Aizaz break down collagen and they break down like you know the tendons collagen around the tendons and stuff and it can cause arthritis arthritis pain so doing it would make sense why you'd want to do something cryo because it it would have an effect on your skin yeah women love it when they get their face done apparently they get or vain men - or any man well you have to be vain to wear collagen but the point being that article came out and all these people were saying Oh see I told you cryotherapy was bullshit I'm like oh my god what a piss-poor article and it was all talking about soreness and one of the things that he said that really drove me crazy was you you'd get just as much benefit from a cool-down and a stretch after a workout I'm like tell that to these fucking people that I see that go there all the time that do it twice a day because they have severe arthritis and it's the only thing that's given them any form of freedom of movement of their hands like I know a bunch of people that go there that have had some pretty debilitating arthritis and this has given them relief where nothing else was giving it to them other than like pretty severe pharmaceutical drugs or ibuprofen at high levels or what you were talking about there's a lady that goes to my thing which she was raving about how she could finally stretch her hands out like her hands had been like locked in this position for years yeah it has I mean the the cold itself is a hormetic stressor that is activating a variety of anti inflammatory pathways antioxidant pathways you know and it's also last time I think on the podcast we talked about it increases norepinephrine well norepinephrine itself it can pick so cryotherapy and cold water immersion are two forms of you know cold exposure cryotherapy just two minutes at like a- 180 Fahrenheit can increase norepinephrine to fold the so you know to fold over what you were before you went in and norepinephrine in addition to the brain benefits we were talking about how it makes you feel good how it helps with learning it also is a very pone anti flat inflammatory so it inhibits the production of TNF alpha which is very it's kind of like in arthritis TNF alpha is kind of like going haywire you're making too much TNF alpha and what happens is TNF alpha is a signaling molecule to your immune cells that says hey there's an infection here because that's normally what happens when you released NF alpha is because there's some bacteria or some something that you need to kill and so your immune cells all they see is the signal they don't know what's causing it they don't know that it's because your gut cells and your immune cells in your gut are seeing bacteria because of your poor diet or whatever and so that's getting into the bloodstream and causing chronic inflammation it doesn't know that it all it knows is that this means there's a threat and so they start to increase the production of your immune cells make hypochlorite which is like bleach so you're making bleach in your body to kill things and that's happened in chronically that's going to cause some tissue damage just going to cause pain it also they also make hydrogen peroxide you make that and your knee tails will make that so cryotherapy inhibits the signaling molecule so that your immune cells quiet down because now they're not seeing that signal that says come on hey fire up fire up it's not there so that's that's a good thing to inhibit TNF alpha and like I said with the collagen aids as well but there are so many I'd you know I just spent two weeks just researching and reading I've been doing some cold exposures you know like cold shower and also jumping in the ocean ice baths and I really liked the cryotherapy that I did last time we were here and you know so I've been very interested in it like understanding why you feel so good and so I did a some reading on it and there's so many different positive hormetic benefits from doing cryotherapy so you have you know the the the anti-inflammatory part and this and this also it's been shown that doing like ten sessions of cryotherapy in a row it increases the expression of glutathione reductase by twofold and another Glu of that fly own related enzyme glutathione peroxide by like 68% and these are these enzymes like you could be taking all the liposomal glutathione you want like it's not going to matter if you don't have the enzymes active to use it so you could take liposomal glutathione and that's great you're increasing you know you're you make glutathione inside of your cells but we can't make as much of it as we get older but if you if you take it you don't have the enzymes that use it to actually do the good stuff active that it doesn't matter so cryotherapy it was shown to activate two different include on related enzymes which is pretty awesome so enhance your body's ability to absorb glutathione no it doesn't enhance your body's ability to absorb it it enhances your body's ability to use it so if you fighting it liposomal glutathione and then you're using cryotherapy it would enhance it so what I'm saying is that the liposomal glutathione that you take all that does is increase glutathione inside of your cells glutathione inside of your cells does nothing without enzymes that use it to to basically sequester damaging inflammatory things and the cryotherapy increased activates the enzymes that use it so it's like great I have all this glutathione sitting around in my cells that I've been taking and I also now have the enzymes that use it to do good stuff now are being turned on okay that what was very interesting is that it took like multiple sessions before before those got acted like ten to twenty ten and one at least ten and yet and then the other study was twenty seven was it consecutively I'm dead ten days in a row yeah ten days in a row but what the first day I didn't do it so that that was also very interesting so it's almost like your body's saying okay this crazy fuck is going to do it's an adaptive response yes yeah your body's preparing for war it's like it's stressful you know it's a stressful response the other thing that's really cool that we didn't talk about last minute podcast is the thermogenic effect when you when you release norepinephrine so that's I keep going back to that because it's like you can't refute that steve novella no one no debunk er no skeptic no I don't care who you are you can't it's just it's consistent in every type of cold exposure period it's it's it's consensus you release norepinephrine well there always seems to be some sort of a rationalization with a lot of the debunking like whether it's the benefits of exercise whether it's the benefits of cryotherapy that's almost like a rationalization for not doing it it's like you're looking for an excuse to not do it and not really very objective yes that was which was disturbing about it's like this is like your pooh-poohing something that's alright people great yeah yeah I it was clear I mean after I especially especially after I did the two weeks of research and I think there's a kind of mentality when you're sometimes people like to think I'm a deep bunker and I'm not I am I am intentionally like because if you get in this mentality of always debunking something you're it's like this spiral and you can't see the good like you can't keep an open mind to like get past you're like what's in your box that you know and that's very dangerous yeah I think that anything last blind spot it is and there are a lot of scientists that I know they're very smart extremely smart but they are in that loop where it's like just they have to debunk and criticize like and it's like you know at some point huge discoveries are made by like connecting the dots and like getting past that like I mean you have to be critical being critical is very important but you also like I think there's a certain threshold where you just start to like you know you get to this like spiral that was also was infuriating about this is the data's out there this is not like it's not there's no data it's like he made a cursory examination of the evidence and what he chose to focus on was it was so subjective he focused on a study that tested muscle soreness post exercise with cryotherapy well actually the study that he referred to as a meta-analysis and it was subjective but it actually came to the conclusion that there were benefits however it said more studies and that needed to be done because there wasn't large enough sample sizes and the quality of data was poor because they were not double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trials and i have to say to you so that so they're actually what he recited in that article there was a positive effect of the cryo but the problem is is that because they followed up with oh well it's poor quality basically poor science that the reality is is that you can't do a double-blinded placebo-controlled controlled trial with cryotherapy like you're going to be cold and you're going to be put in this chamber where there's like cold or you're not and you're gonna know oh you know so anyways I thought that was ridiculous I was like whatever I'm in Oregon I'm gonna read about this stuff just because I know I've experienced it there's definitely something going on and one of the things that happens is the norepinephrine and when you release when you release that in a warp nephron it activates a pathway inside of your cells that basically are it causes your energy metabolism to ramp up because you're trying to generate heat you want basically your body wants to your body is saying I don't want to die I need to make heat and so a couple of ways it can do that one it can shiver and shivering is when your muscles start to contract and that it requires energy for your muscles to like twitch it's very it's not very thermodynamically favorable so you it's not a good way to generate heat but you generate heat because you have to like ramp up to twitch but then what happens after you've been exposed and actually this happened to me because we did the cryo twice the first time I did it I was shivering like the entire time I was shivering it was really crazy because I've never shivered like that in my life but the second time I went in I did not shiver and after reading about it what happens is your body quickly adapt so you adapt and what happens is non shivering thermogenesis so the norepinephrine causes your mitochondria which are the energy producing little organelles inside of your cells well it causes them in your in your adipose tissue to like get activated I mean it does this by increasing the expression of a gene called UC p1 which basically freaks your mitochondria out because your mitochondria are kind of like batteries they're charged they have a negative charge on the inside and a positive charge on the outside well you see p1 totally uncouples that so that there's no more charge and that charge is very important because when that charge is there your body knows okay I've been making energy because the way you make the charge is by making energy so when the charge goes away your body's like oh my god I've got no energy so it just starts to ramp up fat metabolism so it does that and you start to make more mitochondria so you're you're making more mitochondria you're cells and this is often called brown fat so you can actually the reason it's called brown fat is because when you look at a fat cell under the microscope if it has more mitochondria then it looks Brown so you actually start to burn fat and you have this thermogenic because you're burning fat it's creating heat as a by-product so you're warming your body but it has this nice side effect of burning fat which people like and the more you expose yourself to the cold the more you're browning your fat the more you're increasing those mitochondria your fat which means the next time you're in the cold you can tolerate it longer so people that have been exposing themselves to cold like yourself when you're doing the cryo you know often you actually can tolerate the colder for longer periods of time because you have more mitochondria in your fat cells and this allows you to then generate more heat so and this has been shown in people people that have been exposed to cold that they've been shown to increase their their brown adipose tissue but like 38% if they're exposed to 10 days of 50 degree air like outside air just regular air that's it 50 degrees all day all day 10 days so like 6 hours a day spoutin like you know New York and the I don't know pretty winter fall I don't know something like that being out there for six hours for 10 days in a row men were able to increase their brown adipose tissue by 38% that's why people from the east coast or from the Northeast that moved to a Californian and they go back during the winter they go home I blood got too thin well it really is there really is like a physical factor of your body not being accustomed to dealing with cold yeah you adapt you adapt and that's that's what brown adipose tissue and that's really one call how cold got really popular popularized because people wanted to use it as a hack to lose weight you know so they were like oh if I did these cold showers I use it for the brain benefits because I noticed I feel really good and also more focused so I like that and a lot of people I've talked to have felt the same way but then I think the other part of this article was the the effects of it blunting some of the strength training and you know I talked about this in this report that I wrote or the in the podcast that I released on and it's so complicated I had to like to sit there and literally just read for like two weeks to try to figure it out because you know the problem is is that exercise is a hormone extra cold is a chromatic stress so exercise itself you need some of the inflammation you need the bad stuff to get the good stuff that's how it works right but you know the inflammation that's happening happens while you're exercising and up to one hour after one hour after that's when the whole hormetic response kicks in and this has been shown in multiple studies one hour seems to be when the anti inflammatory response kicks in so you've generated the inflammation then now you've got the anti inflammatory effects if you do a cold exposure within that hour after exercising it's possible you may blunt some of the inflammatory effects that the exercise is inducing because the cold is activating anti inflammatory genes too early now I don't know that for certain but I do know that this the study that showed there was one study that showed strength training if you did it there was if you did cryotherapy immediately like immediately after cold was actually cold water immersion which is not not the same as the crowd chamber that it blunted some of the anabolic signaling and so there was like some of the muscle mass was was not gained but you know there's other studies that have been done that have shown for some reason all the endurance guys they always wait an hour it's kind of weird so what I'm wondering is if people that are doing this research like sit down take a step back you know people are always in a second abolish and abolish you know is a real big publish or perish mentality in science where it's like your bread and butter depends on you publishing and so you're just constantly trying to get that data out there but you really I think things are so complicated just to sit down take a look at everything that's out there and start to go wait a minute there's lots of little details that need to be considered to design this trial correctly so I'm hoping that at least for those people doing strengthening that they'll do one where they actually wait until an hour because there's been other studies where they're that strength strength training in combination with cryotherapy done much later even the next day there were actually benefits performance benefits like they're able to do more of those leg curl things I don't know what they call leg extensions yes leg extensions those you know so you know III don't really know what's going on but what I do know is that it seems as though it's very likely doing the cryotherapy like immediately after and now then again if you're if you're talking about someone that's doing like there's been studies that have been published showing that people that are doing two bouts of exercise so they're like riding a bike and then they're waiting whatever 30 minutes and then they go and run or something if they do cold water immersion in between those they actually have performance enhancements you know if they wait I start they do it between two bouts of exercise some of that's due to the fact that cold on the cold water it seems to improve heart rate variability it's actually been shown to improve about like two to threefold so heart rate variability is the change in oscillation between heartbeats and it's also people people judge the heart recovery from a workouts as soon as you're done with an intense workout the ability of your heart rate to lower immediately within minutes that's like a marker of heart rate variability and it's supposed to be good because your part's able to deal with these stressful changes you know because when you're making cortisol or something your heart starts racing more or some of these other stress hormones so it's been shown to improve that and having being able to have your heart rate slower right after a workout and then you immediately going to do a workout again you can imagine there would be in the performance enhancement with with that so there's also there's a difference in the the physiological response between cold water immersion and cryotherapy right well it depends um you know if you're there there are differences in the ability for those two different modalities to extract heat from the body you know if you if we're talking about submerging ourselves in cold water up to our shoulders water or ice isn't much better it's much better at extracting heat from the body than air but surface area also plays a role and and the temperature change so if you're in sitting in cold water that's 57 degrees that's not as cold as going into a - 180 or whatever cryo chamber but you can also sit in the cold water for a lot longer yeah so guys do it for 15 minutes I think that there has been a study that compared the more epinephrine release 20 seconds at 40 degree water up to the shoulders is can terrible - two minutes at - standard something 180 - 184 for norepinephrine for norepinephrine but a lot of this effects are mediated from nora norepinephrine but listen 20 seconds at 40 degree versus 2 minutes so imagine imagine staying in the water for five minutes in that and this has been shown so if you have someone that stays in water 57 degree water for an hour they increase their norepinephrine by fivefold instead of twofold so you have a more robust response so it could be good but it could be bad if you're talking about doing it right after a strength training session and jump into cold water for five minutes that could that could have some you know very potent anti-inflammatory effects so the the best way to handle it would be to wait at least an hour I think yeah that makes sense what about anti inflammatory markers in the blood so there have been studies that have shown that cryotherapy lower C reactive protein which would be an inflammatory marker and in the glutathione related enzymes going up and also superoxide dismutase that would be a marker for inflammation because there's also a decreased inflammation when you have more of those so so cryotherapy does and then also there's been marked measurements of TNF alpha going down like I said also another marker that macrophages release macrophage and hibbett or E protein or something some inflammatory you know molecule that's made there's less of it when you when cold why I can't remember this cold water immersion requires area beds cold exposure so and that was mediated through open if norepinephrine media it's a lot of stuff it's it's mediating the brain effects it's meeting in the thermogenesis it's anti-inflammatory it's anti pain people get injected with norepinephrine in their spine to alleviate pain yes because it's anti-inflammatory Wow Jesus there's probably other things going on as well so scientists science just the hard science there's plenty of evidence that there's benefits to cryotherapy oh yeah so why would anybody write an article like that um like I said there's the there's the bad article that was the anabolic blunting effects which was done immediately after exercise which made a huge splash because it's like well you're right your gains and then you have the the hardcore very skeptical people that are like well the quality of data you know well the thing is is that there's a large body of data and sometimes if you can't have a double-blind placebo-controlled trial then you have to look at mechanism you have to look at animal studies combined with human studies you have to understand what's going on you can't refute the norepinephrine we know that norepinephrine is doing all these things you know so I think you just have to be very comprehensive especially when the the when you know there's the argument that the there's no placebo control trials or you know it's too subjective but there's lots of ways that it's not subjective and this has been measured in people people have measured c-reactive protein they've measured these enzyme activities they've measured these inflammatory molecules and people also in animals you know so there's a I am confident when I say that there are absolutely health benefits from doing cold exposure for your brain anti-inflammatory for poor thermogenesis you
