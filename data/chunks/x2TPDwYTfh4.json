the girag and experience give me that shit you uh did you check out my special bombing episode that I air no you told me about it we were talking about it before the podcast we it's funny we're almost three hours in we were gonna we really I mention it or two hours in um what the fuck happened you were up in Winnipeg I was over Winnipeg I was doing this club that I've done many times called rumors it's a old club it's a good club and it was a Saturday night and instead of like regular comedy club crowd it happened to be like private event people like a group of 80 was doing their corporate party you know I mean so it wasn't like it wasn't individuals buying one and two tickets right she's a giant group giant group so there was like three groups one was like 80 most 60 so you don't like it's more like you're doing a corporate like you're doing a private event you know and I talk I break it down if you if you want to listen to it's episode 172 of your mom's house and I play the audio from this thing falling off the rails and I mean it is like there was a lady who worked at the club she's been there 20 years and she told me she's I've never seen shit like that even close to that before what happened it was I mean I think it's like a combination of things happening to make it fall apart that way basically I went up there I had one guy in the front row who I fucking you know when you just hate somebody and you fixate on them because like this one guy who was like kind of mumbling talking tagging my everything I so know like yeah I bet you'd like that and you're like what what did you just say I said I said one of those guys who I fucking absolutely lost my shit I didn't lose my shit on him but I kind of tried to straighten him out and then there was a one of the groups one of the groups of like 50 50 60 people was like being super loud in like the first like really talking about and I went to talk to them they were kind of like dislike kind of shitty about it and the thing is like it's different when you when you do a regular show and you let's say you go after somebody or you go after a table you're just working on five people maybe right a group that like but then everybody else in that room has nothing to do with them right in this case it was more like mob mentality where when I was like hey go fuck yourself then the group is like I'm talking to us yeah not yet see I'm just talking to them you're talking to my group of 80 so then it was like no fuck you like but in in unison is all of them and then it just went then I tried to put it back on the rails which I was like I'm sure I can done this a thousand times let me put this back together fuck you meant like it was like there we go and then I you dude they were booing in unison for like 15 20 minutes the 80 people at this point it was more than their group so it was probably 200 people doing that oh my god yes so is their group and then other groups chimed in so yeah booing you two unrelated groups yes yes whoa it was pretty crazy and then they're like bring back the I had a black feature act like bring back the black guy like screaming that screaming it man and it went and I here's the thing I resigned to the fact that it was so crazy mm-hmm it was less emotional and I talked about this on that episode then your standard bombing when you're bombing and a regular bomber it's just not going your way you start to sweat and you're like man this fucking sucks we're shooing dicks up here but like and that and that like emotionally affects you this was different in that I felt like their response to me was so outrageous like I felt like it was unwarranted how upset they were that it affected me less like I was just standing up there I was like all right guys here you ready for some more jokes as they're booing me you know like not as I wasn't as flustered as I've been during a real bomb yes so you were just dealing with a giant group of cunts yes school of cunts yes swimming through your pond yeah exactly why didn't the club do something about that that's that's the only part I like I take responsibility of that I try to make it clear on that on that episode that like I take responsibility for yelling at a guy for insulting people like I'm saying I put it on myself that I made things go downhill the club takes responsibility for kind of not really policing and they like the one part is I tried I told a guy that he had to go I was like you have to go you're gone see you later and you know I've done that before sometimes I have to do that right you're out of here man right and then they were like the club came in talking they're like just give him another chance he's gonna be good now I was like I've already thrown him out like there's no we're not negotiating now right so the club asked to keep the guy there yes so nothing like that I don't know but they they now realize that that was fucked up I've talked to them and they're like that was that was all some people you can give a second chance I've most likely most of the time I've asked clubs to leave people alone like that there okay there okay yeah yeah yeah they just I just I don't do that he'll say that I'm like yeah you can't yell shit out too too confusing I've done that a bunch of times like he's okay right but this time the difference was this time I was saying get him get him out what was he saying he while this is gone he was it was the fucking he was the mumbler the the tower right so we had our first interaction we had another interaction I think the third time I said something to him I was like what the fuck did you say I forget exactly what he said and then I was like oh you're a tough guy he's like you want to step outside and find out and I was like you can go outside cuz you're out of here you're done get out of my fucking show it's my show right out of here and they were like what and his table he goes we all go go great have a great night get the fuck out of here I don't need you here that's when the crowd with the problem we felt like we were discussing what happened I was talking about it with the club the guy is that a lot of people in that room didn't hear what he was saying right they thought I was just attacking a guy for no reason right that makes sense I still take I was an asshole that night but that's you know the guy was clearly he was instigating it yeah he was a fucking cunt he was a real cunt of a guy and I didn't like him at all and you know III don't think that like like I always say I I don't have to be like pleasing to the different like you know I'm there doing comedy you came to see my stand-up if you want if you're not liking it that's cool but if you try to take over the room No well it's not just taking over the room it's interfering yeah its interface interfering with the performance and it's there's hundreds of other people yeah that have to deal with the fact that you have to deal with the sky yeah yeah it just it's it's all in how to do it and not lose your cool and when you lose your cool yeah so it's a fucking bad scene yeah terrible feeling - it's crazy and the audio is in sane I mean you've probably not heard a lot like that yeah it's a different it's not like a standard bombing I mean there's there's a lot of aggression from the crowd on and how does it end well the best part the only because I also was bummed at myself for not I was like I you know yo you always look at moments where you like I wish I had said something funny or here right it was an opportunity to be funny I really you know so I was like a lot of it I was like I was like I you know I really they want like they defeated me I was like but the only funny thing I'd said was like at one point the manager came up to the stage and he was like are you okay like he was checking it he came onstage was like cuz it was so crazy and things like you alright I was like yeah he's like do you want to keep the one I was like yeah he's like okay so he leaves and they're like yeah that's right get the fuck is a think he's telling me get off stage right and I go I go he asked me if you guys wanted me to bring back the other guy and they go yeah like they scream yes and I go I told him you guys want more of me so here I am form or Junction they're like there they go so crazy at that part these are Canadians - yeah they go for some of nicest people ever but in the very end the lady who was running the one of the private events that night like she brought her group there mmm she was in tears she was crying and they brought her on stage there like she wants to say something and I was like oh cuz my plan was just right stay here the entire time no matter what talk about recipes that you want I just don't things them yeah right she gets up there and she's like please I know I've done fundraisers here like I really wanted this to be a good night I see like how like she's a right way affected by this please give him the respect of like some just your your time and like just let him talk and their likes too fucking late for that fuck it like they're going crazy oh right she's and I see her like just like she's defeated it's like someone was beating her up right you know and I was like oh my god I go you know what this is 35 minutes in right to what's supposed to be like a 50 55 minute set there's 20 minutes to go I was like you know what um I don't I want her to have a fun night she like she like it affected me right he was so I was like I'll tell you what because you're a nice
