the Joe Rogan experience and that's really what I'm doing at a level that you can start in bed right so there's no more fucking excuses no more fucking excuses and that's so damn important because people can feel sorry for themselves they can say they can't do it they don't have the energy there to beat up that's bullshit there's always something you can do that's always something if you but if you give yourself that fucking excuse that's the problem what I love about that video is if anybody had an excuse it's that guy absolutely that guy I mean - canes giant belly blown out knees blown out back veteran paratrooper okay I mean jumping out of fucking airplanes over and over again blows his body apart and you fixed it that and he fixed it he fixed I just literally like they're so fly creditor so when I sent him the food plan right from from from Fred bushy his food plan because his food it's just regular food but like what do you have the meeting and say let's let's make there so I vegetable you'll hear me say in my program over and over and over and over and over again make the DDP why your own like and I explained the Arthur when I called him well here's what happened so he he's I sent him the food plan love you say and if he writes me back I think I can do it I'll give it a try you go crazy no I go hey awesome keep me posted but he said four words or he wrote four words I can do this I said give me your number right now and I called the motherfucker up if you say you can you say you can't you're right you know that you say you can or you say you can't you're right right do you have said that originally who Henry Ford right yeah and I would say but but what the fuck did he ever do what the fuck did he ever do but for when he said I can do it I said give me your number so I called them and I said you know we talked for about an hour two weeks later he calls me back the main thing I talked them in in in that conversation which is again what positively unstoppable is all about as important as the workout is as important as the eating plan is that 10% of the equation the 90% is right between your ear right here that six-inch piece of real estate the story you tell yourself and I said if you can really just get past that story and start re telling yourself a different story an example would be when I had when I went up for my whole thing induction speech in front of 20,000 people and millions of people in USA and on the WWE Network which is only $9.99 by the way it's like a rib bottom line is is that I wasn't in the back going oh god I hope I don't fuck this up oh god what if I forget what's gonna say oh god this sucks what if I what if I fuck up what say now saying he's gonna be the best thing ever done I'm gonna blow people away I'll make him laugh gonna make him cry I'm gonna inspire him and that was my inner voice I'm out there did the best thing I've ever done like it's the best thing I've ever done but it's about that story that you tell yourself and you get all this shit and that's why people listen to you because they want they need to be reminded it over and over and over again you know the way you think about things is so important it's so important it's almost more important than the facts right right the way and the way this guy decided that he was going to change his life that that video is so important to people I mean if there's ever that's the best testimonial video you're ever gonna see I'm running boldly with an L by my name right so I'm trying to change the Brian so it's a decent brand it's what I'm doing you put libertarian all my stuff I'm always libertarian so I'm trying to build the brand out to be a better brand so if I win the brand's better people will do that will raise my money it'll be a real third party I mean there'll be a third party in the United States which will make better Democrats and better Republicans will literally be a better nation a better politique will be better in America if I actually win this damn thing but let's say I lose Sam wrong my things my righties are wrong whatever people agree I lose doesn't matter the bold ideas are still out there what you heard what your audience heard is still there someone's gonna pick this up someone's gonna talk about it and if you're fine with that a hundred percent what yes please I want to fix things I'm not concerned with who gets the credit for it let's fix it I want a better place to live this cut is in trouble nearly it's the perfect where we're going I don't want that to be the rest of this nation we can fix steal all my stuff please steal at all awesome I hope you steal it I hope California copies me and does everything I said to be amazing please do that and be awesome but if people don't hear me if I don't get out there if I don't in the baits the agent and I don't come in second or third then no one's gonna hear me cuz I'm gonna be forgotten but if I come in second or a tight third there will be a microphone in my face for the next two years and every time it's out there I'll be saying stuff just like this again and again and again and maybe my education isn't perfect but guess what someone will figure out the right one it won't be just keep giving it money it won't be that it'll be something that'll actually work it'll be something brand new and exciting and get people to come back to our state what I don't want is what's happening now is kids get educated they leave they don't come back look educated someplace else and never come back it's the wrong answer I'm really into crafts from shit man I always have been I love handmade pool cues and this desk which is a handmade desk and I feel like it's one of the things that I really appreciate in this modern digital world and I also feel like unfortunately it may be one of the things that's slipping away it definitely is slipping away I think with um you know with technology technology has been great for us and a lot of different ways like we couldn't be fucking talking into a piece of metal right and it's recorded on a computer like it does a lot of great things but in doing all those great things it actually has taken us away from really creating and working with our hands and so like you know even this whole like farm-to-table movement where people even grown their own vegetables you got your own chickens you there they're laying eggs for you like knowing where this stuff is coming from having like firsthand contact with that just having that relationship in general with it brings so much more value to the overall experience of eating those eggs or using that knife or sitting at this fucking table right now and it seems like a fairly recent movement in that direction right like it feels like things got so digital that people like whoa whoa whoa with the Facebook and the fuckin Instagram I'm you know I want a wood table yeah I want to saw this man myself yeah your hands line hey I don't want to eat your elastic yeah I want real stuff and there's something about handmade things whether it's a handmade pair of boots our handmade bag like this like there's something about things that are made by hand that people get a like a deep appreciation of from for sure well and I think I think it also kind of goes back like I was saying like it's technology is advanced we've kind of grown away from these kind of what's considered like blue-collar work yeah a craftsmanship kind of work but I think people really are driven by a sense of achievement and when you're doing data entry that literally millions of people fucking monkeys can be trained to do not today like diminishing anything that anybody's doing but literally like to be able to go into a craft and to and have a hands-on experience is very very very very different and that sense of achievement even when somebody comes out of something and maybe I taught a class on how to make a knife and it looks like a fucking turd they're gonna think it looks like the most beautiful fucking knife they've ever seen in their life because their hands and their creatively they have touched their energy yeah they're their sweat and pop probably some of their blood is put into creating that thing and that brings that much more value to it like like I was like I was saying earlier you could get kids to believe in anything you get brain I could I could get my son into Satan easily he'd be all all about Lucifer boom I got him into the brown kids little kids you know yeah totally he's he's so into the Dodgers because his grandpa is into the Dodger so he's all about the Dodgers and I got him into the Browns he's all in the Browns not too because I'm I could get him into anything so I sat him down and I say you were but I'm gonna sit you down and I'm gonna show you the master of the nunchucks and it's Bruce Lee he's number one he's dead right he's the greatest martial artist of all time I broke him and I sat him down and put him in front of the TV to film this I did you found the whole thing he filmed you saying it to him no I didn't film that but I filmed is real filmed him watching Bruce Lee first I showed them the greatest nunchuck scenes of all time with Bruce Lee the eel on YouTube and you can get there's there's compilations they put together the one from the stuff and the dragon the stuff in Chinese connection a way of the Dragon and we're all returning the dragon and so I sat him down and goes I'm gonna blitz him with this shit I'm gonna make sure that whenever he thinks about fucking nunchucks he knows that Bruce Lee's the master right so he's just completely blown away then after I showed him other nunchuck scenes we I sat him down and I wanted to show him the greatest fight scene of all time Bruce Lee versus Chuck fucking Norris come on so I just wanted to leave that just in his DNA and I film that I filmed him watching Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee any always wants to know he loves he loved Bruce Lee instantly and he he needs to know who wins the fight so fagged daddy does Bruce Lee wanna go he always win son he always wins and but my natural reaction cuz he's constantly asking questions he's constant does he win my natural reaction would be just watch watch you gotta watch this cuz it's gonna be sweeter if you watch it and you go through the ups and downs and he goes no daddy you need to tell me now and I couldn't know you're gonna like it more if you just watch it you got no daddy does Bruce Lee win he wants to fucking know he don't want to be disappointed yeah so he's got years old yeah he got completely blown away so a week later a week later I got today you're gonna watch the greatest martial arts movie of all time Enter the Dragon it's Bruce Lee dead isn't it yes they're real mean it's like movie chimpanzees yeah there was like there's anything like a cow what movie was that look Rico chimpanzee whoo yeah yeah it's kind of like a documentary I was like damn these chumps or mean they're mean yeah they're cruel yeah they're they're calculated yeah yeah they sneak up on each other and like I realize chimps did calculated cruelty mm-hmm yeah that's pretty I left that meeting kind of a game whoa this is dark right well we know better because we advanced but if we hadn't we'd be like man I don't want to fucking live in a house I like the chimp ways bro chimp ways to go this is it man chimp life life right now but we in a way to the AI might be like those chimps I'm like these stupid fucks launching missiles out of drones and shoot each other underwater like we're crazy we got torpedoes and submarines and fucking airplanes that drop nuclear bombs and discriminately on cities where assholes yeah they might go why are they doing this it might like look at our politics look at what we do in terms of our food system what kind of food we force down each other's throats and they might go these people crazy don't even look out for themselves I don't make how much do we think about chimps not much very little it's like these chimps are at war they're these like look like groups of chimps just attack each other and they kill each other they tortured you know that's pretty bad they hunt monkeys there but like this is probably the most but you know I mean when's the last time you drove white chimps let me yeah all the time you do talk okay watch my podcast episode okay [Applause]
