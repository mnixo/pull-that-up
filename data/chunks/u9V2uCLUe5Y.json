hello freak bitches some people definitely want to fight I can't live in with fight well some fighter I'm not either some people think that you're supposed to that's how a relationship supposed to be I mean if you're not fighting the year somehow or another you don't care about each other because if you care you get upset so I'm very weird sort of dynamic the man-woman relationship dynamic of things that people think you shouldn't shouldn't expect right the way people behave or don't behave the way they talk to you or don't talk to you like yeah it's very you know it's weird if it's all the same if any friendship is the same yeah don't let don't let people be mean to you don't let them fucking beat you down you'll shit at you but some people like if you grow up in a home that fights all the time yeah you get used to that and then you it's not a big deal like she would this girl she would fight screaming yeah Lynette and like as soon as was it was done she'd be fine just like say having some coffee and just like sit there and I'd be shaking like oh my god why did she stay like I I'm not good with that kind of tension that at all yeah I used to date this girl would get really mad really mad and want to fight and then once once there was some sort of resolution should immediately turn docile it was very odd docile should be aggressive to like start some sort of altercation but you could calm the altercation down shut it down yeah would you how to almost shut it down by just saying oh you're not gonna do this I'm not gonna talk like this like this is like a child yeah that was young so I needed to learn like how to talk to people right like or how to manage situations like sometimes like something's happening between two people like you're you're upset about something and instead of thinking about how you're conveying your thought to them all you think of is what you want to happen yeah right I want you to shut the fuck up you want someone to shut the fuck up the problem is when you say that yeah you're not really thinking about communicating with them like through their eyes wants anyone to say shut the fuck up but we say because we want people to shut the fuck up and you can't deal with yeah yeah yeah that is the point you don't want you don't care what their needs are you just stop well it's well it's also like when people want people to do things so they want people there's there's the the mindset of you wanting a result you want someone to behave a certain way instead of thinking about them as like your equal I can just another human being and instead of thinking like I have to get what I want like what is it that you want okay what what happened here like why are we well that's is an ass I find like impasse getting older that thing I'm more aware of your it's that big part of not thinking about you all the time you're always think especially when you're young and you're like coming up and you're did it's just me me me me because you're just trying to survive you're trying to figure you don't even know what you want when you shut that part down and think about the person across from you yeah it opens up the whole world but it's a difficult thing to learn it's absolutely when you're young the camera industry just done just tell you they're useless last time you saw like a straight up camera well you'd have to be like a guy was a photographer like Jamie then you carry those goofy bricks cuz you want impress chicks you know what he's doing it's just taking pictures of chicks huh I see them all the time they just go on like little photo shoot dates with their like girls too and to spend time there's taking pictures of each other they don't need to hire the photographer anymore I've seen that man I was at a restaurant in these two bitches just kept doing that back and forth with each other I was like ladies enjoy your meal cry and they were like now with witty phones yeah this is the I'm about to take a selfie face ready there's a thing that girls do with their neck that they only do when they're about to take a selfie this is it ready just tap that weird neck boom [Laughter] weird selfie deck okay don't ever do that any other time except for when you're like looking at your phone just to celebrate right yeah nothing is more awkward nothing is more awkward seeing someone trying to take a selfie you ever seen that mom at the playground with a kid trying to take selfies she takes forty-something selfies you see like this bitch smile that's what you look like okay you just roll with it doesn't always look great girl shrieking people but filters this weird chicken check it adds chicken and chicken adds that's where it comes from chickens be crazy it's not where it comes from but it belongs in its crew it's in the same right yeah on Briella that's a real chicken head yeah this is really this is trust me I have chickens that's what they do man there's nothing more awkward see so I'm trying to take fucking selfies it's so embarrassing there's definitely more awkward shit it's more awkward if your friend is taking and you're a guy it's so real yeah your ass look how many guys take
