thought record and son ladies and gentlemen welcome to the broadcast are we on yeah we're on right now bitch I'm good so you can see it and if that Twitter for like cooking up call it water commie twat that's a terrible way to start off the show no one heard that shit what are you talking about you are online right now do there's like a hundred people online I'm sure see how many people we got ninety four people did anybody hear that they'd say I only heard shareable goddamn joke wow this is blocky as fuck look how goofy it looks serious fucking delay - ah what's happening Eddie and Joe when we come back to Philly we'll be back to Philly eventually um I don't know when the UFC is gonna be back in Philly but people been calling for young Betty Bravo to be on the Joe Rogan podcast he's here ladies and gentlemen there he is Eddie Bravo man there's like a five-second delay I know it's kinda well that's awkward uh so why we're here in Charlotte North Carolina pretty fuckin badass town and it's nice here people are all friendly and I like it I like it I rented a car for the first time coming to a UFC city and you get to know the city a lot better when you have to know where the hell you're going you know we're so used to jumping in bands and and just not paying attention and we really don't even know anything about the city renting cars is the key yeah drive around get to know the place I like it here man it's real it's all spread out it's a you know it's like no congestion creep are all friendly there's no tension here it's a good-sized city Charlotte's a good-sized city it's not not too crazy you know super friendly I drove into the weigh ins and they were charging for parking and since I drove and didn't go into it with a UFC van I pulled up to the girl take them on I go listen I actually work for the UFC I just don't have my laminate but I'll pay whatever you like no just drive right in I just drove right in park went up I needed to get backstage and again I didn't have my credentials so there's like security there like North Carolina security I'm like I need to get my credentials dynomite I mean can you direct me to a spot where I could speak to someone just go backstage I just walked backstage I went right in zero security Clare telling stalkers how I could meet fighters yeah next time is in Carolina you have some ammo this guy okay I can't read this shit's too far use your eyes bad is my eyes man yes your eyes be bad well we froze up you stream kind of sucks you know they all saw these things it's the the Internet's not quite ready for this shit yet similarly likely just answer questions and share what stuff have we done in town we haven't been shit in town really I went river rafting last night Monday last time I had a show at a place called a missus South End a lot of fun great crowd good times now afterwards there was a gentlemen's club down the street we had to bring some dudes came to my show they had two books they wanted Eddie to sign it's actually kind of funny story I thought they wanted Eddie uh signed his books so we had to get the books over to Eddie but um and then we went to a Waffle House and fucked up some waffles yeah that's a good time good times my friend good times what do I think about synthetic cannabis that's legal that's kind of interesting shit you know about that man they have that marinol no no it's a synthetic cannabis it's like you know how they had that uh when the whole ball Coast scandal came out what it was was a steroid that they had made that was just slightly different from regular steroids and was undetectable and test because the regular steroids what they were looking for in a test they weren't looking for this stuff well that's the same thing with this there's a synthetic cannabis that you could smoke it as the same effects and it doesn't show up in tests what does it look like it looks like wheat it actually looks like weight yeah it looks like so that's a plant yeah yeah and they just Wow they've just grown it and I mean it makes sense I mean they figured out a way to I didn't know about their botanists have figured out a way a long time ago to put THC into other things they like there was an article online where this guy was trying to put THC in tomatoes get tomatoes to grow tasty like they can fuck with clients and have them you know you know different plants produce more vitamin C in different plants do certain things and you know they're they're trying to figure out how to make these uh I guess they have figured out how to whip them the way how to make weed that doesn't show up in drug tests pretty crazy and it's legal so if you work for UPS or something like that make drug tests you can't smoke weed you can smoke the fuck out of this stuff how long has this been out it's been out for awhile man they're trying to make it illegal it's a big deal now you're trying to make an illegal shares dirty bitches so you could sell it anywhere this is stuff that they're selling on in High Times magazines where they sell that bullshit that stuff's not real at all and what's up with that shit ain't optimizing is wack that is the weakest shit ever that fake we did they sell that is so dumb but they say that that's like a big part of their advertising revenue I think that's just because they're fucking lazy you know you telling me that everyone's so afraid of weed they can't advertise their products in your magazine come on but yet you can sell fake weed you're just ripping people off that's all that is that stuff doesn't get anyone high but this other stuff does sort of stuff is real shit Eddie what are you hitting look at Eddie is here talk about UFOs already Michael Chevelle oh the guy from k1 and you know dream you know the Australian dude that we hung out with an Oscar yeah yeah he's a big UFO guy and he was down to Roswell Museum and he actually saw a UFO and took fucking photos of it and shit fuck yeah that's pretty crazy yeah it means who the fuck knows man we have any UFO questions go ahead and shoot did I finish the entire plate of food you post on Twitter I finished most of it I fuck up some food folks especially after shows after shows like a fuck up some food you know after UFC - you burned off a lot of energy just talking doesn't seem like you would but you do the red man did he actually say something flap Oh Saturday this is all reckless I read Ben's what does that mean Oh always going did I watch that trainwreck Prison wives on the Discovery Channel no there's a show about wood chicks whose husbands are in prison oh I might have to TiVo that yeah what channel I'll TiVo that Discovery Channel might be good oh the History Channel documentary I know what I saw yeah I saw that one too I was kind of interesting that was the best documentary I've ever seen on UFOs definitely I know what I saw I didn't have it was one of those rare documentaries that about UFOs did didn't have like that the other side you know they didn't have a guy going well you know it's all just mythology and you know it's in their minds and they're all crazy and why are they landing in Idaho all the time why not big cities they didn't have any of those guys because it was so ridiculous because I had so many high-ranking military officers coming forward you know that one case in England on a US base with at 80 witnesses and three of the guys went up to it and touched it and wrote down notes on it and they all came up in the Ministry of Defence totally they said this is not a concern of National Defence that's what that's the content so that is that alone right there is pretty crazy and those Arizona those Arizona lights something people saying there's I don't know how many witnesses but they're Arizona lights pretty crazy I know dude who lived in Arizona saw that he said he saw the fucking the the big pyramid thing firing through the air and they saying it's like bigger than a aircraft carrier he said it was a football field yeah she said it was gigantic it was a gigantic big pyramid shaped thing flying through the sky who the fuck knows you know my take on UFOs is if there really were aliens that could come here from another planet well do you think that they would be so silly that they would they wouldn't disguise themselves I think a lot of the shit we see all the time could be UFOs I talk about that crazy dude that told me that uh you show me pictures of clouds yeah this is a dude that I know is a comedian is a very nice guy and the other day I'm talking him at the improv and homeboy says what do you think about UFOs and I said well you know hey man I don't know I haven't seen one but I don't discount the idea made certainly possible obviously we have spaceships and someone from other planets if they're more intelligent than us for sure they could have spaceships so he starts pulling on his iPhone and it dude has like dozens of pictures of clouds on his phone and I'm like what was I what do you think about this look at this right there and I go it's cloud and it was yeah but it's an unusually shaped cloud look at it and I'm like oh no he's crazy I'm like he's fucking crazy this dude takes pictures of clouds all different clouds and he's convinced that these clouds are UFOs yeah but on one point on one hand you got to think like if you really are so super intelligent that you can visit from other planets why would you you know for sure we're working on cloaking devices right now there is already this Japanese jacket that's been invented that basically takes an image of what's behind you and broadcast it on the front of the jacket it's basically like predator type shit you remember from the movie the predator yeah and they really have this already I mean it's not perfected but we can't travel other planets yet either you know I'm saying so if someone from another planet is so much more highly intelligent than we are that they can actually travel here from other galaxies or older other solar systems for sure they've figured something like this out so when you're seeing the sky I mean it's very possible you know that what you're seeing is if there are UFOs you would see an image of the sky behind you behind the UFO being projected on the UFO so you wouldn't see shit you know that said you if you could take into account how many UFOs are reported I mean it's like there's some ridiculous amount of UFOs reported and if you take into account how many people see and don't report they don't say anything cuz they want to look foolish you know that's so that's a lot of goddamn UFOs I think a lot of what people are saying is military jets that they don't understand like when I was in we did Fear Factor down near Edwards air force base and they had stealth bombers that flew up dude you see a stealth bomber you think that's a goddamn spaceship but yeah the French government get a test with some there was a serious review of all the there's like fifty thousand or something like something fifty thousand since certain year there's probably way more but they they came to the conclusion that ninety five percent of reported cases can be explained away with that military all this military all this top-secret military planes and different lights but they said five percent most likely are aircraft from other worlds well I don't know why they can say aircraft from other worlds because I don't necessarily think we have it's more likely perfect inventory of what exists in this know what they're saying they're saying that that's probably what that is more more likely it's some extraterrestrial craft then I mean they that's there's five percent just because it's not from our government or the Russian government doesn't necessarily mean even it's from another planet we don't know what the fuck is in the ocean well you know how's your dick you love UFOs get cited yeah I called you lemming out of the out of the air there was a whole History Channel documentary about that people go well that's ridiculous that's nonsense that's silly it's silly that you can send a fucking picture that you could take this fucking thing and send a video across the sky into somebody else's phone in Australia that's way more silly than some people from another planet have visited here or that there's something living in the ocean especially when you have guys like X Pentagon high-ranking officials like Philip Corso who before he died he wrote a book and he explained his job in the government in the Pentagon was taking crashed UFO stuff taking it to the Hughes Aircraft and Lockheed and all these different aerospace companies to reverse engineer he's saying he was like there's many interviews on YouTube with Philip Corso he's dead now he was on Dateline and they try to like ridicule him but you know I'm howdy J Alan Hynek to is another excellent example that jail Hank was the guy who was in charge of project Bluebook and he was told to by the government when they had this thing to explain away everything swamp gas you know mass hysteria anything they could do to explain away UFO cases but as he became more involved in Project Blue Book and as he investigated more and more sightings and you know and dealt with more and more evidence he became absolutely convinced that UFOs were real so J Allen Hynek who was you know like a guy actually working to discredit UFOs eventually came out and started supporting the whole UFO movement so I think it's it's not it's not ridiculous to think that we've been visited I mean we go to the Congo all the time and stare at chimpanzees you know I mean if you were from another planet and you had the ability to travel here why wouldn't you check out people people are fucking completely ridiculous they're probably fascinating I mean what would be more we study lower forms of animals we always have and we've been doing this since the beginning of time I mean people people have always been interested in botany and we've always been interested in in and studying different monkeys and different weird animals another kind that's the whole thing with Darwin you know it took uh you know it took a count of all these different animals that he came across we've always done shit like that and I think if we were a much higher intelligence than human beings we would want to do that with people we want to check out and see what the fuck people are up to see if people are evolving see what the bottleneck is as far as like social and cultural evolution and see what the bottleneck is as far as technological evolution and whether or not our technology is surpassing our ability as a human being like to to make rational decisions and I think it probably is right now you know they just fired up the Large Hadron Collider yesterday you know yesterday was like the first test North Pole jato is watching what is that hola I think that I go ape alot too I think that looks like el duderino I don't know it looks like a hole hot or if you don't know poha is uh is Portuguese doesn't Brazilian guys say poha all the time it's like it sort of means like fuck or balls it means like a bunch of and things they said all the time Oh balls these balls I think it means is uh bitches yeah yeah not balls I heard a bunch of different translations but to me Nosferatu is the fighting vampire in our main Dracula no Dracula know is a famous battle Gracie black belt and Dracula need a I guess he looks like Dracula or something so I called him Nosferatu he's the Brazilian vampire oh that's funny am I not gonna commentate yeah I'm gonna commentate that shit's in uh I'm gonna leave in a half an hour we're chilling here in the hotel room getting ready to go down there and commentate yeah my god okay what do I think about Scientology I think it's it's awesome if you're gay and you want to cover it up they're really good at that shit it's all nonsense all religions are nonsense you don't you know just as much as I know as far as like what happens when you die no one knows I think we let you know what I think religion is awesome if usually right if you do it right it's like you do the right thing and help your neighbors like my grandma was hardcore Catholic and I wouldn't try to convince her like if she was still allowed to get out of that she was doing she's won a church every day praying and that praying is like meditating she was meditating so I think just like like having a healthy heart you could some people can do kettlebells some people could run on a treadmill some people run stairs some people do martial arts that's for a healthy heart it all works and I think religion whether you're doing the Jesus or the Allah or the Buddha or meditation or yoga it doesn't really matter as long as you get your frequency at the right spot with the universe it doesn't matter if you do the Jesus thing you know so I think that I think you're right yeah I think whatever you whatever gets you in that right frequency you could worship your iPhone if you actually believe that and you can meditate to your iPhone I think the universe don't give a fuck they're like how are you going to get to our frequency that's all that the real problem is people the real problem is the saint you know what it is it's the same thing when whenever when someone believes in something even if they believe it something completely irrational they want everyone else to believe in it too beautiful love everyone else to be on their team that's why like it you ever talk to people that use windows and they find out they use mac and they're like what the fuck man use Mac Mac's for faggots they get crazy like they want you to use windows it's like people want you to be Muslim they want you to be a Scientologist they want you to be a Catholic you know that's the real problem is that people want you to to subscribe to their ideology but the idea behind it you know being a better person and you know and treating everybody as if they're yourself and you know that oh that's that's the way to go I mean it really is but fucking handing out the basket and fucking kids and all that other shit that you know involved in fucking kids I have to admit I'm not into that I'm against that I saw that deliver us from evil they recommended come on he recommended this documentary and you guys should check it out - it's called deliver us from evil if you want to find out how fucked up the Catholic Church really is oh my god is this incredible see the whole thing yeah well I couldn't watch the whole thing I watched about an hour and 10 minutes into it did you get to the point where it turns out that guys then like hundreds of kids yeah yeah I couldn't take it I wanted to kill him I mean it's it's really a really sick sick documentary about this priest who was responsible for molesting hundreds of kids and you know they covered it up they kept moving them they moved them all over the country and really it's incredible and it's what's going on right now that gigantic scandal that's happening right now with the Pope I mean the Pope had knowledge of all this fucking shit that was going on there's so many pedophiles and I think they're all pedophiles I bet they're all pedophiles because it was not all it's because there's no percentage because it was if it was just if it wasn't half of them or a quarter of whom there would be busting each other out they would there would be people coming forward saying we got to stop the shit they're all covering each other's asses I mean think about it there they chose a job where they can't get any pussy well the whole idea you know what I mean that's got to drive you insane and anybody who accepts a job that where you can't get laid that you got to be fucked up already you already got me and I think my my theory is that when these guys grow up gay the religion growing up in a religious home then and then once they find out they're gay they realized oh shit maybe Satan is inside of me I got this game feelings oh my god I gotta fight Satan so they become ultra religious and ultra Catholic and then they're trying to prove to God that they're gonna fight the gay they're gonna devote their life to God they become a priest and then BAM they hold it together for the hiroshima video God when they lose you're seen that video God hates fags no the guy who was a gay guy who's singing about being Christian I've never seen that not financially you know what I got it fuck I don't know no way and I gotta leave my mom and we'd have to leave for 20 minutes we leave had a shower Steph yeah but the fights don't even start for more than an hour and I gotta get my hair did come on man your hair looks groovy you gotta check this out people don't get to see you on YouTube day how long it takes to blow dry my hair no how much you'll have to wash it but 15 minutes man I

know the fucking dude is a gay guy who converted to Christianity he needs like you know try to tell people the right way to go wow it's pretty awesome it's pretty awesome stuff where's your lighter yeah put it up in the air bro well as good lighter oh yeah do we watch Tim and Eric yeah man Tim and Eric rocks that's probably top three favorite shows that in Celebrity Rehab mmm that fucking thing dancefloor Dale if you haven't seen that go do a Google search for dancefloor Dale is gotta be one of the funniest fucking videos I've ever seen in my life the weirdest funniest things on the internet ever dancefloor Dale you got to see this gotta find it find it online it's on my website you can find it on Joe Rogan net season 3 of Tim and Eric oh that's because they keep having recurring sketches and they just get funnier and funnier the more the more developed here's a good question for you what does Damian my and it's Jew to bring to the table that latest didn't vs Silva because Damian Minds fighting Anderson Silva next month in Abu Dhabi next week dude I've owned Abu Dhabi next week I think Demian Maia is a better guard cooler than Tyler's latest Tallis would pull guard but he wouldn't clench up for so you know Silva doesn't not gonna just fall in you got a really shoot deep with an underhook and you got to make the guy sprawl if he doesn't sprawl you know because you didn't take a deep shot you're not going to pull him in your garden Damon Maya likes to shoot deep and pull guard I think that'll be the difference there's no way he's gonna stand with Anderson Silva you know just based on not just based on Anderson Silva's career and what he's done but based on his last fight where he tried to stand for a little bit with Nate Marquardt and he he's gonna pull guard immediately trust me he's not gonna fuck around anymore with that shit I hope that's true but I didn't think he was gonna charge damn with Nate either well he stood with them for one punch and that was just one punch too long and he's I think to him he's training with Wanderlei and Wanderlei is you know unknown brawler you know do you think that uh that style of getting in there and just mixing it up get ugly Desa up that's not a good style for a guy who's not very technically proficient at striking ah you know he's just so good on the ground why give your opponent any kind of chance especially Anderson Silva we're gonna try to mix it up a little bit with them that's a big fucking mistake he's gonna he's gonna pull guard immediately trust me or you know or try to take him down because you know Anderson Silva isn't some n-c-double-a national champion or anything so I'm sure Damon my is really going to take a shot for real and for real try to take him down but if he has any trouble he will pull guard no problem I guarantee that yeah we've definitely seen Anderson been taken down before you know I mean he got taken down many times by Travis looter now Travis looter probably had the most success but you got to think about that fight Travis looter fought Anderson 11 weeks after Anderson had knee surgery on both knees so that probably wasn't the best representation of his wrestling then Dan Henderson took him down as well and when Dan Henderson took him down he wasn't able to do anything to him which is kind of like held him down on the ground punched him a few times but really couldn't get anything going you know so that's the big questions is Anderson's Jiu Jitsu good enough to stifle Demian Maia because Demian Maia had a hard time with Dan milliner's fight really couldn't get anything going with them I mean he ground and pounded them and you know he'd beat him by decision but never came close to finishing with a submission no and I think Dan Miller is a real good real tough guy but I think Anderson's jujitsu is a least as good as Miller's I mean on paper at least he's a black belt and Miller's of grandbo but Miller is wrestled his whole life there's a big difference that's a different kind of animal when you're grappling with a real legit wrestler and Anderson Silva has long limbs I like going with guys that have long arms it's hard it rubber guards a lot easier with taller guys it's harder for them to pull out about out of anything they have long arms like the small one forty five short five foot five stocky wrestler types it's hard to get any rubber guard on because they pop their arms out there you know out so easily they're really small so I think I think David Maya's going to have more success with his jiu-jitsu with with Anderson Silva if he gets him to the ground than he did with Miller because Miller again he's only a brown belt but damn he wrestled his whole life that's that's that's a different kind of animal right there he's a chimpanzee the other thing about Anderson is that Anderson has had elbow problems for years he's had bone chunks floating around his elbow that made training really difficult he would have to ice his elbows after training sometimes he couldn't do any weightlifting and he strengthened conditioning because his elbows hurt he finally got all that shit fixed he got the elbow chunks the the piece of bone taken out so we're going to see an Anderson Silva that's in a better condition than we've seen him in a long long time he's got a problem throwing his right hand because of it which is really hard to believe when you see his fights big country Nelson went tonight by fat mission how dare you we tie some man fat a big guy like Roy Nelson he that weight centralized in his stomach he knows how to hold you with that shit that that can keep you in a certain position he's really good at keeping his weight on you we have a dude that we trained with Brent Brent can see inside controlled man that motherfucker is really hard to get off you and he's built similar to big country not as fat but he's got a big gut and you know and he's talented as well he's a good jiu-jitsu guy and when he gets on copy you in you know he gets a good position on you is really hard shake him off you he plants that weight down on you and holds you in place and big country if I had a guess what's gonna happen tonight what's true you know I would say that big country if you get some down the ground streams gonna be a lot of trouble okay yeah yeah but Struve has a lot of potential he might be a he might be the underdog in this fight he probably should be based on his experience and he's really young and in countries been grappling for a long time he's really good on the ground people having a listening that he likes to stand in bag but country Nelson is really good on the ground really good really good I mean no heat Frank Mir was it like 11 to nothing in a submission match yeah he's really he's got a great half guard game too we just haven't really seen it but Struve in the long run has so much potential I mean that guy that's like he's like 26 8 or something like that he's super tall and he loves jiu-jitsu you never see that you never see tall guys like that who are athletic and coordinated love jiu-jitsu I mean you've seen we seen Sammy shell he didn't like jiu-jitsu um I don't know what other tall guy but you know random ran a Kendall Grove that's another tall guy who likes to Jitsu but he is true if he continues to evolving and remains a student of the game and everything of course striking and wrestling as well but in jiu-jitsu the way he's moving it and you know we've talked several times about a jiu-jitsu and strategy and philosophies and stuff and he's on the right track he's a he you know I don't I don't know if we can be country at this point in his career maybe maybe not but get that guy another five six seven years if he continues to evolve he can be a serious threat with that with that height his guard could be insane ya know Kay oh he decided to be a ninja off his back fuck he's only 22 that's the other thing about that kid he's real young he's got a massive massive amount of time ahead of him you know and a lot of potential he's got crazy heart remember in Germany we got cut wide open was bleeding all over the place who would he fight that fight he got in trouble he got cut real bad and he still pulled it out and went up submitting to dude so it was it was pretty badass do another Ustream tonight maybe maybe we will if we get back to the hotel it'll be late here and I don't go to bed until late on the west coast so it'll be early for me so yeah we could do that we could come after the after-party and do it do it non sober this is a sober version of the Ustream because I got to go do the broadcasting right now go me or Ken Flo who the fuck knows son that's why they got to do it I think it's exciting having gone me over here I would have liked to see him over here years ago but you know he's still young and he's got a lot to prove you know and I think he's training real hard he looked really in real good shape and he's saying all the right things that he wants to really make another run and get another run at PJ Ken and he's obviously got to get through Kenny to do that so I think it's gonna be really interesting he's a solid wrestler and it's a big power puncher you know he hits hard so I think Kenny's going to try to use his legs Kenny's got real good leg kicks real good movement he's gonna try to use his footwork working with leg kicks and then if it goes the ground who trying to submit him and cut him up with elbows the thing about go me is go me has not fought anybody ever with the elbow rules you know elbows are different man especially the cage you know cage and elbows you know it's those are two totally different things that he's never experienced before so it's gonna be gonna be interesting gonna be interesting and Kenny man he gets better every time I gotta get out of here guys I gotta get ready got jumpin showers you start gotta leave in 10 minutes three little thank you very much I'll do this again yeah almost yeah come on my house will do a full version fuck yeah - well virtually all right um you want to leave with us you know what I'm gonna just take my own car okay only have you I got the rental yeah yeah all right I'll see you there ma'am seeing 10 miles uh ya know yeah 515 huh yeah it's only fits four or five right now ladies and gentlemen finally we're alone mm-hmm so Wow does the store I got to leave in 10 minutes so I said I should uh get my shit goin yeah I wanted to do just a little show because I couldn't do one last week because I had a staph infection that I had to deal with so I didn't fucking die that's the problem at jujitsu man no you roll with dirty motherfuckers and your weird skin shit you know where diseases I know dude got herpes on his head what yeah you can get a you can get herpes from jiu-jitsu not good hmm the deal with me getting a Sirius radio show I'm going to do a weekly show I think I'm going to do like a six-week run a trial run and it's all dependent on my scheduling because I just signed a deal to write a book I've been writing it for a while but they've been negotiating about a deal we finally got the right deal and I was in New York last week and I met with the publishers they cannot see me when I performed at Gotham so I got a nice deal and I'm getting ready and the deal is that I have to finish the book by August so I'm gonna be guns blazing trying to write this thing and finish it most of the stories it's going to be mostly about my the beginning days of doing stand-up because I have so many crazy stories about bad road gigs and just struggling on the road and you know like what it's like to be a really an amateur comedian trying to you know go out there and get people to laugh for money and you know and how fucking crazy it is and how unsure it is and how you really have no idea if it's ever going to work out and you feel you know it's completely insecure you know you feel like there's no way this is ever going to really turn out to be a career and and how nutty some of the fucking gigs I've done well why wasn't you at weigh ins yesterday I don't even think I'm going to answer that so retarded League written but if somebody else asks it I'll answer it I was at the ways because I didn't get any time I got my flight didn't land till 4 o'clock so they had Goldberg doodle the weigh-ins and then I had my show last night you know because we were in New York and then I flew back from New York Sunday I had Monday to stay home with my family and then Tuesday flew out again so unless I'd stayed here in Charlotte there was no way really I was going to be able to get to the weigh-ins but you know I didn't I didn't really this is too much traveling I need to be home at least a couple days a week otherwise I go nutty when you have babies man you just can't wait to go home the same you know house Hardee's on parties fine already didn't have any problems there's nothing wrong with them I can't believe it I you know his shoulder his arms you know I think George st. Pierre he didn't quite have the arm bar right but uh the Camorra there was at one point time the Camorra I thought it was just going to rip off I mean it looked it looked pretty bad Oh bring back some chicks from the after-party at least no I can't do that anymore I made babies and I made it made a wife and all that shit am i doing a show the Z's and zari I don't know him but I think yeah I think he's on that show the Kevin and bean show that I'm doing this weekend April foolishness I think it's it's either Friday or Saturday night one of those I'm not sure which I'll tell you right now yeah Saturday it said the Gibson Amphitheatre and Universal and I'm pretty sure its way sold out those guys always sell out their shows it's a really good lineup to a lot a lot of funny comedians I did it last year with Patton Oswalt did it Ray Romano Ray Romano Patton Oswalt Jeff Ross a bunch of good guys I know Jeff's on it again this year I think J mores are again this year too is Arianny hot or what she's hot if you're not gay if you're gay probably not hot the buffer 360 tonight I think he said he would never do that again I think he said the buffer 360 is gonna retire he's gonna put that shit in the books it's over son what do I think about crop circles I think they're incredible geometric patterns well they're not humans made them with the fuck knows you know I mean there's a lot of people that argue that it's impossible for people to make them that they've you know three times the size of a football field and they appear overnight and they're imperfect geometric patterns and circles and everything I don't know you know I think it's very intriguing you know at the very least some of them are fascinating because they're so fucking huge you know and if really I mean if people really are making these things you know and they're flattening them out and just leaving them there it's like wow there's such incredible geometric art you would think that they would want to take credit for that you know if it's just a hoax it's incredible that it's a hoax that they've kept up for this long like how sneaky today and what's the what's the benefit of that what's the what's the reward I don't know I mean I don't have an opinion one way or another though I am I think it's also possible that it could be some sort of an experiment that they do to impose geometric patterns in these fields it might be something that they do you know from the sky or something like that and who the fuck knows how they're doing it if you talk to some people that say that these patterns the way they're made that the the nodes of these plants have been blown out like they've had energy pulse through them like microwaves like expanded I don't you know I don't know though I really personally have not done enough research and really paid attention to both sides of the argument I know one side of the argument is that it's bullshit and the other side of the argument is that it's aliens you know both of them seem pretty ridiculous so I'm not I'm not exactly sure what I think about that shit so would I think about the Luke Stuart Andre Galvao fight I thought that fight was really interesting I was blown away by that Luke Stuart guy that guy has incredible sweeps man he's relentless I thought he won the fight I thought he beat him would stand up and I thought his ground game negated Kyle's ground game and he swept him a bunch of times and I thought he edged him you know I thought it was a real close fight but I thought Stuart edged him but man he he blew me away Luke Stuart is a bad motherfucker and I'm really looking forward to his next fight that was really really impressive UFC 115 in Cincinnati they say that might be possible if if the the Vancouver thing falls through I don't know if that's fallen through or not I haven't heard it directly from the horse's mouth so when I hear it I'll find out any more documentaries like the Union coming out yeah I did a documentary on DMT it's called DMT the spirit molecule and it should be done in May and probably out for release sometime around the summer I know they're taking it to film festivals and they're bringing it all over the place but it's a documentary mostly about different people's experiences on DMT and I am the narrator so that's the deal so I know who Bob Lazar is yeah Bob Lazar is a guy who claims to have worked for area 51 and you know he's kind of been discredited with a lot of things especially like his education I guess he kind of like told some lies about where he went to school and what his degrees are in but very very intelligent guy and he obviously knew a lot about that area about area 51 whether or not he really did have any contact with UFOs or with alien spacecraft or any of that stuff I mean it could be total 100 percent or shit or it could be true I mean it's really hard to tell but when a guy who lies about his education and lies about you know certain aspects of his background you gotta assume that he's probably lied about other things as well you know I don't know you know again I don't really have an opinion either way interesting to watch him talk though he's very confident you know he's very confident which could mean either a he's crazy and that's why he's confident or be he's telling the truth all right I got to get the fuck out of here because the car is picking me up in two minutes I just wanted to bust out a nice quick one right here for you guys and say what's up so um thank you everybody for tuning in and we'll do one probably this weekend
