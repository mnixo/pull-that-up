haha hello freak bitches what a week young Jim Norton has had what a week what a week Sirius satellite radio has had what a week censorship has had what a week Anthony cou Mia has had what a week all the the people online they loved a bitch and piss and moan and complain and get very excited when something fucked up goes downhill well something fucked up went down when if you're listening to this if it's sometime in the future because these recordings will be saved forever this is today's date is July 17th 2014 approximately a week go Anthony qu Mia was taking photographs Anthony of the Opie and Anthony show which our pal Jim Norton is also a part of was he was downtown in New York taking some photographs and from there on it's a bunch of you know what he says and what I'm sure the woman who beat the shit out of him would have a different story but he was taken two photographs one of one of the photographs was of this one of those things called when you uh those things we look our scaffolding scaffolding who's walking through the scaffolding a woman was coming towards him it looked like he was just taking a bunch of cool photos of New York there's a bunch of him that he put up on his Instagram yeah anyway this woman got upset that he was taking a photo of her probably thought that he was Pervin got mad at him violence ensued she hit him and he went on Twitter and went on this rant about violence about the black community and their propensity for violence about this woman calling her an animal what she did and serious fired him and which left a fucking huge hole in my entertainment world the open Anthony shows my all-time favorite radio show I listen to it all the time and now all of a sudden it is no more yeah it's a you know it's a huge hole to like I know one panicked like me because Opie and Anthony both have kind of fuck you money Jim Norton doesn't so selfishly thinking I'm like well there goes everything because the show is done well you're always going to be great because you're funny comic thinking always work and you never have to worry about that but um it is a crazy thing uh that you know all the sudden like that for things that he said on the show a hundred times I think what happen happen was he tweeted like he told I talked to him multiple times since then he was walking and people don't believe that he was actually taking legitimate New York photos that was one of the points of contention people like he was being creepy but he really wasn't like Anthony has had this giant Hubble like camera in the studio every day for probably six months now he's getting into photography it's what he's been doing so that was not unusual at all to hear he was out and about taking photos that's the legit and I guess this woman got angry and I talked to him and he said that she just says something like you you know this white boys take my picture you white motherfucker whoever she said she clocked him and he kept defending himself and as he's putting his arms up she is going don't touch me like you know that thing like that a woman might do to prevent you from hitting her like you could see how frightening that would be because then people think you're beating on this woman right so he's putting his hand up and you know I know aunt well enough to know he's not going to just punch a woman in the face so she's doing that I think a few black guys came around and they didn't do anything to aunt but they were like you know don't touch her so you know and who is always armed and he's licensed to carry didn't hit her I didn't pull out his pistol and went home and I guess was really upset and went out like you said a Twitter rampage and I knew it was bad the next morning when I saw it because my ex-girlfriend called me and she's like what happened Anthony kept beat up by a woman and their I don't know so I looked and I saw the tweets i'ma go actually text him about one I think I've ever done that before there was one that I text around the cozec you're right man that he's okay I'm fine the cocaine was scary Wow um yeah the thing about Aunt is he's developed this sort of style of communicating on the show where he goes on these long hilarious entertaining profanity filled rants and there's one thing about hearing it but there's another thing of like seeing it in a text form this is not the same it looks things don't look good in print certain things and I think what happened was is in the middle of like when you have you have a contextual conversation it's like you have people there's inflection there's another guy next to you going well hey what do you mean by that and you're clarifying it or it's just it's a different energy when you're tweeting and you're that mad like I think he'd like any type of an assault even if it's a woman hitting you and it's not life threatening is still like you know an hour later you're like what the fuck just happened like I think it just freaked him out and she hit him a couple times five times or so and I he she sent me a picture of his face and he had like little you can see that he had been struck him he wasn't making it up and so he went on and when I looked at the the flow of things like I know Anthony and I know what he's saying he was not calling all black people animals he wasn't because he's never said that he's talking about a behavior of this woman and I think that what happened was he was so mad and when you're treating that aggressively and you've just you're fucking dealing with this in your head that sometimes things come out jumbled and muddied and like if you know aunt you know what he's saying people who don't know him are reading this cord what does he mean he's saying that there's violence in black people and they are animal-like people are putting these pieces of a puzzle together and they're making a picture and it was like it just I know him well enough to know that in a conversation if someone said are you trying to say black people are animals he goes no not at all it's a baby Haverhill based that you know I mean because he said that about white people too so I mean it was just one of those things where once it was in print it's even in context we lie as a country like you know like when cancel Colbert came out the the activists knew the context that he was making those Asian jokes in and didn't give a fuck she still wanted to sink him she's like I don't know I get it he was trying to you know show the difference between the same thing between this and Native Americans and how ridiculous is but I don't care so we gotten to a point now where we don't even pretend to not understand the context anymore we admit that we understand the context and we go after people anyway so something like this is bound to to sink you because it can be taken both ways unless you actually sit there and talk to the guy and each tweet has to come out like a film each suite has to be a beginning middle and end with no explanation needed around it in order to to be survivable makes sense well you know what the big big key to you said that it could sink you well it only sinks you if you work for a company and in my opinion that's unnecessary yeah in this day and age it's unnecessary and I I think you guys and I think Anthony for sure would be far better off with a podcast anybody can get a podcast to put on their phone now everybody's phone has a little jack that sticks in your car and you play your phone through your car everybody has that now I mean it's not an uncommon thing it's more common to have that Jack that it is to have satellite radio most people have to get a satellite radio thing installed in their car most people already have that Jack right you know it's just it's so goddamn easy and I get I bet you could get all the same sponsors I bet you could get all the same sponsors and you would have no middleman and you don't look at the studio it's not doesn't take much to put something together you know a little bit of time a little bit of effort you know you gotta know someone who's an engineer know someone who knows how to put the stuff together and set up the microphones but other than that what's the difference between this and satellite radio I'll tell you what the difference is nobody can fucking fire you you can go on some cunt rampage that fucking animal cunt and no one you know people might say I'm not downloading your podcast but at least you have the opportunity to communicate to explain yourself and if the people decide that they don't like your character based on one thing that you said or one rant that you went on that is their decision but it's not the decision of a company and when things get you know companies are squirrelly man they have fucking shareholders and stocks and they have responsibilities and all you need is a few slacktivism you know fire Anthony and Anthony Kim we're going after those sponsors we're gonna let them know we're boycotting but mostly just noise mostly nonsense mostly just soft targets but all you need is a few of those in a a fucking a company will panic they do what happens is you know it's a billion dollar company so you get guys like you know Scott and Jim who runs it who you know they're just a fourth of July weekend was coming and then all of a sudden they're getting phone calls from the New York Post and The Washington Post and although all the press obviously has a narrative and they did a shit job but the Washington Post I thought was the worst offender with the way they covered it because the woman wrote things that was just really it was revolting to read which right she was talking about Anthony saying that these guys came around and she was saying like you know all well I guess if a bunch of african-american or however she said a bunch of gentlemen want to defend someone from defaming an african-american woman it's okay like that's what was happening she wasn't acknowledging that Anthony was being hit she acted like these guys had read his Twitter feed not like it was just like she read the Twitter feed in the future it was repulsive all this all woman who looks like the fucking fake deaf interpreter from Mandela's funeral was beating on Anthony but there is a fucking it's a meme that guy has a meme he's rules but that the company these guys just get all the sudden they're just they're home and they're getting phone calls in the office the day before vacation so what are your comments and they probably weren't even that familiar with it until they're getting calls from the paper and they're like what do we do with this and then this is what the press does and this is why you gotta hate there because I think serious was going to try to write it out that's my opinion because they knew a holiday weekend was coming and this is purely a guess because no one was saying anything and then all of a sudden the press starts going we have not had a comment from Sirius satellite radio so we're assuming that they agree with mr. Comey his opinions they do this sneaky shit to push you into defending yourself so now the company with shareholders like you said has to go well how do we tell people that we don't agree so it's not like if the press is the made them do it but the press understands how to corner you into giving a statement a definitive statement because they know that you're not used to this they know that these guys come in to work in management positions are not used to getting phone calls going how do you feel about this statement in that statement you know it was really it was a very frustrating thing when I saw it the press did with it that that to me is always my biggest complaint is with always it will dress there's no nuance to the way they report on certain things like this because there's there's nuance to this especially if you look into it in character if you in context rather if you understand that guy and you you look at him look there is a problem with violence in the black community to pretend there's not a problem violence in the black community is to pretend that there are insane amounts of murders going on in go to pretend that there's not issues with the amount of black people that are in jail the percentage of the population now are those economic problems are those problems related to upbringing are those process education yes absolutely there's a lot of fuckin disparity there's a lot of problems with poverty there's a lot of problems with the structure of our culture itself and that you could attribute a lot of those problems to racism to racism in the way that funds are allocated the way that you know the attention that society puts on impoverished communities absolutely efficient Eliza yes but to pretend that it's not a problem is ridiculous it's fucking ridiculous so when he's taking a picture of some chick and she starts to punch in him I think he's allowed to talk about the problem with violence with that community with the community that this person is from that's beating him up did he do it the right way no absolutely not did he do it in a way that could be misconstrued or construed or interpreted as racist absolutely did yeah he did he fucked up he did it the wrong way he probably shouldn't done it on Twitter you probably should have made a video you probably should have made a video explaining showing what happened to him and explaining what goes on explaining this 140 fucking characters things he's a big part of the problem dude absolute that's exactly what it was because Anthony is so good at clarify whenever you talk about race or a million other thing whether it's religion where it's so hard to make your point without stepping in shit and then having to go off on fifty digressions I go no that's not what I meant no that's not what I meant like you know that's the worst part of discussing stuff is that people jump in on the side what are you saying that all people do we all black - no I'm not so in order to be able to get your point across you have to walk an arrow you almost have to close people's argument doors like a Get Smart episode as you're walking this way your point gets through and Anthony is a genius at doing that a genius at it because we've debated raised so many times on the show and him and Patrice would go back and forth and and Patrice loved Anthony because he said Anthony's an adorable races you know Patrice was so funny with he never no never was upset by Anthony's opinion because Anthony would listen to him and they would go back and forth half the times Patrice was right and half the time Anthony was right but on Twitter I think like in that emotion when you're saying XY and Z he I don't think he did as good a job as he should have done of closing those doors behind him almost like sealing off things that people can get to you on because he was so upset because he had had a physical assault I know it sounds like I'm talking in circles and just defending my friend but I've been with him for 10 years all in this medium of totally uncensored and I'm telling you I know him well enough to know that he's like he's got weird things where he'll talk about race and people misinterpret him and I've talked to him privately and the guy does not hate black people and I know that that's just all his friends defending him but I'm telling you that he does not because I know him well and then to hit people going he hates black people think he's miss not afraid of being misconstrued or interpreted as racist he's not afraid of it by saying what he really believes is his opinion about certain aspects of a group whatever race a gender whatever it is he's not afraid of speaking his mind about things because he's got that fuck you money that's a big part of it and he's got 150,000 guns those are two things and you know a big part of it that drove me fucking crazy is people are not they're not taking into account the reaction that someone has when they get assaulted yes because when you get hit by someone some fucking stranger that you don't know hits you especially when you've got a gun you've got a fucking bullet launching gun you've got a thing inside you that has explosions you press a trigger explosions propel bullets and they end lives instantly and Anthony's an expert with one and he has it on him at all times and he's getting hit and he's like what the fuck and so he gets on my fucking animal cunt yeah bitch fuck you this that you know it's getting hit is a very disturbing thing it's I mean there's one thing to get hit in a spoiler getting hit in a sparring session is infuriating with people you know I've seen people go fucking crazy because they get choked out in a jujitsu session getting punched is way more traumatic getting punched by a stranger multiple times for taking a fucking photograph I don't know what the exchange was between the two of them I don't know you know if if he was saying something that it was infuriating I don't know I wasn't there you know I'm not going to pretend I was there but man you got to take into account the reaction that people have when you hit them and it to me and again I hate to keep going back to the press but they didn't focus on the fact that he that like he handled himself properly in that because I know I would have I don't know I would have pulled the gun on that moment but I'm a panicky Pete and I would have just been what other guys were coming over I would have at least brandished it and he acted physically responsible like as a as a fucking guy with a pistol on him because people get shot all the time for dumb arguments and dumb things he'd he handled himself absolutely right and lost his cool once he got home and people didn't take the press didn't take that into account I hopped on the fact that he didn't get a police report and I wished he had now in hindsight because they're all going mr. Coombe you did I get a police report but here's the deal had he gotten a police report they would have just ignored it they wouldn't have said well at least he got a police report they would have glanced over the fact and said yeah well I only can get a police report so they were just using that as a reason to kind of ignore the fact that he got hit they're like we didn't see a police report all the press harped on the fact that he didn't get a police report but an sit response was look man you know I know enough cops to know that me getting hit by some lady in Times Square it's not a fucking priority for NYPD who's worried about terrorists yeah especially if he's fine I think there's a real issue also with with the press with a lot of people in the press I'll clarify that what they're trying to do is they're trying to close those Get Smart doors as they write a piece as well and as they're writing a piece they are also trying to placate all the people that are going to be up in arms about their opinions if they could possibly be supporting a racist if they could possibly be taking his side agreeing with him seeing his point of view they could be misinterpreted or they could be interpreted as being racist as well so they have to worry about that as well especially if you're with a liberal rag you know if you have a very liberal newspaper that you work for and they have a clear agenda which a lot of them do the Washington Times does write Alijah absolution post Rose there's a lot of them that have a liberal slant and if you are reporting for them you know and it's something like this that's very controversial and something where there's there's a bunch of things that automatically have like a knee-jerk reaction to them and this is one of them knee-jerk reaction to what's conceived as racism perceived as racist yes and another thing they do that's even that's even more enraging is they would people who write for the press now have to do is that it's not just reporting what happened it's how do i editorialize under the guise of being impartial right and they do that a lot too and that I don't like either it's like that to me is the worst crime they commit actually it's the editorializing as they're going along like it's legitimate like like NBC and I'm not a Zimmerman fan either aunt was a big supporter Zimmerman I thought Zimmerman should went to jail for something I didn't know what legally I have no ground to stand on but I kind of thought he was a con but uh but but not a guy who was out to commit a murder either I thought there was a line in between but whatever like NBC edited that tape like ah can't do there's no reason to do that unless you're pushing something but they're doing it under the guise of being impartial and I'm sure they've done it plenty of times to vilify blacks I'm not saying they haven't you lost that lawsuit you know I know II did yeah I'm crazy it's absolutely nuts I don't know why the news has such a different level of what they can get away with what they can do because they're seen as doing a public service in my opinion though I think they lost it because everybody was hating that guy and they just want didn't want him to win something on top of this the fact that he still has his freedom the kid lost his life right I think he's us I think he's a sucky fucking security guard that's what I think I think if you're going to look at that guy and find fault in what he did it's how did he handle the situation and what a more confident competent person to handle it the same way like here's a perfect example my friend Big John McCarthy who's a cop I guarantee you you know the referee oh yeah yeah yeah referee caught that guy was a cop a long time but great guy but knows how to handle shit if Big John McCarthy saw that kid walking in the neighborhood he probably said how you doing man everything cool you know they had a conversation with him everything would have been fine like even if the kid like got up in arms or got mouthy with him he would have probably calmed them down you know without having to get into some physical okay not only that the kid wouldn't been able to mount them and bash his fucking head off the ground because he's physically incompetent if you're gonna fucking could patrol a neighborhood you can't do it just with a gun it can't be you can't have the only the last resort is your only resort you can't physically defend himself he's out of shape he's soft and doughy and he's not physically able to hold that guy off but yet he's put himself in this position where he's like a security he's the force of the truth of the law you can't do that you're not you're not qualified for that job he's just not so when that kids on top of them bouncing his fucking head off the curb look I don't see any way out for him other than using a weapon i when that kids beating the shit out of him but he should have never got into that position you should never it should have never escalated to that you tell me the only way two people can communicate like that is it comes into violence no it's how do you deal with it how do you communicate how did you address this person what did you say when he talked back to you what did you say what was what were the exchange of words right you know and those those things there's a big difference between there's a video that we played the other day um was some the G even lift bro you ever see that guy the Russian guy is he Russian there's even a worse one this yes I don't know the back of Stanny kids though in New York where the the Bronx the police chief in Bronx New York was like stop doing it you're going to get killed like these two kids just go on YouTube and they go up to people and in horrible neighborhoods and are like hey man you got a problem while he's holding a calculator and he's just trying to be funny but these guys are just bashing your heads in and stuff and so the Bronx chief police or something I said look stop it but yet these videos my more popular my point is if you watch those videos the guy he comes up to people that like look like the workout and goes dude lift bro look how small you are and some people handle it great some people go you know like man don't pull it up we don't need to see it some people go yeah I mean I don't even lift you know I guess I'm small and then they laugh and they walk away and some people like threaten them like it depends entirely on how two people interact with each other and I think that's what we don't know about the Anthony situation that's what we don't know about the Zimmerman it's not just about what went down it's about how did it all play out how could it have been avoided there's little subtleties in language like when Jonah Hill was apologizing recently and he and he's obviously not a homophobe we just got mad and said suck my dick faggot it was a stupid thing in a moment and he's other Tonight Show and I get he's just apologizing I think he never had to deal with something like this and he said something he goes bandy intent doesn't matter it's the words the words and it was like again I know you're on the spot in that moment I'm not gonna crucify the guy but I wish I was there so I could just appear on the seat next to him like in that Woody Allen scene when the guy walks out to correct the guy on line and go know that the intent is everything because if the words matter the next time somebody said the fucking Giants killed the Jets well we better call the police oh that's right it's the intent we understand every every every single interaction or phrase has an intent behind it which which doesn't always come through in the written words it's an inflection and that's something that you and I had a conversation about with the Tracy Morgan situation with people pretending that what he was saying when he was on stage you know that he was gonna stab a son if his son was gay like his whole act is filled with him saying ridiculous shit yeah this is not a statement son an affidavit he's making court you're taking it out of context because it's a soft target if you do that yes I'm gonna stab my son because he's gay as a statement of fact or at the at the end of a political rally is a pretty awful thing to say but if you've opened up with I'm gonna get you pregnant and I'm gonna mold shit and make a hat out of it it's kind of hard to take any one statement and go well that's the serious one but that's again that's that purposely ignoring context or even when you can't ignore it saying yeah we understand the context we don't fucking care it's just soft targets people find soft targets and those targets look if they're all ganging up on Anthony too that's the other thing I'm not saying boohoo Anthony right let's pay attention what's really going on if you're writing an article out of the blue for no reason about Jim Norton you're the only guy I think Jim Norton is a despicable person and you write this article you have the option to respond to that and you can go well who are you mister reporter dickwad let's take a look at you and then other people can take a look at him too but when everybody's piling on it's a free-for-all it's a free ride and then you're they're flailing wildly well louis c.k actually raised a really good point about that when something was happened he goes you know you have to remember to everybody's not googling you like everyone is not googling Joe Rogan or Jim Norton or Anthony Kumi alike so you're seeing every result about yourself and it appears overwhelming but the reality is like people may be reading Newsday or the post or the Glock or vice or you know whatever they're reading but they're not reading every single article on Anthony kuma or on Jim Norton so that's where the overwhelming thing is sometimes misleading because people are all reading little snippets of it mm-hmm but when you know what the companies getting calls from again five or six different outlets to them it feels overwhelming and like what the fuck do we do with this because this wasn't on the air so I think that's when again they haven't discussed this with me I'm purely speculating because to them if it was on the air I'm guessing they would have said well that's what he does on the air but they're not looking at it like well he was reacting to being hit I think they just were like okay we got a fire like I think that's why they they kind of just reacted very quickly I think they fucked themselves I really do they fucked themselves because they were supposed to be the place where it was free speech this is the wild place but we're the virus you would lose the virus channel member now it's Sirius XM talk that's it Sirius XM talk we have to rename it but we don't know what they if they have to did I ask you for input I don't my name on the show like I want to be on the show but I don't I don't want to be Opie and Jimmy I don't people to feel like I'm jumping in Anthony's right seat because I'm not right um if they call the Opie show I'm much more happy with that because that's what it was before he met Anthony call me I would call we miss Anthony uh yeah that would be kind of uh or Tony will call Tony so they don't know who we're talking about okay bring where's Tony no be sneaky yeah but it is a horrible and it's like people get mad at me and Opie and it's like we don't and I tried to say like we didn't mad at you for what because they people think that we're like a bunch of teenagers hanging out and like you guys should walk and support and say first of all you dumb motherfuckers that say that Anthony I've talked to he wouldn't walk and he told me dude you got to make your money like and it's all a and B I'm under contract I can't just walk I have three more months on the contract and I'll be tried to clear this up on the air like if we just walk out if they don't fire us and we just walk and say a bunch more subs leave because they realize like wow the show really is gone then all of a sudden serious wants to take action on us for breach it's a whole fucking legal people just don't get that part of it and they think that we're fucking Anthony you know who doesn't think we're fucking Anthony Anthony he knows we're not fucked only an idiot thinks you're fucking Anthony but there's always going to be idiots with opinions on ya and I'm fine with that I'm when people say like dude I love you and Opie but I gotta cancel because I'm staying with Anthony I don't get mad at those people or people like I'm gonna keep serious I'm also gonna listen to Aunt I don't bog I'm fine with that too because I get the emotion like whatever they got to do to support aunt is cool with me I want them to stay because my in my ideal world they listen to me and Opie and then they fucking listen to Anthony there's no competition I'm not gonna we're not like here you don't mention Anthony you know when his fucking show comes out I'm gonna I'm gonna tweet it because I want him to succeed because he's one of my closest friend it's gonna succeed it's going to if you you know just he's an entertaining guy he's an interesting guy and the platform of the Internet is so free and easy and he's already got a full professional set up at his house yeah people don't know if you've never seen one of the main reasons I started this podcast is because of live from the compound because he set a fucking green screen in his house a professional studio and he was playing images behind him of like the city of like he had a green screen I mean a beautiful green screen poke like professional broadcast quality cameras like the whole deal I was like that's amazing and that's slowly but surely led to what you're seeing right here like him doing that while he was already on Sirius and Sirius tried to stop him from doing that they got it they gave him a hard time about that yeah I mean that was it I think that was a contractual issue to it they're like look this is the medium you're on but eventually they kind of like let him do it no my god what do you think is going to go down with September when your contract is up October 4th I don't know I mean like I love the gig I love performing but do you love the gig the same with Anthony not be no of course not no I mean I mean the idea of performing either alone or with other people right I want this thing to work because I want my own thing like I've done so many this thing device thing yes Jim Norton show I want to have my own thing too because you feel like a more complete performer when you're not always with Opie and Anthony or Colin Quinn or louis c.k or amy schumer's put me on our show like I don't always want to be on somebody else's thing right um so I love the idea of performing on the radio I love doing it with Opie I love doing with Opie and Anthony more because I would say the same thing if Opie left like I honestly do love being a part of that radio show mm-hmm being without Anthony is difficult and hope you would say the same thing it's it's just like it's hard to realize how much space a person fills in your life until they're not there like I mean we all know Anthony's a comic gene that's easy to say but take the little moments like when there's that chair I mean I'm called I I said closer to I'm - Anthony that I do to you right every day five days a week for 10 years and now he's just gone and it's really hard to get used to that empty seat whether he's saying something funny or whether he's just doing a stupid erock joke or a little aside or just pie it's like this whole fucking vacuum of this this great powerful brain that used to be you know a foot away from me yeah or just talking about things he's a fascinating guy he's got a lot of information in his head he could talk about anything for any length of time anything he could be and we've said that like pitcher and I've said this before Patrice said that Anthony can access funny faster than anybody he'd ever known like he just had the ability to access being funny immediately on any subject like if you're talking like you know he was a tin knocker he would put in air-conditioning vents and he can walk you through that in a fascinating way and be funny about it and be captivating with it me and I I just died telling a story I lose people in me and it's a joke I've done but I meant the sincerity of it that if I was on 911 on the if I made it out of the first tower I would lose people halfway through the story like I just have no ability to go from the beginning to the middle to the end and keep people locked in did you guys have a meeting with Arius after this now over I know Opie hopefully talk to Scott I talked to Scott on the phone and he goes look we're gonna try to move forward with you and Opie and see how it happens he goes work through it organically on the air they didn't tell us how to to do it they didn't say don't man badmouth the company don't he said work through it organically on the air and what we'll see what happens so I mean see what happens and they completely closed the idea of Anthony ever coming back I don't think so um and they've given me no indication so I'm careful how I say that I don't want the fans getting like I'm putting false hope out there but I'm just being truthful is they it doesn't feel final to me and maybe that's my own denial or my own lack of willingness to admit that this thing could be over like it was really sad man last I saw anything I went to his fucking fourth of July party I was very depressed driving home like I know I'm gonna be okay financially and I know like hey this other show could take off hey you got standup hey you got but just the idea that this thing you love to do like art this chapter is closed like it just fucking depresses me depresses me to listen to it I couldn't imagine if it was me every day day in day out being a part of it you know I'm every time I did it I'd loved it I mean I had a great time doing your show my favorite radio show of all time without a doubt it's a real conversation you have real moments and the laughs somebody played for me recently or they sent me a link to Jim Norton's laugh compilation there's just times where people have made me laugh on the show and I listen to part 1 & 2 because the point is not me laughing it's the things and most of those laughs have come from Anthony more than any guest or anybody and some of the things that if he did a thing recently or years ago that I heard two days ago we were talking about people who've shot themselves in the head and survived and Anthony did the voice of the guy who survived and he just wanted to it was an immediate he became the guy who shot himself in the fucking head and survivors talk about how he just has a more positive outlook and I'm howling listening to it in the clip and I'm listening to it uh like you know yeah two days ago and I'm laughing all over again like I forgot that bit ever existed but god this cocksucker made me fucking laugh and I'm not talking about like he's dead but I mean that's how valuable of thing he is like I can I can't listen to radio best I think they made a big mistake I think they made a big mistake for a couple reasons one I think they made a big mistake because I think it's it's going to open the door more to the internet because people are going to look at that is the only the last remaining true free speech option yeah because it that's what it is look you can you could say you don't like this podcast you can decide that I'm offensive you can do with it but you can't stop it I mean you might even though the host might say we don't want to host you anymore I'll find another host you know the sponsors might say we don't want to be your sponsor anymore well guess what I'll do it with no sponsor we did it with no sponsors for years this is the only real option well you're your own producer your own director your own your the whole thing you're the performer you're the whole thing that's where it's at because just like a stand-up is entirely responsible for your act you put on stage if you had some producer hovering over your fucking shoulder every time you wrote a bit every time you were thinking about putting together a setlist every time you're going up and doing a show it would review it afterwards that would be gross they would take all the fun out of being a comic yeah it would be awful I think that's why I'm bad collaborator because you're so used to having absolute and ultimate control of things so you're a perfect example think about you and you as a successful performer and personality who the fuck would have ever thought you could have made a mainstream career out of talking about your love of trannies talking about shit and piss and and shit in each other's mouths and peeing on people monster rain just look at the honest things that you've tackled because you're honest because you're funny if you had to vet that through somebody else if you had to have that filter through some sort of a mainstream producer it would have never happened you'd never work you're absolutely right I mean that's why you're right the Internet is the last place where at least I mean for now who the fuck knows what happens with that but all that stuff you did you did on Sirius Sirius had a different approach when they first came out they've slowly but surely clamped down from that Condoleezza Rice incident that's where I was like oh you could get intro for something that someone says on a radio show that isn't even like a guest yeah like I mean isn't even one of one of the hosts right here's your show could get cancelled a homeless guy yeah and they were going to fire us that Eric Logan Seder that was accent wasn't sure it was it and this is how what happened the fucking the NAB the National Association of Broadcasters somebody on that side I think was what was pushing it because the story went on Drudge and Breitbart will this hurt the merger and again the guys who ran the this wasn't about to merge will this injure the merger and man it was a billion dollars at stake and it wasn't going to hurt the merger but they fucking panicked these are all different people that are in charge now but they're like well ah and they don't know how to deal with stuff so they get the phone call the guy Nate I think was running XM at the time or two Panero what do you think of this thing they said a homeless guy said he wants to rape Condoleezza Rice and felt like like he's worried about a billion-dollar merger and I'm not I'm not defending them suspending us but I try to put myself in there like and this is again I mentioned Louie cuz he's a good he's a good non-emotional reactor two things and he'll look at things ago well they're just trying to do this and like Louis will give you a very logical reason as to why something's happening and it's like yeah I wish I would have seen that I get too angry and emotional and you're fucked I'm there say and then I'll go like okay that's a billion dollar company they're not used to this and they hear this guy wants the fucking first lady raped Bush or George Bush and they're laughing about it merger might be threatened to provoke them get rid of up my Hispanics isn't it fascinating though that you're talking about a billion dollar company okay Sirius XM billion-dollar company okay what exactly are they selling well what they're selling is content who delivers that content guys like Opie and Anthony guys like Jim Norton they're selling your ability to be entertaining other than that it's just music how do you have a billion dollar company that's just selling music well I don't that's what my argue would be to it looked a talk thing is the last like the last thing you guys have and this is for any for terrestrial radio to the last thing you have is original talk content and their point back would be that's a great thing that we have but we also have whether it's a celebrity people doing shit or we have sports that you can't get across that T we have the NBA we have a majorly amazing we let you say that's what they would say yeah but nobody's paying for that let's be honest they're paying for Stern they're paying for Opie and Anthony I hope so men especially since Spotify and like those like Pandora they used to be I like Sirius radio because I had like the 30s the 40s the 50s whatever and all the different radio stations nowadays you just put Spotify put anything you wanted as a you know yeah I mean I I get almost all my shit from iTunes I don't ever listen to music in my car anymore unless it's coming off of my phone I just yeah it's just I don't need to you don't need to anymore you don't need them anymore yeah and what the last thing that the exciting is things like Stern and things like Opie and Anthony where you can have a guy who is just freewheeling saying whatever he wants doesn't have to worry about language restrictions doesn't have to worry about anything and the fact that he get fired for saying the same things that he's always said on his show to saying them in a text message that they're so ignorant that they can't recognize that this is you're taking it out of context you're taking it from a guy who just recently been assaulted you're taking it from a guy probably had a couple of drinks and then when he said it and he shouldn't done it he fucked up he definitely shouldn't have gone on that Twitter rampage you should have said it on a video and you know what Parker on the show up on a shelf on the show it would have been perfect we have been a great episode all that would have been fun and and Keith Robinson pointed out he's like the teasing we could have given him all the teasing beautiful but but I don't know if that's something that we'll ever change like they may at one point yeah we do kind of understand that maybe he's you know he's a valuable asset to the clique you know again I don't I don't know why I don't get that feeling because they haven't said to me we'll bring him back would they really haven't and I never want to give fans I'm not trying to keep fans from canceling it literally is just a feeling a gut feeling he didn't drop and bombs he didn't go on this and I've talked to him enough to know what his intent was and maybe I just this naive dumbing in me but I keep thinking man he should come back he can come back just give it some time I just keep hoping for that I think he can come back I think if they gave it some time he definite and come back in the context of what he said it wasn't that bad you know I wouldn't been happy if it was my company I had shareholders and all that jazz but I obviously I would never be that guy anyway I would never be a fucking head of a big company I'm just not built for it but you got to recognize the entertainment quality you know the entertainment aspect of that guy the entertainment possibilities of keeping the show together it says without that all you have a stern you know you mean obviously you guys are still together and it'll still be a great show but it's not the same show it's not and you you leave open the door for Anthony starting his own thing some wildly successful thing in the internet which also look if someone comes along and they put together some sort of an advertising budget and they say hey listen we would like to do the Opie we'd like to host the Opie and Anthony podcasts on the internet we'll take X percentage of the the advertisers we've already got it lined up we have a big launch we're going to do it around Thanksgiving someone's gonna fuck a turkey live on the air you know whatever you know I'm saying you start you start doing you come up with some idea to do something completely free and wild on the internet a big advertising push by billboards Times Square you know fuck serious we're doing it on the Internet you know ona is back and it's free downloaded online you don't need to pay for a subscription anymore anybody can get it on your phone let me do it the way we do it we're available on we're available online as an mp3 we're available from iTunes we're available on stitcher on YouTube on Ustream on Vimeo if you just did something like that it would be gigantic yeah maybe the right man we have thought about it and again we're up in October 4th we don't know and I and I'm we honestly don't know what we do from here like again Opie and I are doing the show bringing guests in and just performing and it's like we both feel the fucking law through vice do it all through vice there would be a wonderful promotion vehicle to view guys to do Opie and Anthony live through vice they'll set you up with a studio do it all online do the show as a video online and do the show have it available as a podcast free downloads they provide you with advertisers wouldn't be hard to do Shane could hook that up in five seconds make one phone call and it would be the wheels would be in motion I would I would I would love to do that and that's a guy's you know like she could get really crazy and everyone's gonna be fine
