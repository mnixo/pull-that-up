hello freak bitches a lot of us right now we're going into alternate dimensions via technology and hanging out there enjoying it experiencing the freedom from the confines of being constantly in it infinitely located in whatever physical space your body happens to be inhabiting to suddenly remove that weight and I can pop these things on and instantly translocate to some art universe that some geniuses created fuck around shoot arrows wander through Minecraft have sex with two girls who I was apparently going to throw out of my house if they didn't fuck me that's what the point is I never do that but in this universe I guess that's what I do yeah so they're kind of rapey what it's not rapey it's just like please I don't have money for the rent can I suck your dick oh you know it's her idea oh yeah you're not type you're not raping so it's not like look you got you got to give up some pussy either otherwise I'm kicking you this tree you could say it if you want into the porn I mean you could say whatever you want wait you tell you have a microphone yeah I'm a microphone but you can talk to it if you want to be a weird but okay how long before you can talk to it how long before it talks back to you well that's you're gonna look you're looking at like so we got to figure out a way to either I mean I imagine that probably exists in some rudimentary way for some kind of CGI style porn but to be able to like instantaneously communicate with live video porn you're gonna need some kind of AI that I don't think we probably have just yet or we are probably on the print but yes that will have to come oh that's definitely gonna happen I've watched ex machina again on the plane the other day I watched it for the second time that's cause it's just as good the second time that movie freaks me out man why because the girls so beautiful and she's so she's so attractive like you know that guy you could see as much as he knew that she was a robot as much as he knew that he was in a robot as as much as he knew that she was artificial he was in love with her and she was amazing and it seemed like she cared about him and when she was talking to him for real like when the lights went out and the camera was down spoiler alert and she was like don't trust him yeah I'm like this is like a real person yes a real person she's thinking like a person it's a person yeah and he's like completely locked in to this idea that it's a person he's hypnotized it's a person I mean I don't this whole distinction between artificial intelligence and intelligence is the same as the distinction between virtual reality and reality it's just like another human attempt to be in control of something you want you want to say oh I'll tell you if this is fucking reality or not oh this is virtual reality this isn't reality reality but it's like oh really so reality is compartmentalized into places where there's if something is created by a human oh no that's not real reality even though humans are reality reality's reality intelligence is intelligence because the intelligence is inhabiting something that isn't the human vessel it goes back to what we were talking about earlier what because it's not in a fucking meat body now it's artificial intelligence how is why intelligence is intelligence and then Rosa Parks yes but the Rosa Park one is real that's 100% real is that when she that's when she got arrested you know she was a lot of people get that story wrong but a lot of people think like she sat in the front of the bus and then was asked to move to the back well somebody else had done it before her of course the gorgeous of course course Wendy but even the front of the bus part isn't correct what part what is it it's kind it's a very mean my new thing but I'm like a history dude there was a white section in the front right african-american in the book in the back at the time to go black colored section she was in the colored section but what happens was if the white section filled up and a white person went back to the colored section sit down you still had to stand up and give them your seat really yeah and they she wouldn't do it and that's that was the start of it wow I did not know I know it's a small you know but everyone says oh she wouldn't go to the back of the but it's like well that's even gross I agree I agree it is grosser just like literally just sitting there and then just some guy yeah she's complying with your racist rule and then you're like not racist enough yeah yeah yeah so so then that's when she got arrested parks original seat Wow you're totally right am i correct yeah but I've never seen I've never seen this pick there's a diagram like the Kennedy assassination it looks like the fucking Magic Bullet Rosa Parks boarded the bus and sat in an aisle seat in the designated colored section collar stops later the driver told parks and three other blacks okay in her row to move to the back to make room for a white man the three blacks moved to the back parks slid to an adjacent window seat refused to move wait till it was even an input okay just so I'm clear on this now that I'm learning something I almost feel like now like they didn't even want him to have to sit necklace is that what it was like that was an empty seat yep that's exactly that right am I reading that right you're absolutely really that's interesting right that is it's awful that's awful that's another thing that's not that long ago all these things that are not that long ago the colored flag being on I mean the Confederate the colored flag the Confederate flag being on the state right flag of Georgia this what year was this I want to say this is sixty what year was it I want to say like 61 that makes sense 56 and late fifties right well I'm totally wrong Montgomery Alabama system was legally integrated Wow so good learn I learned a little something so I staged photo then her right there yeah like how if there was a full bus and there's a white guy behind her what like houses what's this photo from I don't know I see it's a Wikipedia photo they might have done that after the fact right what's in the upper right hand corner what is that is that the actual is that like no upper right hand corner upper right hand corner yeah I never yell at somebody like this this is the bus where it's at and so like you can actually go there and sit an extra of Obama there Wow so they took the actual bus and put it in a museum Wow that's it up above it someone should make it tour bus oh that I think cast or something yes so this this TMS thing transcranial magnetic stimulation covered by Blue Cross huh yeah so yeah that's what like it's it's it was really really good like I for a lot of my life I felt like I had egg all right I had like I had like a thing like it almost felt like a metal weight like a bit of like five-pound weight on my upper left forehead my left and then so I went to this oh dude that sound is like an MRI sound yeah that's what it is it is yes it's basically the same exact magnet as an MRI but it's just very dear Hey yeah they put it on your head it's pretty simple the first time they measure it they have to get to like the exact spot there's there's another video where my finger is pulsing that you'll enjoy and what is it doing to you like what's the benefit it's basically magnetizing and electrifying a it's waking up basically dead synapses according to them really yeah so it's it's waking up dead synapses and waking up dead waking them up so they're dormant uh that's what they say um you don't even look anyway you look good shoot me yeah what is it I don't have kids man so I'm like yeah whatever whatever it's gonna cost me I'm happy to do it if you had kids you think you wouldn't do it I think if I had kids I'd be like you know sort of more more cautious about it really yeah probably because I'm not like reckless but I'm not I'm not like I do Risa it's all so vague anyway the research it's also like we think it does this most antidepressants they know they think they know what's happening they don't actually know yeah that's a weird one yeah when you think about how many people are prescribed these things and then there's not really a direct understanding of how it impacts each person like they'll tell you hey we'll try this medication and if it doesn't work we'll try another one yeah does this one work well this cycle throat and how do you know if it's working for you or if you're having a good time in your life and so you're feeling better because maybe you start a new relationship and a new job and it's going wow and hey it's just everything seems pretty good I was on medications that made me nauseous for a year and a half before I was like you know what I literally thought I was nauseous because I was eating too many lifesavers I'm not even fucking kidding I was like I gotta take it easy on these lifesavers cuz every night I throw up on the way to the Laugh Factory and then I realize like you know Neil you're taking a pretty high dosage of zola you might want to just take it down a notch
