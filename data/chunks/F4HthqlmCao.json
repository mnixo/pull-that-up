[Music] I'm here with confirmed cosmonaut Steve oh yeah a man who's been to space a man who knows about the atmosphere I can't say I've been to space I went up in a Russian MIG fighter jet to the edge of the Earth's atmosphere hi I was on do you know how fucking forget shit I fuckin forget but it wasn't that much higher than so normal flight is like 1000 and then what's like I forgot they've go higher right they can go up they're like thirty five thousand for a commercial point I want to say that it might have been like not much more than fifty thousand but I I can't back that up I don't remember it was shockingly less than you would imagine oh that's you yeah oh no shit oh yeah straight up oh my god use a lot of they used a lot of stock footage but at the same time on the way down this motherfucker did twirls and fuck it was here's like the gnarliest rollercoaster ride ever ah and I and this is me filming myself like look at that dude oh my god it's like it's fucking night up there wow that's that shows for anybody wants to say that the fucking world is flat that's what I could prove motherfuckers well you can see the curvature of the earth wow that's nuts and so when you were doing this did you get ghosts close to blacking out like how was the g-force I didn't get close to black man or anything like that and I thought that that it would be one thing what it was was I was just fuckin claustrophobic man isn't cramping a tiny little I get claustrophobic - I didn't like that did you do they tell you how many g-forces you were doing ah that's another thing I can't remember but I feel like there was more G shit going on when we did the zero-gravity plane okay which you know it just kind of goes along and then it does a big bell curve kind of deal so you become weightless right that one you could feel yourself really like being pulled down with the G's whatever I did a flight with the fa-18 with the Blue Angels once they took me up and they take you out it's you go down to San Diego and then you travel east like through the desert it's weird and I don't know which Air Force Base is out there it's like real close to I guess close to Arizona or maybe even in Arizona but we got to seven and a half G's we were doing these crazy things where you go like through these mountain ranges and you're only like 100 maybe 200 feet off the ground really low to the ground turning and twisting and fucking bananas dude yeah dude so they took you up and wild boys and what year was this was okay we were cool with the Russians then right that was 2005 yeah 2005 that was our last ever wild boys trip oh yeah yeah and we brought Knoxville with us knock so we had some like Russian army kind of Dayton dudes and and then Knox was like shoot me with the 9-millimeter gun with the rubber bullet while the dog bites me yeah he was he was going for it and and and our director Jeff Tremaine was like hey if you still have this in you why don't we not do it for TV let's make another movie and that was why we stopped doing wild boys and made jackass number two if you still have this in you oh I still want to get a beating with rubber bullets do we a lot of shit happen on that fuckin that last wild boys trip man there is a we always we had this practice of like before the censors you know like it's called standards and practices they'll be like you know they'll give back notes like you can't you know show this and so we would film what we called red herrings like we just blatantly ridiculous shits and never like never gonna be loud on TV but then we'll be like okay well we'll cut this out and so then we'll be able to keep some other shit right so we would always go out of our way to film this fucked up stuff and in Russia we me and one of the guys from that from the crew put like put on these animal suits the what was it at the time it wasn't panda bears polar bears with the big fucking like mascot head and we fucking hired two hookers and had full-on fucking hookers came in like full porno we sold four fucking porno I would included to be included that in the episode yeah and the notes came back from standards and practices I can really please like that you have to take out the you know the cocksucker he had the poked polar bear getting his dick sucked like that the whole thing yeah and there were there was a little bit of fucking hooker action in that one you know and I'm not necessarily that stoked about it but um there was we went to it we went to like a whorehouse brought this hooker back to the hotel right is it like a whole thing and then in in in the and and I don't think I ever could even have sex with it with a hooker without like snuggling after I want to like snot snuggle it's nothing you know oh my god not to stay with me I want to like you know cuddle and stuff and in the morning this this hooker she just tells me like how much how much I owe her right and I'm like that's fucking outrageous there's no fucking away I was like sighs like basically I don't care if your fucking pimp wants to kick my ass and fucking kill me I'm not paying that fucking much I forget it was so long ago but but yeah I was outraged so that was initiated before him it just it just wasn't in that case exactly I remember clearly I was like you want that much and I said I said I'll give you this much and that's how much you'd get worried and we came out right like you know I got a go film and walking through the lobby Knoxville's down there having breakfast this hooker comes walking by knocks once she says that's not Steve oh that's cheapo even that much into like hookers but but but you know in looking back on I guess I've really fuckin kind of had sex that bunch of hookers because I had this girlfriend and you know like I work a program of recovery I gotta be honest and shit and I had this girlfriend she was an English chick and she says have you ever had sex with a prostitute I'm like oh fuck you know and I tell her tell mother you know I never did until I was in England one time and you know there's we did this Gumball Rally where you race cars with all the rich guys and yeah they're getting hookers and they they got me one and yeah I've brought heard though I told her the whole story about how I was I can't give me a massage she's giving me a back rub and this hooker says this is one expensive back rub and I felt like she was making fun of me and said not fuck it and I put on some Motley Crue and put on a rubber and I humped her okay you know I told this story to my girlfriend she says or so okay what did you was there any other ones and I'm like ah fuck you know I'm like well in New Zealand you know like there was a massage parlor and it turned out that that they just have sex to you you know like an and it's a joke how you know it's like I didn't I've like I felt like I was having the sex of the prostitute but she was a masseuse like there's not another one and I'm like wow there's a time in Indonesia no just kept rolling on yeah and the thing was at that exact time we were she'd arranged this trip to go to Cornwall it's a little surf town in England because I like collect pictures with you know of different countries where you know and I call it my surf passport and I'm like I want to get a surfing photo so I can include England she's like she says I don't know why you're making a surf Passport you should have a fucking hooker Passport it's so funny - like driving over here I was like thinking man fuck I'm so nervous about going on on you know Joe Rogan's podcast because how can I touch the last time it was so epic like there's never been another interview that I've ever done that has got that I've gotten more feedback like people just being like dude I fucking heard that like people were like inspired people who are struggling with substance abuse they're like man like that helps me help me get sober like I just like mean Howard Stern like you name it any interview I've ever done in my life like it has this has been the one that I'd I hear about the most and I get the most positive feedback fucking grateful to you for that man well I'm grateful for you coming on you can't compare yourself to yourself though don't ever do that hey I get that fuck you over it'll get you every time I get that I know I saw that like on Jim Jefferies the Jim Jeffrey does I think even did that on his on his special he's like all this special isn't as good as my last special he said that I'm this fellow he's gonna do right but that's the thing like I'm not gonna do that too much but go behind a moment right in the moments do you bro thank you for that Jim you're an in-the-moment guy I'm pretty pretty good about that but but I should say they're not gonna like get in my head and I'm not gonna trip myself out but I did want to come in hot so I just fuckin came out with the hooker stories that's good from edge space dude Chris Pontius my Wildboyz co-star guy I remember at one point saying something to the effect of like ah you know like I'm an astronaut you know and and pontius if I can nailed me so hard it's so fucking funny he says he says you're not not a virgin because you go to the edge of the girl's vagina good point you kind of had to cross the goal line what was more dangerous doing jackass or doing wild boys because I watched jackass and I go why these guys are so crazy but I watched wild boys and literally my asshole just tightness I get my toes curl I'd start clenching my hands together I can't do I don't know how the fuck you guys did it and got away with it right there's no question man that got fucking lions tigers bears venomous reptiles yeah when that lion climbed a tree and bit your fucking hat here's the thing right and here's the thing and and is a distinction about this jackass completely fade there's so much integrity in jackass Knoxville like we're not like ever people says is the stuff you do real fuck yeah it's real 100% and and with wild boys there's no I mean what you see is it happened but what we were dishonest about with wild boys is like locations we would pretend that we were in in Africa when really they had this fucking in California there's a company called like Hollywood animals right where they've got like you know whatever they've got the fuckin Lions and the Tigers and shit now when we went over to Africa the first time we brought the zebra suit every intention of being on safari playing around in front of lions but that wasn't in the cards they're like now that's not going to happen oh my god Lu yeah we found that we found this great whole thing going through the safari in the tomb and zebra suit but but the only way we could get the end was to come back to California I remember Jay Leno fuckin call it called his hat the first time we went on the Jay Leno Show to promote Wildboyz he says you know I want he came to the dressing room here I said I watched that that lion clip with the the team and zebra suit I'm thinking hmm you know I've never seen gravel like that you know in Africa you know on the ground and he says the way that the lion went for the zebra head the cot the the he said no part of that nope no part of that lion wants that fake zebra head you know it doesn't make sense and and he was so right he nailed it 100% he's like I'm guessing what they did was they rubbed some kind of shit on the zebra head to attract the lion to it and he just broke it down you know I have the last thing I'm gonna do is be a fucking fan of Jay Leno buddy okay okay he is I'm telling you man he just seems weird because he did The Tonight Show for so long okay and I'm not trying to like just piggyback on Howard Stern being a stern fan but I don't know I got a weird vibe myself from from Jay Leno but I but I'll take your word for it what he impressed the shit out of me with that calling out that line but what weird vibe did you give wrong I don't know like I just felt like for all the times that we were guests or that I was on his show I just felt like is it yeah I think it's fair to say I felt like maybe a little bit Todd talked down to and away and I felt like sort of like I'd like the impression that I got was that whoever booked us on the show wasn't him and that he was sort of like under protest like you know maybe I'm just he was sort of under protest for almost everything that was on the show I mean it was really a mess look Jay Leno started out as one of the top stand-up comics in the world he was a fucking killer he was a young guy who would go on Letterman and he was edgy and this is let you know 1970s or early 1980s whatever and then he got The Tonight Show and when he got The Tonight Show he became a Tonight Show host and he never put out he does still to this day doesn't put out any standup you can't see it anywhere other than he does it every week but he does the same act ah yeah he doesn't change his shit it's like it's real weird he's a weird guy but what his real I mean he's still a great comic but his real passion is cars like if you're a car guy and you go over to his place you like you get to see the real Jay Leno like you've been doing like I did it showed Jay Leno's Garage I was like you should've been doing this the whole time why did you even fuck with The Tonight Show like Y you're a fucking monster when it comes to cars he's fun he's loose he knows everything about cars you get to see the real him he lights up I remember we were promoting jackass 3d on The Tonight Show went over there we did the t-ball thing right like where it's like a tee ball but it's got an arm and you hit it and then it hits me in the nuts and and we did it I think it was like during rehearsal or said we did it like during rehearsal fully hit me in the nuts and and I wanted to demonstrate that I wasn't wearing a cup right right and I had these tighty whities on and I fucking pulled down my tighty whities to show it was just my dick didn't really need to do yeah that's part of the problem he's so old school right I see it clearly now and he said he goes it looks like a dick just a lot smaller that was just part of I don't know just part of where I got that vibe from him but the last thing I don't wanna fuck I know what you mean I know what you mean and then there was a doll that dispute with him in Howard Stern sure because like what was he going on like writers were taking bits from Stern and doing it on right I can't even remember it is Howard so yeah Howard hated Johnny Carson too right yeah well you know what man that's why those things were a lot of those guys you know especially like if you have a platform like Howard you feel dissed by some guys got another platform like well fuck this guy time to go to war she's Howard's whole thing was about conflict conflict his ratings he was the king of ratings right now with Jay Leno and Howard it was personal with with Howard and Carson I think is just Howard had the impression that Carson was a bad dude no I don't know I think he had a personal thing with him too I maybe I'm just making that up I don't know but I'm telling you man I knew Jay from The Tonight Show and knew Jay from when I was on NBC I've seen him on here with you Judy was great on here yeah I thought the stories about like doing stand-up for the mob shows like and have seen some psychopath mob guy yell at a priest did they were great fucking story hey did I fucking I recant anything I should say I'm fucking grateful it's Jay Leno because he had right yeah no yeah what things with those dudes if you did one you couldn't do the other right unless you're like you know someone who's a humongous star yeah those show suck they really do they're just I mean not and no no disrespect to them but those five minute things we sit on the couch then you cut to the next thing it's just right it's just a shitty way to get to know somebody it's gone downhill from there because all anybody gives a fuck about is what's gonna you know take off on the internet the next day exactly exactly they're not even focused on anything except some fucking gimmicks it's gonna some highlight reel clip right yeah yeah did you see the The Colbert thing where he went off on jump I couldn't fucking believe it I was watching it I was like III tweeted about this that I don't think kids today have any idea how strange it is to watch a talk show host call the president's mouth a cock holster okay that's right talking about the president I mean I know it's Donald Trump but it's still the president there's their song weird there's a lot of weird stuff going on and then did you see Colbert Colbert responding just to Trump's response how did that made me uncomfortable why you know I'm sure people don't even hear about that we do it made me uncomfortable where he's like hmm I won and you know like I mean it's it's again it's just playing into you know what can i well if what he said was he got Trump to respond trying to get he was trying to get the President to say his name for so long and he finally did and it was right what he said was that I thought you of all the things that I thought you were dumb about the one thing that I thought you knew about was show business I thought you understood show business so like I was trying to get you to respond and you did so I win right which is just okay so now the president then this is even weird because weirder because now the president is responding to a guy who's essentially saying that he's a fucking troll I mean Stephen Colbert multi-millionaires talk-show host on a major network took over the Letterman spot is now admitting that he's essentially like a guy on Twitter as a fucking egg icon I think yeah what's this low level yeah super low level whole thing was in and it wasn't because all this stuff that Trump was saying about how they were gonna take him off and they were gonna know the guy Corden who came after they were gonna put James Corden into Colbert's timeslot like I mean all the reports I saw were that they were trying to get Colbert the fuck out and then all the sudden he started slamming Trump and now he's not like number one out of everybody in late-night well that's how it goes stupid fucking business they just have to get people to pay attention to them and sometimes that's the way to do it I mean maybe Colbert just got desperado but it's the whole if the whole thing is so fucking strange like Colbert strange man he's a like a hardcore Catholic oh yeah hardcore which is even weirder that he's calling the president's mouth a cock holster it's a hardcore Catholic it's like we're here where your standard sly like where are you where do you draw that line that's not very Catholic of you it's like the guy from Megadeth the the lead singer of Megadeth became like a super hardcore Christian really and now won't sing some of the songs and he won't perform with some certain death metal bands fantastic man there's something happens I don't know if you noticed this but something happens that I've been noticing as you know I'm almost 50 I'll be 50 in August dude bless your heart bless your heart I'll be I'll be 43 next month dude it just creeps up on you take time moves faster as it goes by if well you know what it is like your reference to time is different because when you're six a year is a sixth of your life okay when you're 49 it's like another year it's like tick tick tick tick tick tick also you're busy as fuck so the day's keep moving quick reference it's time I think it also fucking goes by faster it seems like it goes by faster and you have more of them to think about I had a bit that I was working on for the long time I I don't know if I'm gonna resurrect it but the premise is that God must hate us no no you'd be suffering think about that you live in like this Stevo how could not hate God hate you he loves you right right why me it's it's a fucking comedy right I mean right but the pros make sense though right sure and then I back it up dude i back it up I do that ok now we're the only living organism right they can like watch and have an opinion of itself wilting you know right that's good point it's a fucking really good point you know a fucking bananas not looking in the mirror saying oh fuck i'm bruising this sucks like I don't look as good as I did fucking you know I'm going rotten well what's really weird is when you watch do you watch videos of yourself from like a long time ago and you see how different you look yes but I think a lot of people I look pretty fucking I look less different well think it look less different than other people now I get like super sensitive about like you know if I post a picture online motherfuckers old you know like in fact like I wish it didn't but it does but I'm just fuckin sensitive guys motherfuckers old but now I got a pack now I got a project that I'm working on where I'm digging up like old ass footage and I'm looking at it I'm thinking I don't look that much fucking different fuck all these people you know mmm maybe you delusional I me I look younger for sure but well you've kept your body in a reasonable shape you're in good shape then with real issues when people balloon I looked at Kathleen Turner do you remember Kathy she went to my high school in London England dude she was so hot when she was young and now she's like right like she's got that alcoholic face you know where people don't just get older but everything sort of balloons and you know your your cheeks balloon and your chin balloon it's all swelling and it's crazy teeth I got I went to high school all four years in London England at the American School in London England and there's only called the American school called the American school in London England so I don't have an accent because everyone was just American at the school and I really so it was actually everyone at the school was in reckon that yeah in England they have like different fucking kind of high school it's like it's not great it's like forms you graduating when you're 16 it's all different curriculum but this is in England in London and you take it say SATs you have like so just like America it's an American school in London yeah your folks were living in England folks correct yeah I grew up in five different countries did you really yeah I was born in and when I was six months old moved to Brazil my family moved to Brazil exactly it's no one would ever fucking guess this but my dad was like a baller ass corporate executive really and when I was six months old my family moved to Brazil because my dad became the president of Pepsi Cola in all of Brazil holy shit yeah so he did so they were fuckin gone you know I had him chicken on like right they had live-in maids and I was raised by fucking like these Brazilian servants that lived that live now so I spoke my first words in Portuguese why because my parents didn't my parents didn't fuckin pay attention to me so that's what made me crazy perhaps yeah I deal with you now well my mom died in 2003 and my dad and I are fuckin tight as fuck everything that was cool yeah everything that like drove us apart and brought us together yeah spoke my first words in Portuguese in Brazil when I was 2 years old moved to Venezuela and I spoke fluent Spanish in nursery school in Caracas Venezuela holy shit when I was 4 years old moved to Connecticut so by the time I was 3 I spoke three languages fluently by the time I was 5 I forgot two of them completely and then when I was 6 years old we moved to Miami when I was 9 years old moved to London England when I was 12 years old moved to Canada lived in Toronto and then 13 years old back to England and I stayed there all through high school Wow so this is all your dad just being an executive for different companies yeah with them to move from Brazil to Venezuela dad got promoted to fuck allah president Pepsi Cola in like South America I think maybe like maybe all of South America I'm not sure then when we moved to to Connecticut I wanted to say that's when dad became a fuckin a big tobacco CEO whoa hilarious yeah I smoked he never fucking took a puff on a cigarette in his life ever Wow as an executive yeah it fuckin do dad sold soda Pepsi fuckin just sold sugar water than cigarettes and then when we when we were living in Miami this is the 1980s and all of a sudden it came to light that the cigarettes were bad for you right and all the tobacco companies started buying up food companies yeah because they're thinking fuck we got to get out we got to get out of this right and so dad worked for RJ R which is a tobacco company and RJ R r.j. Reynolds what it was RJ Reynolds and they bought Nabisco and the companies merged it became RJR nabisco and that dad had an aberrational e good year that year that dad ended up becoming like the president of Nabisco and shit Wow yeah I forget if it was I don't really know they didn't figure out into the 1980s that cigarettes are bad for you they only really it only became a legal issue in the eighties like lawsuits and shit right they all they really got fucking scared a la City you know what's crazy I just read something about tobacco companies that they're making more money now than ever that less people smoke but they stay charged more for cigarettes now than they ever have before oh my god it's 20 fucking dollars a pack what 20 fuckin dollars a pack 20 dollars American or 20 noseless trillion Wow twenty dollars Australian what's the exchange rate it's a full parity to the Canadian dollar so just a pretty close to our 100 one Australian dollar is 75 cents I'm for American dude it's so fucking funny I was over there I've done a couple Australian to a few Australia tours and I went in there they got the the fucking cigarettes locked up like you can't even see them they're in a fucking like a done cabinet you know you gotta you gotta ask them to unlock the gun cabinet which you can't even see into and then like it's illegal for them to even have a fucking a logo like there's no logo there's no nothing like even the name like Marlboro they don't they can't use the brand name of Marlboro every fucking cigarettes the name of the company has to be in the same fucking font they can they can't even have the Marlboro logo or font it's all a uniform font that says the company and the entire fucking pack is just the most the whole fucking packaging is nothing but one gigantic photo of like a dead baby like the most hilarious fucking like shit and and I'm telling you that's and it's $20 per pack and everybody's fuckin smoking that's like the craziest thing about it is it the more they charge more than ever and there you go whoa fullscreen with that James Christ that causes blindness smoking causes throat and mouth cancer brand you see breath Wow so fucking it doesn't work dude it doesn't keep people from buy it that's what's very imagine that imagine picking up a new pack that is so fucking busy they got dead babies causes emphysema graham cracker knows every single one of them this so fucking hilarious yeah I've never seen that I've seen in England they have a big picture of like people that have you know like lung cancer and shit on the cover and it says smoking will kill you but they don't have this shit what the fuck its causes peripheral vascular disease and makes your feet rot gangrene the most tame picture I saw on a pack of cigarettes was um it was a picture of a toilet with with blood in the water and I forget what the point was on that one but cigarettes make your asshole bleed crazy that doesn't even work like you're selling someone something that you're showing them all the Tara shit that I could do and everybody's like yeah worth it right where the for a pot I know I used to be convinced I remember dr. drew dr. drew used to pester me like to try to get me on that Celebrity Rehab show before I was sober right and he had another project which was trying to it was focused on getting people to quit smoking cigarettes were you smoking at the time I smoked for fucking 17 years started smoking when I sixteen and stopped when I was 33 whoa yeah seventeen years I fuckin smoke do you feel any ill effects of it now at 43 Oh [Music] almost 43 and how's your cardio I think it's pretty good what what fucked up my cardio was all that nitrous oxide dude those whip-it cartridges yeah there's 24 per box and there's 25 boxes per case so per case there's 600 cartridges and it was not unusual for me to go through 600 in like 24 hours 24 to 36 hours why I took every measure to try to limit like the fucking air that went into my lungs to try to make it like all nitrous oxide like I was the whole time I'm holding I'm holding in a long full of that shit I'm just broke with my fuckin can't the the canister from Starbucks and gentlemens I was like a fucking wizard at like loading up six in two while holding the last fucking ones you know and and that was when all the crazy shit would go down cuz I would be like awake cocaine for three days and inhaling nothing but nitrous oxide at that point is when shit starts popping off people are people are walking around my apartment who are never physically there i watch seeing a but shit like actual fucking people man I watched a dude walk through my apartment and fucking pick up pick up my bong and take a hit and blow out smoke and fucking then like put it down and just the dude walked through the wall he was never fucking there ever whoa looked as real as I do I had fucking like tactile hallucinations I had fucking feel things big-time dude because here's like here's my whole thing and I kind of still believe this to this day's you know that like our little our little three-dimensional experience is very small small part of what's going on in the universe right there's dimensions there's you know all frequencies everything and that like that if you do enough drugs like that the barriers between these different compartments of the universe and become eroded somehow you know like I started hearing voices and and to an extent I thought we believe still that that shit was real like these spirits that were fucking talking to me I'm hearing the voices like I had a conversation with a friend of mine ourselves we'd about a very similar thing where I was saying that I think that something happens when when you smoke pot it's not just that you get high but that the way you interface with the world changes and then the world changes because of that not not the world changes like the world change for you or for him but the world that I'm experiencing is different yeah like in the quantum physics kind of sense I don't know I'm too stupid for that right what I'm saying is that my feeling about the world is that when you when you change the way your brain works which is essentially what you're doing you get really high he change the way you think about the world I think the world that you experience is different sure it's like you know like people think like this is this very simplistic way of looking at it but it's sort of parallel you know some people think oh the world sucks everything sucks and their life always sucks and then there's people that are always super positive and super happy and their life is always sorry there's something about when you get like really high like especially marijuana because marijuana is a sensitivity drug it's almost like the opposite of a lot of drugs because a lot of drugs make you insensitive like alcohol makes you blunt right you're not aware of people looking at you you don't give a fuck you're like whoa you get drunk you get loud and you're crazier and your social cues get skewed you don't see marijuana is the opposite marijuana you get like really aware of other people people will call it paranoid because you start thinking about all these possibilities that you never thought of before but I feel like the way you interface with the world becomes very different you're aware of all these different possibilities you start thinking about things that you fucked up when you were in high school you know you started you know mushrooms are the worst for that oh yeah oh sure I made a mistake make you accountable I get so introspective I mean I had to spend forever but is it too introspective I got I got two intervals what house how to like just start picking myself apart like and you know putting myself on trial in a sense like just too introspective or I'm just like to determine that I just suck you know well maybe that's just a perspective like I think the introspective aspect of it one of the reasons why it comes up it feels like to me is because there's a bunch of shit about yourself that you don't like but you don't address right and so then if it forces you hate in order to truly live in the moment you have to be balanced you have to be like I've looked at it all and I understand it made mistakes and here's where I'm at but if you've never looked at yourself and you know looked at those mistakes then you you have like this backlog of shit you have to deal with right and I know I'm gonna agree with that except when it becomes just a morbid fucking vlogging of oneself right oh yeah which is what it would but I feel like that more but vlogging yourself comes from you like the the debt analogy is a good analogy because if you're in like massive debt and you go to spend money you're like I don't even have any money am i spending this money whereas if you're even and you go to spend the money you're like no big deal I'm just spending some money it's normal right I think that when you don't have an accounting of who you are and what you've done and especially I think the big one is your effect on other people you know that's the one that comes up with me on mushrooms or on pot especially on edibles it's like how I've interacted with other people and even if I thought it was justified and maybe I was justified when when it comes up on pot especially on edibles the big that's them for me at least that's where I feel like the most accountable and I have to think about like my behavior the most I always feel like with the edible thing it always feels like could I have done better if instead of just being like was I okay like yeah that guy was being a dick to you yeah fuck him it's never that it's always like maybe I could have caught on earlier to how he was feeling and we assess how I was communicating with him and instead of being defensive or aggressive right maybe I could have handled it better hey man sounds like you're working a great spiritual program with your edibles well I tried to do it all the time whatever when I'm with edibles like I said this before people know but I think pot makes you a better person I really do because I think all that responsibility you don't have to you don't honestly no one has to do anything I get as much high and as much mental clarity from yoga as I do from anything I really do I mean if someone told me I couldn't smoke pot for the rest of my life but I could do yoga or I could just smoke pot for the rest of my life and not do yoga I think I would take the yoga Wow I really do because yoga gives me I mean I love the feeling of pot I really do but yoga gives me a relaxation when it's over like a there's a clarity that comes from things that it was like it's friend like after up like post yoga class those are like that that is the friendliest nicest group of fucking people go stant you want to meet some nice folks stand outside of a yoga class why don't I go go class is exiting right you'll be like the most balanced nice people because they drained all the bullshit of themselves it create pause so I can take a leak already and I know I am NOT we're not pausing though he's such a good guy he really is he's such a good guy and he's always like worried that he's not a good guy and he's always like you know like coming down on himself and we'll talk about this a little but um al Madrigal I'll set this up so he doesn't have to he doesn't have to be uncomfortable al Madrigal when he was here was talking about he gets mad at guys like Stevo because Stevo is a guy who kind of came to stand up after he did other things and I was like I don't want the thing that is like what I feel is like my chosen thing in life the most amazing thing in life to me to be something that someone comes to as a last resort but al even thinks it's stupid that he thinks like that and then so when he said it like Stevo was kind of bummed out so Stevo texted me about it and Stevo and I talked and I took we were supposed to do a podcast anyway so there was like this question of whether or not we should talk about it like when it came to the actual show itself but my feeling on all that stuff is that it's whoever does stand up to stand up like it's bullshit I was just explaining that you're a great guy in the whole aisle magical time without you having to be in the room and feel uncomfortable whatever but but I think that anybody like that judgement thing of like you this is not a stand-up you're not a stand-up he's not a standard that's so insecure it's so crazy especially when your premise is that you care so much about to stand yeah well I love what you said to me at The Comedy Store the other night you said well I just love stand-up so like I want there to be more of it yeah a lot more people doing stand-up I love it yeah yeah if you're doing stand-up but people are laughing that's stand-up it doesn't I don't care if you're a fucking surgeon you know if you're a brain surgeon and you decide to stand up at night are you not a stand-up like once you do stand-up comedy to me you go on stage you tell some jokes people laugh you're a fucking comic you know I mean I don't care if it's an open mic night you're a comic sure you might not be a professional stand-up comedian right but if you if someone says oh I'm a comic - look okay doesn't mean you're good like you know like you could you could be a big guy who works on cars but you just fuck up constantly it's doesn't make you a professional mechanic right it's like but once you you're doing it we're all doing same thing it's like one dick he's terrible my dick sucked by a guy one time I was totally underwhelmed yeah why did that happen was it on purpose Wow it started out like a joke this happened in December of 2002 well I was doing a show at the 9:30 club in DC after the show there was a great great place fucking waste it was really wasted and I had this shady manager and he was really wasted - and who's talking to this person who appeared to be a hot chick right appeared to be a hot chick and and I was like and so I kind of started talking to this person who appeared to be a hot chicken and rude the person away from the shady manager and I was feeling really good about it you know turns out in hindsight that had we had we not been so intoxicated it was rather evidence but we were really intoxicated so we were walking away from the from the 9:30 club if that was the Safari or 9:30 one of the two I don't think they have Safari anymore but walking down the street going to the next place someone pulls me aside but you know a friend pulls me aside and says hey just want you to know that that person you're talking to was it like not a girl or but it wasn't like they didn't see would say that the person is a mattre diet was what the HOS described as hermaphrodite meaning I get you know that meaning like of both both woman in and they described that the person had had a surgical operation to remove the male parts so it was kind of a chick right right and I was just like ah whatever I don't care you know just like whatever you know wound up I wrote about this in my book about like I really had the sense you know I I you know we came back the hotel and and and the the sense that I got and this is a pretty fucking outrageous and take on it was that here was this person who was kind of I don't know damages a mean word but like you know there was something you know like this person like wanted to be loved wanted to be accepted right now there was something to go or there was some kind of thing and I've wanted this person to feel loves know and that was kind of where the I think that like that was part of what was going on you know I was like hey I'm gonna I'm gonna play ball with this person and we're gonna snuggle all night okay right and so like so then and that was her in the hole in over the course of the evening there was there was oral sex and awhile later this is where it gets really crazy I wasn't doing that and says show dr. Drew's love line showed and talked to dr. drew dr. drew says you know I'm paraphrasing he says Stevo there's no such thing as a hermaphrodite Minh what happened was a dude sucked your dick wait a minute there's no such thing for maps with dr. Drew told me I don't think that's true Wow you know and I'm not a doctor so I probably shouldn't say that I've been wrong about pot and he's not possible to you dr. Drew was I love dr. Drew almost more than anybody but there but the first chink in his armor happened when when I asked him dr. drew why why is is jerking off so much more pleasurable if you tickle your balls while you're doing it and he said I didn't know that was the case what I felt good to touch your balls same way the reason why it feels good for other people to touch your balls like listen rub your own neck it feels good to rub your own right just like it feels good to get a massage Jesus Christ course it feels good to rub your balls wait Dom answer right but since you brought up the alla magic pull up hermaphrodite find out that's true I need to know because I'm pretty sure that it's rare but it does exist that there have been people that have been both androgynous I think is androgen mm-hmm but he says hermaphrodite does not exist and well I don't that doesn't seem to me maybe he's just fucking around with you that doesn't seem to make sense though because that's a medical term I've talked to him about it on many occasions yeah well he I liked dr. drew I don't want I want to shit on doctor he's a good guy but he fucked up he fucked up when he started talking about Hillary Clinton's medical condition on the eye and they fired him from CNN for it and I'm from do that right you can't do that you're not if you're a doctor and you start talking about someone's medical condition without actually appraising them physic you see that in the tabloid magazines this doctor commented but then they have to clarify the this doctor like the person they're talking about wasn't ever one of their people he made an assessment about her health right and that's dangerous because you're doing it on television you're talking about someone's running for president meanwhile look he's right in some ways like she blacked out hit her head had brain trauma that Bill Clinton talked about publicly Bill Clinton talked about how she was in recovery for six months from brain trauma from having a seizure falling down and smashing her head off the ground when you're 67 years old or however old she was when that happened that's really dangerous like I know a lot about head trauma I've researched a lot about head trauma I've experienced a bunch of myself as I'm sure you have I know you did from Tim Kennedy it's special I talked to you about it afterwards I'm like Ryan can't let somebody do that to you I know I asked her to drop me on my head he lifted me up by my neck choking me out with my feet off the ground and then it let you go that's sounds like a guide for sure people dive metal in the back of the heads are soft oh my god what's the super just super dangerous yeah like anytime you fall and you hit your head this is all you have to think about gonna do that again please don't don't think of it as hitting your head think about as you getting hit by the world that's why it's like the whole world is like slamming in your frakkin head and I was talking to Tony Hawk about the CTE stuff oh so bad and he said that that if you have a gene that predisposes you to Alzheimer's mm-hmm then your brain doesn't regenerate or heal mm-hmm you know and inserted so if you say you're more fucked and you're more at risk for CTE if that's the case if you have that gene if you don't have the gene then you're better off and you said so I've went so I went and got it I went and got this test and it determined that I don't have the gene so I was like okay cool and I thought about it for a while and then I had to text him like hey so what were you gonna do if it turned out that you did have the gene and he's like I didn't have a plan do I want to go get that test because what happens it turns out that you do have the gene there's nothing to do about it yeah you're sure well bombed yeah well there's there's ways of you I guess you could probably mitigate the onset of Alzheimer's now I would have to like look at what they're doing now and what we can figure out and they're working hard at it but on its fuckin on that channel yeah but this I mean really you need medical science to figure out like they have to figure out that mean there has to be like some pretty legitimate studies and those studies take a long time because you have to follow people with all homers you gotta try one way with one group and another way with another group and see like what though you know which group has more progress but the bottom line is any time you're getting hit in the head it's fucking bad like tennis players get get concussions you know like people get concussions from playing soccer you know who gets brain trauma cuz it gets kids really crazy people ride jet skis the bouncing of jet skis oh yeah it shakes your fucking brain inside your head I'm only thinking of times when I got hit in the head hard enough that I actually lost time you know where like a time traveled because I find out right like I I got in the ring with the fucking the Monday Night Raw the the wrestling well this was so fucking terrible it was so bad because here's the thing I was never a fucking wrestling fan I never got into I just didn't understand it right and and and so like when we got in the fucking ring to promote it like we kind of walked through what the moves were gonna be you know with this wrestler who since passed away his name is boo Maya this fucking Czech guy they called him the Samoan bulldozer and so we walking through what it was and like I'm gonna do a backflip off the top rope and he was gonna do this and we're gonna knock their over you know and it's pretty incredible how they just very loosely like walk through a course very loosely choreographed but we know what the moves are and we know it's supposed to be the final move what I did not know and this was this proved to be really bad is that I did not know that the match is not fucking over until you actually play dead you have to be like completely still so at the end when he was supposed to there was some fucking pretty major hit like to my head or to my Chad whatever it was I can't remember but the final hit like in in in when we were doing it it was he was seeing so much fucking harder oh yeah I know what it was he jumped off the top rope on and and and and fucking landed on landed on me yeah oh geez he jumped off the top rope it was size of that fucking oh no he didn't here's the thing that's supposed to be over but if you notice I'm fucking not playing dead I'm rolling around like I see I'm moving around so you did so here here he notices it's supposed to be over at this point but he's offended because he's like I'm not now this is not just never supposed to look at this elbow boom oh so you're like this I'm begging him I'm praying them but the thing is that I'm still oh my god in his world it's not over until you play dead but I didn't know they didn't even show they never just cut away for it because it got so ugly and I don't remember leaving the ring I went home and fucking destroyed my brain some more with the goddamn nitrous you talked to him afterwards did you hey man why'd you fucking crack me in the shit was cool I went back I went back to and and like worked my way in I was like with my video camera trying to get him did fucking choke me unconscious like Jim Kennedy did right now I wanted to film that for a thing and he was totally down but then like they got hips of what I was doing there like and all the WWE brass I kind of came in getting kicked out he was cool with me but but yeah that's offensive to a wrestler to get in there and play in their world and not like men because when I get hit really hard like to me like I react I laugh you know like whatever like it's a thing and you know like I'm reacting to it and and right but you got a that was offensive to him yeah you have it has to be final it has to be over yeah that although it to the head was the fuckin what can imagine that giant dude yeah what happened to him how do you pass away I think he had a heart attack Wow yeah yeah that guy was great I got a lot of those wrestlers they get hooked on pills cuz they're in power all the time it's a big big problem with with pro wrestling pro wrestling is one of the most unappreciated or underappreciated things in terms of like how difficult it is for the performers there's one of the most difficult jobs a person can do those guys are on tour hundreds of days a year if not 300 days a year right they're constantly on the road and they're doing that all the time they're slamming into each other throwing each other on the ground pile driving each other slamming jumping from the top rope I get it man massive massive trauma those guys all suffer from some kind of trauma for sure yeah that was a heavy blackout and I can think of a few times where I just blacked out cuz I hit my head so hard and then there's other times where I hit my head and then starting the nausea kicks in and I'm barfing mm-hmm that happen ten years old yeah well you probably got a lot of brain damage bro yeah what's fucked up about is that it doesn't affect me now but that's just creeping up on me and for later well it definitely affects you now it's just like how much does it affect you it's like you ever wake up I'm sure you've broken up hungover and you're like oh god I feel like shit well that's how you feel because what you did to your body but if that's how you felt every day you would just get used to that that's that would be who you are and when you fuck your brain up with the weird thing is you never go back to how you used to feel it's not like you can hit a switch and you go how was I when I was 18 and I'd never been hit in the head let me hit this switch click oh oh so much clarity that that's not available so you just deal with how you are like you ever wake up in the morning and just feel kind of stupid you can't forget where your keys are what am I supposed to do today just feel dull everybody's belt been there right his field dull maybe she'll jet-lagged like you know jet lag like oh just kept anything I'd feel tired I'm always fucking tired right now just in general yeah and I wonder if that's it because as a factor because it could sure I got in the vegan diet right and remember a while a while into it started feeling fucking tired now it's like man it's gotta be my fucking vegan diet and pissed you know and then then there was a point where I said fuck the vegan diet I'm gonna eat fish again and eggs but it's still tired and I was still fucking do you ever get your blood work done I should I do I'm a I get I get like full panel everything you do I mean as far as like for like STDs and shit I'm good enough no you're right you should go to a doctor that can check out your nutritional profile and they need to do that yeah they might say you're deficient on iron it could be like a niacin that tell me that my testosterone is kind of low my vitamin D a lot of that also comes from brain damage oh yeah testosterone being low is a big issue with football players x-fighters your pituitary gland is very sensitive and that's one of the things that happens to people literally just from jet skiing I'll go saying skiing in general like jumping ski jumps and stuff like that even without even getting getting hit in the head just anything that causes your head to shake around the lab like I'm sure head banging like the guys in a CDC it's that what does the fucking chiropractor I've been to chiropractors and you know I'll go to the chiropractor and they're familiar with jackass and the shit I've done and and you know like take my my x-ray to look at my at my spine and they're like dude I don't understand it like you're like fucking Keith Richards you know like there's no there's no guarantee shape than I expected you would be in except for in my neck where I've got the what do they call it the cab Calais or nut Calais that I don't know some kind of fucking buildup and calcium deposits oh no I think it's for head banging yeah so you have some disc degeneration some sort of deterioration yeah anyway whatever it is my neck is more fucked up than anything and so then I'm super skeptical of chiropractors by the way I just heard too many regular doctors say that's just horseshit right I went to I got to a point where I was like fuck you know and and I was doing some job I was getting ready to do some job and you know you go to this physician I need to clear you before you can you know beyond like a work a TV or a movie job right this fucking physician to the stars who dis to there and she's shining a light down my throat and she says hmm the the opening at the back of your throat is very narrow do you like do you ever find that you sleep a full night's sleep but you wake up and you're still tired I was like Jesus Christ that's exactly fuckin me you know I'll sleep for you know eight hours nine hours I get up fucking tired sleep apnea yeah so she said I recommend you get a sleep study did you do it I did I guess a they said I have a mild to moderate sleep apnea mm-hmm super common you know you get a mouthpiece to fix that I know I got to but I already have a you know the mouthpiece unfortunately for you it fits on the bottom it's in the only on the bottom and what it does is is a tongue depressor and it presses down your tongue teach your tongue from sliding back okay I know God does it do I have to do that yeah it's um there's a doctor in Encino dr. Crowe peon who was famous for it well it's um it's super common like sleep apnea right it's people with big tongues your tongue as you lay back especially if you lay on your back it falls back and covers over your air hole right that's what causes a lot of gagging and loud snoring you know but it's a huge issue for people and that CPAP machine man means some people need to have it I mean I did I tried it I tried it for a while and I was able to fall asleep but then about an hour or two into it the fucking thing just blow and blow me away and wake up and there's an end and there's an I couldn't fuckin do it's too weird you're sleep with a Darth Vader mask on yeah it's just it's too weird for really fat people though it's huge yeah the extent they have to clean that fucking thing yeah man speaking of mouthpieces easy where do we go from there though we started out with some sort of we're talking about how magical and then we got on dude sucking dudes dicks right and we got a head trauma but I felt like we had an important thing to say about head trauma like what did we start off it was that it's kind of bad being tired yeah if you don't mean a guaranteed that has something to do with why your testosterone is low also you know another thing that has to do with how many like healthy fats how much healthy fat is in your diet because fats and even cholesterol are literally the precursors for hormones it's like how your body like one of the things that people find when they go on a heavy fat based diet like a ketogenic diet is their hormones jump up it's because your body that's how your body makes hormones your body uses fats and cholesterol actually to make hormones now you see healthy fats like coconut oil avocado is interesting because it's a combination of saturated fat and unsaturated fat and most people assume that saturated fat is bad for you but it's not a lot of that came out of the sugar industry that your your fucking dad was probably a part of a sugar industry paid off and this was in from the New York Times a bunch of like really reputable newspapers reported on this really recently the sugar industry paid off scientists to lie about the effects of saturated fats to cover up the effects of sugar it's really sad because so many people to this day run around worrying about saturated fat and not worrying about sugar because they're worried about saturated fat in their diet and that's what made people switch over to shit like margarine which is terrible for you didn't recommend margin anymore that's how trans fats got introduced into people they're trying to make them illegal and they've made them illegal in America but they still have like another year or so where you're allowed to sell it which is hilarious they give these companies an extra year or two to get rid of all the bullshit that they're that they made so that they can still fuck people over for 12 months and make money they knew that that stuff was bad for you decades ago and they just they've been like lalalala not listening today I'm dying to tell you this story about about my dad okay so when I was 12 moved to Toronto right living in Canada dad was the president of Nabisco Canada and I was speaking of head banging I was a fucking rabid Motley Crue fan right I fucked Motley Crue's this was 1987 shout of the day right now this is their group there are girls girls girls to her right I mean I got fucking motley crue all over my bedroom walls I'm fucking crazy about these fucking guys now they come to to Toronto for their girls girls girls tour they're doing Maple Leaf Gardens and it's the day before the concert well I should say my dad knew that what a big fan I was and the biskits Canada had a skybox in the arena but my dad also knew that that nobody from Nabisco gave a fuck about a Motley Crue concerts the skybox was gonna be empty so high then my dad said to me he said hey I know how much he loved my other crew and so I'm gonna bring you to the concert we can sit in the Nabisco skybox and I tell my dad dad watching Motley Crue through a plate glass window sucks he says all right well you know basically fuck you you know he's like if you can do better than then we'll do better you know use your tickets if you can did you know I'm fucking and I was 13 you know right so the day before the concert and I see on the news they're like complain there's like these fuckin asshole rock stars come to our city and fuck me fuck around like one way or another and I'm like dude they're here the fucking mic what would you say rockstar they made the news for some like blush I forget what it was I think they started some kind of fire it said something great but they were on the news you know and they're like oh they were complaining these fucking guys come here okay and so I'm like they're in Toronto they're in the city now and the fucking concerts tomorrow so I deduce that they're in a hotel now I'm gonna fucking find these guys I'm gonna fucking you're 13 I was 13 and so I go fucking running to my room right this is like right away I'm thinking I know all the guys and I know their real names like Vince Neil is Vincent Wharton right like I know other names I'm like thank you fucking check into the hotel as like Frank Carlton Ferrando right that's Nikki Sixx they're not gonna use the real names and I was like they're gonna check into the hotel under the name of their manager right and I just guess I just knew it go right into my room and I fucking check on my little Cosette fucking album sleeves and I check every one it says Doc McGhee which was their manager I Doc McGhee so I'm like that's the fucking one I could run into the the phonebook and the you know I'd fucking open it up to hotel like the Yellow Pages and I just drink charcoal and every fucking hotel in the Yellow Pages and when the hotel answers I'm like will you please put me through to mr. doc McGee's room right and the fucking show was like a son Davis it's a Saturday and my dad's like watching college football right I'm sitting on the phone call and every fucking hotel in Toronto just going down the list not even calling the ones with the ads like literally just sticking to the list so I don't miss one and my mom's pissed because there was no call waiting she's like you're tying up the house phone my dad all my dad ever wanted was for me to show initiative and to be like motivated for something you know and so my dad's like super stoked I'm on fire I'm telling my mom mom I'm calling motley crue fucking and and my dad like calls off my mom you know I like honey like let him do his thing and I fucking sat there for probably two or three hours just calling hotels and I get they put me through to this room there was one like false alarm you know but then the second Nagi's room that I got through to the guy picks up the phone and I said hello is that Doc McGhee and he says no this is Doc's brother Scott he's and I'm like as it motley crue and he says this is how did you get this number and I told him I fuck I just call it every fucking hotel in the Yellow Page I just never told them I said I just called every hotel in the Yellow Pages is the crew there and and he goes he goes hooked like hold on a second are you fucking kidding me that's that's awesome and he says he goes I'm so impressed by what you did he says he says how would you like if I put you on the list for backstage passes and I can I can give you tickets in the fifth Road so you gave me two tickets in the fifth row fucking backstage passes my dad with my went fucking chauffeur my dad's chauffeur to the fuckin Maple Leaf Gardens and we've gotten the fucking press line with a fuck fifth row fifth row didn't say yeah that's actually better than the first row I was fucking head bay like a mod to get myself hella brain-damaged that night from the dude like how are you not showing me with fucking Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee is that your picture no no no no but Google Stevo and fuck Stevo and motley crue man when you were 13 I was fucking 13 we went up to the skybox and I put my ghetto blaster so I put my ghetto blaster next to the little speaker deal there's me and Tommy Lee and then it's my how old is Tommy Lee oh my god that's crazy I mean Nikki Sixx right there you were like a baby I was a fucking baby that is so weird yeah and you know I'm standing next to these guys and I'm like I don't have fucking you know like shit to talk to them about but the fact that I was standing next to those guys and I was like you know what I'm here backstage with my fucking heroes and it's because I fucking decided so you know like there's something about that that gave me this this is this mentality and they see like top left right there check it out fucking all these years later fuckin one day when they announce that they're back together and going on their Carnival of sins to her Tommy Lee asked me to do something fucked up and introduce them dude how full circle yeah dude that's crazy dad it was the dopest who's the dude on the far right that's Mick Mars do with the hat yeah he's got like a herd of bone disease what's going on with them yeah like I forget what it's called but yeah he's like they gotta like have them come out when the lights aren't on oh my god you know maybe he's doing better and he limps shape brietta I love that story Wow and my dad you know I was like how my dad is that's awesome man yeah that's a great story but thank you man it made it really made me into a monster and some regard because like I think that at that young age it's like you know I I really can fucking you know if you just and I've always said like doesn't matter what people want it just matters how bad they've really put them on it I mean of course they it definitely matters what they want you want to play basketball against well of course we didn't barge in but I want it right within fucking parameters of reality factor what do they say they say that that luck is when preparation meets opportunity yes which is dope I love I love that fucker yeah yeah there's a lot of variables and you can control some of them right yeah and you definitely saw something like with like with fucking stand up and and I really wanted like I brought up ala magic I'm only gonna say this like quickly and I want to be careful not to Lynch the guy because you know I'd like a deck I don't want everyone's at all fucked that guy from everything I understand he's hilarious he's a great guy he's a great guy he's hilarious and we should absolutely check out his comedy special on the Showtime which was called shrimp and ain't easy to decide for yourself is this guy fucking funny yes he's very funny he's very funny not never met the guy I know shit about him but but and this was this was a was a 2012 or 2013 I I had been a headline in comedy clubs since 2010 you know I got into it and I was just we've been doing stand-up for 7 years now yeah well technically it's been over it's been almost 11 years since the first time I ever tried it which was at the Laugh Factory when Skylar stone in 2006 asked me to do a stunt at the at the Laugh Factory because he was hosting a show and he wants to you know so I'm like I'll do if I can stunts like whatever and I showed up I had in a game plan when I walked in just as I said I said I can't there's nothing fucking crazier than me getting on stage we're trying to make people laugh that's the stuff that was I was terrified I'm started tried it that night but I never got like really hardcore like in earnest until 2000 it started 2010 now 2012 2013 I'm at a point where I'm super comfortable in my in my 45 minutes right I think might whatever my hour is at that point my like I'm just really comfortable in it and I'm starting to feel like steel because I'm fucking going through the motions and the shit like you know what that's like right you get to a point where you're just like fucking dying because I'm not you know not doing anything new not doing anything new where and and and and and the worst is if is is if you go back to a fucking place and do the same material that's the you know and I don't I don't ever want to fucking do that like so so I'm like a kid my comfort zone and I got to get out of it but I did but I just wasn't doing it I finally put my put my foot I said fuck it okay this is what I'm doing I'm promising myself I'm gonna go do ten minutes I'm gonna do ten minutes set here in LA and and even if I have that pen on my fucking calendar for one week later and even if I have to bomb I'm not backing out period I'm going I'm doing ten ten minutes and I wrote fucking ten I wrote a fucking set and I went over to the Laugh Factory and I did it and I was thrilled I got some laughs you know then I go over to the fucking I'm The Improv and I'm like hey you know and I made the mistake it was a mistake I did I say hey I'm working on some new mucho you never say that when you're working on neighbor to the audience yeah yeah right but but I might mention and say hey maybe I did it and then I said hey guys thanks you know that like I was trying some new material and then thanks for you know a night and I diligently recorded the fucking set to play it back and hear where the last word you know like I wrote my own shit I went there and I fucking didn't his shit and I worked it out and I recorded it and you know that's how you do it right well when I get off the stage and I'm thrilled because the fucking people left you know and I sit in the crowd I sit in the crowd the host brings up the next comic the next comic is al Madrigal he walks out he goes oh my god what did we just see we just saw steve-o working on new material I just it's just like I just I just can't take it anymore like I just I just can't believe that you know that the this thing that that I consider my calling in life stand-up comedy that I care about it so much and now we have steve-o and Dustin Diamond out here doing this thing he's like I can't believe that these people are taking something that's so sacred to me and just using it as their last resort and I'm sitting right there watching them say this shit I'm like what the fuck you know like what the fuck are you doing dude it was just an honor was up such a blatant attack from the stage and I'm like I'm like it's it's not fucking right because a motherfuckers were laughing you know I played back like I got in the car right after that you know whatever i sat there what I couldn't even believe it and then this there was a lady that was talking at her table and he just went in on it like beyond beyond what was like what was i capabie quiet you know I started starting in with like the personal like what would ever I don't even care but what I proceeded was that here's a guy who's claiming that his whole passion is stand-up comedy but his whole attack on me and then berating the women like there weren't any jokes you know like it was almost like he just before went the act of performing comedy to just sort kind of be mean to me because he wasn't upset that you were doing stand-up he's upset and whatever but then after his set he went in and started telling jokes after that but after his set he comes over to the sound booth that I'm sitting right next to the sound booth sitting right next to it and he comes over and says something to the sound guy and kind of awkwardly notices I'm sitting right there and they comes over and leans over the table and he says just so you know what you're doing isn't taken lightly like face to face I felt like he totally insulted me just so you know what you're doing isn't taken lightly like I don't even know what it meant but I bet it was clear that the the sentiment was like and I meant everything I said you know I felt like he came and insulted me to my face on top of that and I was just I was pretty bent out of shape about it but I didn't like say anything or you know and I certainly wouldn't have come here to talk about that like at all yep except what was it I was on here a couple weeks ago and like I said I seen my Twitter feed my like my name is tagged and it says listen to the podcast douche and I'm like huh and I'm like okay so so I was on the Joe Rogan podcast and I guess he's telling me to listen to it and then there was more like Brendan Schaub replied and they're all playing nice and I just fucked so I started listening to the al Madrigal thing and he's and like right out of the gate he's saying like god man I had this habit where I like kind of create problems I just said I'd talk shit on people and I create beefs and it's really kind of productive and I should work on it and I've you know like it's not a good thing and he basically went on to apologize to everybody Under the Sun you know like and then my name comes up and he makes this distinction that I will actually don't feel bad about fucking talking shit on Steve I don't feel he says I actually don't feel bad about this at all and then he goes on to repeat like all the shit that he said from the stage and like I got so bad I'd if I could shave that night you know I decide trying so we as we talked yeah and whatever like he's just you made the great point he said hey you know he just he doesn't shit sometimes he says dumb shit and and I actually had a conversation with him about it and it was a hilarious conversation because he was like he calls me up and I answered the phone it's like how you doing I'm like well not that fucking good you know I was so fucking pissed I didn't even really fucking sleep last night you know we got pissed I was I was really kept you up it kept me up dude that's crazy right how do you let other people affect you that much that's a great question it's a really meditate at all I haven't I've got into the TM and I've been doing it very fucking little I gotta do it way more yeah you go you can't let someone fuck rent space in your head like that I know because what he said was very mild it was it was and we said in the podcast he was also kind of conciliatory it was like ya know everybody but me that's why I think what bothered me so much he goes because I feel bad I do you goes but then but then when it comes to Stevo I actually don't feel bad about this what that's so stupid what you do is funny I've seen you I've seen you do stand-up you're funny well thank you I appreciate in my mind hey I appreciate that so much and I think that we're what particularly fuckin got me hot about that was that the time that he chose to attack me was when I had fucking abort when I was really working the craft of fucking call me writing my own material going on there getting outside of my comfort zone right doing fucking news shit diligently recording if I can do an actual stand yeah that's the craft the fuckin craft and it was just a fucking shitty time well he really does care about stand-up comedy but I think because of that caring it sometimes it blind you you know and I'm very sensitive to it because I experienced it a lot when I was first starting out where people didn't think that I fit into the mold what they thought of stand-up should be you know I'm such a public figure too and your your your career has been so controversial that's why I don't understand why you're so sensitive to criticism because you you've everything you've done has been chaos you know you've done so much chaos I mean I just would imagine there's so many people shit on you I guess I don't know I would imagine him saying that to you in person just because so you know what you're doing is not taken lightly I would probably smack him I really have would have a really hard time with that like what doing stand-up well that's not taken lightly what do you own stand-up yeah your fucking mind do you don't like this is what I said to you the other day don't you like stand-up if I I like Stannah I want my fucking mailman to try it he might be funny dude one of the funniest guys I ever fucking met was a private detective that I worked for he lost his license at a DUI and I want to being his driver and he needed a drive he needed an assistant in quotes but really what he needed is a guy to drive him around cause he lost his license for six months or something like that so I worked for him for like six months I drove my he was the funniest fucking guy I ever met in my life and while I was doing stand-up I I think I was 21 at the time and I think he was probably 35 36 I was like this guy just did stand up he would fucking put me out of business that's all I could think of is like if this guy went into stand-up you know meanwhile he was a man he had experienced life I was a boy right but everybody that you like that wants to do stand-up you should encourage them to do it like my friend Brendan Schaub he does stand-up oh yeah and he faces the same shit people like just fucking God who's doing stand-up curves and shit on them but I mean but Eric was just being funny and I said to my go of course they're gonna shit on you you're a big handsome gorilla and you're on stage dude he's a great guy and he's funny he's fucking funny and I told him you should have standing he's very smart and he works hard yeah he's been doing stand-up a year and he's killing he doesn't does really well I mean I saw me other night at the comic store sandwiched in between me and Graham with sharks yes swimming with sharks he was doing a real show like at a real show and he had a real good set Dane Cook helped me a lot man no he's a polarizing figure but when I when I first I said when I got into stand-up in earnest because back in 2006 I was like man I should I really like this you know I tried it I got staged for a few minutes that first night and and people the sense I got was that people were excited to see me they were rooting for me they wanted me to do well for some reason like like I can be endearing to people and they're rooting for me and then I got a few laughs you know I made a couple of fucking gay jokes whatever like you know and and before I left a laugh factor that night I scheduled my return and and before I came back I've wrote I wrote a set and I came back and it went reasonably well and I was thrilled then I got overconfident I was like ah well I'm just good at stand-up so I thought back again and don't even now don't try to work on the fucking act I had written I'm a comedy fucking there's a god go up and wing it and I bombed it hurt you know and that bombed again and then I was like scared to get back to it and I was out of control with drugs so like I was really does it wasn't the time now once I got sober and Rehab then like going to bar it's going to nightclubs that's just that's not on the table anymore yeah like yeah you got to ask yourself do you have a reason to go there and I didn't have any fucking reason but I had every reason to go to a comedy club so that became like my go-to thing at night you know like from going with her going out with a girl going out you know it's a good thing I got a reason to be there and I go to the comedy club and so I'm sitting in the comedy club and in my early sobriety and we're looking at the stage thinking motherfucker I should be on that stage I should be on that stage but I was like scared you know and then as the the press machine was that was never really the first thing I even did ostensibly to promote jackass 3d was this young Hollywood interview and they said ah Dane Cook's in there just go barge into his interview great so I walk into Dane Cook's interview and I meet him and I'm like hey dude like you know I've dabbled in stand-up and I want to get serious about it I want to really dive in and fucking to his credit man he said cool he said let's do it I'll give you my number we'll get on stage at the at the improv like in a week he gave me his number and I fucking wrote and I wrote I proved that whole fucking week and I'm renting a fucking practice to that shitty little the Open Mic Marty's it's hilarious you wouldn't even know where's Marty it's a it's on Sunset Boulevard right by rock and roll growls it's it's a hilarious little fucking hole in the wall stand open you know open mic and I went you know churn up a met Dane Cook at The Improv like it was like two comments after Sarah Silverman and you know then I go on and then Dane goes on and right after Dane set he sat down with me and fucking gave me notes the first thing he said was I'm not sending me back to the drawing board which was like his way of saying that and the material I did that wasn't like don't rewrite like it's good he's just worried about your delivery in your timing and from there I went to the fucking two nights that I'm laughs actor Dame's there it was just like he took me under his wing you know like just like with regularity she'd go and I'd go and he'd go or the other way around and he'd sit me down and give me notes and I put so much fucking wind in myself that's awesome I'm really grateful to Dane Cook for that Oh music their real name - intersex a couple years ago it's like the medical terminology was changed so is there such thing as having a dick and a pussy yes so there's uh here's all the stats on which is born with which and there's different one in 1666 births so I don't know which is actually the androgen insensitivity syndrome both so they don't necessarily use the term hermaphrodites right yeah it's so used like in biology oh I see so when it comes to oh so there's like a list if it looks like there's like 30 of them how many other one two three or four four six I'm referring to humans I think stopped using that word because many people feel bad probably Jesus Christ so complete go nate'll die Genesis ooh one in 150,000 that can't be good alpha reductase deficiency 5 alpha reductase deficiency vaginal a geneticists imagine vagine' vaginal a geneticists that feel that sounds like you have an old pussy you're born I'm sorry your baby was born with an old pussy you look down but only your vagina could be worse things face is cute so there are hermaphrodites there are people that are born with a vagina and a butt Google are is there people they're born with both of Aegina in a penis our people born with both of vagina and a penis because there was too many medical terms there I don't know which one of those would apply right it's kind of like with little people I hate that fucking term well the thing about dr. drew is he's an addiction specialist right so he how much does he even know about this stuff I mean how much did you really learn about this stuff and he's also an addiction specialist who erroneously says that marijuana is hugely addictive which is just ridiculous to fucking used to do it a lot I'm sure well I bet here's the thing dude like I at one point I was I was sort of half sitting for this this chick and you know and I humped a strange chick in her bed and tied the rubber and a knot which I would do you know didn't I rubber and not threw it on the floor a fucking dog ate the rubber right and like and and it was her boyfriend's dog and I'm thinking oh no the fucking dog maybe took the fur off the rubber right like it took the dog took the fucking rubber fur like a victory lap and it's gonna driving it's gonna look terrible for this girl so I'm like following the dog around ultimately the dog shit it out and it was hilarious but I felt bad cause like you know I base it's kind of like sodomizing the dog right okay so that I felt like to make it up to the dog we had the dog hi and when I oh I owe it to the dog to do it myself and like because this is a funny bit like to swallow a condom for hello didn't it wow that was really got in my head I'm gonna swallow a condom but then I was like okay cool when I'm on tour a bit when I'm on tour in Europe well I'll fucking put weed in the condom tie in a knot now it would be like a skit where from it's an international drug smuggler skit I'll do run a country and I'll fly to the other country and shit it out right and and I did it was his fucking saga I actually have a fucking epic like there's a huge like tent pull a bit in my stand-up right now about that whole I got arrested for international drug smuggling and Sweden I did you I did it's fucking it's so classic because they're swallowing a condom for greatest fucking story ever did it's so fucking awesome yeah III get it yeah how did you get caught because I had fuckin told the press like I was like you know I just when I first had that I did it was so I did it so big they want to try to fucking swallow I got stuck in my throat I'm sure I'm freaking the fuck out I'm trying you know like and then I'd fly it I'd fly from Norway to Sweden and you know Knox Hill told me I was how big was the nug dude I didn't even take I didn't even break the buds off the stem show me in your fingers how big this thing was on video and for my next comedy special it's on video yeah they filmed everything for my DVD is it online I'm sure it probably is but what's what so I'm so excited about my next comedy special is that so many of the stories I tell them I stand up are things that happened on camera originally right so I'm editing into editing into the fucking actual stand-up kind of like you do with the podcast like supporting foot archival footage right which just demonstrates the that everything is not only not true let's put it's not only truthful it's not even embellished looks like it's like a hundred percent and saw like and I'm just so excited to do that my god wait a minute it's hard to tell because of the perspective where's your fingers bad it's fucking play it so they could say that's why I'm swallow no you can see four feet people that are like it's like basically like it's inside of your body up trying to swallow it I wouldn't go down trying to bar if it wasn't good we wouldn't come on no inside fly to fucking Sweden because like why my buddies are like we got to take a shit that out ever took six and a half days and knock so psyched if you're gonna dive intestinal strangulation cuz this if I can get a block up my intestines oh my god whatever like I'm sorry took it took days to come out and when it came out man you must be so exploded I don't want to tell my okay fucking podcast cuz that's fucking lame most big important part of dude there's there's it's fuckin the best bit I love it you know I'm proud of what I'm doing on stage so you are you saying that pot is okay that was how I got in that's how I first did it then I realize okay because coming Wildboyz every time we would like I wouldn't freak the fuck out whenever we went to the Far East cuz you know you're not gonna be able to find weed and that's not okay so I at any time I went to anywhere where I wasn't coming confident I would be able to get weed i sat there with my four garden airport i sat there with my fucking weed grinder and just grinded up like a ton and then fuckin compacted so you know it's I broke the buds off the stems right and then I would I would fill up and put him out like an eight in each condom whatever night nice and small packing up and I would swallow like six of them you know really Johnny out so when you swallowed those how long did it take the shit doesn't want to come out quick don't want to come out and I don't know like one to two days oh my god something like that many times you swallow condoms every day I went when I went to Thailand I give me one on to Russia like dad it was my fucking thing I was like that was your thing but shitting out your pot that you would smoke yeah when you lit it does ever smell like a condom that's the psychological issue it's not like physical addiction is what we're talking about alcohol to the point like alcohol is the most dangerous physical addictions because when when you get off of it you die from it like that's how Amy Winehouse died like a lot of people think she died from drugs she actually died because she went cold turkey off of alcohol I believe that yeah it could be you know I know that I'm a fucking true drug addict is that I watched that documentary Amy yeah and as I walked out of the fucking theater I was like fuck man I want to get that was the least glamorous portrayal of drug addiction ever and we just looked great to me I was like oh my god fuck well there's no there's no mistaking the fact that somehow or another that what she was doing with her life whether or not you could say that was the drugs or the state of mind that she was in when she was taking the drugs she produced some fucking amazing music man right she just she tapped into it whatever it is like that if she wasn't the hottest chick like you know you know that someone's talented when they're not that hot but chick and they're a fucking huge star for singing oh yeah well she was super talented she was I mean there's a lot of not hot chicks like Adele she's else um I mean I'm sure you could find somebody else I've never really sat down and thought about it exactly that's kind of a rule you're supposed to be really hot and bright yeah I guess so yeah I'm trying to think maybe wine hasn't it down that's unfortunate isn't it it's bullshit yeah for a girl right that's gotta suck right oh but see yeah who's that she's not super hot and she's oh no no that is she is a hugely popular singer I'm so out of the loop I'm not old man who doesn't know what the fuck's going on with young kids today these fucking kids today I get it he had to tell me that little bow-wow fakes the fact that he was on a jet a private jet and he was flying on a private jet and someone was actually on a commercial flight with him and took a picture of him because they saw it on Instagram this motherfuckers full of shit he's right in front of me that's so fucking classic that's exactly like that dude Bear Grylls yes that's the same thing well it's actually worse it's like he set up his tent like Ferris Bueller with the mannequin well the bow-wow thing is indicative of an entire culture it's just all about like showing off your flashlight yet and like shown that you know we ballin here we ballin right and I was watching a fucking documentary vice documentary on YouTube about Bay Area hip-hop and the whole thing is they're like they're talking about how it's such a fucking travesty that all the tech money came in and the area got gentrified mm-hmm how did the whole thing is they're like our land got gentrified and they're in the rap artists talk about that but they're like and I got millions like it doesn't it doesn't jive you can't be complaining about gentrification and talking about your millions yeah you're both right well not all hip-hop does that you know there's like something socially conscious you're black oh they were doing drugs it's so stupid they're complaining these people that make the fucking very electronics they need to make their music right came in and I had a terrible time in San Francisco just go to trip my car broken into there was parked outside of a fucking vegetarian restaurant granted in the Tenderloin it's terrible right outside the restaurant and they fucking smashed front window and then for the rest of the weekend I was at Cobbs comedy club the rest of the weekend every single person I said yeah I got my fucking window smashed my shit stolen on my car every person I mentioned that to you said yeah that happened yeah there's a lot of that's starting to happen in LA - man well it's always happened in that way like West Hollywood there'd smash-and-grab isn't becoming San Francisco it's the worst but it's always happened there's always been broke people that break into people's cars especially if you leave anything like really obvious in the front seat it's visible visible it's I was the biggest score who ever broken and together damn I had my super PAC I was getting ready to go fucking fail my super PAC is like plus I have the merch money from selling fucking merged left your car what take yeah I was going I didn't fucking think about it today there is that wait a minute you didn't think that you were gonna park in one of the shittiest neighborhoods in all of California with a really valuable cake yes Joe but you're saying it like it's like it's loud so weird okay Joe and for me like a black dude what can happen outside of a spiritual fucking vegetarian restaurant plus we sat under sitting next we sat by the window so as to see the car in our line of vision it's - yeah Cisco's a weird place now because like the money that you have to spend buy a house there it's so crazy that it doesn't even make sense anymore right like there was a house that was for sale for over a million dollars and it was a fucking tiny shitty Shack that had to be torn down I mean there was like literally nothing there and people like this is the most piece of ridiculous real estate in all of North America right it's all that tech money I lived there when I was a kid I lived there from age 7 to 11 I still magic show Fisherman's Wharf when I was 8 years old I think you're telling me that you're a copper you're talking about it about what yeah we worked two cops go yeah but I used to live there when I was a little kid and it was just you know this was during the Vietnam wars like hippy time it was weird it was just all hippies and gay people and it was uh you know that was what San Francisco was for ever until this tech boom and now it's just fucking insane money if you ever go on like I go on like that app Trulia it's like a real estate but I go what a like what kind of houses they have in Seattle like let's look at houses just for a goof sure you look at San Francisco and you're like what is 14 million buy you in San Francisco holy shit are you getting fucked right like a regular house is like 14 million bucks West Vancouver is pretty fucked up too so a lot of tech money up there today no no I don't know what it is but it's tech money for whatever reason I guess it's just because you know everybody uses tech and just just ton tons of money in it right but those guys just seem to figure out a way to make more money than anybody there's so much money in San Francisco though easy right I know so you had a bad time in San Francisco because you parked your car and attended with a lot of money a lot of like laptop iPad fucking 70d every lens are you doing so you're doing like these shows or you're filming them is that what you're bringing all this electronics sometimes yeah and sometimes I'm just filming for whatever YouTube you know now you did your Showtime special that was what a year and a half ago or so yeah it was the end of 2015 and then it aired in March of 2016 yeah cuz I'm gonna be getting in touch with me saying you need so much choked you out in Texas I'm like right I know the guy especially came out on Showtime oh that's awesome I'm really fuckin do people get it somewhere other than show times that available on Netflix or I had a the Showtime Showtime on-demand and then Vimeo and I thought it was on Vimeo yeah I think that uh I guess it was tied up for two years before it can go on Netflix Oh No so is it available now not yet not yet so soon yeah that's cool yes I'm fucking stoked on on how that came out are you gonna do another one yeah do like I said man I'm working on work on doing a comedy special where I edit in archival footage which is sort of makes it a docu comedy special which I love do people are people born that have a penis and vagina we figure that out yes and no I would say hmm after what I was reading most of the hem Africa comes from having like ovaries and testicles that are maybe right yeah both at the same time there's pseudo him after tights hmm or also true him Aphrodite and there's some sort of so true whom Aphrodite someone who has both generals in some cases that means that a ball and one Sun over and the other and others it means hybrid beasties known as Oviedo oh my god OVA testes to the naked eye their external genitals tend to be iffy maybe it's a big clit perhaps it's no it's a scientific scientific document perchance it's some unholy pee no vaginal miss mash pseudo hermaphrodites have the chromosomal and internal sex organs of one gender while the external protuberances are again anyone's gasp hmm photo click that mm-hmm nothing oh that's a hardcore Claire that's that makes sense that is a hermaphrodite right got to be this page also has something called that there's a double it is an anteater what did you say mm what you're trying a double penis and then there's this thing down at the bottom I found which is this never heard of this persistent chlo-chlo iike one in 20,000 female verse Jonah and vagina and urethra coverage converge into one nauseating funnel-like drainage hole located somewhere in the taint area between the clitoris and the buttocks poopie and vaginal sludge mingle freely corrective surgeries costly complicated and risky don't click on that photo what about the double vagina photo click on that bitch see what the fuck's going on up in that oh Jesus there's one next to the other one whoa why is it look like that looks like a chicken yeah that's not good that's when it didn't work out let's go with the double penis let me see a double penis picture is that real and this isn't one of those dude that slices it that's a crit that micro penis things a lot more magic die folliat die fuck two penises oh it's true guys double dick no that's a slice that's us this is websites bullshit that's a 1955 okay so it's not a split it's just you just got a broken double dick thing going on he's peeing out of his clit hole it's like the lizard dude mm-hmm there's a lot of people do that that's real common they're cutting the tongue cutting the dick they split their dick down the middle and then the pee comes out and just a bit all splatter yeah Wow you know people just they just do yeah right man it's a weird world we live in Steve oh yeah so another thing about my comedy special that that guy's got to double dicks big fatties maybe donate went to a friend with a little day they do that now they doing dick replacement surgeries well like if someone like had an accident or something happened to their dick they'd give him a penile replacement where they'll someone will die and they'll take his dick and sew it on to you and it works you can get an erection and everything feel it got an explosion I thought I remember reading that I do not remember I remember the first guy that got it done though I believe was a 50 year old man and something happened to him and he was dickless for like a year tough here yeah well he got a sewed back up member you could have he did porn when it was done it was just the head of his dick she cut in half she basically just swapped the top yeah what a drag yeah yeah yeah I'll never forget and I didn't even know this is real until someone explained to be on the show that this actually happened but Ozzy Osbourne's wife was on some talk show so that she was doing for a while and she was joking around about some woman who cut her husband's dick off and threw it in a garbage disposal and they were laughing about I'm just laughing thinking about his willy spinning around inside that garbage pail and I went wow what double standards would crazy double standards because could you imagine a group of men sitting around laughing about a guy cutting off a chick's pussy and throwing it in a garbage disposal there's I can't imagine a scenario where you would not only laugh about that but laugh about it on television and think it's okay but somehow another it was okay for her to laugh about a guy losing his dick and having it chopped off and thrown into a fucking garbage disposal it's a weird creepy double standard right but at the same time like if you think like I'm kind of close to this because sometimes people want to make like a female version of Jackass where girls do like terrible shit and and and hurt themselves on purpose and then just know that's never gonna work and it could boils down to a hormonal thing because like men and with testosterone and the idea is that you know we're providers and we're supposed to be like macho and prove that were tough and so it it becomes funny to see a guy fail and and get hurt like that's funny because right but not be optimized but with but with women with women their their maternal their nurturers their so it's not cool to see them get hurt you know they tied the guy down and cut his dick off and threw it in the garbage disposal this is not a like a blurry line here all right okay Joe was in jail for the rest of her life she chopped his dudes cock off all right it's just I'm just saying it's weird that they thought it was okay to laugh about it's not I mean it's horrific that people do horrific things to each other it's more horrific that a woman does it to a man that a man does it to a woman and people have done horrible shit to women for forever but it's never funny but like did they make it funny because a lot of people can make a lot of things funny shame funny yeah Ozzy Osbourne's wife not very funny no it was just gross it was just mean but it was weird that all these women thought it was funny they call he lost his dick ha ha ha like whoa like it didn't seem real but I guess it's also because like you know like what you're saying but it's like there's something funny about a man getting fucked up okay like a lot of people feel like that about watching women fighting there's people that I know that are super uncomfortable like watching a you wanna yunjae chick fight she beats the fuck out of chicks and bashes her face in and cuts them up right like do you watch my major fan of the UFC I've really fuckin loved that chin I think it's it's incredible how not only did women be you know I mean Dana White said forever there'll never be women and then now not only are there women but they're like the headliners yeah the headliners often this past weekend it was a co-main event you want to you and J check and it was a real good fight because the woman she was fighting was just tough as fuck and she took a serious beating but there's a fight that she did you wanting J check against see V pull up the highlights Youngjae check vs. Jessica Pinay try spelling her name good luck I don't even house but they hurt it's so hard to spell a name that people just call her you want a champion they don't even try with her last name cuz it's like a J and then a Z and then a fuckin E and then some letters that don't even exist in the English language but um she beat this girl I was so bad that it was it was fucking disturbing ah I mean she fucked this girl up oh it's horrible this girl just just did not belong in the ring with her I mean in the cage she's from Holland Poland Poland yeah it's multiple time world Muay Thai champion she was before she ever got into MMA she was one of the best strikers on the planet and if you go like deep into the fight she just pecks her apart for the first couple of rounds and then by the time you're deep in the round she's a mask of blood and ulaana is just beating the fuck out of her and smashing her in the face with elbows and cutting her up and then the final brush when she when they stopped the fight like you see blood pouring out of her nose it's coming out the girl Jessica Pinay all due credit to her that girl is tough as fuck like look at this she is a mask of blood and swelling and Youngjae check is just a fucking demon she's just kicking at her and smashing oh yeah honey well she probably got hit a few times herself I mean it was a fight I'm sure she got scratched and caught a little bit Miz just know if she got hit at all which I'm sure she did but look at that that's the short elbows like looking across the face I mean it's just and you see also that she's just having a hard time taking it and this is the final barrage she steps forward elbows are in the face and just beats the shit out of her and I had some friends that were watching this that weren't MMA fans and they were like fuck this I can't watch this I clue this bang-bang look at that that was final barrage but I just had a lot of thoughts on the same time like thinking man like what what an honor to sit next to Joe Rogan as he essentially commentate some fight a lot of people would want to do that you know like I'm such a fan here's two more friends we don't really have to talk like we're fans of each other we're just buddies right thank you oh god then I thought fuck did this one coming up is an animal yeah and we're Cormier and John Joe yeah exciting want to go yeah okay ha dude you're the man hooked up that's it I fucking do have you sitting right next to me my dad's gonna be in town - my dad oh dude do I'll give you two tickets one for your dad fuck you and your dad store when you're 13 you went to motley crue that's cool ah so exciting I wanted to ask to like you know for all the shit talking people have to promote the fights but like Daniel Cormier and John Jones no matter who wins the end of the fight they're gonna shake each other's hands right I hope so it's hope so is it common like what we saw with Ronda Rousey not shaking me shit how do you fucking armbar somebody they tap out and then they get up and go to shake your hand and you won't do it like that well I think that mentality that Rhonda has is like a she's a like she's mercenary in there I mean and it wasn't over when it was over to her for her wasn't a competition it was life it was it was life or death I don't know man I mean that same thing is probably why she's not fighting anymore you know like her animosity and her emotions were so riding on that thing and then when she lost and then when she lost again in devastating fashion that's also the reason why there was so much backlash whereas someone who's really loved like Randy Couture Randy Couture would lose a fight and no one talked I mean I'm sure someone talked trash about him but no one's opinion of him differed when he lost because he's such a good guy and because when he when he won you know after the fight he would always pick the guy up and shake their hand and hug them and he was always a gentleman and when people have that sort of a mentality you know like here's a perfect example this past weekend Dustin Poirier and Eddie Alvarez had a fight the fight was stopped because of an illegal blow that Eddie Alvarez accidentally landed on Dustin Poirier and the crowd was booing Eddie Alvarez and Dustin Poirier yelled at the crowd don't boo this man like we were in a fight and he's not a dirty fighter and he made a mistake and they had like first of all Eddie Alvarez I was closed he could barely see he was completely on queer Street he had been almost knocked unconscious any-any hit this dude in the clinch with a couple of knees and the referee didn't stop him and he thought they were legal you know he's in the chaos of a crazy cage fight but to have those two dudes after the fight both are bloody and battered both of them are just like exhausted from a war right and I'm interviewing the both of them side by side and to have Dustin Poirier step in to defend Eddie Alvarez who just kneed him illegally in the face telling the crowd don't boo this man like he was literally a set and then it shook hands there's something beautiful about that and I think people to me people like to animosity but they also really like the fact when the animosity is squashed after the fighting people hug it out they really like that yeah I think there's I think there's a parallel with comedians who don't want to accept other comedians yeah and then there's you who's just not insecure and wants more fucking comedy well I love comedy you know and I love comedians there's some comedians that want to be the only person that's funny and they also bring people that suck with them on the road that's one thing I can't stand it oh that's so common guys will do they stack the deck they'll bring someone on the road with them that's terrible I try to bring the funniest young guys I can find in Edwards yeah Ian and this weekend Tony and Ian those guys of national headliners you know and I but I bring both of them on the road with me I have enjoyed Diaz and had one show in November 2011 and it was my first theater show in LA and this was like I'm gonna have everybody that matters to me like every you know and and I asked Ian Edwards to open for me that's awesome and the fucking stars he's an animal is just so stoked that he even did it and I loved that he's so much better than me he's a really fucking good guy too and he's another guy that like he spent too much time doing other things other than doing stand-up and there's one of things that I always tell comics like you got to be careful of those honey pot jobs like writing for a show like a lot of really good comics wind up losing their stand-up careers because they develop a writing career and they stay like Ian should be a national headliner in big theaters all over the world he really all the country and all over the world who really should be he's that good but because of the fact that he spent so much time writing on sitcoms he didn't tour enough and he didn't put out enough material like he only has one CD out he's been doing comedy as long as me Ian Edwards and I started doing comedy together in 1990 that's when I met him I met him in nineteen fucking 90 or 91 in New York and I've known him forever that's when I made my first video is 1990 yeah it's a long time man but yeah my thoughts are that we should I mean if you like like everybody gets into comedy because they love it right that's why you get into it you want you you want to watch you know you see a guy like you know Dice Clay or Kinnison or Pryor or whoever it is that inspired you and you see them Kevin Hart and they'll name your person you see them and you want to be like wow that was awesome I want to see that guy again you know and you want to go see comedy and that's why that's why I got into it like to get into it and then also want to be the only one who's funny it's crazy to me it doesn't even make any sense and to not like the other comedians it's just like you're robbing yourself of inspiration but there's a lot of comics like that they won't watch the other comedians they don't want to see them and when the comics are doing good they get upset you know they're like litem early litem early let have seen people say it's it's it's it's totally a question of being insecure it definitely is it's also I think it's it's a it's a famine mindset and the famine mindset is this mindset like there can only be one like you can only be it can only all come to me it has to all come to me like no one else can but itself lose that Snoop Dog song song it's no fun if the homies can't have some but it's true you don't have to be the only one who's doing well that's crazy it's just not a good thinking it's not a good way of thinking around them right and fuck I'm excited for for Anaheim oh you know a time it's a great car to as its as it stands right now there's a lot of issues like getting these cards to actually like to play out because guys get injured you know where they get disqualified yeah but I mean when you're getting to yeah they get caught doing something but yeah watch that sorry for interrupting that I watched that hurt business documentary on Netflix I happen to know Daniel Cormier the fucking like for this knee injury he's trying to get healthy again and no fuck that documentary isn't ten I wanna check it out it's so incredible like the way I'm a almost like the focus of it is okay we're going to spotlight like a number of these personalities from the UFC and really sure it is how fucking tragic it is that put so much into it and then that you know they had their careers for whatever it's worth and then when it's all said and done they just got nothing to fuckin show for it it's just so fucking tragic well you can't think that you're gonna have something to show for it that's the thing if you're lucky and you become a Conor McGregor who's like one in a million or you become you know George st. Pierre who retires as the champion you're you're really really unusual but for everyone else you have to do it because you love doing it and if you do it because you love doing it and that's what you want to do then you should do it and you will Bank a lot of money if you're successful but there's this thing that people have where they see a guy like Floyd Mayweather and they say well hey boxers make millions of dollars look for me whether made hundreds of millions of dollars no no no Floyd Mayweather makes hundreds of millions of dollars not boxers like Grenada golovkin who was one of the best boxers in the world he can't even sell 200,000 pay-per-views like his last pay-per-view by I think was like a hundred and fifty thousand which is insanely low to the point where like it's very difficult for promoters to even get behind him unless he's fighting someone like Canelo Alvarez which is his next fight well he'll make some money in that fight but guarantee you he ain't making very good money like with a hand 50,000 pay-per-views and he's a multiple time world champion and like a fantastic amateur fighter one of the best in the world it's about being a star and a promoter is not responsible to give a fighter a bunch of money if they're not earning a bunch of money it's a business and the business is people want to pay to see you why do they want to see you do they want to see you because you trash talk or do they want to see you because you're Anderson Silva and you fight like you're in the matrix or do they want to see you because you're Ronda Rousey your first ever woman ass kicker that we've ever seen like this well whatever reason it is that they want to see you that reason is why you can make a shit ton of money it's not that you just deserve a shit ton of money because it's hard to do right and that's where but a lot of people get that wrong in their head they get that wrong in their head well it's show business but it's also athletics so it's a very bizarre combination of two worlds do you think that car McGregor is doing a disservice to himself by putting so much like attention on like just putting his whole UFC career on hold for this Mayweather thing no because ultimately he can only fight for so long and he stands to win like who knows how much money I mean he can make it could be as much as a hundred million dollars for the fight it's gonna be insane asking a guy to pass up on the opportunity to make 100 million dollars it's kind of crazy that said he's fighting you know boxing what no no it doesn't matter it's not the way boxing works is you get a purse you know like the way UFC works is different and often criticized and I think rightly so is that you have a win money and a show money so say if you were gonna fight Jamie and they set it up where you you fight you make $50,000 to show and then another 50 if you win a lot of people have a real hard time with that and I think they should because you're doing your best you're giving your best performance regardless of whether or not you win no one's gonna fight harder I don't think at least to get that win bonus these guys are trying to win their fucking gladiators you know I mean I think you should have a purse and that should be what you get paid and you fight your best and that's what you get paid like this idea that you're that's double is gonna you know you're gonna come your way if you get the judges nod meanwhile the judges get shit wrong all the time and they have your future like have $50,000 or $100,000 prett a shove it or you can get injured and wound up losing or anything in a polite I think that's kind of fucked up the thing about the Conor McGregor Floyd Mayweather fight if it's tennis you get the money if you win yeah but that's different first of all it's not a fight okay cuz like you play tennis match every weekend try fighting every weekend right dead in a month you know accurate us u.s. president yeah they agreed to sign a deal with Floyd man that doesn't mean anything because Floyd Mayweather hasn't agreed to it the deal hasn't been negotiated Conor has agreed so that's what that means but here's the deal let's be honest about this as much as possible this is a boxing match between Conor McGregor guy who's never had a real professional boxing match was a really good amateur boxer in our in Ireland who was a real multiple division world champion combat sports fighter no doubt about that but and a striker no doubt about that but he's fighting one the best if not the best boxer ever most likely this is not gonna work out well for him if you had a guess that's my honest take on it the only way it could work out well is if Floyd takes them lightly Conor Clips them Conor mugs and kind of does some like old-school Bernard Hopkins shit like this ties him up roughs him up inside the clinch hits him with some real hard shots or does something fucked up to him I mean who knows had bought some I mean that's what Victor Ortiz try to do to him yes you can say that that yeah and also Floyd is not a vicious puncher Floyd's not really no he never was no no he never was he is an amazing boxer but he has very brittle hands he breaks his hands a lot and he can knock you out like he knocked out Victor Ortiz but he knocked out Victor Ortiz just stand in front of him he knocked out Ricky Hatton who was a smaller fighter but he doesn't knock out most guys he stuns them he sticks him with some hard shots but Connors got a really good chin and he's a much bigger guy so the odds are if even if Conor gets worked he's just gonna get out boxed for 12 rounds and and get embarrassed and just whiff at a bunch of punches and Floyd's not gonna be anywhere near him or he can catch him I mean it is possible that he can catch him but it's not likely like the odds are gonna be huge in Floyd Mayweather's favor if I had to guess it's we're gonna be like 20 to 1 or something crazy like that I'm not an odds maker but but I do know movement and I know boxing and that just is just a big difference between what a guy like Floyd Mayweather can do and a guy like Connor can do when it comes to the actual boxing skills but there's also there's another factor to that Connor has been fighting with small gloves and I was gonna be fighting with larger gloves what size gloves they agree on for the fight if Floyd smart is gonna make them fight with 10 ounce gloves you know because probably Connor will want to wear eight I don't know what what weight class they have the cutoff in like lighter weight classes they use eight ounce gloves and heavier these 10 ounce gloves you know that's like that was a stipulation in the Marvin Hagler or Sugar Ray Leonard fight Leonard one of the bigger gloves heavier gloves fighting a big heavy puncher like Hagler so they might make some sort of a decision to go with larger gloves but Floyd's a fucking 49 and Oh multiple division world boxing champion and Connor has never had a professional boxing fight that's really what it is it's interesting I mean I want to see it don't make me no mistake about it when the fucking first bell rings I'll have my popcorn ready bro you'll probably be right there I don't think so no I think I'll be home yeah I think I'll be watching that from home I think that's whoever does commentary on that it's going to be probably boxing people it's like if you had Max Kellerman and Jim Lampley doing commentary on Floyd Mayweather fighting Conor McGregor and a MMA fight I think that would be an embarrassment that would be ridiculous just as ridiculous as it would be for me to do commentary on Conor fighting Floyd in a boxing match unless they wanted to have a combination of an MMA judge and or an MMA commentator in a boxing commentator maybe perhaps I would do it with Max Kellerman I'm a big fan of that guy like that guy a lot I think that would be kind of interesting but most likely I'll be at home watching it you know I'd like to see it live maybe I'll maybe sit ringside it'd be kind of interesting to see that it's gonna be a crazy interesting experience to see what Conor can do and I know he's been working like almost exclusively on his boxing for months and months and months in preparation for this here's the thing that motherfucker can put you into orbit with one punch that's a fact you know like if you look at this past weekend is a perfect example when I said about Eddie Alvarez and Dustin Poirier having this crazy war Conor merked both of those guys with one punch with I mean with Eddie he softened him up with a few punches before he merked him but he he had him on queer Street with one punch and he marked Dustin Poirier with one punch I mean he's just he hits fucking hard is this guy ferocity is a very famous MMA coach and he said it bastard said Conor has a touch of death like he just wow he just fucking he just blaps dudes and zap something with ridiculous speed and accuracy and when he does your fucks Ville the question is whether or not can be able to do that to Floyd motherfuckin Mayweather and most likely Freud's gonna be nowhere near him when those punches come flying I mean he's a wizard you ever watched like Floyd made with her defensive highlight-reel what she's him kind of running back know him just moving away from punches bending at the hips he's not a runner see Floyd people think of the Floyd's a runner Floyd doesn't run he's not like running away from guys he stands right in front of dudes he stands right in front of dudes and maybe backs up slightly or moves to the side but he's just so knowledgeable when it comes to boxing and he has such a deep understanding of where to be at the right time and where the punches can come from the left comes from here that means the rights coming this way and he's nowhere near that he's over here and that means after the right looking like what can you stand in front of him when you watch him the way he's able to like slide out of the way a shit I mean dudes just don't fucking hit him very often he's been hit least or less than any world champion that's had 49 fights I would say that he probably has the most successful defensive career in the history of boxing he's I mean he's literally been tagged hard maybe five six times in his entire career and he stands in front of some of the best fighters in the world like Canelo Alvarez I mean Canelo was younger than it was a few years ago and Canelo wasn't as good as he is now but he just stands right in front of guys and pops him in the face and just understands how to move like that kind of shit like when you're watching this highlight reel could you watched a master like young fighters they should they should watch his defensive movements and abilities I think almost above all others except now this new guy Vasily lomachenko who I think is rivals anybody that's ever lived in terms of his movement its ability to move and his his positioning and footwork I think he's as good as it's ever been but you know he has only got like nine professional fights or something like that he just hasn't really look like this Oscar De La Hoya standing right in front of him and he can't fucking hit him he's throwing all these punches like that mom Juan Manuel Marquez he pops them in just swoop slides right out of the way sorry not here and unbelievable work ethic like Floyd maybe we'll go to a club go to a nightclub in Vegas hang out drink water hang out with everybody get all the accolades crazy lights and hundred other bills then you know what he does people will drive his rolls-royce and he'll run he'll run the Vegas strip run miles and then go to the gym 3 o'clock in the morning and do fucking 15 rounds in the heavy bag he's an animal I mean his his work ethic and his mind and his determination and focus and I guarantee you man if he's getting ready for for Floyd Mayweather is getting ready for Conor McGregor he's gonna be in tip-top shape again man he's not he's never gonna like come in slepen it's gonna be fun why is he gotta be such a dick yeah cuz that's how he made all that money because we were talking about before look what it like showbiz is the show business aspect of it is having Pete like he used to be pretty boy floyd mayweather that's what they used to call him but it wasn't really making any money you know he became rich when he became Floyd money Mayweather when he started talking all this shit and people want him to get his ass kicked and he wasn't getting his ass kicked like people paying to see him not necessarily because they like they're paying to see him because they want to see him get fucked up because he's a huge star and it became a huge star by fucking with people talking a lot of shit talking about how great he is showing all of his watches and all of his jewelry you know he's got this crazy house in Vegas and you know I mean it's the it's really the controversy like domestic violence they went to jail for beating up girls you know like there's a lot of controversy involved in him and that's one of the reasons why people want to see him fight they want to see him lose and he didn't lose he went all the way to the bank I mean he tied rocky Marciano's record for having the most successful fights ever 49 and Oh as a champion it's unheard of unheard of and rocky Marciano's record is a little bullshit because Rocky Marciano Italians right now going crazy what the fuck you sayin Rocky's the best it's pretty much agreed that Rocky Marciano fought his brother and at least one fight early in his career so was it like all fake fight pull that up see if you've that's been that's been validated I'm pretty sure I've read that that Rocky Marciano had like a fixed fight with his brother back in the day you know like a guy like Rocky Marciano was a murderous puncher it's probably like he would show up for a fight and people didn't want to fight him and I like the people who paid to see him like we were gonna do okay my brother won't get in there so his brother gets in there and goes down to a body shot or something I don't know I don't know how it played out but we're lucky we're not in that business dude you think you have brain damage I know from Tim Kennedy dropping you on your head how about just getting flooded in the head by some of the best fighters in the world I think I'm in pretty good shape with all that you seem fine thanks look Anthony Rumble Johnson who was one of the best fighters in the world just retired and he did an interview recently and today the interview came out we said brain damage is a big concern he's a guy who gives everybody brain damage if you ever see Rumble fight the most terrifying knockout artist in MMA in my opinion and he retired because he's worried about someone doing that to him he's like I don't I don't want brain damage he's like I want I want other things in my life it's also interesting because he's one of the best fighters in the world and he said I'm not really a fighter because I'm an athlete he was really good at fighting I thought was fascinating because it shows so much awareness shows what a smart guy he is he's really kind of aware of who he is fuck yeah dude so Anaheim you there I'm downstairs psyched it's a good one too I hope nobody fucks up before the fight they're almost kind of brawl this past weekend you should check out that show this past weekend Daniel Cormier hit John Jones in the face with a water bottle at a press conference at the press conferences well they now they drain the monster energy cans so when you see those monster energy drinks that are sitting there under the dais those are fake the real monster energy drinks but they have to drink them all or empty them out before they get up there right I'm so exciting oh it's okay and just the this John Jones that is so interesting that that press conference where John Jones is talking all positive like now I want to show that you can get back on your feet and you know this and then Cormier says wait a second maxi's you told me I'm the biggest pussy I ever saw yeah and then they yeah well John is starting to come clean now trying to be more of himself in this past weekend they had a press conference and he said that he is doing cocaine well Daniel Cormier said Daniel was talking on the shed what is this fight even going to happen who knows if John gets caught doing cocaine or sandblasting a prostitute what is sandblasting litoris so hilarious Daniels funny man I did commentary within this process it's a funny fucking dude man that on your IG story yeah yeah and so anyway when John said that I beat you after I did cocaine for a weekend everybody's like oh shit like I like that John is being himself that's that's that's what I'll serve him better than all this fake right yeah well he doesn't want to be uplifting too but when it comes to like actual fighting he's a fucking straight-up killer John Jones is a killer that's I mean you don't get to be the youngest every UFC champion if you're not a killer he got he showed up he fought Mauricio Shogun hooah in his UFC title fight who is like a legend in Brazil his opening move was a flying knee he threw a flying knee on Mauricio Shogun who oh that is just crazy I mean you have to be such a gangster to even think about doing that to a guy like he not feeling him out he just leaped in it through a fucking flying knee at Shogun's face and caught him and beat his ass and stopped him when he was like 22 won the World title missives bananas you know John was something special and still is but it's gonna you know it's gonna be a raw a long tough fight with him and Cormier this time I think it's gonna be flying out wait gonna be there yeah I just hope the car doesn't fall apart you know cards fall apart it's so hard to get through a camp without getting injured like we're in danger of losing TJ Dillashaw versus Cody Garr Brandt from bantamweight title fuck are you guard Ram Cody garb and right now is in Germany getting some shit done to his back he's getting Regina Kane done on his back to deal with a bulging disc that's been battered last fight like I followed him on Twitter mm-hmm and then he followed me back oh cool that's dope so just strikingly handsome guy very handsome beautiful man bad motherfucker - yeah that was a great that was the best fight of that night Dominick Cruz and Dominick Cruz yeah well not only that but he mean he's fighting a guy who was consenting it's top two or three pound for pound fighter in the world and Dominick Cruz and he still lit him up yeah that's a big fight and and the bravado there mm-hmm yeah oh yeah oh yeah Abby's breakdancing and shit improvising after he dropped him and knocked him down he was like posing right yeah I could have finished him but I don't know about that I mean if he thought he could have finished him he would to try to finish him he realized that Dom was hurt and stunned you want to humiliate him he wanted to fuck with his head because Dom Dominic Cruz's whole game a big part of it was getting inside your head we fuck with the wrong guy because Cody grew up getting fucked with so like you start fucking with him he's like oh I'm home here like I like fucking with people come on fuck with me I'll fuck with you like if you want to be like reasonable and respectful he'll be respectful Cody will be respectful but if you want to talk shit to him oh he's a black belt in talking shit so I was like Dominick Cruz just kind of bit off more than he could chew when it came to the shit talking and really fired Cody up so when Cody dropped him and then started posing on Mike then dominic has to kind of get it back and he couldn't get it back so he got kind of a little bit out of his you know his comfort level sits there's a fascinating aspect of fighting the the trash-talking in the mental warfare yeah you know there's a lot to it don't don't ever do that dude don't never let anybody talk you into doing that I know Johnny Knoxville he did that boxing match with Butterbean oh that was so hard to watch how bad was he fucked up after that fight that's not the words for Knoxville what is he doing these days right now he's filming a movie in South Africa based on a true story about an amusement park in New Jersey called action park which was notoriously the most dangerous amusement park like lots of people died on their rides or so everybody that worked there was intoxicated and fucked up while they were working and they called it class-action Park and I gotta say he's making a comedy movie about the guy who ran that park and it's at New Jersey but they're filming it in South Africa because they're filming a lot of shit in salt divers no cheap to film in South Africa so they're building a whole fuckin thing Russell Peters just got back from South Africa he was filming a new show for Netflix called the Indian detective he's filming in South Africa I think for the same reasons they just film a lot of stuff in South Africa now because of this out sheep they're really yeah I remember being there we went out there for wild boys is it dangerous Johannesburg is the carjacking capital of the world whoa which we thought was hilarious we were jacking off in cars the whole time [Laughter] wasn't there like - a movie on that like drive was there a movie about carjacking in Camden I feel like Camden New Jersey but they wouldn't say Cape Town is a first world city in a third-world country I think oh that makes sense so in Johannesburg is Morris burger I think is a little gnarly ER that's more Lebanon kind of deal oh yeah let me I don't know that was the impression I got was it was creepier I want to go to Africa but I'm scared of malaria so funny I used to dump out my malaria pills and fill up the bottle of xanax what yeah you weren't worried about malaria now the quote because the malaria pills give you like terrible nightmares yeah heard yeah crazy hallucinations yeah like I didn't like the experience in malaria post so would it do for you give you nightmares yeah gave me fucked up nightmares if I remember right and as I can bring tons of pills and just put him in the wrong bottle even if you get malaria then what I don't know that when I was a kid at the American School in London like in eighth grade we went on a field trip to Egypt and they told us they said don't fucking drink the water don't like even if the order of soda don't let them give you ice cubes to port because the you'll get so sick from the water and we took it seriously but then we were eating outside this restaurant on on the River Nile here's this Egyptian dude if I can watch it and dunk a toothbrush in the River Nile he's sitting there brushing his teeth and I was thinking well if the fuck'em tap water is so bad then what's the River Nile has got it could be the same remember and I was 13 and I thought fuck if that guy came that guy went to America that guy went to England the toothbrush dude he'd probably get sick drinking the water where I live no man I don't know it's like whatever you're exposed to has built up his immune system he can do that right and I remember thinking so probably the best thing you could do would be to travel the whole world and drink fucking tap water like crazy everywhere you go that'd be the way to build up your immune system and and then ultimately that's what we did wild boys we went to fucking every goddamn continent except Antarctica and I drank the first thing I did it president from the airport check-in the hotel room and I would put down my bag and I'd fucking brush my teeth you know you brush your teeth and you can rinse it out and then you'd think and I'd be able to put my head in her - the tap and his gulp cocoa and drink a ton of tap water I did that all over all over Africa fucking Asia South me everywhere I'd fucking drink tap water let's get fucker that my theory was sound experiment yourself you brought somebody with you Mike drink the water understand germaphobes and shit like oh that's crazy I you live in an incubator that's how you get sick you know you wanna let go right I don't get nervous about shaking people's hands or anything like that fuck that that's keeping your immune system on its toes yeah no I love core a weekend I'll shake hundreds of people's hands you know at a comedy show especially if I have a meet-and-greet after the show which i didn't do in Dallas this past weekend but the people that are asking 6000 people I can't have us congratulations thanks man I was fuckin cool thank you it's fun jealous of your tour schedule to go like three days that's how I do it I can't do it I have kids you know I don't want to do any other way I do two days I come back what Bert Kreischer schedule oh he's crazy he's fucking hilarious well Bert Kreischer would go and do things on the road for months at a time you know yeah yeah well for his television show was real bad but he's not doing that television show anymore which i think is great because it allows him to concentrate on a stand-up which is another thing that's like that was kind of his honeypot was the his Travel Channel show whereas there's kind of taken away from a stand-up but now his stand-up was blowing up because he's really focusing on and he's doing it a lot touring a lot and now people are getting a chance and it's tighter to like you see him on stage it's fucking super tight because he's performing a lot worse he was go a long time without performing because he'd be you know doing all this crazy shit on the road right did she enjoy podcast we had a blast and he really encouraged me he's like ha man go to the store go to the store and I've been going to the store a lot and and and I encouraged me to do that that's awesome I just think it's funny how you say that his stand-up separate because of the Travel Channel show but now he's on the road like every day out of the year mmm well he's not really mean he's home during the weekdays a lot its weekends why yeah but he's on the comedy club grinds so that means but this at night the way it works with me my kids are asleep by the time I leave the house because my sets at the Comedy Store always like 10:15 I put my kids to bed at 8:00 and then I'll go over my material quick and head out the door and then you know it's like I have another life you know I have the nighttime life it's it's doable it's doable but the travel is a fucking grind man it's just it's so bad for your body I'm not now I'm like week on week on week off as a way to do it two weekends out of the month is enough it's more than enough because like if I come home like yesterday I was wrecked when I come home just just for the weekend of traveling and then the flight and it's not a fucking long flight Dallas is only like two and a half hours or something it's nothing but you get home and you're like oh just it's so dragon but what you got to do is work out that's the key when you get home from something like that go on a hike do something to get your metabolism pumped up and then you'll feel normal it's the only way to feel normal if you feel jet-lagged a lot of people just like to lay around do nothing right you can't do that you got to you got to kick-start your body just get a blowout all the carbon that'll help - that'll help - don't you worry about people fucking with you Stephen I know dude thanks for setting me straight like
