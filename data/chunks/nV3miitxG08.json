how are you see ya outside the store I know that we're when you run into a comedian that you don't normally hang out with outside the store I mean I would recognize you but sometimes you'll meet someone that you met at a meeting and then it's like that are Ralph and you can't place the contest that's bad especially if it's like an executive and they really like you yeah remember them are you good at faking it nope tired well it's your tell I just say I don't know I'm sorry see I'm sorry where you go it's good seeing you instead of nice meeting you nope I've done nice meeting you and they've go we've met five times no shit I don't think you understand the volume of people that comedians especially at your level like come across every day yeah like how many shows we do people come on come to you afterwards and being like a great set bubble blah and how many meetings in generals are you aware of Dunbar's number oh is that like how many number of people use like a hundred or something you can keep it some I don't think it's an exact science but I think they think it's somewhere around 150 I believe it you got about a hundred fifty people in your head and after that you fucked yeah yeah it's stuff that makes sense right there's no way you can keep them all in there no that doesn't make any sense yeah it's cool I'll tear this or you don't having a chat yes yeah it's like you feel the most come around with other comedians outside the store when you run into them at an airport I was just thinking about that every time I go to LAX I'll bump into like someone jo koy or last time I was Bert Kreischer and like Hayes's Trejo we're going to do I think Utah it's just like a hub for all of us yes so yeah you'll see so many cuz we're all just transients we're here for the middle of the week and then when the weekends come for the club's we're all going somewhere yeah want to come to the store tuesdays like probably the best night and people don't understand why like it's so stacked like why is it you why is it Bert why is it crash or why is it Joey Diaz yeah like well we're just biding time until the weekend right and practicing yeah yeah it's the one of the weird art forms that you can't prep you can't practice alone you have to use an audience yeah don't you think oh for sure and even like I'll be telling the same joke and I won't really change the words it'll be like an inflection it's almost like I don't know when a jazz musician or something like plays a note just a little differently mm-hmm you know you ever notice how a joke won't work maybe because I'm I'm like making a meal out of this word but if I kind of just like throw it away yeah oh now that fixes it it's interesting to do it long enough where you realize it's like it's not the words sometimes you there's like performance new wants to it depress the joke yeah it's on paper it's the same joke you know what's really weird is that none of this shit is written anywhere mm-hmm look what we're talking about you know the worst is like I did JAF out there doing a taping out there for TV and they're like send us your transcript look so you that means yet to sit at a computer in like it it takes the magic like whatever you're seven minutes you want to do for the taping they want you to sit on like on a Mac and open up word and be like oh you guys do or whatever just like type it all out you need a better manager no but I think like I refute I didn't do it I just dodged it I asked alia cuz I used to do it in the past and I was like yo they're asking me to write this out it's taking all the fun and organic like I feel it would really hurt my performance yeah if I literally wrote a transcript then I'm like a robot up there and he was like just don't do it and I go what happens nothing nothing happens just be dodgy it's some pencil pusher it doesn't make any sense I think they get you know well they have power over people that don't have a name yet I think they have people above them breathing down their neck and then you know shit rolls downhill so then to keep on asking like where is it where is it change your number yeah yeah well that's why I had like the reps gonna be a buffer and yes very aloof and like very busy they contact you at all it was a direct to you thing as I would I would see them throughout the fast and they're lovely people I love these people but like say no I play the game a little better I go I'm not there yet I'm not I'm not in your mother's pussy level yeah I feel like it's a it's in your mother's pussy yeah where's the transcript you didn't check your mother I swore that I thank your mom is the fact that you know that it should be in there yeah I should go check check around the corner yes those the words having to type it out but it's also like just for laughs is a weird situation it's evolved right use well yes it's a weird way of looking at used to be very valuable for comedians now it's very valuable for just for laughs because they have this enormous platform and you go there and everybody knows that all these great comedians going to be there and they make an enormous amount of money off the comedian's it used to be the comedian's would go there but at the end because the industry would go there and the whole key to the whole thing was development deals for sitcoms and they tossed out so much money I always hear about the gold rush a day of jfl deals are getting thrown out left and right and like lives were made I don't know that jfl but fake lives were made - like they've ruined it like because I have a theory about people who aren't comedians like they think they see people laughing at stuff and they see something's fun they think it's funny but a comedian can go this is just tricks yeah yeah well cuz the amount the volume of comedy that we want on a regular basis is so much so we can discern like Ian and I will talk about this we watch for students of comedy we watch a lot of comedy people can get like a huge pop out of the room but like Ian can cut through the bullshit and run all that like oh that's a parlor trick oh yeah so it's a different type of thing but I think a lot of times you know suits and everything they just hear decibels more right place right time and they believe this lightning rod moment or whatever this great set isn't it is indicative of their entire comedic being instead of like a lucky roll yeah do you ever hurt what a psych resident was his name chicken that what I always hear that as an example like I heard you blew the roof he was the guy that ended it all like literally because I think they gave him a half a million dollars or something crazy like that I kind of want to see this chicken set like what was the set that just blew everyone's mind he was a handsome fella and he was young and he was very energetic and they thought he was going to be the next Jim Carrey did you see him around was he no leg I know I don't know where he was from but I saw him at Just for Laughs I saw him quite a few times and he was a nice guy but he was terrible I mean in the way that like it was just a bunch of black but there was no substance to it there's no thought to it so they tried to put it together they tried to make like a development deal and he did a little touring but it all went south and it fell apart he eventually committed suicide do you know how many years he was doing himself in front of a school that's cool yeah like like that's what I had heard like you hung himself on a tree in front of a school geez this is last piece of performance art I don't know if that's true see the thing is like I shouldn't even say it on a podcast of millions of people knows - but I did but the hanging part is right right yes he definitely committed suicide which it's one of those things men were like it if it didn't work out and he didn't develop it didn't he didn't he never became like a legit comedian good thing all right over there Jamie yeah I think if like if that had happened and he actually had the equity of a stand-up comedian and been doing it for a long enough yes that would be like a bump in the road but you can come back from that oh yeah if that's just sort of like your lotto ticket mmm then that's why it was so drastic I think well some people are just not they're great comics but they're not really into acting they're not the best at act and they got kind of forced into acting yeah I love Mitch Hedberg Joe Corey's like he's a great standup you know and it's like you know they'll come up to me and they'll be like can you act I think that's like going up to a shelf and being like can you farm yeah that's true I mean I'm butchering it but yeah but there's such different things but it's a you have an agent right and the agent wants to make money since it's an avenue for cash yeah and you know you look at Seinfeld and Tim Allen and Roseanne and Brett Butler there was all these comedians the 90s that made uh ah slow to money yeah doing sitcoms well that's the quicker payoff - I even noticed of my own career like when I was a younger comedian out here in my like early 20s when I move from Seattle like when I first got reps and stuff I was going out on these auditions for like CW shows or just whatever they just throw you against the wall you're an actor comedy is this thing you do at night right they don't really give a shit that you do standup probably don't even think you're funny you know yeah it's just a cute thing you do it's like a kid like a dance recital or something like they don't care as long as you're going these auditions in the daytime so they just hope that you hit on like a series regular yeah and then that's some cash flow for the biz but luckily I mean I don't know I think your say your successes are carved by your failures so I'm kind of fortunate that I would get some acting things here and there but never anything substantial enough to take me away from stand-up well never anything substantial the worst is when they tell you to stop doing stand up because it's messing with your acting role like that's they did a Tim Allen oh really because his acting it was you know he was on home improvement it was a gigantic kit they were making kazillion zuv dollars but he was a I don't say he was a blue comedian but he some of it was a little risque so how did Tagget deal with it he stopped doing stand-up oh okay so he stopped dude Saget stopped doing stand-up for ever forever he really didn't start doing it again until after that show was done I feel like was that show again holding house yeah yeah he stopped doing it for a long time and then kind of drifted his way back in and now he does it regularly yeah yeah I think that's you know maybe they did that at the time but it's almost detrimental to let go stand-up is your car like it's your business you're in control over in the TV stuff it's like one hand washes the other if you let that go you're letting go of this revenue stream so that when the acting gig is over you're kind of fucked because this wasn't like building along with it you know it also was a point of confidence where you understand what's funny and what isn't like you know how to be funny because you're funny in front of a live audience here at the store you have to be there so much like you're there more than someone at your low you would expect someone your level to be it you have to be yeah you can't slack off everyone knows those really famous guys had slacked off and started to suck and the good thing is nowadays the cycle of comedy we all do a special basically every two years pretty much all of us BRR cry sure Segura re kind of everybody kind of does a special or tries to do a special somewhere around every two years so every two years you throw it all out and you're a beginner again yeah you have no fucking act you're terrified you have to come up with new premises and scramble and that requires a lot of performing yeah I like I was on here talking about it was cool here a guy like him even talk about just the dilution of specials where he's like they're not special anymore it's just like a flyer or like a brochure for sure that I'm still around yes that's all it is a little bit yeah yeah I mean obviously there's different degrees of Polish with some of the specials and how great some of them are but there's so many now it's a weird name special yeah we'll just left over from yesteryear it's like wire albums a certain length plays of the yeah but at least an album is like a collection of music that is all in one thing that you get that's kind of been consistent forever a special it's like what is it anymore mm-hmm what is it I guess 45 minutes to an hour of joke strung together yeah yeah to let everybody know but it's also like an album like if you go to see Fleetwood Mac I don't know why the fucker came up with Fleetwood Mac right hey I like for the good Mac I do too yeah but you're expecting the hits or as a comic you're expecting the shit that's not on the special expecting all new stuff yeah yeah that is interesting sometimes you'll get them where they're like do that that's a very rare type of aperio that's like Gaffigan gets that for sure because he's got some classic bits and I think that also happens with Russell Peters I think he gets some requests for classic bits mhm I get that no they do I don't know how to do them anymore I know I purged him I barely know yeah someone who's yelling out Bruce Jenner the other day I was like I can't do that bet I don't know how to do it I'll fuck it up yeah like you don't want it you don't want me to do a sad version obvious like what you could remember or forget the taglines oh let me do it again let me start again yeah redo again fucked up guys how the fuck does funny were happening yeah let's go back to one so you are one of the rare comedians it doesn't smoke pot yeah I guess so talked about that and it's kind of interesting especially being in this industry not taking advantage of that cuz it's especially the store like you'll do a show and they're like hey do you what these three bags these three pillowcases of weed and CBD oil and you're like don't take the CBD oil either I haven't done like is it good which it's great for you what would I use it for it's great for anxiety it's great for it reduces inflammation it's great for a lot of people use it for us it's like it's just good for you it's like it's a it's a nutrient you know it's healthy for you yeah it's hot right now Oh positivism I can get CBD on the phones loves I don't love what CBD don't love it BD how you doing yeah canola's out yeah canola is bullshit that stuff's bad for you can you cook a TBD that's a good question I bet you can't I would imagine it has a low flash point like it would burn quickly yeah let's find out there's a high flash point wait doesn't grapeseed oil have a low cut grape pseudo I think has a high flash point too I think it's good to cook with oh yeah okay so take a longer referred yeah okay it's a high temperature flat high before it smokes burnouts donor's bunch of losers but they stink yeah there's some people that do everything with weed and they need to just stop where's the hemp people I feel like you don't hear from them as much anymore yeah there was like wait yeah was that like the back door like this hemp is cool what about well CBD is for grandma that's how you get people to vote for it because Grandma and Grandpa use it and it helps their joints right yeah like well I'll tell you what this CBD I mean it's not doing anything from the brain not getting high but my joints never felt better feel amazed you know CBD and I'm gonna vote for it and I really want to get a hold of Trump and let him know it's not bad CBD is it really what is a region from the guy it's random random old guy from the middle of nowhere CBD does revolutionize nutrition and really affected my life in a very positive way I think a little south maybe Maryland maybe somewhere outskirts of Baltimore people don't know you have that gear or you forget look you do voice it's really well well I don't have that many though I can only do a few I think are you the type though where if you're doing a bit and you need this person to talk or whatever you'll you'll figure it out yeah I can get a few there's a few voices I can get out you know yeah cuz you're Alex Jones and like you know I like so well know Alex for like more than 20 years so it's that's just easy yeah I've hung out with that guy we've been hammered together so many times it's like it's that is the most misunderstood guy on the planet he just needs somebody next to him that's what he needs someone to go Alice let's slow down like you had a really good point there but you see the manager who's always get them he even agree with me we talked about I said you just need like a rational journalist who's next to you to like study goes you're right you're right you're right I do need that and I go just you need someone who's just even Alice is it look he was right about all this Jeffrey Epstein shit that is a fucking fact Alex Jones called this years ago years ago he was saying that they take a lot of famous people to this island and they have all these young girls that this guy hooks them up with he was talking about this years ago now it is mainstream news and this human hybrid experiments yes sounds like a complete we were like we were like what now it's fucking mainstream news this is a fact man like people want to write that guy off because he'll tell you he's crazy he'll let you know he's crazy I mean on my show there was one of them was a favorite the funniest things he ever said he's like look I want to be honest with you I'm kind of retarded fell to the ground laughs but that's who he really is man people just have him lumped in you know it's like some people they don't represent the best aspects of themselves right to people and then other people try to define them like people try to define you it's really one of the things that it's really kind of weird about the more famous you get the more people try to define you in a way that's detrimental or a way that's dismissive and limited yeah like I've noticed that after this Bernie Sanders thing that I did so anybody listening to this you if you're saying this I am NOT right-wing at all so stop saying that it's silly it's foolish I've interviewed right-wing people I am 100% left-wing the only thing that stops me from the only things that I disagree with about left-wing people is support for the military support for police in the Second Amendment that's probably it everything else across the board I being way left in terms of like Bernie Sanders made a ton of sense to me and I would 100% vote for him tulsi gabbard is my favorite I mean I'm not I'm not a right wing person so this nonsense like so many people were saying that you know that Bernie Sanders spent this time on a right-wing podcast like what what do you say sure and don't you think he weighed the pros and cons of like it was an opportunity for him and I think I think was a win any idea who I was really yeah I think it was one of his young staff members who's friends with Kyle kolinsky who is a really good left-wing progressive talk show guy on YouTube and Kyle hooked it all up and this this idea that you know it's bad for someone to talk to people it's just it's foolish yeah this is a weird thing that's going on right now I thought was a great platform for him and I get his ideas out there and to be heard and something other than just sound bites yes should be taken out of context it's a great platform I think for anyone who's running for anything to have a long-form conversation and it's good for us too because we get to find out who they really are you really can't hide in a long conversation yeah three hours yeah you can't only do an hour and 10 with burn that's all he had cuz you know the guys running for he's legit running for Brett like he could be present all right he's not like you know some people that are running for president like all right bro yeah like what is that guy Zoltan what is his name he was the guy was running the transhumanist platform ish Devon how do you say his last time very nice guys that is for this come now was the last one it was 2016 we had him on but you know it's like one of those guys all right like Ben Gleib you like do you think Ben's gonna win um oh I do okay oh yeah but you got to respect the swing that's what's great about this country you know when I swing the swing what are you talking about just like anybody could run for breath yeah yeah it sounds far-fetched like yeah okay hmm but I mean you've gotta be crazy enough to think you can be you well look anything can and will happen when it comes to being president like people get assassinated people get exposed as being a crime like look do you remember when Michael avenatti was the hero of the left the demo parties like he's the guy that's gonna run against Donald Trump he's gonna take him down cuz he's tough and he's distant he's fat and Michael avenatti my can I have a knife I mean that you there's a compilation of left-wing pundits talking about the hero that it's Michael avenatti you don't hear a fucking word from that guy anymore so if you were in a time capsule right a year ago when everyone was Michael avenatti crazy and they just and then when they woke you up Fahim it's twelve months later and you'd be like looking over the news hey where's our guy finality I mean I was that happens I will have their champion and then this other shit you know drr there's always they ascend and then there's some like dark shit from the past and then you don't see them anymore but then there's guys that you know like one of the things that I was getting at during the Trump campaign when he was running for president the first time was like this guy's not going away like this is not going away he knows what he's doing you know did you know like how how like early in the campaign did you kind of realize I don't know man but my also did you you feel like you had a better read on it just doing stand-up across the country because I feel like you get in a bubble you could be in New York in LA and just be like oh that's never gonna happen this is ridiculous but doing stand-up in some red states you kind of you're with the people you're doing jokes and like you get a temperature of an audience moreso than someone who just has a death job for sure but also I have a lot of right-wing friends a lot of right-wing friends especially from the hunting world I have a lot of friends that live in like I have friends who live in Iowa and or again and they have a lot of right-wing friends too and there's the whole part of the country that the big cities New York and Los Angeles and the the big Democratic leaning cities they were all dismissing the the Democrats thought that Hillary was the most experienced and Trump was a buffoon and that that grabbed her by the pussy tape that was it we got it it's in the bag they all believe that but the middle of the country did not believe in her they didn't trust her they thought she was some sleazy politician who's been involved in the business forever and she licks her finger and figures out which way the winds blowing that's what she says and then they they thought that Trump was a straight shooter and he's gonna drain that swamp and he's gonna do this and bring jobs back and he's talking about clean coal it's almost like I think it's just so outside of the system like it seemed like you could done anything just like we want someone to throw a wrench into it yes that's it there's a lot of people that just wanted a wrench thrown into it and he definitely threw a wrench into it and I think ultimately that's going to be good for the left as well because they're gonna realize that you can't just get away with that same stupid old school politician style of doing it anymore I think he's just blowing up the playbook even like even like Bernie calling Trump was a stupid or an idiot in a post or something like amazing this is a new paradigm yes like they're adopting they're taking pages out of what worked for Trump yeah look we've got a we've got to take some bully tactics and then even a Moscow Mitch I'm like oh they get it mmm nicknames are the only thing that's dick yeah yelling and then the rally like Moscow Mitch like yeah this is part of the PlayBook now sleepy Joe Biden yeah that's my favorite as it evolved is we like to think that we get as adults when it comes to politics it goes back to grade school the only thing that seems to be effective is yelling Moscow Mitch more you know sleepy Joe Biden or Pocahontas yeah sixth and if rules like Rickles just mmm yeah it's so interesting and my favorite about the Pocahontas one was when people were saying that he's racist for calling Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas it's a Disney movie you can't you can't you can't go down yes one called me Aladdin I'd be juice Aladdin's cool little monkey eats apples yes did you marry someone I did that's pretty good yeah got bad reviews I didn't attend it people accepting what they did they felt I what I read was that Will Smith modernized it too much about me like I prefer a classic Janie oh they used modern urban for now yeah and they just weren't uncomfortable with that remember how I'm you know the first photos came out of Will Smith as a genie I loved how little it takes to whip this nation into a frenzy like I'll wake up and open up Twitter and then the real Smith Jeannie everyone is freaking out over that and he's crazy how how we put them on the same pedestal like some sort of Trump scandal or like pedophile island and then the blue Genie or sonic looks weird right Sonic the Hedgehog himself both take on the same amount of fervor on yeah same amount of psychic energy yeah yeah one of my I think one of the biggest gaffes biggest mistakes ever was Ben Affleck thinking he could be Batman if Ben Affleck never ran of her Batman he would have 50% less hate you think yes some people who liked or no was it no one who liked Ben Affleck is Batman even Ben Affleck didn't like himself when was the last time you heard anybody talk about Ben Affleck is Batman ready to go yeah no one Christian Bale's Batman motherfucker even mikaelsons Batman but he's old that's so hard though you know like you're not gonna hit a homerun of Batman every time with everybody who does it and failed their career hits a ditch who do you think alright do you think ok Kilmer leveled up or no from Batman well Kilmer did it once and he did a good job but then he decided to get fat mmm he's like fuck this business what am I crazy see in the Top Gun movie the new one I hope so I'd be great although the lady's not in it the girlfriend the really hot blonde was her name Kelly something another McGillis is that it yeah she was beautiful back in the day I think she might have gone the Val Kilmer out for no long time what about Clooney you that Clooney Nespresso and tequila who's Nespresso he's his was like a comedic take Arnold Schwarzenegger wait made way more money than George Clooney in that movie oh we just say who would polity I think we just say to each other no matter what party we're at what is that Alicia Silverstone she was in that and Chris O'Donnell yeah but why did I forget about that he was Robin now he's on a TV show with LL Cool J what is that one is it it it's like a NCIS that is something that the same people who talk like that guy was making from that's what they D be are that oh that's what you get the certain parts of the country isn't it interesting to find out what their favorite shows are yeah yeah that's where all those NCIS shows that's what they get all their millions of you sure that that's wonderful show Chris does a great job and he just pairs well with LL Cool J who's he's a little aggressive to me I mean enough is always a good fella I guess but I really love Chris I wish we get more work we should bring them back to the movies well thank you be an excellent Captain Kirk he could be Captain Kirk also oh I go to my aunt house and that's just playing all the time yes like burn I mean there anymore but like did you have a show yeah Jagr remember tall my god yeah reruns of Jay my shows on jag love it how the thing is like we can laugh about these shows be like 20 season jag was on for 20 seasons well we were just going over Survivor the other day Survivor was on when Fear Factor debuted it was already on the air and that fear factor came out in 2001 or two somewhere around right after September 11th I remember that because I remember being asked questions like was it appropriate to have a show about fear after September 11th like that some some guy asked me that I literally wanted to climb through the phone strangle them I'm like yeah that's nonsense what are you walking so stupid you're like I'm sorry I didn't know that fear would play such a factor for you yeah but so survivors been on what do we say it was 28,000 seasons on the 39th I believe 39 season it's still going yes you didn't even know no I think the Amazing Race is still going to remember that show yeah yeah CBS is killing it yes I want won the award every year for the Emmys like best show up or best game show whatever reality I don't know what it is but yeah Wow 12 times in a row or something crazy did you like fear factor more than cuz I remember I loved news radio my favorite shows so did you enjoy that more a fear factor they're different things they're definitely different things I enjoy the paycheck from Fear Factor far more huh I like working without actors but I loved Newsradio way more Newsradio it was just a far better Jo so it was really well they're different things they're very different animals it ruined me it would it would it's like going from the comedy store to Uncle fuck sticks chuckle hut uh-huh and on Monday night you know it's like every other sitcom that I looked at every other sitcom at a read for or that I got scripts for rather just not good stuff isn't interesting when you get sides like just sides or just like one scene or two scenes for a show and you could tell it's good just turn that oh yeah that's so rare it is rare yeah yeah when someone's a good writer good sitcom writing is hard to do man there's a really hard gig I mean there's a but and then but then some people have bad sitcom writing but they know how to make a bad successful sitcom like there's bad successful sitcom their last forever they're just unoffensive enough to stay on the air and keep you watching with your mouth slack I mean formulas exist for a reason those big band kids they're so they're so clever with their writing that's what keeps this guy ever shut off CBS but they're too hostile did you know that your TV has other channels so what yeah there's other channels of the programming you watch well when they took Bill O'Reilly off the air instead CBS my channel yeah you ever been in the like an audition and it's terrible but everyone goes through the motions where everyone's just like cracking up like it's oh it's the greatest show on earth yeah Oh like it's Def Jam like because the writers and the directors in the room like the fake yeah they have to because I think they need this rocket fuel to get this project off the ground yes and they need to give the writer confidence they have to give the director compliment I have to give the studio people confidence that it's all good it's a fake moment the fake laugh it's gross and the thing is though like it's also not only the girl but it's the 30th time there's just because there's 30 people in the waiting room mm-hmm and they're laughing like it's the first time they're faking it left and right and we know fake laugh we do it's offensive someone's fake laughing at you it's almost worse than Chanel laughs it is worse than not like you know if you say joking they're like ha ha like get him I get you get out of here you bad person yeah you you you you you it's the quickest way to heckle oh right just like a anything what I'm laughing yeah it's like the Fredo thing no I was afraid of that thing I thought you're afraid of did you see that yeah of course did you see that Chris Cuomo guy said Donald Trump had the best line today Donald Trump won the Internet today with this he said should we red flag Chris Cuomo because he seemed unhinged he looked he was using terrible language should not have a gun he basically exposed those red flag laws just like you see a guy like that he's irrational that guy's irrational he goes I'll wreck your shit I'll throw you down I like stairs with stairs comment that was I enjoyed that look what is he talking about cuz a guy called you Fredo and him saying those same things the n-word I didn't know Fredo was drug Tory or maybe I'm new to it I just I'm not that I would ever try to call someone Fredo sometimes it's not it's a fuckin character in a movie it's like a Latin is it like there's no like I don't know yeah yeah I'm Italian there's no cultural context for Fredo where people look what the fuck did you say it doesn't exist it does not exist right well you could say it for someone who's a traitor but what that doesn't even make sense with Chris Cuomo it's just it's just a loser you know in a movie well I guess I go you know what he's trying to do I mean obviously he's trying to insult him yes even if there is no history of this word existing for you know I mean I don't know if it does exist or not but like you know this guy's trying to take shots it's certainly not a compliment sure yeah I mean it's a loser in a movie it's a brother that always fell short and he turned it turned on his own brother who was the Godfather what is he wanted to be the Godfather did he explained this insult to Chris Cuomo that would be great gofredo was a weak Italian in the movie and I'm referencing your character yes you are the son of a great man cuz you know he's Mario Cuomo's son and you probably you know let's let's be honest about why you're here yeah you know the name is familiar and you know it helps yeah but it's it's that Italian energy that like again this is my people yeah this is my full Italian no 3/4 though but these people that that react that way are common it's like what what the fuck did you say to me well fucking wreck your shit yeah but you're not supposed to be a respected political pundit and behave like that that is nonsense you know that's nonsense it's nonsense so it's a silly way to behave it's silly that guy needs to work out he works out that's tough it's stuff we might be on too much testosterone so we need to take him to tell the doctor just pair you down a little bit take whatever you had just drop it by half settle down bro or just work out really hard before you go outside uh-huh do some yoga meditate I like when those because Elly's pretty passive town for the most part you'll get some of those you'll get like an East Coast guy no one afraid oh yeah we don't actually fight here we just go get my shine box yeah it's um it was a very embarrassing moment but I think it's a very important moment look at him first of all he is Fredo for life now I hope he understands that he's Fredo for life unless you want to get tossed down a flight of stairs he ain't tossing anybody down a flight of stairs that's nonsense he doesn't want to get sued he's not gonna do that touch somebody he'll hire someone it's not doing shit not doing a goddamn thing that's one of the reasons why it's so funny he's not doing nothing this that is Fredo you'll never get away from that now better embrace that shit better start selling Fredo t-shirts with your face listen CNN's probably gonna fire him outta me I think they're standing behind him get the fuck outta ya are they really pretty what act or unprovoked ins yeah but someone calling afraid yeah man look up fighting words dude someone called me Fredo I'm not even Italian hard snap I go how dare you he he's a silly man that that's what wood exposes him and said he's a silly man it wasn't like someone was being equally aggressive to him and he was defending himself sometimes like if you're in a situation where someone's very aggressive to you you almost have to be aggressive back just to let them know hey I'll go there with you yes we could we could go to a dark place right now and you know I'm not gonna let you hit me I'm not gonna let you do something to me if you think that I'm a pushover you know I'm here to defend myself but that wasn't that way like someone was mocking him and he turned violent I think it was a little bit of a ssin where he just wanted to get a rise and use recording from down low they wanted him to do say Chris Cuomo this is CNN CNN's lost their fucking mind Chris Cuomo defended himself when he was verbally attacked with the use of an ethnic slur in an orchestrated setup the spokesperson said we completely support him for now listen to me this is not done this is not done this is just beginning to take on a form of its own you can't you can't say that's an ethnic slur that is a fucking character in a movie news to me no it's not that sir and him saying that that's like calling it the n-word that is so preposterous that is so offensively stupid do you ever get that like people 20 shots or get you to slip or something most people are nice yes I've had guys say goofy shit to me and I try to say goofy shit back till I get shadows or just on the street it was in both things but I'm not Anna I'm not a hostile person yeah and look hostile yeah but I'm not hostile like I'm nice for the most I've had people get deke with me and then what do you do how do you handle it get deke back just like yeah you sale $3.00 flex don't say that it's just it's not that it never escalates to that some people get worried you know it gets weird the fucking autograph people at the airport they like surprise somebody off somebody pay somebody off what do you do design orgies keep lost oh my son won I'll sign one they get mad at me I got a stock in these I go no no I'm not working for you yeah it's not working for you like there's people that charge people they'll go to those conventions and they'll sit at a booth charge someone X amount of dollars like it's like 20 bucks or more for an autograph photo I don't do that I'm not going to do that ever so I'm not I'm not I don't I don't even want you selling my picture I don't want it to be sold yeah I don't want my autograph to be valuable but if if I felt if I thought I'd was a really a fan and they wanted me to sign something that's different yes I would sign something for him we'd be happy to instead of like a four year old guy with a ponytail Kodak of fucking photos of me in various you're selling those yeah I know you're selling those so some got one guy got mad I mean he was like following me around LAX I was like dude I'm not signing any more it's like next time I see you okay I'm like I'm not signing but you know by sign going one of them you're making it very valuable if you sign the whole status fine I just not gonna be rude I'm not gonna be root so I'm just trying to like lick I'll sign one and I tell them that like I got a bunch of them in Portland this weekend they were there was like ten people met me at the airport a small sign one I think one is good but I refill Adelphia they got mad he tried to get me some another one I go I'm not saying that and he goes he goes you don't fuck you fuck could forget your fans I go you're not a fan I go you're selling needs what you think they're worth a lot I go if they're like that this is a weird mental gymnastics dude you better be worth your fucking autographs worth about 625 I go and you're a mooch I do you over here trying to get me to work for you I go go get a job and we so we had this like weird conversation like what are you saying you want me to sign these so you could sell them but you're saying they're not worth anything so I'm a loser but you're meeting me at the airport to try to give yourself things sorry you looked at my flight it's so silly it's so silly but I just don't like the idea of it because primarily I don't like the idea that there's some weird loophole where someone can get you to work for them they're just showing up and your sign is real quick and I'm gonna sell them cuz it's you you're asking someone to work for you even if it only takes five minutes or they're taking time off from you one guy had 30 pictures he had 30 back oh how many you got there he goes 30 I go you out of your fucking mind how funny would it be if you just thought it was a good a Turk if you sat at a Starbucks and you just did them all oh yeah I called on family just go through these the UFC makes fighters do that they sit down but they give them out to fans and they do stuff with the promotional material that's not one guy and everybody signs them like all the fighters in the card sign them and you know they're valuable to fans as a fan like I have I have a signed poster out there from Efrain Reyes that I purchased and the Efrain Reyes is like the world's greatest pool player I love pool and he's this Filipino wizard they call him the wizard his amazing pool player so I saw I bought it like it was signed by Ephraim Reyes I got so excited but I would never ask Efrain to sign something and then sell it I'd track him down their planet someone at the at the promotion for the tournament they probably got him to sign a bunch of them they sell them and it probably was helped offset the costs and but there's just so that the autograph collector is a different animal than the autograph seller so if you're a person that is just like I love Fahim comedy's really funny I want to go to the comic store and see if I get them to sign something for me that's a fan for sure but if you have 30 of them you're gonna go on eBay and you gonna try to make 50 bucks that's what you're doing well you're not gonna make 50 bucks he's gonna tell you right now they might if they hold on they sit on what have you seen I was surprised because like I came to the store I always see at the store you know and you're like oh man your videos are funny and like I don't know what you watch you're just going to other level I don't I don't think it even reaches you oh that's nonsense that that other level thing is a complete total illusion no because you are a rarity I think of the comedian's of the store who have gotten to a certain point where you kind of have a relationship with everyone at The Comedy Store from the door guy to the waitress is to like you know stand ups like me or like Santino or even like you know you have relation with everyone you come through you spend time at the store you have you're being pulled by a lot of things like UFC and the family and all the stuff the podcast but you will hang at the store well that's a community it's very important to me that community means it means a lot it means a lot and I like I like supporting the up-and-coming people I think it's very important I think all the door people the guys worked a lot those guys are all there we're all gonna work together some day you know it's very possible they'll they'll be you know I'll be at one theater they'll be at another theater you know I'll be in a club over here they'll be at a club over there we're all yeah it's just an illusion it's just time and I think it comes from martial arts because in martial arts everybody trains together you know I'm a black belt in jujitsu but I'm as friendly to the white belts as I am to other black belts we shake hands we hug if I roll I'll roll with the guy who's news just starting now give them tips I'll help them out you know we're all in it together and I feel like that's the approach that I take with comedy the same approach I don't believe in this elitist shit I think it's stupid I think it's it's bad for everybody it's bad for the person who becomes elite even more so than it's bad for the the up-and-comer because the upper covers if you don't if you just mess up and comers and you treat them like shit like you treat them like you're better than them you're above them you don't need to like talk to them you don't make eye contact with them you ignore them when they're trying to talk to you and I've seen that from comics and I think it's bad for you for them it just makes them angry you know they can't wait till and I have been in that position before where someone's dismissed me and been shitty to me and then I surpassed them Fame was and then passed by and then they become friendly and weird with you and you never remember yeah it's very strange and you see the 180 and something you'll be in comedy long enough to see plenty of 180s and it's not I mean you'll I'll give you some names after the show oh really yeah I would love that yeah yeah name some good names juicy and then you you act however the relationship is now at this point in time yeah but that's always in the back of your mind like I remember when it was not this but there's there's also I want to give someone an opportunity for redemption like I want to believe that they've changed you know I've it's hard I don't want to be that mean person who's like that fucked that guy for life sure for sure but I do like hopefully that they grow that maybe they've grown as a person yeah and even been humbled because the career kind of like skid and it came to an abrupt halt and they're trying to rebuild yeah they used to be someone that thought that they could there was a time mostly pre-internet where comics looked forward to doing a couple things one for one thing they look forward to was bumping people doing a lot of time they yep they're like but the bumping people was the big part it was just doing time so like do any time thing if you like dave chappelle calls up and says I want to do a half an hour nobody cares like he's really gonna do he'll wait til everyone's gone up and then he'll go up at the end of the night he's a beautiful person I love that guy to death he's he's the exception to the superstar rule because he's a sweetheart of a guy but there are some that wanted that spot of the bumper where they could just show up oh my god Mike's here Mike's here for him I'm sorry Mike's going up mike has to go up and Mike looks like I'm going up you know there's a few of those like I fed them yeah feed some feeds them to let them let you know that you're not on their level yeah I like that happens way less now oh yeah yeah yeah yeah well first of all because people like us talk about it on podcast like if this is one guy that was like a super dick to you and you're like let me tell you something Joe there's a fucking guy you know it's we're all comics man just like when you go to a jujitsu school you take a class or two classes you're a fucking martial artist you know you might suck yeah but you're a martial artist if you're you're up down that goddamn stage your comic in in my eyes you're just like me I'm just I've been doing it for thirty years and you've been doing it for less yeah yeah that's what it is that's that that's the only difference it's just a time in and if you get thirty years down and what you get out of those thirty years is that you're better than everybody and that you can act like you're better than everybody and you're aloof and you're dismissive you've missed everything I think beautiful like when I come to the store yeah I like that I get hugs yeah yeah it's always hot start coming back like I would just think like I'd be on the wall you're like yo what's up what's up hey hey man look at me a hug you know and like we haven't really like talked a ton but that something as little as that goes so far well that's nice yeah I hope it does go far I want I want comics to feel good about the community that we have yeah I remember because when I got past the store it was the Dark Ages like I know the stores had various Dark Ages Bobby talks about like the 90s and stuff but you are at the ice house so like you weren't even really part of the story you were still just like going there a lot you know yeah so it was very cool for you to come back and Adam take over and then it just kind of evolved into what it is now it's crazy because I remember when it was not that and there was kind of a beauty in it though I'm like pretty fortunate in hindsight that I got past then what year was this have passed in like 2010 you know that was three years into the dark ages the dark ages start at two thousand seven huh yeah yeah it's also crazy to like know that you know the history and see the video and then oh I exist on this timeline now yeah the store was just you know what I'm living in Seattle it's this far away place even Hollywood and entertainment in all that it's just this place that exists on a box it's not real it isn't it isn't right this isn't a real thing and then you move to LA and I'm hanging at The Improv I'm a ghost you know people are walking through me walking through me and I'm just like my hands aren't it and I just hang out and that's part of the deal you just have you realize leaving your apartment yeah is a win in itself like you may not be getting up as much as you want to but even just like being out it's a win yeah it's gonna be like oh you should do my you know because out of sight out of mind yeah so I was a lawyer at The Improv I was nobody and then how it's like it was like Sandler and someone and like maybe Kevin James I think Sandler Kevin James I want and that was like I'm sure that's very standard I mean I've been here so long it's a very standard now you see million people like I very I don't get starstruck at all but it's kind of like oh fuck those are people in a box other people in the box that I watch right and they just walked in so that was kind of like a little mindfuck an adjustment you know well when I was in Boston in 1988 when I started Mecca was the store man that was where Pryor performed and Sam Kinison and Hicks started out there and Hicks used to STATS he was a doorman there and you know Letterman was there Robin Williams was there it was just it was Mecca and I thought when I first started doing comedy when I when I realized like okay this is what I want to do like after the first set I ever did I was like okay this is what I'm doing I'm doing this now I'm all-in you know took me a while to get funny but I mean I I had it in my head that I was gonna get to con the The Comedy Store oh yeah and then when I finally got there I remember thinking how surreal it was cuz I was like I guess I was 26 25 no 25 or 26 I think the first time I stepped foot in the store and we were sitting in the back of the room going holy shit I can't fucking believe I'm here isn't it odd it's it's just the place yeah but it isn't it's not it's not just a place I know but like when you I guess the manifestation of the place like okay the stage there's chairs there's a table you ever see in the daytime yeah alright this is the space it's odd it feels like it's waiting yeah like it's waiting it doesn't come alive until nighttime yeah it's like a bedded animal like a hibernating bear yeah and at nighttime man the drinks start clinking and you know the comedy starts flowing and Jeff starts playing the piano it's an interesting room to when you first started doing it was it difficult cuz it's not a NAT it's not a it's not an easy room the war is on yeah the o.r I consider the Oh are the Comedy Store yes people will come through and be like oh yeah I better store I go I go what what room they're like one of the main room okay cool main room is cool but it's not the heart and soul of the Comedy Store the Moammar is intimate nothing gets lost right the main room you kind have to be it's so big and there's that second tier you know how the step goes up to like be able to have that laugh wave hit that back row yeah you're really working you're performing and the stage is so big you have to be more theatrical to kind of do a serviceable job in that room but in the or it's like literally you're just watching a man gather it's not or a woman you know just like you could be real you can be you don't have to be like right you have to protect as much yeah yeah well there's different kinds of comedy right mm-hmm what's the largest crowd you've ever done I've been watching your stories and stuff and that's fucking insane like even when you're in the green room and you just hear these murmurs it sounds like you know look I'm angry mom's gonna kill yourself it's but they're all just like filtering into this giant theater maybe 3,000 or 4,000 and that was that was a trip for me but you notice when you do 3,000 or 4,000 that there's like you have to give them more pause oh yeah more time for the set the the joke the punchline to settle - laughs to settle before you move on to another but what another great about doing it so long is stand-up is this conversation with the audience so you know to wait yeah like you have inherent timing yeah another comic would just kind of know the timing of the club and just like plow into the next joke while they're still getting last my theater yeah you can't do that but I took I was talking about this yesterday with Tom Papa that one of the reasons one that one of the best lessons I've ever had was actually sitting in the audience at one of Richard not Richard Lewis blacks not rich Lewis confusing I mean I would confuse it yeah the word Lewis Lewis black show in New Jersey he was there the night before me and Joey Diaz and I sat in the audience and he would hit a punch line and people would laugh and then he would hit the tag and I couldn't hear the tag because all the other people were laughing around us and I was like you gotta be like a little more sedative yeah yeah yeah you can't just hammer them like in the story at the oor you can hammer them punchline punchline punchline punchline you could beat the fucking shit out of them that way and it's a different kind of comedy you if you have that style of comedy you might struggle a little bit with the theater and you'll definitely struggle in an arena arenas and amphitheaters are another animal I feel like just having no ceiling how does that work is that Saturday night that's music huh I had a great time we had a great time ally McKellen coughs key killed she had a great time Ian killed it was fun it was fun but it's definitely different yet I think it's different because I think there's such fans you know obviously I think they're gonna be tuned in yeah it's different when you're like I'll do some festivals sometimes or I mean back in the day you would do a college or something and it's just outside and if they don't know who the fuck you are yeah and it's a daytime and it's outside yeah you flew to pick up a check Paul you all you got to do is not lose your mind onstage and you can collect your check if you're like like then you're not gonna your money well it's a matter of whether or not you're have being fun if you're having fun and you enjoy performing and you your materials good so you know it's good you have fun sure and again have a good time and the absurdity of the situation is funny but obviously it's not going to be like a regular Club Saturday yeah dude I'll take you if you want to come I'll take I'll take you one of the crazy I mean that's just seem that's a mine forever it's like that would be like a stand up float tank well you know Ali's only 22 yeah she's so young yeah and I've been taking her with me and her and Ian and the first arena she ever did well here's Ali right she's done clubs with me she does improve with me all the time she does a store with me all she's the door yes beauty of the system store it's like one of the last places like that yeah there's a system in place and yeah yeah she works the door of the store and she performed in front of 10,000 people I went back to checking IDs that's the mind fucking with a young comic do these crazy things and then you're back at your job but she's wild and hungry and yes I don't worry about Sally she's fine she's great she's really talented too but um you know so the first big show she had done before that was the Mirage in Vegas I love that Claus yeah I love that Club I started doing that Club and then I went to bigger arenas and I came back to that Club because it was so much fun because most the time when I do Vegas I do it the night before a UFC like on Friday night and I was doing these big giant places like the car theater which is like a hundred foot tall see more than 100 feet tall ceiling it's a Cirque de Soleil place but it was too weird it wasn't it wasn't the right setup for comedy and the Mirage is so perfect just a Terry Fator yes yes yes so I went back to so that was the first time she'd ever done anything big and she walked out there looked she fucking owned the place she's like she owned it yeah it's just like she had a bet the best set I ever saw her have there and then I said okay you want to do arenas she's like ah so that's ballin so we did this crazy place in Portland Portland was insane damos off-the-charts almost too big almost two to one what was almost too big but almost too powerful did they do concerts in there normally or is that space it's basketball oh shit that's what the Blazers play yeah for real yeah whoa great it's like you're cannon before your set yours yeah I had up my buddy cam Haynes who lives in Eugene which is real close to there was in that same place a couple weeks before that for a game he's like dude I can't fucking believe you're coming here to do comedy like what is this yeah nuts you would almost think is like a consumer of comedy what is that experience like and is it still like the beets have got to be so different than like a club like that there was fun man I was watching Ian on stage and he was murdering and I was laughing my ass off it was great it's it's all in the acoustics of the building and the modus Center in Portland is a really new theater or a new arena it's it's really well made so the acoustics are excellent there's nothing is lost cuz that's my work in a space that big that no one can hear what you're saying and it's muddled and I've done some big places where it's not the best I've done some big places where you hear a little echo ooh this could be a problem so you have to be a little clearer with what you say like you almost got to take some of the spice out of your joke you know spice out of your delivery because it's a little echoey the best though the best is the ice house or the store or the improv like 200 people 300 people damn fast BAM and that's why comedy clubs are a certain size mm-hmm if it ain't broke don't fix it it's also because that's all they could see I mean it's hard to sell like prov like Joe Rogan comedy clubs and they're all like 20,000 see you know yeah I mean it's also when Joe comes around we're having a tough time getting people to come out it's I mean how many there's not that many people that are doing those places like Kevin Hart Dave oh that's so crazy to like you guys teaming up to do a tour if you're a comedy fan how great is that dude we did 25,000 people in Tacoma uh-huh we broke the oh you got my brother and I think he hit up Ian yeah it was like because I think I was in London so I was sleeping like the time is off so then he just DMD inand he was like hey I'm his brother can I come to the show the Dave things are crazy though because he brings a DJ and Donnell Rollins gets out there and gets everybody hyped up and it's the fucking DJs in between it's like oh it's so next level let's go concert yeah pasta just you feel crazy like is this really hot like even Dave he was like this is fucking crazy man like we were all like this is to get him to say this is crazy yeah we were all like this was crazy we all realized this is something because people are so pumped that we're doing it together yeah was mad it's like I can watch the Throne tour Kanye and jay-z yeah yeah we're gonna do more we're trying to figure out where and how but we had a great fucking time why not it's just so rock star shit they show up at places and have IVs ready they do intravenous vitamin infusions with glutathione and how do any 12 shots how did you feel after like I could run through a fertile yeah how did you feel before and then after we just like tired you know we're traveling and we're up late the night before and then you get juiced up with vitamins and you just like where's that tree yeah you feel fucking excellent this I guess you know they don't rock stars know what they're doing yeah and I'm sure you're only doing a fraction of what they do and they have something different I've either probably have some other bag we don't even know about probably yeah it's probably some illegal shit and yeah like they're probably doing nad they're probably doing a lot of different things yeah yeah bus looks insane at the end of the day though back to the grind like tonight I'm doing the belly room you know I'm doing improv we got 10:30 at The Improv Oh tank double dip yes always you ever do you don't do factor you really huh is that cause a tape yes okay yeah they taped me they tape everybody they put your shit online but like say we're not gonna do any more but they still have the camera mmm jeez not trust them because like they'll send it to me with the clips and I'll be like I don't it's not ready her I don't want to put it out there and then they respect it that's a bill burr said yeah and then I found the shit online I'm oh yeah look at that he's like what the fuck I was like Yemen like somebody work in there that's not listening to this you know and maybe they don't do that anymore and I hope they don't but but my chance it just doesn't feel good it's just that was very poor the way it was handled was like you should be happy that we're putting it online it was not good I'll tell you all about later okay but it's just there's plenty of room at the improv and the store yeah I don't need to go there I don't wish it I mean well it's a great club it's fun to work out sure you know I know you mean though it's like I'm in Tarzana now and like one will be like hey do you wanna do this show in Irvine and that's just like saying my shows on Mars alright fine at 8 o'clock you might as well leave your house yesterday but Burke can you chopper me to yeah chopper no you gotta go I was working at Boeing I had a co-worker who was learning well he had his hours up and everything so he fly he flew choppers and during our lunch break he's like you want to go in the chopper Jesus I was like sure so then he's like let's take the doors off what yeah this guy's trying to kill you nah but like mine it was crazy I figured why not gonna go in a chopper that's true so for my lunch break I went in a chopper what this guy I recorded it Wow and then it's my mom she's fun yeah if I had a son and I was a woman and my little boy was in a plane flying over the doors and off that doors off yeah maybe you didn't serve him on the shitter told her like that it was my coworker yeah yeah you should have said it was like a super experienced fighter pilot he's a military guy yeah 20 years experience yeah yeah it's weird when you go up in a in a bird with like someone you know though so well I did it first in high school when I was in high school my friend Mike Mike warbell he was uh taking small plane lessons and we flew around this whole small plane he's like fucking he was my age maybe he was older than me like one year I think I was 16 he was 17 maybe maybe but no more than that he's gotta trust them and like I said flying in a fucking plane had a co-pilot it was like an instructor so that's better than yeah it was taking lesson with him but that was the first time I was ever in a little tiny ass plane I was in high school it seems like a rough way to die I just don't like even with all the training and all that I'll leave to the pros mm-hmm like if JFK couldn't do it well I think that JFK story was more complicated I think he was involved with I think that that flight was like no visibility I think you ran into fog and like a more experienced pilot would have known the weather conditions yeah the best to be going up yes and also you you have to understand how to read the gauges because you got to know what altitude you're at and the gauges have to be 100% functional yeah I don't know what the whole story was with his death but I believe Google whether or not JFK's body had cocaine in it Google that know RFK what's his name jr. not RFK JFK Jr's body had cocaine in it because I think there was some cocaine involved if I'm not mistaken fly in the clouds I'm in the clouds big doesn't even have any like lessons he's just like the plane I think he knew how to fly and I think he was I think he was unprepared for no it's you know how it is like he was off the Cape right was wasn't someone in your Massachusetts that fucking those clouds get thick bro I mean you don't see jack shit so you're flying around that fly you want 500 miles an hour and right in front of you is white that's all you see 500 miles down through the white and just knowing kind of just knowing this isn't a good situation yeah you're fucked and you kind of know yeah yeah well when I lived in Colorado I remember there was a time that I was driving up this hill we were pretty high up we were about 8,000 feet above sea levels 3,000 feet above Boulder and as we're driving through the hills up to the house the fucking clouds were so thick you couldn't see five feet in front of the car so you're driving on a mountain road sometimes has no railings to the left it to the right and it's just death to the left and you're driving up this mountain road you can see jack shit so you literally have to turn the fog lights on so you the regular headlights are no good shut those off and you have to have fog lights on it's fog lights just kind of light the ground yeah yeah that's why they exist yeah that like people like people don't think of what a fog light is cuz most time you don't really have to deal with fog fog light is a little like down below you'd see a little bit yeah instead of blinding it just yeah otherwise you just see bright white did he say anything about that but they were check info wars.com yeah you go to the wrong source dude use Google but being is Bing at Jamie 8:30 at night and they were flying over water that had no features the remember water it was dark and foggy yeah basically pitch-black yeah and he didn't have a flight plan either and he he told an instructor that offered to go with him he wanted to do it alone Oh what but you didn't find anything about cocaine I googled that nothing popped up did something popped up that they might have had a past of that but it nothing said I know I wrote on top see nothing said that okay maybe I made it up it's possible let's put in the Wikipedia page just just think my memory vary so wildly it's confusing and I'm wondering if it's old age or if it's just a just an overwhelming amount of data in my brain and my hard drive is just completely run out of space maybe there's some overlap like a similar story first sure there is because I'll have conversations with someone sometimes and they'll ask me where we'll be just talking about something well that's not exactly how it happened this is what happened and because of this because as they evolved they developed the ability to do this and that and I just had know this I'm like why do I know and someone goes will you a fucking biologist might know I'm an idiot yeah I do retain a lot remember things I'm good I don't want retain something sometimes I forget who I was talking to or who said what or how where where this idea came from it's weird yeah it's not it's not selective yeah it's not that good it's like but it helps when I'm taking nootropics which I didn't today today I didn't take any alpha brain we don't why don't we have any here how come you don't have any here Oh give me the hell thank you oh man how does this work well your brains gonna grow hope your head familiar it's flexible just like the headphones are swell from the head a lot you used to use used to rabid other than here yeah you to work at Boeing is this like a Elon Musk moment guys am I gonna be a mural yeah crazy from me too I mean I didn't even think twice about giving him weed really you didn't think like all this will be a moment it was just oh I thought were just hanging out me and my buddy Elon yeah smoking a little weed like normal like there's like no you see the Ross Baines painting in the green room we're in the cloud it says 6% oh no yeah go look at the smoke cloud again because he lost 6 percent of the stock jeez but he got back it was up to 9 percent the next day went up three percent but his street cred went fuckin through the roof dude I drove his car here that guy deserves everything he gets that car is got a time machine I'm still a Mazda 3 2007 man myself yeah I'm a purist someone's I'll get a brochure in the mail like get the 2019 Mazda 3 like I'm gonna put a bullet in my head if I get to Mazda threes in a row don't get a Mazda 3 but get in the Miata yeah those are dope isn't a punchline I don't give a fuck who's making that joke they don't know what they're talking about in front of me bullshit - the Miata is a fucking fantastic car I'm not bullshitting it has very low horsepower but it's super likely this will be my like defense some people make fun of me they have a lot of horsepower it's really lightweight doesn't have a lot of horsepower it's very low I think it's less than 200 horsepower under an 81 yeah it's but Miatas are amazing cars but everyone how many times do here is a punchline those are hacks sure those comedians are funny there's certain words that are just like go to like Chipotle's a great this Chipotle's a great wine hard they still make them in a in standard with the standard transmission I just wanna say thank you mother you're welcome Mazda 4 it's a fucking great car man I'm not kidding they're really fun to drive they handle really well I like mine I'm at a very tactile but a Mazda 3 is different than a Miata right how much different is it I mean probably pretty different what is that one that were right there 2019 Mazda mx-5 mx-5 Miata what with rx-8 to see that red one the cool red color yeah but good with the one above that look at that with the removable roof ooh that's like a target I could be on the beach that is a dope car people are crazy they just want it they want higher horsepower if that was instead of a Miata of that was a Tesla Tesla made an electric Miata that goes zero to 60 in one second get on everybody would want that car yeah dude it's a great car yeah drive one all right you know a test drive a Mazda Miata go to in it's cheap how much is it me honor like 28 grand dude come on come on I'm not bullshitting for 28 grand you get a great car I'm not kidding I would try I just would never think that you would have this much passion about the Mazda Miata and it's really refreshing I am an automobile enthusiast yeah I love cars I saw the cars here I love engineering mm-hmm I'm a fan I know oh yeah I love mechanical things I love how people design things and what they've done with the Miata is they've made a car that it always has a loyal fan base that continues to buy them because they don't break the bank it's not something that you pull up to the club and everybody thinks you're like some super baller but it's a fun car to drive they're a really fun car to drive they're super lightweight they're very agile they handle great they still make them with a manual transmission yeah mine stick yeah they're fine man it's a fun car to drive don't be hey no meows all right but how do you feel at Mazda 3 though I want the same love for the month I get a Prius yeah you're in the Prius category you know what's happening with Tesla it's interesting because when you for a while you could be driving a Prius and no one knew if you were rich or poor it was the great equalizer sure but Tesla came along and they're like you know now you can stunt and save the earth now people know you're rich and pious before you don't know if this guy's poor or DiCaprio yeah but now it's like so all the poor guys who want to go green are kind of fucked mmm but a Prius is difference because it's a hybrid like that was the only option back in the day that was the only option Mercedes has an s-class Mercedes for the food chain Mercedes that's also a plug-in hybrid it's just a new one that they just released like Jeremy Clarkson was raving about it mmm it's supposed to be this incredible car so Mercedes is actually making like plug-in hybrids for their top of the food chain vehicles that's pretty cool pretty something that's no it is it is new but it's also it's like a little bit of a step back because it has gasoline but the step up is going to be a car that charges and it charges in a normal amount of time like an hour - how long forever we have a supercharger here we have a supercharger installed here and it still takes I don't know probably five hours five hour dead yeah if it's dead it'll probably take five hours maybe six mmm you know but like if I come here and it like full charge is what does it get three hundred and fucking ninety miles or something like that somewhere around that range are you not really are you having to be a little better with your planning like alright I'm gonna put it in here I'm not going anywhere with it I go to LA I go to the comedy store like I have like this weekend I'm in Anaheim for the UFC yeah driving that fucking for you crazy what happens anybody have electricity a concise anybody can sit here with me for eight hours yeah there's not a goddamn thing you can do you have to call a tow truck and they have to bring it to a charging station and then you have to sit there like an asshole you know it's uh but the technology if you you can't look obviously I'm kidding in some way because it's super simple it's Scott you've seen one the inside right the giant screen I've only seen from the outside because like the phone right here is hidden because the Comedy Store is turn into a Tesla dealership kind of how you know how you know the store is in a Renaissance where it's like just so many Tesla's coming in and out of the place not just Tesla's like Russell Peters pulls up in a Ferrari and it's like a Bentley tow just got a Bentley yeah a Ferrari no a Lamborghini Lamborghini yes you like now must be the most trying time to be a lot guy at the Comedy Store just a man the bullets they sweat having to move cuz know that parking lot in the comedy store who is like Tetris yeah there's a finite amount of space and they've got to fit all the paid regulars cars in there and the price is the price that all these are insane now the problem is they're letting these promoters park there aren't they being better about about saying like you can't park in just a lot they should detonate they're like I'm a tow truck is just like a stick of dynamite is to giant like Kevlar tarp that they throw those cars just detonate them just during the set you just hear promoter because there's so many people that Park back there like you're not even a comment what do you do not only that though like the back bar and I sold the back I had yo area weird cuz that's like our home that's kind of where we hang out before we have to go on stage and we want to see like you or Santino and just like chop it up before we have to go on stage and then it's like who's this and they talk to you and they interrupt conversations and not in a snooty way but it is a bit of a way it's like a dugout it's like a baseball dugout adderal people go back huh yeah I talk too much - yeah right they have more confidence than me back there I'm like they have a knurled confidence I've never done that at all have you don't isn't it big now like every student has taken it a lot of people are taking it it's a big thing amongst journalists journalists and writers because they get more work done because you're on speed like there was a guy that I had in here that was writing a book on he wrote that book on honey rest Thompson was it uh what is it what is it what is his book something gonzo something anyway um he was talking about how he needs it to write you can't write without it is it just the deadlines and the workload is insane and that's a way that kind of you don't with it you don't need it to write can you move your fingers you will you sure yes Teague yes yeah that's the natural thing to do but some people want quick fix well it's not necessarily quick fix it's like you can get it go Timothy didn't ever yeah isn't that very nice like mental debt if you keep some book let's name the book yeah mental debt yeah called you become a crackhead freaking freak Kingdom yeah you become someone who is on stimulants all the time and I know several people that have an issue I know one guys completely lost his fucking mind thinks everybody's against him thinks that everyone's done him wrong and he's just out there cracked out in the middle of nowhere unfuckin adderall every day and making YouTube videos and there's a lot of people like that man there's a lot of people like that it is a meth like drug it's very very very very similar to meth yeah this is a different release in terms of like that how quickly your body processes it crazy how widespread it is for something like that then it's fucking stimulants man it gets people if you can effectively do your job and you don't commit any crimes and they can sell you that stuff and make a profit and then you actually are more profitable when you're on that stuff then not then fucking have at it that's how people look at things and look when I was when Pop was sort of legal when it was medically legal I had a bullshit prescription your back hurt oh yeah everything yeah did you go to the hot doctor you know like you would see on Sunset Boulevard it's like this like Persian chick was like no subscribe you know I went to a black dude with dreadlocks he was awesome he this is what he looked at me and that's the best weed doctor to the black this guy's good the best he had remember those vaporizers that are there a bag oh yeah yeah remember when I stayed with Ari Shaffir in New York and he he had those and I had never seen that before just seemed like such an odd contraption some of the early podcasts we vaporized with that bag and they're the dumbest conversations cuz we had no idea what we're talking about I would like correct myself halfway into a sentence because I forgot what I was saying and then I would forget what the original correction was and I'm like what no no that's not what I'm saying what am I saying I was so fucked up and it would take like an hour into the podcast before like the fog would settle so was that just the medical marijuana delivery system well no it's just a delivery system it's not met you can use it right now you know if - I feel like do people use it that way yes oh really what's that what's the no upside of that no smoke you're not you're just getting mist you're basically getting the THC crystals it's turning into mist and that when you vaporize you're not getting the burnt plant material it's almost like harsha connoisseurs yes there's a million ways s to get what you need our wine dorks yeah or cigar dorks it's like real similar sure but anyway I walk into this guy's office and he's just the fucking coolest I wish I kept in touch with this dude who was somewhere in Hollywood I forget where it was but the dude looked at me goes you look sick you know the game he goes you need some medicine you need some medicine and he had this big smile on my face I said thank you sir I feel sick and I feel like I need some medicine he goes what are you here for a brother and I said it helps you sleep he goes good enough for me anybody gives me prescription and he pulls out the biggest bag he had a custom vaporizer bag for the volcano and I'm telling you I'm not exaggerating was four feet long his his four feet long bag he puts it on this like if it pumps up like a kid's bouncing house fills up with weeds he does it there oh yeah we were blasted we got blasted at his place the doctors office was connected to a grow-op right so we we smoke we smoke we vaporized right and then we go into the back where they're growing the wheat and we're barbecued right I'm barely in this dimension and I go in there and I see all these plants and I get a feeling from these things like they're alive like they're conscious felt so weird to this day I missed that feeling I go up man what do we it was that was I so high I was hallucinating is it or is it possible that if you get really high on pot and then you go around the pot leaves you pick up their frequency and you understand that they're a living organism and that's one of the reasons why they make you feel so good when you get high like one of the reasons why you're interact you're interacting with whatever they are with the molecules the THC and the cannabinoids you're interacting with it and then when you go around the actual potted plants and they're all super healthy because they got this crazy hydroponic setup and they're all the right nutrients and these blush green plants and it's perfect environment for growing because you know they're experts yeah and I'm like these things are alive man these things like their and they know you're there they're like huh was a successful trip oh yeah man I was I I took me hours before I knew what I was doing afterwards yeah hours later I just loved how he took the onus of an excuse off of you oh yeah you look sick that's the moment I was sick looks you need some medicine and crazy dreadlocks and circular glasses he was amazing god I wish I kept in touch with that good doctor he was a great doctor I've had a a bunch of good weed doctors I had one of them though I had to stop going he went crazy 911 on me what does that mean he when he was trying to tell me that the towers were brought down by Tesla technology and I was like what he's like concrete doesn't vaporize so no I was like what do you mean vaporize I said try new baby but like how like you know you hear my white privilige and everything I go one of the things about white privilege people really think about that much is you're allowed to have any conspiracy theory you want I can't be like 9/11 was an inside job Jeff fuel can't melt steel beams they're like whatever Achmed sure thing Aladdin understand right yeah that's different yeah yeah if you looked at the pie chart of people that are really into conspiracies and like looked at race white would be overwhelming would it be like the pie chart of conspiracy theorists yeah I don't know like 3/4 of the pie chart white people yeah just it would sound absurd coming from me like I don't believe that but imagine if I'm like 9/11 wasn't yeah it was a brown guy like you're like Cher thing you're not getting off that easy yeah yeah it's you you work for Boeing's I would you do yeah what did you do over there I was engineer anyways you were involved 9/11 right what did you train those pilots you gave me yeah did you do would you do it Boeing I did stress analysis I were the floor beam it's a very unglamorous the thing with like it's kind of cool though I guess so me bona fide smart yeah I mean I'm able to jump through hoops with a goal in mind like I have a high threshold for academic pain so I took a lot of math I took a lot of it wasn't that hard for me was like I mean it's difficult to get the degree but alright they do these steps you get this number there's this formula you have the tools right they show you how to do it monkey see monkey do interesting way to describe you have a high threshold for academic pain cuz it is like a little painful right I think just it seems so daunting to the average person and they just don't wanna be bothered with that to even get over the hump of learning something like that there's like I could never right that's for brainiacs right but the thing is engineering was a means to an end for me to do stand-up comedy like my parents we're gonna pay for my college but only certain degrees so at first cuz I knew I wanted to do stand-up when I was like 17 really yeah yeah what how did you know I think two things happen so I didn't grow up with stand-up I didn't really know it was a thing was on my radar I grew up with The Simpsons SNL and and like Conan late-night Conan those were those are my Jam's I feel like that's my comedy DNA but then I was seventeen twenty seventeen birthday we rented delirious so we watched delirious Eddie Murphy's delirious you know just fuck it was like the greatest thing in the world and that just planted the seed of comedy so that coupled with my love for SNL and I'm like how do I like I don't know if Google was around even or maybe I don't know I just research how do people get on SNL maybe Google was around so I saw they came from two camps they were either stand-ups or they came from improv so like Second City UCB Groundlings this was like the pedigree these are the schools they picked from and then I researched those schools they were in Chicago LA New York you had to pay money to take these classes you may not pass you have to go back to 101 or whatever so it's like it's a school mm-hmm and stand-up is just you it's just you out there was like a sword you know yeah so I like I'm like oh I could do that and there's comedy clubs in Seattle I can count on me like I don't have to rely on other people to like zip that Zoop with each other it was a great thing you know I'm not like knocking or anything it's just it's such a different you dedicate your life talk one or the other I think it's very hard to be great at both and there's not a lot of career paths for improv do is a certain spot and that's it like there's some people who are very very talented in Groundlings in like UCB and then how do they monetize that if they booked a commercial they're still beholding to a lot of other people they have to be the right guy or girl the right look there's so many variables that are outside of your control as a talented improv performer but as a stand-up you could do a weekend we can always make money yeah once you get to a certain level famous like in terms of going on the road as an improv guy I guess whose line is it anyway guys do yeah but you you'll have to maybe they'll they'll start doing stand-up cuz they've built some you'll see that right they'll build some credibility like a notoriety and they come from the improv background but if they want to start making some money on the road they start doing stand-up but they're no better off than someone like a 22 year old doing stand-up now cuz you got to put the hours in just because you're good at this other thing you still have to start over right it's like the farm yeah yeah exactly you gotta you can't the beauty of stand-up is you can't skip steps it's so when you see comic on stage it's like when you cut a tree open and you see all the rings you can just tell like oh this guy's been doing it 20 years yes you can't fake that yeah so I chose to do stand-up because it was just me out there and I could rely on me and I could do it while I do engineering school so I chose engineering because like I knew I wanted to do this stuff so I thought I needed a theater degree so I was like can I do theater my dad like no you can't do the it or and then it kept getting more and more watered down I was like can I do like directing no you can't do direct they told you what you can and can't do yeah and I loved it in hindsight I'm so grateful I don't dude if I had a theater degree right now I'd be fucked if anyone's watching and you have a theater degree or you're thinking about getting a theater degree don't do it you don't need it you're not going to be Jude Law because you have a theater degree you could do it on the side think of how many people have come to LA or New York it's a different thing okay look if you're at Juilliard and this instrument or whatever and it's like a top top top theater school and it's a feeder to like that world okay or if you're the son of like a huge actor or daughter sure but if you're like in I don't know Ohio and you're going to theater to school you're just lighting your parents money on fire that's all you're doing they're letting you like go on a twenty-year old jungle gym for four years what the thing is like you see sometimes like an actor like or rather like an athlete or someone will be an actor in a movie and they'll do a fucking amazing job here's okay like Oprah here's an exact color purple the highest-paid actor is the rock what theater school Dwayne the rock Johnson go to the theater of hard knocks thank you so you might as well do wrestling as opposed to so it doesn't theater degree does not equal acting job right but that's a different kind of acting then say like Jake Gyllenhaal or sure I mean yeah do you think you're learning that at all like here's the other thing too that I always thought was so interesting because I did act in class for two months when I was here in LA you know just a trying out and stuff it wasn't for me and what's funny is like they'll be teaching these techniques and like Meisner and tapping in a little blah and then at the end of the class they'll be like all right does anybody have any sides they want any auditions they want to go over and it's all just CSI interrogation jobs like I don't know the guy so you're like you're teaching Shakespeare in class and anything anyone's ever going out for is like oh yeah I used to come around here like two times a week wait how is I am back pentameter helping you with that's that's what you're right and you're chomping at the bit to get this long order a CSI delivery guy number two why are you learning Meisner right and I know there are no bit parts only bit actors and all that was it true no that's what after that so that's what acting teachers would love to tell you when you complain about getting a bit part like that they go there are no bit parts only bit actors and then you go I want to be bit actor I'm happy to be a tree well there's certain comics will tell you there are no bad crowds those people are assholes sure I think we've been the thing is if you're a younger comic and you're you're like the crowd sucked you don't have the bandwidth to know what's good and bad yet not yet so you can say that I can say that like we've all seen bad crowd sure yeah and we can chalk it up for what it is but if you're a year n or two years in right it was Moe it was probably you yeah not audible or just like adjusting on the fly or you're not very good yeah maybe that too I'm sure sure that's a there's a weird thing about comics where there's certain comics where you know there's no way they're gonna figure it out I don't know though because I mean as a whole yes but there are I hear there's anomalies of that like if I would hear stories my Sebastian which is so crazy because I wasn't there for that timeline of one but he's killing it he's so funny you know and he's like the guy now well he was never terrible okay so you're talking about like no I remember Sebastian in the beginning he was never terrible he was learning I see but he was he showed up all the time and he was always a nice guy and he's like he wasn't terrible he just didn't do great in the beginning I think people just take liberties with that story then and they make it sound like ya know he was never offensively unfunny right certain people that are offensively unfunny we like there's not a chance you're missing the DNA like you just can't you're colorblind you're you're missing it whatever it is you you don't have it yeah water I mean that's the beauty I would hear mitzi stories of her just telling people like you're terrible you never met her huh no I got there when Tommy was it was around and it was kind of so she was still she was like sick you know and he would say it's he saw your tape and I don't know if you I know I know I know yeah so he would always just like have this buffer between yeah like mitzi and myself and over for Kenda Mitsy was she became like what's the guy's name from psycho Norman Bates was like 'mom I was in the fucking shower but it was really him you know yeah like his mom's dead and he would put the wig on yeah that was Tommy Tommy put the mitts you wear go on he would always like do her voice that stuff and like when give me free yeah man dude like cuz he would expunge wisdom and uh cuz I remember I would drive up from Boeing that was my so I was working in Long Beach oh yes I got engineering degree right and then I just applied to jobs I did mechanical engineering because my best friend was doing mechanical and I was like I don't care what engineering I do I just I'll be close but to my friend and you were just doing that so you could have a job for myself it was such a long con it's like all right I knew I wanted to do stand-up in the meantime I got to go to college right I've got to be able to support so I can get good in Seattle really funny man I guess people don't do that life's a long time if you're lucky you know yeah and it's okay to have to plan this far out it sounds far-fetched maybe if I told it to someone at the time but in hindsight it was the most beautifully executed plan so great yeah so I did stand-up while I was going to college my life was just school by day stand-up at night it would actually be stand-up on the weekends cuz I was living at home and it's 40 minutes to the club so I would just do a lot of time on Friday and Saturday did your parents know yeah they knew and it was bad it was like doing heroin like they were against it just I feel now my mom has I took her to the premiere I had a small role in whiskey-tango-foxtrot this Tina Fey movies so I took her to the premiere in New York and so she got to be on the red carpet and like take pictures of Tina Fey and so she she was in she was in after that and she keeps on a species like when's the next premiere there was an after party and everyone's milling about and then my mom's like there's Tina Tina's at the like introduced me I'm like yeah okay okay mom cuz I'm like my mom's a sweetheart but I'm I'm still caught in his showbiz thing like I'm what number 15 on the call sheet or I'm married yeah yeah I don't even know she remembers me even though the movie you know so I'm like I got to pick my spot and then she just kind of like nudges me like a linebacker she's like pushes me in the penis I'm like oh but it was great to have the out of my mom be like my mom is such a huge fan and she's like oh you have course and she was a sweetheart so now she's in she's in she's like you made it you're you're yeah or she could see the light at the end of the tunnel like right would why your dad my dad my dad is kind of more nuts and bolts he doesn't he doesn't like get fooled by the clips in the glam or anything like that he just understands money and things like I've had a nice car if I don't want them you'd be fuckin soul did okay but no get a Tesla yeah I guess so I think what what has softened him a little bit because I just got this place in Tarzana like a house and that's like real adult shit so I didn't realize that would kind of soften him a bit because how will you know thirty five so he's like wow he's a real adult I guess so yeah do you have a girlfriend no so when you get married you think I don't know if he cares about than Ally I think it does I think like that cares more about the security like like a real career right income and a house and stability when the comedy was never there and then also aside from just those things you know they're from Afghanistan so it's a low in my dad's opinion it's kind of a low thing stick comedies like a low thing for someone to be doing like oh yeah like low like subhuman like a giant sold-out theater I don't know maybe who knows but line of people waiting to see you I guess I don't know what that thing will be but he would he would always say cuz we would you know be in shouting matches when we were younger oh yeah yeah I mean look I love my parents and I know what it was grounded in I think they just they didn't want me to be eating out of a dumpster so they were just they were there I mean most my dad his frustration and lashing out or just like and not like physical anything just saying you know like you're throwing your life away blah blah blah it was cuz he wanted that security for me yeah I understand it for what it is when I was like 17 or 18 yeah you know you don't get me right yeah like I just feel so I know that I'm older I get it I get where he's coming from right yeah so never thought the point was but I think now I have a little more stability well we say um like they like you're out there every night with the pimps and the prostitute pimp at the Comedy Store yeah I might have seen one or two processors over the last 20 years out there every night pimps in the prostitutes that was his line you should talk about this on stage he didn't like my last special I taught I tell that story I talk I talk about this story with my dad and he would always trot that out they're not half wrong he's half wrong he's I've seen a couple processes sure but that's my god longer than no pimps okay for 30 years I've seen maybe two or three processes the whole front row is just like fur coats oh I'm like campaigns Oh Oh big diamond rings that he would say people should be entertaining you that would be the thing like I should be the one entertained because you're intelligent I guess so you're in a serious person yeah yeah I like I'm just found like if you want to make broad strokes I think in the Middle Eastern community it's um like they love art but their kids shouldn't be doing it they should they should be consumers of art but what are interesting but what if you were like a famous painter classical painter I guess no one no parent really thinks best case scenario for their kid like what people buy is art it's always like it's a pipe dream what are the odds bubble blah yes throwing your life away and I guess there is some trick that statistically sure oh yes sure but I think like what I would do different when I have kids or whatever I would I would explain the realities of how you know the whole theatre degree thing I'm so glad they made me do a degree with teeth because that allowed me to have a legitimate job to get me out here I'm not a trust fund kid or how else would I be close to where I needed to be and you'd be here up there in Seattle oh so they're still they're still there yeah yeah so so I would have some practicality I'd be like I'll pay for college get a get a legitimate degree where there's an actual job outlook at the end mm-hmm like I'm not paying you to find yourself when did you quit the job like 2010 2010 2009 so right when you came to this store right around so some things happen like I was working at Boeing for three and a half years and I would just work by day and I would drive drive up to Hollywood and like the valley by night I was burning the candle at both ends oh you must been tired all the time I was well especially at first because I didn't little lay of the comedy land I was just going I thought everything was worth my time or you don't know until you do it so I would do some like shitty open mic drive off like a backyard shows that what that wasn't a thing really that wasn't a thing yet as of late you know what's so funny is like the progression of the all-team is that first it was in weird spots like a washing order to go laundromat and then it was like a meltdown and then living rooms were a big thing living room shows and then backyards were hot oh yeah I want to do or it's like the hottest all show it's called crawlspace well let mean everyone's just on their belly you do really funny one on one sketches that you do like you play more than one role oh thanks I'm on your Instagram like super bored during the day and you like I always wanted to ask you know why I do all my stuff yeah all right so it's almost just some of the stuff I do is just a byproduct of I don't know being creatively backlogged so I love stand-up and I love sketch those come to me naturally sometimes people be like you have a movie script or like you know what's what's your sitcom mmm and that's just more work there's a scaffolding there that if I was teamed up with someone who understands that world maybe you'd be a little more easy but I don't want to bang my head against a wall to understand a format where stand-up and sketch just like come to me right so that's why I lean into that so stand-up has been a thing I've been doing for like 17 years I feel like I've developed at sketch I started doing I did it like I think eighth I was I grew up through it like um I would do funny videos in school like video productions back in the day when you had two VCRs this is before like avid so you'd like jog shuttle you have two tapes your mixdown tape and your raw tape so you would actually like make sketches on a VHS cassette so I was always into that because I loved SNL you know so and then you know you stopped doing it I'm doing stand-up and then I moved to LA and I'm not getting on stage that much because it's so saturated here it's so scented the biggest market here in New York although I think it's easier to get on stage as a stand-up in New York here you have to deal with actors and there's a real bottleneck so I wasn't getting up a lot but I'm a creative guy I have all these ideas and I had this idea for this video I'm like how to attend an Afghan wedding or whatever so and I was gonna I was trying to get people to help me out and shoot it and then you were a runt no one really gives a fuck like if you can't do anything for anybody when you first come out here it's just sort of like and not on a mean ways just the nature of the wilderness like why am I gonna you're on a proven thing there's really no upside so you get a lot of but yeah I'll help you and then flake so I rewrote it to just do it all in my apartment so I just filmed this video this YouTube video I wasn't even on YouTube yet though it was um I did this video called how to attend an Afghan wedding or something we're just called an Afghan wedding I put it on MySpace and it kind of does well it kind of takes off a little bit and then my brother was like oh you should put on YouTube like it wasn't a bit kotas to put stuff on YouTube yet I was like oh yeah okay I'll put on YouTube to put on YouTube it kind of makes the rounds on there too and that was just kind of like the nudge I needed like oh I'm good I could do this and I could do this while I'm waiting to get stage time mmm so this was another avenue for me I do stand-up and then I do sketches and this was in the heyday of YouTube when there was an appetite for YouTube sketch like indie YouTube sketch just funny guys and there's just different sketch groups and everything don't think there's an appetite for that now not anymore no why not it's become bite-sized no one wants to watch sketch on you like stand alone people wanna watch makeup blogs didn't to watch pranks but how do you know I know cuz like do you know cuz I've uploaded you see the downturn there was a time is it because now it's Instagram is everything's more bite-sized so so i'ma sketchy I love fully-formed and really taking my time like and me my buddy Aristotle like he's really talented filmmaker and director I think I just left Boeing and I had this idea for this American History X type sketches Domino it's called Domino's and he and I did it and we put it out there and it was beautiful like it's just one of my favorite sketches we've done and so I just kept on doing sketch and there was an appetite for it and then it started to drop off like there wasn't a lot of viewership now YouTube sketch will only work if it was on TV the night before like if it's a key and Peele sketch that made it inside a me or like a Tonight Show sketch or key but the only way it'll make the rounds is if it the sketch was on TV and then has the potential to do well in the internet just a born-and-bred sketch on the internet doesn't take off anymore Instagram does so I just have all these ideas and I always write them down on my phone and Instagram those like a little one on ones is a way to get those ideas out in a very not precious way mmm and it's just idea driven and people respond to it you know so it's just more of like well let me get this idea out of my head so when you write do you sit down and force yourself in front of a notepad or a computer back in the day like when I was first doing stand-up I had two methods I would I would have the jokes that would just come to me and then I would like sit down and try to manufacture jokes you know like all right all right brain what's funny what's funny about the world right and I would come up with some stuff but I always found the things that always work the best were the stuff that just like came out of the ether it just came to me mmm and then eventually I got to the point where enough I would get enough of those ideas where I didn't have to sit down and write so all I had to do is just be good about capturing what I'm receiving so I have my phone with me all the time back Monday I had a marble notebook and all that but like phones of advance so much I've ever note I mean we do yeah so whenever I get an idea regardless of what the proper medium for it is I'll get an Instagram video idea I'll get a fully fully formed sketch idea where I need like production value a sitcom idea or a stand-up idea I have different notes for each of them and I've just trained myself my brain is wired a certain way where I just catch the butterflies just put the bucket under sponsor don't sit down no I just I'll get the idea I'll jot down as many words as I need to capture it maybe I'll say something happens we go to I don't know we go to the lake or something and then like we go hunting I get three ideas about hunting this many words to capture this not this many wars to capture like separated by commas so I have it do you record your sets yeah I'll record them do you listen to the recordings I do well it depends like if I'm doing a hot night at the store that's kind of like the hits and I'm not gonna learn a lot from the hits right when I want to work on stuff I'll tell Adam at the store when I call in my veils I go up late on Tuesday or Wednesday whichever one I get mm-hmm Isis basically asked to go late so that there's a Harvard yeah there's no pressure there's like 10 people trying to sober up I'm on my phone and it's not like this because they wanted to pact oh are it's kind of like a what do you got right like I paid this much money I got a hot date with me blah blah it's a different show Joey Diaz started getting angry about it about what but you can't practice well you can yeah you just have to choose different time slots or choose different shows to do it on there's new material nights I love those like Neal Brennan has one at Westside that's one of my favorite shows to do Jeff Harris has one so you have this new material shows but I'll just if you choose to do a later time slot it might be different for you because you're such a draw but I'm nobody you know I got a cusper right now so I can just do late night but I just think you just sandwich those new bits in between obits you can but if you just want the total mental freedom of just like throw spaghetti against the wall right and not and in a professional way because if if I'm doing a hot show and I'm trying to a sandwich it can still put the brakes a little bit oh yeah and you know I don't need that I'm not Joe Rogan yeah yeah but that's that's where it's that's where it's at I mean I find my way out of it by putting when it hits the brazier you panic and then you find a way out and sometimes that's where you find a punchline sometimes not sure I deal with the 5 out of 10 mm-hmm 5 out of 10 are gonna eat shit I was a 10 it's almost like being a baseball manager I have my a string my B string so if I'm doing like a hot show and I want to work on a bead so there's different levels of bits that I can polish I'm not gonna throw a d-a-d in there it's the primetime baby yeah right D is for was 1:40 a.m. DS got no pressure DS got a lot of potential do you Jeremiah show I love the show yeah yeah dude I love shows where the audience knows the expectation is like you're a fly on the wall in the process yeah and so pre-recorded or pre-planned material yeah there's so much goodwill yeah yeah yeah yeah because you don't get that one it's just like a shell show I've come up with four or five legitimate bits that have wound up on specials because I'm Josh oh yeah yeah it's almost like a stand up float tank yeah it's a great little workshop all right what's what's this idea what's that and it's also because everybody knows that you're doing that so it's kind of more fun and also if you hit a dead end that's funny because they know they know the theme of the show yeah so let squishy would do it more often he's only doing it like once a month yeah once a week man I don't know maybe they know their what their sweet spot is I don't think they do mmm I think the sweet spots once a week yeah yeah I think it's totally possible do that show once a week yeah yeah I love those shows when was it the first time your parents saw you on stage um oh you know what this is so funny this is kind of so this is like a last bit on my special I talk about it like this see me once once ever yeah really yeah did you bomb oh yeah in the word in the biggest way oh oh oh my god oh yeah I mean do you want to hear the story fuck yeah I do okay so this is just a rehash of like the last thing so the last thing I said um I closed my special with this so I'm like 17 I'm like 17 or 18 I'm at college there's a bulletin board and it says like Apollo amateur night on tour right so there's a flyer like the Apollo is going on tour and you can audition and I have the Apollo Theater yeah Obama Theater yeah yeah so they're going all these major cities right so like interesting especially I'm just getting maybe a year in or if you want into stand-up this could be a great opportunity isn't it funny we loved a level delusion you have as a young comic yeah yeah we like I'm ready yeah they gotta hear what I got to say I've been doing this for a few months so I take the you know take the little tab I have it I get all the info I go there it's in Seattle so I go there to audition I forget where they're holding the audition this this is like theatre or whatever so I'm sitting there's three hundred forty two people just like wait it's like American Idol pretty much and there's like a bunch of like older black ladies singing I believe I can fly under their breath like just cuz they're mostly singers so leave this here like we didn't do my jokes later oh my go ray Ming so finally it's my time to go so I go out there I do my stand-up set and it does well like it does genuinely well it wasn't like a let's feed him to the Sharks like I did well like I made them laugh you know so I find out I get selected I think I'm one of eleven one of a woman who gets elected so I'm like sweet and then I invite everyone I'm like mom dad everyone from school and shit oh yeah everyone it's at it's at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle have you been there yeah what is that four thousand it's big play four thousand five thousand people something like maybe three thousand whatever it's in a thousand don't big place yeah it's one of our nicest theaters yeah so it's going right everyone and then knocked oh it's packed oh oh my god so I do the dress rehearsal I do the dress rehearsal blog of emotions lady comes up to me she's like all the producers great the producer of the show thinks like you should do this bit before sort of your hip-hop stuff like do this bit first and there's like this big wide is talk about being Afghan or something you know oh my god okay whatever it like I'm so new I just trust the producer I'm like I guess they know so I rearranged my set just based on the producers request comes down to the show everyone staple blah it's my time to like they introduced me well you know please welcome a man where I come out oh my name is Raheem the it's like an Afghan or like Middle Eastern Afghan to be exactly is like boom boom am I out there for maybe 20 seconds it's such an interesting sensation to be booed by them many people so just like it starts cascading like and I've seen Apollo I know how it works and you hear they like though all right I don't need to get swept off like I know how this works so I get booted off you get booted off just from talking about being a half can maybe I don't know maybe it just really sucked maybe it's cuz it was like close to 9/11 and I talked about being Afghan whatever I get I get booed you know I mean I'm sure it sucked balls to whatever I was about to say was gonna like be so bad so I was gonna get booed regardless but I lasted maybe 15 seconds 15 20 seconds so I'm just like shell-shocked and then I'm just chillin in the hallway there's there was a desk there was a you know like an old school student desk where it's like l-shape and they have the basket it's just in the stairwell for some reason so I just sit I just sit in that chair I felt like I was in a video game or something because that's not a human experience really that many people get to go through some just trying to make sense of what happened in the world and my wife moving forward it's a lot going on oh it's a lot going on you know and then you know I get up again I myself I go up the stairwell I get my things from you know I have to see everyone else and the great oh the worst see everyone in the green room area get my shit I get my car and I think I Drive home my parents they take a separate car right and then I hear the rest of the story for my brother so they're all in the Dodge Caravan my cousin Neil oh my brother my dad my mom is just silent on the car ride home like no one's talking cuz I mean you know they saw what they saw so no one's saying anything and then obviously my dad my dad's like wouldn't be thrilled about me doing standard to begin with right so he he breaks the silence he goes well there's no business like show business insight like I think that's why when I want them to come out I want it to be like such a polar opposite experience and obviously I've come a long way from then but I'm almost grateful that it did happen because you know when comics trade bomb stories I fucking win every time and to me for me to be so young like seventeen and come back from that that means like there's really something like a fire in me like I was meant to do this or I really love stand-up because that's not a pleasurable experience to potentially think that could happen again you know now they've seen you on television did they show me yeah they think you're special was good yeah I think so I never know like my mom will tell me but I never know what my dad catches and what was the last time you worked in Seattle did you do the parlor go under like a few months ago I think fucking-a yeah so the pool hall part is gone too I think so fuck yeah you like to play there yeah it was a great gig and play pool and do me that's your jam oh my god it's like you design yeah that's how design a club yeah yeah so it's weird I mean I could have them come out to another where they have there now what's the club I don't know I think mostly see ah no they have um giggles or whatever in the university district or maybe it's called laughs it's called laughs it's where giggles used to be so they'd only have like one comedy club and all the comma they have to coma you know that's crazy man but these aren't Seattle fuck man Seattle used to be a scene yeah God fuckin parlor Live was a great club how did it go under yeah Bryan Callen [Laughter] sure the man who broke the parlour fucking ruined it bro yeah yeah so when your parents come to see you will they come to see you in LA or they come oh no I haven't you haven't decided I put on the back burner for I mean I guess if I do the Tonight Show I mean I've been to already 20 years later you know you've got to come see you live uh yeah yeah what should i do I don't know invite him to a show yeah I don't know what you know pretend they're at the first show and then bring them to the second show yeah just to mentally prepare yeah yeah you obviously have a little bit of a block you're thinking about it yeah not a block but it's a it's a thing oh for sure yeah they saw you eat shit yeah and especially when they were so anti that yes and but you were right and they were wrong this is how it works I mean my parents never yelled at me that I can't do comedy or else waste of my life or the I be there with pimps and prostitutes I mean I love my parent we have a great relationship this was just kind of like one one thing that was incongruent in the relationship almost no parents think their child is going to make it as a computer it is the most it's the most impossible to imagine success business that you could ever think your kids gonna go into no there's no like we were talking about stand-up that none of this is written down right talking about the principles to stand up there's no course you can take it doesn't exist yeah any class is usually taken by someone who's not very successful at stand-up for the most part yeah I don't know of any successful it could give Chris rocks not out there teaching now in class it can give you the confidence to like jump off the cliff yes but outside of that you're not going to learn but but here's the thing all these principles that were taught me think about look comedy is obviously a viable art form in a large-scale venue I mean I just got done doing two arenas this weekend right so we're talking about something that is right up there with music or even with sports I mean it's large-scale enormous people yet there's no real like pathway that's written down there's no real principles of it that are universally assumed by all people who participate in the art form yeah whereas almost like if you learn music you learn chords and chord progression you learn you learn how to use your diaphragm you learn how to sing and learn how to play instruments and you learn how to make a chorus and there's none of that for us I think it was just such a foreign I can understand where they're coming from because it's such an important concept if you get an engineering degree or a doctor you do a B you get C there's a blueprint for it you know stand-up is just so nebulous or just like the arts in general is just sort of like you can't tell someone what like your path to success is gonna be different than Ian's path to mind or and you kind of learned that as a comic as well early on because I think there's a little bit of impostor syndrome like like somebody else get something you feel like it's an attack on you but you do it long enough you realize like oh everyone's journey is so different well not in a hippie dippie way yeah but like your relationships are different than mine they're different so everyone hits at different times yeah and it's not right or wrong it's just life and nature you know yeah you're you're different than everybody else you just gotta concentrate on doing your best and figure out yeah what you can learn from other people's success and failures but don't think of it as your own success or failure yeah and eyes on your own paper yeah I wouldn't want my kids to do comedy my kids look we do whole arias Lee hypocritical if one of my kids was like I want to be a comedian like listen you're not gonna be a fucking comedian stop yeah I think where I differ with my parents is if they want to do something in the arts I'd be like have at it like I support you I want it to work out yeah but kind of have a foundation work on that I don't want to send you to do communications for four years yeah there's no school for it yeah stand-up school here's the school have a shitty childhood well adjusted I had like that maybe that's why I hurt so much maybe like I gave them everything you still did it yeah that's funny you might be one of the rare guys I think new breed where there's people obviously you know there is more what just well-adjusted yeah I don't know those peoples ago even level-headed guys what about no well I don't know if it got what fuck out of here everyone everyone is fucked up to some degree yes yeah so that's why they're comics sure yeah but every no matter who anybody you pluck off of Earth Dada yeah yes so this is a universal truth but usually some kind of fucked up childhood is a prerequisite it helps it's like the whole fuel its fuel it's like there's fires that come from good childhoods - yeah you know I would have this it's a dumb thought but I would have it as a kid trying to do stand-up and not have to face this wall of I don't know you know my parents not wanting me to do it oh my god man I kind of wish I had like a like a words childhood or like not middle class because then it wouldn't we to be questioned it would just be like yeah of course what is he gonna do well I was really healthy when I was young because I was a martial artist I was competing all the time I always worked out and I always thought me if I was a drug addict I probably funnier I really used to think that way because like guys who did drugs like Kinnison and Pryor that drug problems yeah so fun like I mean you've been doing it for a long time so maybe you have a better perspective on this I think like back in the day with the doing drugs and all that part of that did that help like it was it image like how in terms of just seeing the comedy for what it is was it part it being new rock star stuff drugs so you didn't have to be as tight as say like nowadays because there's so many more comedians no Tigers wildness to it there's wildness to it like I think the funniest guy of all time is Joey Diaz one of the reasons why he's the funniest guy of all time is the wildness but he's truly why yeah like in you know it's great watching him like in the Oh are especially in 2019 you can tell he doesn't know so you came at him a time if she heard he's like Encino man I know our people they're horrified and so happy at the same yes I think even the locust people when they're watching Joey and there's just this energy and people are laughing so hard you like your altruism can't break through that you can't deny what's happening right now right so it kind of makes you I guess reassess what you're supposed like I shouldn't be laughing at this it's it's a weird time for comedy but in that weird time you're gonna get some of the best stuff because it's like supercharged yeah I was like as it was it when it does get through if you can cover all the bases and make your argument soundly and logically and also have it be funny I'll see birdie that all the time and like Joey's just such a force of nature yeah it's you don't have time to like think about is this woke or is just knee-jerk yours rolling burr will kind of just like throw out this crazy premise that no one no sane person would be on like especially guys on dates well you just hear some of these arguments or whatever yeah she'll just throw it out there and he won't steamroll over he'll just let it simmer and that's my favorite because like he's methodically surgically taking his time to proving the point of this argument well a lot of these arguments I would suspect that he's having at home of his wife his wife woman yeah and she's feminist I mean what a cool woman too you know what I mean it's like yeah so he has to formulate really well-thought-out arguments I would imagine I mean maybe he would but you know he's obviously thinking these through yeah like this is not it's not he's not flippant about these points of view these perspectives yeah yeah so just throw like a piece of Bologna on the kitchen nails when it when he nails it man it's like so much more satisfying even in the past because it's like you're you're you're making your way through the rockiest stretch of the river and I think those are the most rewarding bits as comedians the longer you've been doing it like I could be silly and get a joke and sure that's fun but it's it's not that rewarding as if you have an argument like burn or something was just countered counterculture and you can methodically it's like going through the laser field right that's way more rewarding than just walking down the hallway right like Mission Impossible and all those lasers are protecting the diamond yeah what kind of movie is ever just one thousand apples right exactly yeah it's a it's an interesting time to get these ideas out there but you see by the reaction of the comic store the people are looking forward to it because I think they feel the same way like goddammit everything's going so far and so many people are so goddamn sensitive about so many different things it's not about intent they're just looking at magic words and and buzz words and words are off limits there's no such thing as context anymore or intention no and you get that at The Comedy Store and I think it's the last place people are talking this freely yes because I used to think all right we've been in a little bit of a resurgence would stand up and like all the specials and all that I'm like are gonna burst I'm like all cool I'm gonna get to miss to comedy bubbles sweet but then think so yeah but then it's proven wrong like it's getting bigger and bigger yeah it's good yes why it was a bubble when it sucked let me tell you about the bubble over the 1980s there was a bunch of people that had a kind of way of talking about things so I got a cat in my room and the mouse was like Wild Kingdom in my house nah it was a way of talking there was a comedy way of talking that these guys did there was some guys that just were not insightful and they just did comedy in a way that they had heard people do comedy so they kind of just like mimic the sounds it's like you ever heard a band that sounds exactly like maybe Stone Temple Pilots and like that but they're not really like they're close like so weird they so much like so I don't know if you remember guerrilla black no he sounded exactly like notorious b.i.g no well yeah fuck is that guerrilla black yeah really like when I heard it I'm like are we doing this so oh yeah it was insane yeah I watched a comic one night at in 1993 or something like that on stage in Montreal at Just for Laughs and he was basically doing a Richard Pryor impression and I was like what in the fuck am I seeing it's like this guy was doing prior I mean everything about his set he was doing prior like this is so strange to see that people do that well that that was a part of the bubble in the bubble there was these guys who would wear the clothes they thought a comedian would wear and say the things and there was so much work and there was so many there were so many clubs and there were so many evening at The Improv 's and all these different little show anyone to get a piece yeah mimic the part - there was a lot of people back then that were arrogant that were working and they were headliners and they were arrogant they were fucking terrible and I really enjoyed watching them fall off to face the earth you know I'll tell you some have towards but the other names I was gonna tell you yeah but these these people were doing comedy in a they weren't participating in an art form they were mimicking they were mimicking the people that were participating in the art form like love him or hate him Jerry Seinfeld's an artist oh yeah I do too but he's an artist his style whether you think I've heard criticisms that he's not deep enough he doesn't talk about sex or anything dangerous whatever he likes what he likes he likes to talk about certain likes a certain style of comedy and he's an as a master at that style but he spawned so many babies what Patrice O'Neal would call babies like Patrice O'Neal like would say like hey man you got a lot of babies out there there's a lot of people that are imitating you you got babies then there was a lot of like Dave Attell perfect oh yeah got a shitload of babies there's a lot had a lot of babies yes Dane had a Mitch Hedberg Irish channel yeah see a lot ton of babies yeah there's a few people that mimic but during the 80s it was there was a few innovative people and a lot of babies it was like there was ten babies to everyone innovator and you had these like fake headliners and they would show up in town but they had those premises that everybody had they had those beats that everybody had they talked in the same way they didn't take any chances they were shooting straight down the middle and that was the bubble and that all went away that all went away and when that went away those guys died off and there was people that were left over the people that were left over were the actual comics the actual people that were good enough where people would repeatedly go to see them at clubs they wrote a lot they they practice they were they were interested in the actual art form itself and I was really fortunate that I started out in Boston where Boston had a very high standard due to Barry Crimmins really inspect document it was great he's a brilliant he was really a rest in peace Barry loved that guy but he that guy he was one of those guys when when he was nice to me as I got older and you know I was terrified of him terrify to him like him seeing me when I saw her it's terrible I came in so much in well I knew what a high standard he had for comedy and he was one of the main reasons why there was no hacks that were tolerated in Boston and that that you want everybody had to be original everybody had to do good material and everybody sort of policed each other you know and when when you have a community like that you you get to see the artform flourish in a very good way and we we had a lot of like different people they were different but they were all like really high level so we would get these guys that would come in from out of town Road guys there were babies there were Seinfeld babies or difficult and you would see how poor they looked when they were surrounded by these original murderers so you'd have like guys like Steve Sweeney and Lenny Clark would go on stage and then one of these babies would go up after him and just eat blades of shit why are they going after they had a terrible system in Boston that was really mean and it was designed to make new designed to make national headlines pom oh really yes yes they would pay them a lot of money to book them at a club and they would book them on a show with three local headliner sellers and these local headliners would just fucking straight-up murder and they would do all this local Boston stuff that made everybody excited and then they would have one of these guys who was used to going to Cleveland hey I was just in Indianapolis had a great time did a little comedy yeah that's what I do I'm a comedian and they would go up there and just eat plates of shit and get booed off the stage and people would leave and they were they would do it on purpose teach him a lesson or some no no they were just mean like those guys never first of all those come those comics never left Boston okay and they would murder almost every night and they were all animals there doing coke and they weren't drinking they were fucking savages they'd pay them in coke really no bullshit yeah Nick's calm me stop used to pay people in Coke yes didn't pay me in Coke I never did correct but I knew of the whole deal everybody knew the deal and so when these guys would come in from out of town they would be angry at these guys and they're like who's this fucking guy he's got evening at The Improv I don't have that show he's on the fucking movie with Billy Crystal fuck him and they would go on for those guys and light him on fire light them on fire who's dictating this line at the club club there are coats so it's just fun for them and they would they would do it on purpose ain't gonna cool you but some guys would survive like I saw die my rera in that environment but Dom murdered yeah that was the thing Dom murdered so he would go there and he would talk about how strong the lineup was you know is amazing this is great but he would go up a murder because he was a real comic so Dom was there pre bubble during the bubble post bubble he's a comic I mean those are the best guys yes funny guys who take funny guys on the road with them yes because not everyone does that well yeah you know wrinkle panic yeah they want like the best comics are like almost want funny - yes I want a great show you know the reason why I take Ian or Santino or I always took Joey Diaz before he got too big you know Joey Diaz selling out the Chicago theater fucking murder in it but all those guys Ari and Duncan I there I want to have fun I want to be with comics I want I want this show to be great I don't want to be the only one that's funny that's gross right and I think it's a way to discover new comics as well cuz I was I was opening for Neil for a bit for his tour for most of the dates and it was so fun for me because I got a headline and stuff but I'm not a draw yet so I need to have walk up for whatever the club I'm doing what they need have a comedy on States great you know Madison Wisconsin it's just they have to walk up they just have a trust with the community they all just come to shows oh yeah it's great or like Comedy Works in Denver I'm just done comedy on state I heard it's right yeah it's really good there's a theater right next door you probably be doing that like it's so it's fun to do that when they have a walk-up audience like the comedy works like you said Randall Club I'm not a draw yet yeah like in purgatory but the Neal thing was cool because they're all coming for Neal they're theaters I'm just doing 20 minutes which is like I'm shit that no it's nothing you know right cuz I'm like headlining so there's no pressure they're there for Neal I have a great set and you like you know you were funny so you get like fans from his fans too the best and it's a great show as a whole yeah it's like we complement each other so yeah you get two injured and he gets two injury yeah - a funny comment yeah and I'm so grateful that he gets to do that like pull a guy up and and sort of take a little credit for like I don't know yeah no it's great that that's where it's at you know but I don't think this bubbles popping it's too fun yeah it's too good I mean there's too many good people as long as the art form is good the bubble only exists and pops when it's a fake thing like it's a Ponzi scheme that's not really the case right now yeah there's so many good comedians right and everybody's working hard yeah you know everybody realizes that there's a lot of pressure on you so they're all like that's what you were saying like how many sets I do that's why I do somebody's head yeah does the only way to do it I do two sets tonight three sets a night all the time and there's so many outlets now to just kind of what's helping it not pompous yes you have Netflix you have these new streaming like HBO Manus on Amazon and Apple I'm here in a couple days and he's got special yeah and so does Alonzo Bodden his Amazon specials coming out soon and then there's a bunch of other people that have Amazon specials of seeing people advertise them on their Instagram so Amazon is putting together a bunch of specials now which to me is very very exciting because they have the marvelous mrs. Maison yeah one of my favorite shows so I'm just psyched that there's a lot of new venues and then there's new streaming things like who knows maybe Hulu will get into stand-up you know maybe some of these other streaming services will get into stand-up it's great for everybody man it really is this is plenty or there's guys like Andrew Schultz he just exciting trades like as a performer and another comedian and I think everyone has varying degrees of I think angst that he had coming up and I kind of felt that way as well like people have varying degrees of how much the industry fucks with you sometimes I feel in sometimes I don't I don't feel in I do for certain things and and that was just really refreshing just to take the power back yeah and even seeing it happen with I have so many peers in the game like I've known Theo forever yeah we've been puttering around town and doing shows and just you know obscurity and then doing the podcast and and just seeing him take his own fan base and power back and everyone wanted to fuck with him now mm-hmm and and like they weren't they weren't launching that guy you kind of learned to that it's just monkeys picking stocks well a little bit Baroness yeah Theo turned a corner in like two years ago uh-huh well I remember watching him before and my disguise kind of funny he's unique but then two years ago me and Adam were in the bathroom like this for motherfuckers turned a corner like he was just killing it yeah he was just really funny but like a funny in a new way like he had hit something yeah some of the words he uses to disservice but he hit that gear and then everything took off from there it was a lot of it was just hard work yeah persistence hard work and just eventually really clicked I think it was a one-two punch I think I was turning that corner mm-hm and then also just the word to the people democratically just his podcast and and him doing other people's podcast you're sure cuz he's really good on podcast he's just fucking funny Billy yeah and funny and then his own podcast where he just looks right at the camera and he talks about shit yeah and you realize like how is fucking unusual brain work there's funny sometimes you just want to like figure out what this algorithm is or what he's doing and you know this is him I can't ya know you know how would you think to call it that never yeah he's got Theo Comedy for sure but it's like what we're talking about earlier where no one can really teach you how to do comedy like you're you got to figure it out and no one know classically trained comedian if there ever really was one we're never d terrible to you classically trained comedian would be so those babies yeah it would be like those guys that feel like fake Seinfeld's or fake gaffe against or whatever the fuck they are they would yeah the Schultz thing was really cool to see because he just did it on his own yep and it's here's the thing and I wanted to bring this up with you Jimmy is he shadow banned on Instagram tell me what you think is going on because I texted him when that happened cuz I looked it up yes and his name's show up at the top of my list but but he said other people me yeah you wouldn't show her mind really yes I hated change the algorithm I've noticed a few helmet it could be what it could be but there you'll have to take it like a case by case scenario was the person that first sentence him are they already following him do they search his name a lot did they block anything has ever done people have told him hey man I'm having a hard time finding your Instagram page and so he asked me about it and I said what do you mean and I go I'm you I see you right now you're on my feed and he goes no no if you go to search me so he let me search you I know why whoa i search Andrew Schultz nothing I mean a bunch of other people but not him and he's got a lot of followers like good let's do it right now pull it up put it up on screen okay put it up on the screen let's just do it in real time let this part of what I was saying is I follow him so if you're not already found myself in a different way but I do follow him hi oh now just right Andrew and give him some space right space my god in space already right but just space and then it type in his name and it's not coming up right oh that's so sad now hit Search I don't think good you can't search on No Oh on the web but look it's not showing up you see Andrew Scholes fans even when I protect in his account name it didn't show up oh hold on and say it was that Andrew Schultz fans what does that click on that right there below it blow it blow it blow it keep going keep going a blind count there it is that's right click on it I know but it's not so it's his fans I just have made 165 followers and that's crazy right no I know it's not him I'm just trying to figure out what it is so just in that search it's not showing up and it wouldn't show up for me on my phone either now it doesn't make any sense because what does he have like a half a million followers how many followers yeah interesting yeah like he thinks he's being shadow banned what's the are they trying to get some money out of no two hundred eighty two thousand two hundred and eighty two thousand people and he can't find his page Instagram is it Schultz with the T or no just no huh no ulz but it's not showing up it is not showing up on my knee and now we might be being paranoid here and it might be just something in the search algorithm that for whatever reason his thing isn't showing up and he used to say Andrew hesays Schultz I don't know why has he was that nickname of his okay and maybe he thought that Hesse was fucking him up so he took Hesse out of his name in the it on his Instagram page so it just says Andrew Schultz now but even though still you can't find it yeah that's weird you have to type in Andrew Scholes altogether with no space and then you'll find them it that's what I just didn't didn't come up with no space yeah that's why we're just doing in front while you were - asking me to type stuff and I was like oh so you did it with space and no space that's when I did it to him I was like if you're typing in no space that's where the issue is if I'd leave that know if I'd type in all the way is showing up right away and he said well I'm seeing that from people both ways so I go off if that's what you're seeing then I'll go out on a limb and sort of say does your sure one is manipulating that search result because you can't manipulate search trees well here's the thing they do Shadowman people on certain social media platforms this has been revealed through hidden camera conversations with people who are whatever moderators or engineers or people that work behind the scenes on Twitter or Facebook and they they do manipulate algorithms manipulate searches and and Shadowman people and there's a lot of people particularly conservative people which he's not conservative but what he is is you know he's a raunchy comedian and he might have done something that someone felt was not woke or what have you and they want to slow down the broadcasting of a signal that's entirely possible I don't know if it's true though I would love to have a logical explanation that it's the line he's not showing up yes but he's you know he's complaining about it that it's a shadow band anyway go follow Andrew Andrew Schultz yeah s sh u LZ si jouelzy go follow yes I miss Montreal just tell Instagram shadow bands we can get around you bitch he's a marketing genius this is great to hear him talk about you know what he's doing and I got to get around it and it's exciting because you you forget as an artist that you have a lot of power a year everything here you're the product and hmm sometimes especially in the old model you just kind of waited to be anointed well he's got millions and millions of views on his special on YouTube and if you stop and think about if that was on Comedy Central which Comedy Central didn't want to give him special um he probably would get like maybe a million people would watch it when it came out and that would be the end of it I have a special and I don't think people are watching it just YouTube is accessible it can be in comedy jail you could do a great special and no one can find it right yeah yeah and everyone has YouTube everyone can click on the link everyone has you do and this was his logic he was like you know what I'm just gonna release the whole thing on YouTube and look he went straight from not selling out clubs to selling out theaters like that now he sells out everywhere internationally and it's amazing from afar to watch the industry change mm-hmm just realizes cuz I think early on you so much of your self-worth is is put in these people and you you you don't realize till later that all they're just heat-seeking missiles yep yeah they don't you know majority of them don't have taste taste it's just whatever seven oh yeah evers hot can I get a pie if whatever this is yeah I mean including hacks I mean there's a long history of them supporting hacks and thieves it's just a thing where they're what they're trying to do is make money you know if you're an agent or a producer I mean there's no benefit in you supporting an artist that is not going to be commercially all right yeah yeah you have to find out like who who's it kind of who's gonna pop who's gonna be the next movie star who's gonna be in the movies you know you have to figure that person out what was it like when you let me see a thing went down what was the climate like for you say professionally after that went down because he was at a different level at that time right yeah yeah who's more popular than me with comedy for sure hmm you know I was doing Fear Factor back then and I wasn't really working on the road that much I really couldn't you know I was doing you know 30 episodes a year plus so 30 weeks a year of work and I wasn't really enthusiastic about trap I was doing that yeah I just wanted to I was exhausted um and then I was doing the store too so it's mostly just working on my act and just doing stand-up and they supported him because he was the one who was making the money I mean in fact I left my agency because they wanted me to apologize to him and then Louie wound up leaving them and a towel wound up leaving them and Swartz and wound up leaving them everybody left them right after that because they found out that they wanted me to apologize to him everybody in that industry knew what was going on right but they wanted to turn a blind eye and make money so it did it hurt my career while I stopped going to the store but that didn't hurt me as much as it hurt them it hurt the store because I told everybody and then that place was a ghost town I mean it went from being packed when I was there because I would let them put my name up on the marquee and I was working for free that's how fucking stupid tommy was but then when you know he got fired and I came back it made it all worth it you know the whole thing was it was interesting because it could show you that if there was someone who was doing what Mencia was doing that you can get away with it and even with someone who was successful like me like I got another agent like that I mean but I let my agent literally said I was gonna have to apologize to him I'm like you're out of your fucking mind I listen I'm not only am I not doing this is we're never gonna work this out I'll never work with you again because you're asking me to apologize to someone who was literally a vampire someone who's stealing from the work of other artists it's all he does and you guys know it and you guys are profiting off of this like this is you're making a giant mistake and I turned out it was correct but it was interesting because even though it didn't hurt me financially I got to see that they were trying to because you know he wanted them he wanted an apology yeah and I was like you're out of your fucking mind I'm not apologizing you know and as it kept getting people became more and more aware other people started finding other bits that he had like the real thing that sunk him was Cosby really funny now and think about it now but he had this like such obvious theft of a Cosby bit I mean he stole all the inflections and the he switched it around a little bit but people who work with him are trying to tell him to stop doing that bid because it was a giant famous Cosby bit and he just insisted that he's gonna do it and when that bit got on YouTube that and Mexican folks finding out he wasn't really Mexican that was a fuckin knife in the heart when they were like what like what when they found out what his real name was like you gotta be fuckin kidding me there was so much going on then though that was you know he was really popular you know he went from selling out these giant places and you know kicking ass all over the country and people knew him from the television show and they thought he was hilarious I guess that's kind of cool about stand-up is that of all the art forms stand-up has the most justice and then now it does now there's a lot of people made it through the net back in the day yeah there were just criminals I guess it was harder to know back and there was no internet there was just sort of like word of mouth or you would hear stories we all know that there's parallel thinking and then there's even cases where you forget you heard something I've done it I've definitely hash it out like a comic or something we're sure okay yeah you can have it or you're all pals right and it's bound to happen it's gonna just have the conversation if you're a probably like alright I don't need that bit yeah exactly and then there's also people that are like you know like you said that word and that's the word that I say in my bit you're like what like some people some people high-percentage it's almost like delusional yes yeah some people get delusional that's like I talk about being a relationship so oh yeah yeah appreciate it that's hilarious I broke up with my girlfriend recently too so yeah I own that well especially things that are current events right I feel like something like I can't believe you're talking about Trump you know I'd do that whole Trump bit yeah what are you crazy I've seen these conversations right over I'm telling you yeah this is just brewing this is just starting he's never living that down that's one you know I'll wreck your shit I'll wreck it throw you down a flight of stairs yeah was there stairs nearby or would they have to go up they have to go find some stair huh just yeah you're not gonna like trip down that's a weird thing to say to someone throw you down a flight of stairs you want to hurt them but you want the of gravity to do all the work yeah that's true so it's not that tough it's lazy he has all that potential energy once it gets up there just knock him over right that's funny you looking at like an engineer my dad so proud that I pulled that out of the bag do you use your engineer training at all in your standup is there anything else I think one quality I can take away from all the engineering schooling like I'm not doing formulas and equations and all that but I think it's just a manner of which I approach things and time management I'm wired a certain way where I can be studious on my own I don't I'm not like smoking weed on the couch and like I'm amused or I'm a vessel God's me like I'm okay what do I got what's what I want to do one of my goals for this year let's say how many sets do I have when I'm working on for this set so I'm just a little industrious it's taught me and also when it comes to bits like I see them in a certain way like um the way I get the bits it's very organic and that's what I like about it is that it's not clinical or anything it's just magical how I think of something mmm and I'm grateful for that do you give yourself time to think do you like specifically do things like go on walks or anything were you not specifically but what I found is one of my favorite things to do is go to a diner sit in a booth breakfast have coffee and they keep on refilling it and I'm on my phone and I'm on Twitter and Instagram and my mind's just kind of and I'm listening to music I love music so I'm just scouring Spotify and hype machine just for new music hype machine I don't know what it is uh so what I love so that's how I find music like hype machine and also Spotify hype machine is this blog aggregate so there's music blogs right mm-hmm there's one called like acids tag that I like a lot so you can follow a blog and they'll post songs every day maybe they'll post six songs a day this website you can follow different blogs and it's like following someone on Instagram or something so you look at your ear feed and you get to hear all the songs your favorite blogs have posted within the website mmm and there's an app on your phone too and these are kind of underground songs these aren't top 40 so it's a way to hear great music that you wouldn't hear on the radio and they're they're not any less great there's this whole subculture and genre of music that is magnificent but it's not on top 40 so people don't really know about it hmm so height machine is a great way to get some cool tracks off the beaten path oh I've never heard of that before that's too high machine so music plays a big part when the comedy yeah machine yeah what's popular now over sighs this is like their top 40 so even this is a little poppy for me I'll have certain blonde like finding yes yeah yeah yeah I mean for this type of music yeah whatever makes whatever makes the popular ante hold on yeah you're not gonna know scroll back up please Durant a Maya that's papi not fuck knows any of this music if there's childish gambino I know that guys if you're like a teen or early twenties old you'll know this stuff really yeah so I just love listening to music drinking coffee and on my phone and I'll just get these ideas mm-hmm but also just living life I'll be walking around and I'll get an idea jot it down well you don't have a day job which helps no that's that really helps collect material believe it or not yeah I think my comics have to be amused and you have to be experiencing just life life if you're working all it's not like it was harder when I was working at Boeing cuz I had that mental fatigue of just working on write you know parts and all the head yeah computational stuff so I'm nothing about bits well suck it out of you too I can see they're not because you think that oh it's just like you know I didn't really work on my act that much during the day anyway now I have a job doing doing acting I'll probably get just as much material uh-huh no no you won't you're gonna be wrapped up and whatever the fuck you're doing and then when you go do stand-up you Billy oh yeah time to do stand-up now I'll think about it you know you really need that time to be just free to think yeah it's kind of crucial to the creative process I don't think about that but that's true cuz those other jobs you you have mental focus that you're not dedicating to writing bits right yeah where I'm in a diner and yeah my mind's just floating around it seems like you're not working like someone on the outside would be like you're not even working I might come up with a gem that might be my next closing bit yeah that is worth randomly yeah because you gave yourself that time yeah like you just are watering grass and a mushroom pops up even with me I think there was a big breakthrough and just accepting that I'm an artist because you know my parents don't want me to do it for so long it was this dirty thing and it was always a process whose go to the club so stand-up in comedy was I was like a vampire feeding it was just this thing that I do over here and I want to do it but it was always different than what I supposed to be doing it was always on the side it's like a hobby type or I would there was a division within my mind but once I left Boeing and I was doing it full-time what was the impetus like what how did you make the decision ideally I always had this pie-in-the-sky scenario that would happen for me to leave Boeing I would think alright if I got to the point where I'm doing engineering and standup I wanted it to a point where it's glaringly obvious that engineering is holding me back from this other path and I have to make the jump so I needed that to happen and then I think enough things happen where I kind of had that situation I had I booked this acting thing I booked a role on Chuck NBC's Chuck I was still working at Boeing it was like this huge gas dollar charge yeah yeah so I will now do these things towards the end of my tenure at Boeing I would I had a manager and get auditions so I would duck out for lunch and I'm in Long Beach now would drive up to Hollywood and do an audition and wow I want to be gone for that one I would like do a combo I'd say lunch and doctor's appointment huh and then I would do or I would take off or come in early and leave early if I had an audition but I had to be very strategic about what audition I can't be bad Asia so this one I went out for Chuck and then I audition and then I got it this is huge guest star I'm still working at Boeing and they need me for eight days I have a day job so I said I had a family emergency and Seattle I have to go back home and they're like oh okay but I was just in Burbank shooting Chuck shooting and then I go back to work and people see you know luckily there was enough of a lead time where that wasn't coming out for a long time so he quit no not yet so I just thought like okay cool like I still keep on I can keep on being an engineer and then a couple things happen did anybody notice you on chalk when I but the thing is that happened when I left Boeing so so weird after I had left oh how much lead time was there quite up quite a bit maybe like six months or almost towards the end um and so no one knew I did stand-up and the beauty of it was when I entered the workforce of engineering everyone was substantially older than me they were like in dirties or they don't know about hype machine yeah I don't know the hype machine so it was a second nature to be like what's your MySpace or cuz jig would have been up immediately yeah so social media was not second nature with coworkers so there was a big enough generational gap so I was able to for three years just no one know anything so I do the Chuck thing and then I also I got really far and standard NBC has this standard for diversity initiative every year you do like a stand-up competition thing from different cities and then they have a final showcase so I got like second on that so I got some college gigs out of it I got quite a few college gigs and then I booked this show on MTV called disaster date which was like boiling points for dating they had a cast and I was one of the catheters and you just go on dates with friends would set up their friends with dates and there'd be like this is the things that she hates and you would just be the worst date ever and you see how long they last on the date so they need me for eight months or no three months fun what do I do yeah yeah three months so this was kind of that situation where I'm like fuck all right I just did Chuck I have some college gigs lined up this MTV show needs me for three months I got it I got to do this I didn't do that yet I try to take a leave of absence because I plan on coming back I was like can I I need something came up gonna be gone for three months middle and they're like no you can't do that I'm like um are you sure he's kept I'm trying to finesse it and they wouldn't let me and then I was reading about unemployment and stuff and I read that you couldn't quit you had to get fired yeah yeah so I'm like all right um here's what I do so I wrote my last day there I wrote an email just like hey guys I'm be gone for this three months I plan on returning on this day and then I just went incommunicado like I didn't I didn't pick up any phone calls if I was gonna get fired I want to get fired by them right because I didn't want them I didn't want to run the books that I quit right for some reason my engineering brain is like this is great I'll get them on a technicality they'll fire me and I'll get my unemployment if I need to so I leave mowing I'm shooting the show for three months and then eventually I get a termination letter in the mail from Boeing yes but then it turns out I mean I could have collected unemployment from the MTV show so I didn't even have to go out that way oh really yeah I mean it was fine like it wasn't yeah Ari used to collect unemployment for dude he was he was like my guiding light in that regard because early on especially when I left Boeing and the MTV thing comes and goes I do two seasons of it and then but that's not like a fucking it's got a rock-solid thing and Ari would show me the ropes he'd be like buddies collect unemployment from an acting job you get a nice jump than unemployment that's how it fucking works yeah you taught me how to do it and I've never heard of anybody getting unemployment from acting gigs yeah alright would do a commercial that's how it works employees you pay into it and all that it's all on the up-and-up it's just part of an actor's I guess requirement or necessity of an actor is being available yes so if you booked a commercial like a Toyota commercial let's say you make 30 grand or 20 grand whatever in that chunk you've made enough money in that quarter tool to apply because you're paying into it with the thing well you have to hit a certain amount mm-hmm and then you're eligible there's tears of how much money you get for unemployment then you're eligible for X amount of dollars every two weeks or whatever and that helped me keep a full frog a year and then I got to the point where I didn't need I didn't need it I had enough study work coming in but that was when I'll tell you my parents I thought that they would take it worse and they did but I think we had been at odds for so long that what I've noticed is you can't stay in an 11 your whole life right yeah so I think they had to know this day was gonna come eventually because I would talk about that was a plan the whole time I guess it's never thought that it would come to fruition now when you quit how long did you wait or when you got fired how long did you wait before you told them you don't have a day job anymore yeah it was around Christmas around the holidays so we were at my aunts house and then I told I told that like it went over better than I thought yeah I was surprised what did you say all the good things you're getting yeah yeah obviously come on yeah I quit and I'm gonna figure it out I'll figure it out but I like coming you guys for money later but I'm really proud of that in this whole adventure I've never asked my parents for money and I think that's a win yes that's a huge win that's a huge win yeah and I hope that they kind of noticed that through the tough times is I never that that's a sign it's going well they should figure that out that's a giant win yeah but I mean I just want to tell people if they have a similar path that you don't there's this romanticized version of being an artist where you just pack up all your things coming to LA yeah man like no I gotta be a hundred percent of my art yeah you have a plan do you you want to set yourself up for success or are you trying to throw are you an artist are you an engineer you be both none there's a lot of hours in the day you're that you're a prime example event it's amazing all the things you do there are so many hours in a day and it's such a cop-out to be like I've got to be all in it I'm gonna live and breathe my art otherwise I may be a hack now be methodical set yourself up for success well I think you have to be disciplined disciplined for sure I think it's very romantic and discipline contrary to popular opinion you can yeah and you have to be careful not to lose yourself once come to LA how many people do you know who come out here with a particular plan to like be an artist or a writer and their fucking birthday parties every day like it when you come to LA you can go to songs birthday party at a bar every day really oh yeah yeah there's so many it's everyone's birthday every everyday - this town's so big yeah that's true so you get yeah you'll see it - some artists just get like they'll go down this networking rabbit hole and they have no tangible and they never want to do a bad show they just want to do the best shows and they don't just focus on getting good at stand-up comedy it's just I'm going to this party someone's else here and they have nothing do you ever envision a time where one of us or maybe a collection of us writes down all these things but he knows like some sort of a guidebook to stand-up comedy I really think yeah someone could benefit from it I mean this it really is the only art form that as we're saying before is a viable art form and large scale that doesn't have an e-book or nothing yeah not I mean every fucking book about comedy like how to do comedies terrorist yeah you know what's weird you know what's scary there's all these formulas mm-hmm I think podcasting has taken some of the mystique out of it yes I think it's also created a bunch of fans of the process too sure like I've talked to people that have like come up to me at the Comedy Store and said hey I saw you first do that bit a year ago and then I watched it change and then when it became on your Netflix specials like holy shit like look at it it's kind of cool to see it grow and become viable yeah I think it's cool that there's an audience for that or that they value that because I think it's easy to assume the end consumer just won't see the finished product yeah but their comedy fans are so savvy now they
