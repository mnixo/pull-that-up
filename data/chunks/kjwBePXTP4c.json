the girag and experience now how did you get involved in this you started you said 24 years ago doing drug research on animals how did what was what led you to want to go down this road so I was in I tell the story in the book and so I was in the Air Force back in the 80s like you mentioned about crack cocaine so I was in the Air Force over in England 86 87 88 and crack cocaine was a big deal in the United States as you point out and I grew up in the hood in Miami and Miami was a cocaine capital in the United States and and so things that were happening in my community that were not good high unemployment crime all of these kinds of things I blame crack cocaine for that and so I thought that if I go to school and get a degree in order to study drugs the effects of drugs on the brain I could solve the problems that face my community or problems that I thought were in the community particularly those related to drugs and so I began studying drugs as an undergraduate and then went on to graduate school to study drugs on the brains of animals and to try to figure out the neurobiological mechanisms that were responsible for addiction she just got fascinated by this idea of fixing this issue that you saw in your community and then you just fell into a rabbit hole yeah so when I started along my journey my path I actually got in education and you know so as James Baldwin said you know the the paradox of education is precisely this as one begins to become educated and conscious one begins to question the society in which he's being educated and that's what happened with me and so along the way I discovered things like hmm the majority of people who use these drugs are not addicted that was one thing I discovered I discovered that many of the things that we said about crack about crack cocaine were just simply not true like the cold crack baby myths and people said that when that our generation beep should be prepared to have an army of kids who couldn't learn because of being exposed to crack cocaine that just simply wasn't true when all the data came out there beginning in the mid-1990s we realized that that simply wasn't true other things that I learned that just simply wasn't true things like one hit of crack cocaine you're addicted not true that crack cocaine was different from powder cocaine not true all of these things I discovered of long way that they won't they weren't true and not only that I discovered that this wasn't new I went back to the early 1900s and saw the same sort of hysteria mainly race-based hysteria surrounding drugs occurred even then and so I thought what's what's going on and then that helped me to be more critical about my issue is there a difference in the the effect of crack cocaine the physical effect and and and cocaine and heroin so let's think about crack let me not not here on rather how to conquer powder yeah let's think about crack cocaine and powder cocaine let's just think about the chemical structure the only difference between crack cocaine and powder cocaine is that the powder cocaine has this thing called the hydrochloride salt attached to it that salt prevents it from being smoked now you can dissolve the powder cocaine and in water and in shooting in your arm and so you have the effects of cocaine the onset of the effects within seconds the same is true with crack cocaine the effects are onset of a sex effects are within seconds now the biological activity of cocaine is at the base not that so that hydrochloride portion on the on the cocaine powder on the powder cocaine has no biological activity whereas so that means that crack and powder are the same drug they are exactly the same drug the same effect same drug Wow so it's indistinguishable to the user indistinguishable now why is it that they prepare it that way like what's the benefit of preparing it it's just so delivery quicker great question so one of the things that you you might recall Richard Pryor back in the days when he got he burnt and he burnt himself with smoking so he was freebasing and so he was removing that hydrochloride portion of the salt off of the off of the cocaine base so he could actually smoke it now he was using ether which is highly flammable with crack cocaine you don't now you no longer need the ether you just mix it up with baking soda and water and the cocaine and you mix it up and you get rid of that salt so ether is no longer needed and it's not as dangerous so that's one of the reasons that we have crack cocaine as a result of that and it also it made it so you could sell them in unit doses to make the drug appear to be cheaper because you also might recall in the early 1980s 1970s you had to buy cocaine powder in bulk and that made it more expensive crack cocaine made it a lot more simple simple for people to buy it who didn't have the kind of a expendable income that was required before the mid 1980 so essentially they just brought it down to bite sized portions that's right exactly rather than selling this whole six-pack or 12-pack now you can sell one item one can or one bottle I want to talk more about this but I should just clarify the Richard Pryor changed his story as he got older and actually said that he tried to kill himself he lit himself on fire apparently I'm a huge Richard Pryor fan and I know that that was originally what he had said that he got burnt doing freebase but I think he changed his story later I actually worked with him a bunch of times right before he died was a real honor he's a real special dude as far as stand-up comedians go yeah with you but that that um style of like freebase was a thing that we'd always associated with people that were really really fucked up yeah like the guys doing coke oh well you know he's probably gonna mess up his life he's freebasing oh shit yeah he's gone man he's based and he's a basehead yeah right base head was the thing before crack I was lace heads absolutely I described a cup of people in the book from my neighborhood who got into freebasing in exactly the same way you just talked about right absolutely um now everybody has this idea in their head that crime and that everything escalated in the world changed when crack was introduced is that a myth as well yeah it's a myth well what let me clarify because on the one hand so when crack hit the market its first sort of talked about December 1984 in the LA Times the first time we heard a crack but it didn't become more widely known or available until maybe the mid nineteen mid nineteen eighty-five now once crack cocaine hit the markets what happened was that people were fighting over various new markets whenever there are new illicit markets yeah you're going to get some violent activities until the market settles down that happened with any illicit market and that certainly happened with crack cocaine now one of the things that people there are a number of things that people attributed to crack in terms of crime and all of the sort of downfall of certain communities unemployment they said that unemployment really rose as a result of crack cocaine being around now nineteen eighty two the unemployment rate in this country was about 11 percent for white folks and it was double that for black people that was before crack at least two three years before crack even hit the market now doing the whole crack era unemployment has never been as high as 1982 that's number one people said things like people from my community crack cocaine what's responsible for these mothers these grandmothers now raising new generations of kids because their daughters were strung out on crack and so now they have to take care of these kids that simply wasn't true it certainly happened in in my community but it happened before crack cocaine was ever on the mark and certainly happened in my family long before crack cocaine ever hit the market when we look at other communities like particularly immigrant community if you look at the Jewish community when they came over to Eastern European Jews when they came over in the country there early nineteen hundred eight or 1800s and so forth what you see is that you had a similar sort of phenomenon going on in those kind of communities what's his name urban how his great book land of our fathers a home of our fathers he kind of described all of these pathological behaviors that happened in that community many of those same behaviors were attributed to crack cocaine and black people later but it's not it they were there long before crack cocaine was there but crack cocaine became the scapegoat that's a fascinating scapegoat because I bought into it hook line and sinker I really thought that there was a difference between the 1980s and the 1990s as far as like when crack was introduced boom it took off it was sort of something that was just always discussed as like common fact ya know I bought into it too and that's what drove me to pursue my education in the way I did but as a result of pursuing that education I discovered that it was not true so are these cultural myths the result of politician like political campaigns we're trying to clean up the streets and they attributed to certain issues or is it is it as something more widespread is it the media just running with a narrative what it what is it how did it get started well there are multiple sort of factors and players involved so when we think about the politicians for example politicians if crack cocaine is the problem never mind the fact that unemployment rates was out of control before crack cocaine hit the market hit the market unemployment was out of control a number of things were already problematic now you have crack cocaine if you blame crack cocaine it's really easy to simply say we'll put more law enforcement we'll hire more cops we'll put more efforts in controlling these drugs a lot easier to say will lock people up for selling these drugs for using these drugs in the process what you do is you create jobs for a select group of people and then you don't have to deal with the real issues the real issues of unemployment of deprivation all of these things you don't have to deal with they're far more complicated and so politicians are happy to buy in now one of the things about crack cocaine is that we think about the law that punishes or punished crack cocaine a hundred times more harshly than powder cocaine and the vast majority of people who got punished under these laws were black eighty eighty-five percent of the people even though they don't make up the majority of the users so people say things like well were those laws racist and the laws themselves weren't racist because the blood Congressional Black Caucus 17 of the 21 members voted to for these laws for these laws that punish crack cocaine a hundred times more harshly but the point is is that everyone bought into it parents bought into it because the parents did for the parents what this meant is that you don't actually have to educate your kids about this you just say that they're bad and stay away from it no education require even sciences and treatment providers they all bought into it because you got a problem we're going to solve your problem so we are needed and we are valued all so you had all of these sort of constituencies from society benefiting from the vilification or the scapegoating of crack cocaine all of those things didn't came together nicely and then we think about the rappers they all came into the game too because it's like I'm conscious I'm going to say that this is a problem my community and I care about my community and this is the way that I can show it so everybody had a stake in this sort of thing Wow that is absolutely fascinating you know one of the things that I've talked to quite a few people about when it comes to issues like real complex issues like drug addiction and and violence and in poverty is that once you feed it with any organism whether it's that what organism is law enforcement or that organism is education whichever one you feed is the one that's going to grow and once you feed the law enforcement one and you look at this really complex situation I think law enforcement is important but I think education is probably more important to avoid future law enforcement like the more I think the more education we have the the more nuanced our ability to raise children is the more we understand you know that we're all in this together the less you're going to need law enforcement but when law enforcement becomes this machine that lobbies against the legalization of certain drugs which when you start looking at the data there's only one reason to do that and the only reason is that you're trying to stay alive you're trying to grow your an organism you're trying trying to eat the sugar you're trying to keep going so you're creating more jobs by putting people in jail it's essentially no one wants to look at it like this but it's a form of slavery I think we in the house I live in the film Eugene Drake ease film I think that's the kind of analogy he was trying to draw in that film absolutely so I think we get it I think a number of people get that that's exactly what it is you
