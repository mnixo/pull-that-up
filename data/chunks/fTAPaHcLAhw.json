a combo high it cuts it yeah I like it before I go on stage it's my favorite before I go on stage that's just a little pickup hi I'm happy how legal weed is these days because it's like I would I must learn how to spring concert yesterday and I would feel like shit back in the day walking in there smelling like but cuz he goes to private school it's reflection on him yeah so it's like you know you got the weed head dad blah blah blah another thing but it's like nowadays I should have kool-aid no one cares nobody gives a fuck yeah I've seen it happen because I have a 22 year old daughter but I also have an 11 and a 9 year old uh-huh and with the 22 year old when she was growing up it was all weird weird it was like if you were you were a loser for smoking weed lay dates you know say yeah people coming over your house you got weed at the house yeah but parents get weird I live like right up the street from the school so I'm getting real technical with it I think yeah I'm in a school zone like legitimately yeah like I could be not here right now incarcerated for real that lady they locked up today in Dallas did you see that shit no no a lady a grandmother they locked her up because she had CBD on her oh yeah she was a Dallas Airport it's not even psychoactive and I think she had the oil like first skin right oh hey it's just ridiculous she's old lady old lady needs it for arthritis that's right my wife's mom uses it for arthritis it's great solder fuck this shit my my daughter called my ex baby's mom she's still my baby's mom but she has another baby on the way in her new relationship but she's able to take CBD during her pregnancy to help her her nausea and all that's yeah it's like why would you hate on CBD bro no it's amazing this shit is my friend's son has some seizures he has some sort of epileptic scene get some CBD it's gone is it everyday it doesn't have him anymore that's amazing it's incredible it's so good it's almost you feel like you're lying what does so many different things right that when you talk about weed you feel like you're lying yeah I mean like these days in this day and age I was just telling somebody the other day smoking pot is going to be old school like you know I mean we're still going to do it but it's totally moving towards just ingesting it yeah I've been it on and all that shit sprays yes scared of it and it works like yeah like fuck like the thing about the animals don't puts you in a weird place we get too much yeah yeah I've seen people melt down yo edibles are crazy so I got a homie who just took a THC pill yesterday and he was talking about types of shit like really I should knocked him how he's probably still asleep yeah the edibles fuck you up you do edibles yeah I do but yeah I've had some bad experiences but like someone really not bad but like like completely lost could touch with this dimension Dale you know what I'm saying yeah like I had a friend of meet THC pills yep and I was taking him out of party once it was a party for jujitsu tournaments well because it was a jujitsu tournament and then there was this party afterwards and by the time the pills had kicked in I have no idea how much was in there because it was like some handmade shit that this guy stuck together himself a little capsules that it was as high as I've ever been in my life to the point where I wasn't even seeing people I was seeing like a two-dimensional cutout of the person and then behind them I was seeing like their true intention hi fuck I was talking this one dude and he was just he's he was a high-level jujitsu guy was really was really odd it was a very strange feeling I got talking to this cat and then um like a month later he was on the run for rape yeah he raped some woman and then he escaped and then he was out so addicted to jujitsu the story was that he started training again with a fake name but he was like this high level black belt there's only that this especially back then when this happened is like the early two-thousands there's only a certain number of high level black belts that are running around right so he put on this fake Brazilian name and started training in like the Pacific Northwest and then but he's strangle in black belts and everybody's like what the fuck is who is this guy some people ask face is someone took a picture of him they go that guy's wanted for rape oh shit I remember talking to him on these THC pills being like like some there's some wiring that's not correct oh fuck yeah damn duh that's in whoa yeah THC pills and yeah the exposed thing yeah they do bro I didn't mushrooms in it exposed a lot yeah yeah you just wrote yeah yeah yep I fuck with mushrooms because that's what happens with me when I was on mushrooms I was able to see people's true intentions yeah I was being a rapper and shit like that you know you'd be having to peel back the layers layers and layers and layers and I was trying to peel my own layers back just for my own Shore personal every man I ended up yeah yep and I ended up being like backstage somewhere and I was like fuck I was like I'm around all these people and I really see their true intentions and I was like I see what crowd they are and it was like I felt like I was separated you know what I mean it was like I was on a boat all the way out here and they were all on all on an island partying and I was like damn yeah I could see what's going on over there but it was cool like I do mushrooms every now and then I don't fuck with it all the time I haven't done them in like three years because they help you see shit like that so it's like for me I'll take that experience and I'll just live with it you know I don't need to keep going through like you probably seen that dude was like oh shit now I know people who are rapey as soon as I see him I knew he was dangerous like he was a legitimately dangerous person but not the same bro not just a trained killer but he was dangerous like the way thought about things that's why there's people like that out there yeah yeah I mean you you you you don't know until you experience it and that was a mild experience compared to most people's owners psychos fucking crazy motherfucker I know I know just probably in fighting too that's why I feel like more people need to like smoke weed and train I think so too because it balances it is great man alleviate Saul that shit with the most people mmm-hmm but there's gonna be some dudes just like that guy that are just they're just out there yeah it's taking it to that level like yeah yeah yeah that's crazy when you think about the world of fighting and competition I mean you're dealing with people that are taking the biggest risks they don't have to do that this is like the choice I could get a job the choice is I want to get a job trying to fuck up other people who have a job trying to fuck up people the killers the trained killers just going after each other right right and when you're around those dudes one of the things you one of things you realized very early on you that you can have your preconceived notions about them being like like mean people violent people right they're people of character yes sir you have to have extreme character to pull off what they do yeah yeah there's some of the best people I've ever met my life for fighters yep yep they're they're a different breed of human being yeah they chose that path they chose it yes no one's forcing them we're not in war right they decide to go and do that and that's why it's so exciting to watch right right because you know that they're putting everything on the line right I look at it like like you said they chose that so you don't become an athlete to choose to fight you know what I mean like and a lot of them are really like you said smart and they're technical and especially how the sport is developing these days because people don't want the long-term damage but they want to still like you know what I mean go hard so hmm they're coming up with fucking all types of ways to do this shit and it's like at the end of the day you have to be creative or you have to have some type of something up here you know I mean you're not just fighting to be fighting you know right so yeah I think they all go in for the same reason you know they're trying to find out if they can do it right and then they have a just a drive to prove that they're the best right I was just talking to somebody the other day about that it was like a crazy argument because they were saying how fight fans are just there for knockouts and I was like you definitely have your knockout fans like those probably the people who pay the most you know I mean it's like but I was like you got to give credit to a lot of people who understand fighting and love it and are viewing it for that aspect there's like you know Luna Park you watch football like a lot of people played football and you know wish they could have been that person on the field they just haven't you know I mean yes I was trying to explain so I was like it was a huge crowd of people who actually know about this shit who are knowledgeable and those people supported as well it was weird yeah I feel you are know exactly what you're saying there's some people they just want to see people get beat up and some people that want to see Floyd Mayweather duck punches right you know one of the best things about Floyd Mayweather and Canelo wasn't that Floyd beat Canelo um he out boxed him right but he showed this level of defense right if you're a boxing fan Yulin Jesus Christ like he knows everything that's coming yeah he's always in the right angle he's always one step ahead and that's why he's so good yeah his defenses the boys only been hit like a few times in school career really hard see like Shane hit him a couple times was it my Donna Donna hit him really hard when they fucking like save the clip and play it over think about other boxers how much they get hit I love watching that I love watching someone who could move like that right right like my favorite fighter to watch the UFC was Mighty Mouse mm-hmm not just because he was the best pound-for-pound fighter on the planet but because he was not getting hit right he was occasionally someone would tell like John Mayer got tagged him with straight limb occasionally some guys hit him but most times things are just grazing yeah thanks for getting block right right if he gets hit he's moving right it's a he's a puzzle right if you're a fan of martial arts you want to see the master of the puzzle exactly yeah hell yeah and I don't I don't count them people out and I wouldn't fucking sit in front of a dude and let him just be like oh yeah everybody will see knockouts like nod like it's not like that family I think everybody likes both things though yes like when you get like Arturo Gatti versus Micky Ward you ever see that fight it was a trilogy of fucking wars between these two guys that were not champion they were they were like one step below at the time of their career being like championship level right so they weren't like in threat of fighting for the title no one thought they liked Floyd was better than both of them by far right but what they were doing was showing the two guys that are similarly talented can put on like the most entertaining fight in the world it was incredible crazy back and forth it back for I like watching that too yeah yeah you know yeah I want to see a good fight me personally I like watching both things I like watching someone just completely willy pep somebody jig just like Pernell Whitaker used to do yeah he's a great boxer he couldn't hit him no he was so slick nope you know and you can only do that for so long like in any sport and you know he'd be at the top for so long watch those performances when those guys were at the top that shows you what's possible hell yeah and this is good to see somebody like master their craft - yeah cuz you see them come up like you watch them bi and then it's like they become the shit and it's like oh yeah you know mean I've seen this do like start from just being okay and now he's just fucking shit up you see them learn you see them develop you know that stuff is fun like you grow with him that's a good combination of getting to the bottom of shit is weed and martial arts yeah yeah that's a good combination 100% it really is I do like a lot of my thinking is just from like after I trained I just sit there and just think about nothing but you know what I mean you know ideas come to me how to deal with situations you know what I mean because it's just I don't know it just happens like that just flows yeah yeah it flows and I think like the training helps you get all the bullshit off your back right hell yeah right yeah yep especially for me too cause like I party a lot and I'm in a studio till like 5:00 6:00 in the morning and I'm drinking and stuff like that so to just be going down that path and doing that every day bro I look crazy I feel crazy you guys I have to get that off of me like I don't mean you know that I mean that's why your gym is crazy but I need to do something like that for myself it's nice to have at some point like that's how I look at you like the og so it's like I'm not gonna go do it tomorrow like hey everybody build me a gym but you know eventually that's the goal when I look back I'll be like I seen Jose Jimenez that's what me dude you train hard I've seen your videos yeah well I get to work you work out it unbreakable yeah yeah your spot yeah that's a great gym it's a really good gym Jay Glazer yeah he owns that spot there a very impressive place he put together in awesome place yeah yeah it's cool the team there is good like I said it's not all about like just fighting and being you know the biggest baddest meanest motherfucker like they really taught me about my body mm-hmm that's what they do they teach you there whatever your goals are they bring you you know up to that speed so it's like I'll wait like 140 pounds ever since I got out of high school and I was like fuck I gotta gain some weight and they helped me out and doesn't snoop train there too yeah there's this video snoop sparring he's sparring daniel Sarafian yep Daniels fucking crazy at least yeah I know that guy he'll have all his fights before he's a tank he is crazy like has a tank nuts his thing is like you know I gotta get hit I'm like all right Daniel you know he's got to get hit the weak himself oh yeah Wow there's his barn with him yes Luke was going at it so he's trying to take him out dude Snoop throws some good shots them right there yeah Snoop skills he really does some glad Daniel ducked that one oh yeah I mean oh I guarantee you snoop that's funny right a lot of people their fist fight oh yeah he's tall as shit to look at a team like that look at those arms yeah look at that it's new so that was so ha ha that's Sarafian that guy's a tank mm-hmm yeah he fought in UFC for a while he's still fighting still active yeah I think he's in Brazil right now using yeah he was working at the gym for min and and he I guess he chilled out yeah it's it's anyway my point was the videos it's nice to see cuz you train hard like watch you do muy Thai hit the path so you're really putting it work on this sir yeah yeah it's everyday thing it's a journey like you know I mean Tyler Ernie Ernie Reyes is my oh shit I got sunshine right there that was Stu he was teaching me some stuff while I was early do I suck right there oh do you our sparring right there with one of the greatest muy Thai fighters if not the greatest of all times yeah that dude was super tight he's amazing yeah he's really good his videos like highlights yeah you ever see that jumping left switch kick yeah knocked I do that with yeah yeah yeah yeah outstanding crazy cake so how cool is that man you you're sparring yet with one of the greatest of all time as far as fuck mmm it's like those people like you know about fighters did the majority said when you meet them they they're cool as hell yeah so to meet him and him not wanna whip my ass when I tell me like hey you look goofy sit down he's like showing me shit that I could use later so it was cool well the Thais have a really interesting way of sparring some of them do they play right they don't hit each other full blast mm-hmm they're like tap and they'd laugh around and joke around they're just developing their timing yeah because they fight so often yeah John Wayne Parrs a friend of mine from Australia multiple time world champion mm-hmm and you know he would talk in depth about how they would play they just play they just hit each other just slap each other a little bit and you like that way they understand the timing of it but they never worry about it they don't get hurt mm-hmm and they can do it all the time a really smart way to do it yeah but you'll see guys like Sarafian he's capable of doing that so he could spar with a guy like snoop or a guy like San Choi could spar with a guy like you and you can play with you right everybody just have a good time it's fun at the end yeah super-fun yeah yeah how are you definitely seen that a lot like more Instagram and even with my trainers will do it like me or he was just doing that yesterday was like developing the time and of the cakes where it's like you kicked me I kick you I can't you you kick me I kick you twice you kicked me three times I kick you once like you said just playing around yeah and like when you got a good sparring partner you take care of each other exactly don't hurt yeah but there's no ego involved and the ties they do like knees though they don't need a fuck out of each other like it looks like kind of hard but they're just making their bodies harder like you say for later because yeah they're used to it a lot of times they'll slap each other with the side of their leg too right that really drive the knee in yeah they're just slapping each other a little bit but that's it's obviously it's very effective like they figured something out you got some crazy cakes thank you yeah I seen what was it a side kick that you did probably turning side kick yeah yeah you got to teach me that I'll teach you that yeah I'm with the forum because I'm learning just a regular psyche like a slide you know go to like a Taekwondo school they'd be the best at showing you how to do it I'll definitely show you how but yeah if you need a place to Train find like a really good Taekwondo school mm-hmm because one thing Taekwondo has some things that you know won't work in MMA if you're adding takedowns and punches to the face but because they don't punch to the face in tournaments and you get used to doing crazy kicks crazy yeah so they have a lot of weird a lot of weird leg dexterity stuff and if you get good at that stuff I think that's a good I had a kid that wanted to fight I would say let's just do some yoga Shen or some Taekwondo first just do some karate something we you develop in leg decks there yeah hailey then as you get a little older then movie into more time right sorry you could do both things mm-hmm because if someone's caught you when guys are like constantly chopping at the legs they never really develop the kind of spinning kicks that guys do what they don't kick the legs right those are the guys have developed the best spinning kicks cuz it's so easy to chop the legs and effective chop the legs out mm-hmm so a lot of those techniques don't really get dialed in to the level that they get dialed in from a Taekwondo guy mm-hmm because they can't kick each other in the legs right right it's kind of a dumb way to fight because you should kick the legs but at the end of the day it allowed them to develop some crazy shit and a lot of weird spinning stuffs guys are so fast and the powers insane yeah yeah cuz it's all moving torque and bull crazy shit it's just it's hard to develop right hard to develop those tits like a lot of posture and you got it really you got to be balanced then you got that knee is everything right you got a dustin how you aim it so it's like when you're spinning or even if you're just standing there you have to have correct posture and be able to do a couple kicks like you says like a lot to go on coming at somebody spending glisten doing all types of shit so it's different for show it's really good for your balance to do that as a young kid and learn some other shit later right you'll have balance yeah that's what I've seen when you kick the fuck out of that shit was like you like really balanced and straight like you know that I mean the the tech because a lot of people I you might be strong as fuck but you can see technique right right and this if you do the shit over and over and over really perfect it that's different than just being able to throw a strong kick yeah me yeah techniques everything and that way in jiu-jitsu it's that way and then I'm it's got to be that way of music be that way in everything yeah definitely man I'm in a studio like all the time practicing like I could write a song before this interview is over but that's because I practice you know it's not because like I'm the most lyrical person in the world it's like I just fucking rap every day like it should come easy so but when you write do you write things out or do you do you do it out in your head like I know jay-z supposedly doesn't write anything right it just keeps it all in his head yeah yeah incredible it's awesome that he can do that right it's kind of insane yeah yeah yeah I have I have different processes so like for me I kind of melodies like I'll sing and I'll rap so it's a lot easier for me to just have a melody in my head and make up the words as I go but if I'm writing lyrics like writing words down where I actually rap it that's what I'm gonna use the paper you know but there's different ways to do it because honestly this is what my studio setup looks like it's like a chair the mic is right here I don't go in the booth for anything in my engineer sitting right there so it's like we're coming up with it as as we go I'll take a little break just write something down and then I'll just jump jump straight back on it you know what I mean so there's different techniques though because a lot of times sometimes I won't write shit I'll just go and just make it up and just keep going keep flowing or there's times where I could just lay a melody and then write the words to it later so it's just different you know ways to approach it so you just do it based on however you feel that day mm-hmm whatever the track really calls for it's like if if the song is something that I get instant inspiration on my oh I'm gonna knock it out right now or if something I want to live with for a little bit I'll just do as much as I'm happy with it at that point and then move on to the next thing come back to it later and just make sure everything is fresh I like to keep everything fresh keep it fun keep it loose and I don't really overthink anything if it's not there then I just go go away from it and find something that's more fun yeah that's a it's a beautiful freedom to be able to do that you know yeah you obviously picked the right fucking job I swear like you know it's it's a it's work because I I'm always looking for what's next you know what I mean for the fans for the listeners for the people who supported me all the way to this point like okay I gotta push myself I gotta do what's next I got it has got to be crazy you know I mean I got a son he's six so it's like I gotta impress him I can't have him just listening to a whole bunch of other rappers and not my music so it's like yeah yeah it's uh you know it is an interesting responsibility you have right yeah yeah and a guy like you becomes famous it's an interesting like you have so many people that want you know and I think we need to call it a different thing other than work yeah cuz it's like there's work like fuck I work for UPS right yeah it's cool they're good good benefits and that's work right what you're doing is like you love it yeah hell yeah you know when you love something almost we need a better word yeah for sure that's the same word as working at McDonald's the same word we work a market word would be need a better word like a passion project like being able to do what you want to do exactly whatever that thing is yeah yeah no I believe that that's that's a good point because it's not the same work it's not the same thing no it's not the same thing we need to put in the work yeah we're a shit job in your life you know what that is that's work yeah we put in the work we've done that but saying I'm going to work when you're going to do something you love you're excited about yeah it's we need a better word then that's why I think that's true that's why people get pissed at me there's a hundred girls there I had a punch in just like you yeah in that sense the world is just not fair okay you know some people's jobs are not the same I mean fuck you stop and think about how fortunate you are yeah yeah yeah I thank God every day bro beautiful all the time because it is it is a blessing I'm literally like last night I'm like writing a song and the only problem that I had was like a girl's ass was right on me I was like baby like I'm enjoying this as much as you are but I got it like physically right so I was like your ass is like I'm moving my arm around like you can do that but just right there you know I mean like no and I started thinking about something like wow these are my problems like yeah that's cool just a little bit of discipline that's amazing yeah I'm cool with that yeah for sure that's amazing yeah yeah yeah and the song got rid so we beautiful yeah yeah job got done yeah this is another word right that's not Newark you were not working you're working obviously you're working at it but it needs a better word a nobler word the fans will come up with the word for sure they're way more creative yeah that way more time on their hands yeah I think they will they'll figure it out okay and we'll report back for sure I just make sense there's no way it's the same thing mmm it can't be not hell not for show nope yeah and that's why I always tell people when people always try to think down they always try to think man that's easy for you to say or not everybody can make it yeah you're right not everybody can truth but maybe you can right woody what does that mean not everybody can everybody can everybody's gonna do everything nobody's gonna walk to the top of the hill that's the thing some people gonna stop halfway I can't do it that's the thing yeah people limit themselves in a crazy way they're like oh yeah everybody can't do it it's like you says I know everybody can't do it it takes a lot you know I mean you gotta fucking go through the shit to get it but when you get there it looks awesome right yeah yeah I mean it's whatever it is yeah you know try to figure it out and go do it oh yeah hell yeah Mike you said the top of the hill looks great but some people settle for the middle yeah and they get mad if people get to the top that's motherfucker you know they get mad at the at the top man there's no one who's like you doesn't work hard right so that's the myth right that's the thing - it was like main it so again the wrong word for it right passion hard whatever it is right I mean you don't a tattoo craft maintaining it is there's an art to that right because you work so freakin hard to get to where you're at and then you get there and it's like aw fuck what do I do like there's no rest there's no rest everything that was acceptable before becomes unacceptable because now you're up here you know I mean so it's like yeah you have to you have to you have to pick your shots and like you know I'm saying can't really like just go crazy like you did back in the day so there's an art to it you know what I mean and that's how you really maintain and stay in that spot and even level up so do you consciously think okay balance out enjoyment with things that I have to do to stay discipline 100% yeah 100% that's a very smart way of looking at yeah yep 100% like those there has to be a balance of each because it's like all right now I'm at this new level like whether I want to behave like this or not I put myself here I worked hard now I'm with these elite motherfuckers so this is the this is how I have to act because I'm not down here anymore I worked from here to get here so what happens you balance you put things into place you do a little bit of this and a little bit of that instead of a lot of that you know I mean and you just pick your shots and it's like you're gonna get everything in the end this is how it's just planned and how it's supposed to be but you just piece it together just a little bit differently like I just turned 31 well damn I'm about to be 32 that's young too a lot of people that's old to some people as well but for me it's like there's a whole new mind state you know what I mean and I feel like through my 20s I was actually like a fucking teenager and like now I'm an adult so now I look at things a little bit differently it's like you know I was really a kid this is how you behave as an adult for the rest of your life and it still involves a whole bunch of partying and having fun but the business gets handled and things get approached totally differently that's a balanced way of looking at it man I love it mm-hmm enjoy it this other think to like people have to understand to to be someone like you to be a very successful rapper mm-hm and to not expect you to live the way you talk about all the time right so ridiculous right right like you don't think you he wants a party he's talking about party I think he wants a party party this is just an act yeah yeah it's weird right it's crazy as fuck because people they want you to be you they want me to be myself right they want a party they don't want to take shots they want to smoke weed they want to stay up all night yeah why is that bad it's nice so many people want to do it but it gives us image in some people's minds and like frivolous life mmm frivolous thinking Marty mm-hmm what are you doing drinking and smoking and then they come around and do the same thing because they want it it's like I have like a weird place in life where I think I'm like the key to a lot of shit because it's like if you want to enjoy yourself I'm a guy I mean I don't I mean it's like oh man I'm just fuckin gonna live through it where it shows up he's gonna light the joint it's gonna be amazing if you want to fucking be professional like especially when will I do because there's a whole lot of rappers who like on business you know I mean they're not thinking like that mm-hmm so for those guys I'm their guy like they look at me like where's has his shit together like he really handles his business he talks to people he shows up he does this he does that so to be the party guy and the business guy it's like amazing you know what I mean it's a it's a lane that I kind of carved for myself but it's me in real life so it's like that's the only thing I have to do is really just completely be myself just be 100 fucking show up do my business thing tell people do the right thing and fucking lie to joy

yeah all the time yep it's the same damn bro yeah it's not limited to one or two of us right now there's a bunch of different paths that's the Copa yeah yeah oh yeah so how many years you've been trained in martial arts now this is my second year Wow yeah only two years that's amazing I gained what 35 pounds I'll pull up a video of him hitting pads that's incredible is it - yeah I don't know tell him tell me what what video but it's all good you know how we are you can hit hard you have good technique you tomorrow you turn your hips and shoulders in the age you do it right so that's very impressive that it's only two years in yo I'm learning I love it when people take a chance - and you try something new yeah that's all but you know we'll get there so how many eight months had you been in here like you say this is old this was probably like a year yes a year ago yeah still seriously though good technique for someone who's been doing it a year the way you're moving I mean there's no fat to your movements where I see what I'm saying like everything you're doing it might not be the fastest in the world of the most devastating but you're doing it perfect I think you're doing exactly how you're supposed to do it and then you just get better and better from there there you go but we are talking about is the change in your physique right you became fucking shredded right it's impressive yeah thank you that's only through hard work you can't do it any other way yeah just just work it and and eating I was all oh I'm sorry that's mine it's hard to cut that off sorry about that that's no worries man welcome to the wonderful world of convenience there we go family yeah eatin like a motherfucker brah yeah I'd like forced myself to eat to gain weight to gain weight you know if I can just move it around some but I already have a quick metabolism so then you add working out to that mmm so it's like I'm burning so muscle setting alarms to eat yeah yup getting a little bit more rest too you know they alarm see like how's that work yeah like wake up and then you eat eat go back to sleep luxray what kind of father I do a lot of like like ginger shots and like shit like that to help like what yeah to read all of that shit to cuz like you said that she could fucking stomach up why who told you to get up in the middle of the night and eat though my trainer yeah yeah hmm yeah yeah I would uh I would say that your sleep cycle is more important than anything oh well it's not like breaking my sleep it's like more like yo eat oh you mean like you said in a long while you're awake yeah oh I see I've never heard anybody telling someone to wake up in the middle of the night need nah no I did hear that that's why I was weird I heard that from there was that movie with Clint Eastwood where he played a boxing trainer and his daughter that famous actress played a boxer okay you know that billion-dollar baby is when that actress what is her name Hilary Swank Hilary Swank the job when Hilary think we could change on the ball when she was training for that I think that's what I read that they they had alarm set which she would wake up and mill the night and have a protein shake oh really and then go back to sleep again no I'm not doing that okay no no no break-in to sleep just regular eating habits just reminding myself yeah I mean cuz I was eating like twice a day awesome just some rock star shit can't live like that bro I said it's back do you have a nutritionist or someone who like handles your meals meal preps yeah yeah cuz I don't cook right so it's like they just deliver my that's nice yeah it's really nice actually yeah you know because I'm single so it's like I don't really got nobody in the house like cooking or right making all that shit happen for me so it just comes to this so you can make sure everything's healthy exactly what you want all right up for you is fresh every couple days that's a good thing to not have to think about there yep the food the food is like a big part of it and working out is one thing people just want to get big like you said I'm well like we were talking about it's like my embodying a soul right so the food is further so mmm that keep that fucking meat alive yeah yeah keep the body moving yep are you do you ever do yoga or anything like that I would you would yeah yeah I need a yoga instructor yeah who's the best yoga issed I don't know you do yoga yeah I love it yeah yeah how long how long you oh yes you do like some hot yoga yeah yeah yeah yeah she's intense right it's kind of intense yeah but it's it's great for you mind touches you out loosens you up that's what I need to do I need to stretch you know yeah I do like regular normal stretching but some yoga will be I yeah it's good too because cuz the heat in the room everything gets real loose yeah you get really kind of dig into like certain things stressed you're free to test your flexibility and stretch things a little bit more got you just keeps you pliable got you you know when you're doing a lot of hard things like multi or wait like there's not not enough stretching things out and totally maintaining your range of motion yeah especially as you get older how often you do it I try to do it at least once a week but I often fail but two times a week in a good week okay yeah it's alright but I mix it in but I can't do one thing every day oh yeah bored mm-hmm so in order to stay active I just have to do a bunch of different things that make sense it's whether it's martial arts and running or lifting or whatever it is I feel like through time you like added those things in right yeah it was just like all right I'm gonna do this yeah the hill running is the most recent thing okay cool so what's Hale right English I take my dog running through the steep ass fucking and then you know sprinting up these it's the most ruthless workout right you know if you ever run hills yes yeah it's the worst thing I do yeah I don't like it sand dunes are the worst that's probably sucks it sucks you never get up there you see chief you keep pushing and you're pushing sand and pushing centers no hard you don't ever bounce off anything right you're just pushing through soft shit you try to find like balance and yeah that's some real martial arts shit though yeah for sure that's a mental shit exactly yeah you're learning about yourself when you're running up a fucking sand dune you're mastering a fucking moving thing things melting the whole time you're trying yeah yeah okay and you're forcing your body to do what your mind wants it to Iceland bitch I know you don't want to do this yeah you're gonna do this that's like I heard the Diaz brothers do some crazy shit like swimming oh yeah they do triathlons yeah look that Nick Diaz I think it's now five times they swam back from Alcatraz fuck that yeah Alcatraz and sharks barks that that's what I'm with you that's so crazy those guys are so crazy okay that's like you and the sand dunes though well I haven't do it I don't do sand dunes if I had one near me I would do it I've run hills which is definitely easier than sand dunes but it's still hard as fuck mm-hmm good steep ass hill it's the best for trinsic grass yeah dirt dirt rocks just anything yeah just just rails damn bro yeah I'm gonna get there someday come on any place I'll take you out we'll go running together I like to hike it's a it's a great workout man and the thing about it is it amps everything else out yeah so like it makes your kickin stronger there's more wind it just accentuates your ability to explode because you're running Hills right so you're always going up it's like you're doing these crazy plyometrics and then you just develop this that's forward a stronger power in your legs and your lower trunk yeah yeah more power yep that makes sense yeah I feel like I will fuck with it dude love it because I like to just tune shit out and just know yeah so like the pain from running up the hill would just I would be like yes yeah I'm not even gonna think about this I'm thinking about something else yeah well and you get a goal right you set a goal like a mile put yourself at one mile whoo and then turn around and go back for the other mile whoo yeah and if you can if you can do that on good steep-ass Hills when you're done you feel like you fought a battle with your brain whoo so you know you didn't want to do that but you hit it uh all right that's nothing compared to look some people do yeah my dog that's that sounds like you know some that we could unlock later on in my life I think for everybody doing something that's super strenuous yeah all the time is important yeah for sure for sure that's that's part of the reason why I fuck with training you know so much because it's not easy and it breaks you yeah but you reach points where it's like okay now I'm just cruising so I need another challenge like you're just sharpening the shit after a certain point so it's like all right now I'm gonna go run some sand dunes yeah swim from Alcatraz so yeah I get it there's dunes somewhere down there like Orange County or they're free Facebook's nothing to run a Manhattan Beach Park yeah that makes sense it's a park yeah yeah I was just there's a video of Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook train in there I was about to pull out yeah bullshit I want to see somebody run on those tunes Westbrook be doing it yeah all right good I know a lot of fighters do it in Australia I believe Robert Whittaker does it yeah see backwards when you doin shit like this you on Sam that is phenomenal in your body that's so hard to do man I'm dying that's so hard to do and I wonder if they're running with just socks on it looks like they oh yeah that's amazing that is difficult fuck man cuz that makes your feet strong because you just you've using every muscle in your toes to push through that sand that's difficult fuck there's levels to this life yeah that guys that's literally who's gonna go to the top or who's gonna stop in the middle yeah yeah fuck those little decisions you make every day I just seen my whole life just running up some juices there Mike yeah that was cool yeah yeah that's awesome it's like a mental martial art - yeah yeah yeah yeah Wow you're testing the mind hell yeah and like getting stronger at the same time yeah that's the cool part yeah so it's like you could be up here the whole time and you're building all of this and becoming more explosive and more dangerous yeah lighter on your feet and just when you started training and seeing these awesome benefits will you like ah damn it why wasn't I doing this all the time haha I'm actually happy that out that I waited for a little bit cuz I enjoy it it's not like old to me you know what I mean it's not something that I'm tired of that's a chore I'm still figuring out new shit like all the time and getting better you know what I mean and like for me I feel like the physical was probably like the first thing to come to me as like as a reward as benefit like I see the physical shit but now I was like the feeling that I get you know what I mean or like like we said like posture and balance and technique improving and shit like that so it's like learning that and feeling that and having that being a part of the process I'm happy that now is happening as opposed to being like old and played out to me right yeah yeah that's interesting mm-hmm I think you'd love it either way yeah I still love it I still love trying ever ever ever yeah I'm 51 i ha started training when I was really seriously when I was 15 oh shit yeah damn suck what the fuck was that doing yeah will you wrap it when you're 15 Wow when did you first get in this - that's one thing I really admire about a lot of rappers guys are always working yeah rappers are always in the studio hopefully that's like a big thing you know it's like there's a discipline aspect to it though I don't think that gets appreciated yeah yeah you have to be you're always in the lab a always working a constant it's like training you gotta be you gotta work at it it's competitive yeah you're a better than you got to be in a studio not work for producers you gotta become a new fucking knowing who's next and who's been like working with them and shit like that so like at the end of the day yeah it's a crap shit I've been in the studio since I was like 14 15 and there was times where my dad used to have to tell me like you'll get out of the studio like go play with your friends be a kid be normal like what I'm saying like there was times that shit happen and even now like I don't really do normal shit you know and I mean I might like go to the movies or like go to Dave & Buster's or something like that but like I don't do shit like I just go to the studio much rather just you know what I mean yeah create well that's amazing that you figured it out so young like yeah how old were you when you knew you wanted to be a robber uh I think I wasn't very great real shit I think I was a third grade that's made it to be a ninja turtle and I wanted to be a rapper I think a rapper was like a little bit more realistic I'm working on being a ninja turtle now okay that's amazing thing great it there great hold you in third grade again do you nine you know yeah yeah yeah that's when I started writing my first rap sesh it does hilarious yeah I was like watching music videos and I remember seeing like puffy and Biggie and Bunnell Thugs and harmony is like one of my favorite groups Wow I was like yo if I could do that I'll be all right and then um by the time I was like 13 that's when the internet was really popular so you could download like instrumentals and shit like that so you didn't have to like have Beats or anything mmm then they started introducing you know at-home equipment they have like a little tascam four-track little bullshit thing that you could hear me so I started fucking around on that mic doing my own little home studio then fruityloops came out started making beats Cool Edit Pro was like the the program back then before Pro Tools and yeah that's how I got my start like just in the fucking in the in the create just putting it together then I turn like then about the time I was like 16 I got like an internship at a UH at a studio in Pittsburgh where I was literally like answering the phones and running errands going to pick up like office supplies and shit like that and then return they will pay me with studio time so like I would just record like off you know me off the clock you know mean I had like four or five songs and that turned into a record deal Wow yep got my first deal at sixteen that's an amazing story as well that's that's a movie story mm-hmm that's crazy you're always new yeah yeah it was something that I worked out for sure because it was like being him in Pittsburgh you ever been a Pittsburgh yeah you know it's pretty crazy out there right crazy how like it's just a really wild city like the Midwest so it's like there's either a couple of things you can do and there's not a lot and working the job is like the last thing that anybody wants to do in Pittsburgh so all my cousins and everybody that I know do different shit than what I was willing to do I was like you know I'm not trying to be that guy like like that so it was like how am I gonna make away from myself you know the me how the fuck am I going to get still be fresh still you know me enjoy myself have a good time but be safe and like have fun it was music so it's amazing you nailed it yes and nailed it young yeah that's a beautiful thing to know what you want to do live and just be working towards it have for many people that's the real problem the real problem is like finding a thing near you know find anything they really love so much to me it all their energy into yeah I mean I'm blessed to grow up in a time to where technology was like taking over and shit and I think like if you're my age and you like make music or got a camera or you know I mean anything around that you good like and now I think it's like if you have anything to do a we'd like do not grow it if you could sell it if you could brand it if you come up with light technology or whatever it is like that's gonna be the future for this generation it's like pot there's gonna be a lot of that for sure it's it's gonna open up to everybody I think once they realize how much money there really is in pot and how safe it is in comparison the liquor and all these other established things that we've all no one has a problem with alcohol companies right no no no nobody has a problem with them nobody has a problem what you drink in that twelve fucking afternoon like I get on planes all the time people be like yo let me get fucked up on a plane fine we just have to shift attitudes yeah yeah people just have the wrong attitude about it they did they think it's something negative it's something that could be negative to some people but that's like everything else that's like food sex gambling everything shopping everything yeah shopping for sure people go crazy people lose their mind shopping yeah you can't buy enough things yeah buying crazy shit just cuz just cuz yeah that's that's as much of a addiction than anything yeah but pot can definitely for some people derail them I don't think it's for everybody nah it's a medicine so you gotta have a right dosage that's that's a good way of looking at and I think some people react to it weird - yeah I mean certain people's experiences aren't everybody else's experience so it's like if you got fucked up on weed that's you know it's like don't put that off on everybody else and I think like like anything it takes time to you know I mean like I can't take percocet because it's like that shit'll fuck me up because I don't do painkillers but I think over a certain amount of time if I had an injury my body would start to react differently to a certain amount of percocet but like off RIT it's gonna fuck me up you know Janice I'm gonna throw up I'm gonna do all types of shit but you know after a while you know I mean there's people who just pop that shit and just walk around like you mean normally that's a Malay with me smoking a joint there's like there's sort of people who could hit this and be in that corner for the rest of the day me i'ma go do everything that I have to do so it's a medicine it's a dosage and you have to train your body for it I think that's true but I also think some people might not react to it correctly in terms of like biologically yeah I think they might have an allergy like it might be like broccoli or something yeah there's people out there that are allergic to weird shit right there's some people I think that just I've heard of that that experience is not good for their like they're allergic to it I mean you know I'm just guessing I don't know I think it's opinion like if you if you believe it or not yeah I mean like if you want to believe that I feel like you're entitled to believe that and if you don't want to believe that then it's like okay cool you're that guy too okay I don't know yeah because it's like I'm on the fence because it's like you know on one hand people I mean I don't know fuck yeah yeah whatever it's medicine it's fucking medicine yeah and I like it there's a lot of people that like it yeah it's not what everybody thinks it is a wrong idea of it me one of the things I found out real early on is how many Jiu Jitsu guys smoke weed and do Jiu Jitsu yeah in the high-rollers state yeah yeah yeah yeah high-rollers has these awesome events where they do they smoke weed and then they fight yeah in the jiu-jitsu match yeah my partners are big part of that Lonnie and Brees and they're the ones who actually got me like kind of you know into fitness so to see them like and I'm the one who got him into weed so hey to see if I cross over I never would have known like you know I mean jiu-jitsu dudes like smoke weed and like we are about it like yeah there how's that she helps you Jitsu it really does another way it helps like slow it down for you right I don't even know if it slowed it down it's like it Tunes out the rest of the world okay you become freer it's very weird like more creative there's it's definitely it's better for rolling than it is for drilling guys just like when someone's trying to teach you something sometimes your brains just not taking it in right so you just high your brains not taking in but if you were sparring it would be good watching you just you flow better then yeah it's what makes sense that makes sense I haven't done jujitsu yet let me get there eventually you would love it and you got long limbs man you mean perfect for choking people yeah armbars triangles and shit let me get there you could do it yeah I totally fell for it I feel like I'm gonna just fuck with stand up for like a couple years and then just gradually do other things like yeah I'm saying yeah I'll just probably do jujitsu for like four or five years yeah for sure you should just learn some shit yeah it'll be great for you man yeah yeah you're like I said you're built for it that's the the perfect frame for fighters is long who seems to be if long as as long as you're strong it's like the John Jones frame that's the perfect frame right thank you it's so you can't get close enough to him he can hit you when he wants to and then when he grabs ahold of you he's strong enough to and he's better at wrestling he's gonna throw you around like if you could cut like that's the perfect the perfect combination is long and strong oh yeah perfect yeah wait dudes like Sarafian they buck that trend right tanks mm-hmm but the best it seems to me like just mechanically the best frame is the long frame so you have like the best frame for fighting Bucky ngratulations doesn't guarantee success but it's a fucking awesome base there we go I'm start I'm working with some Hey yeah just like short dudes like me can't put big guys in triangles I don't have enough legroom there's not enough like mechanically I'm sure you can figure it out not really give up on that one but long guys can get triangles from all kinds of places okay you'd love it super it's a thinking man's game - mm-hmm you know it's like you're playing a game yeah no yeah thing that I like about it too is that you can go full blast okay whereas like if you're sparring you don't really want to go full blast or hurt each other right you want to be tempered measured and just kind of touch each other but when you do sparring in jiu-jitsu because you're not striking each other you're just wrestling and grappling you guys go full blast okay it's amazing I'm ready bro yeah I'm super with it like a little bit that I've done I was I I cool I could see right you know I mean yeah yeah I'm down definitely got to go there I just loved the fact that you're interested in doing different things yeah for sure I'm a learner do you do read books do you do watch documentaries i watch documentaries you know I have read some books that I gravitate towards what kind of documentaries you gravitate towards like music really all always about always about music um let me see what else yeah it's always about music like musician searching for sugar man what was that one that was about this dude who was a guy who was making music but I want to say it was in the 70s and he had a like a little bit of buzz on his album and then it died off for him and he went back to work as a construction worker mm-hmm but his music became insanely huge in South Africa hmm he was a superstar and there was all these legends about him he was dead that he you know there's just crazy stories about who he was meanwhile this guy was working as a construction worker damn so in South Africa he's a fucking mega superstar like sells out arenas and a spoiler alert it's a great documentary to see it but he eventually goes to South Africa and does this concert there mm-hmm you'll cry yeah you cry yeah you're like oh my god you imagine this guy was working as a laborer hmm and the whole time was he was a superstar and he didn't even know it day and then the people see him they're singing along to his music I mean the guy's bolon away I would love that it's a crazy documentary I check that out it's it's insane to watch like how could this be true yeah a damn it's amazing I kind of feel like I heard the name but I never never never no never bro yeah it made me cry I gotta check that off at the end of it you'll be like wow oh hell yeah in this guy's experience yeah right it's almost like being released from jail or something it's like exactly damn yeah it's incredible holy fuck yeah I'm gonna check that out it's matin and see how comfortable he gets on stage - Wow there's amazing damn yeah his music is good - man very very interesting is he still alive I believe he is a lot as fire he's alive right yeah so he's able to see the proceeds from his movie and his yeah yeah yeah but someone said I think he gave away all his money really I've read something but that might be more of those rumors and and legends of legend another myth damn Jamie find out that dude gave his money away because I felt like I read that I was like bro but life to him is so surreal anyway truth may be felt like he couldn't be a real bona fide artist unless he gave away his money or something crazy over cuz he think I was living in like this that's why I don't want to do that ayahuasca or anything like that guy feel like that's what's gonna happen to me you want to give away your money like whoa no no that's hilarious yeah it's too tricky yeah you could you could get so you know so so charity driven and just give away everything mm-hmm and then you're working for charities mm-hmm just walking the earth barefoot yeah he's on tour last year touring theaters all over good shit Sugarman yeah he's back hey smacking so did he gave away all his money yeah Dave Matthews covered one of the songs oh yeah yeah damn he's doing good so he ain't give away nothing beautiful you might have but I don't the documentary is really amazing it's one of the best music documentaries I've ever seen perfect thank you yeah it's a good one tell me a good one my documentary oh it's called behind the cam yeah so Apple music oh okay hey did that I just did that I just did that beautiful man not I like to watch like I watch this Pink Floyd documentary about how they put together their albums and shit like that um there's another one about like background singers who never like became super popular but they're like part are part of songs that you hear and that you love and it's just like telling the story like how writers and you know I mean being a studio know what it's like to live that life it's really cool because I listen to harmonies a lot I don't know if when you hear music I hear like all the textures of it so it's like I get interested in like what goes on sometimes like in the background and that was a cool story um fucking what was the last one that I actually was I just watched I'm watching this show actually you ever heard Chernobyl I've heard hardly shows amazing that shit's kind of cool yeah I heard it's great it's pretty awesome but that's not music though what is that on is that Netflix so HBO HBO coming back Game of Thrones didn't kill them Chernobyl is it really yeah good I'll shows it it's all you need Lena is a big show HBO's back Chernobyl what is it about the accident yeah mmm how many episodes is it I'm not sure they're like streaming them now so cyclone no it's dreams yeah yep oh this one like the fourth or fifth episode I think yeah all those networks that don't stream everything yeah like they must be it must suck yo to have like a show that has to be on Thursday night and eight losing out just today so weird people want to watch things whenever they want it right now five-part miniseries the last episode is coming up this week how do you think the movie theaters will always be here mmm mmm shit no I want that I think eventually ain't gonna be gone what do you think I don't know just it's what I kind of I like that they're real you know that there's a place you go they've already kind of came and gone twice if you look around old Hollywood there's old theaters that aren't theaters anymore but there's new theaters that have taken over them but those buildings are still there for whatever reason we still use a number well people still like going to the movies yeah it's like an it's a night out thing yeah you know I just like it cost so much that I keep screen and actually put movies in there and you got the popcorn it's like but it's one of the few things that we do inst with strangers is like be a part of an audience it's like one thing the few things we're and we do with giant groups of strangers I think alike technology is like removing that because people don't like that I think people are uncomfortable with it because most the time we spend on devices yeah for sure communicating through devices and especially it were like virtual reality becoming more popular you know like people love access so it was like if you're making them feel like they're there like why would you want random dude walking across your lap when you can just be in the movie like yeah I feel like they would just fit spend that money on you know keeping you at home like where you want to beat it's just my opinion I don't know no I think you're right and I agree with you 100% but I also think as a community of human beings it's nice to have things that we all do together yeah it fosters like kind of getting along better and friendship I love that people that you don't know nothing that's what's good about sports I like concerts because the concerts yeah yeah yeah when you go to grow the whole group of people see something mm-hmm like it's nice you connect to tell yeah feels good baseball games cuz yeah I've had fun at games and not gave a fuck about what was going on but isn't the community that's going on for sure one percent that's what I mean I mean they never it's kind of drinking and I'm fun that is an important part of cities in those communities that's one thing that I think that it like a movie theater does provide yeah I mean for sure concert for sure and I'm not even mad that people don't really go to the movies like that now because it's like when you actually do want to go you can go and it's not full and it's not you know what I mean like it'll be people there but it's not overwhelming to the point where you got like it fucks up your movie experience so it's like it's kind of you know it's doable it's enjoyable it's it's handleable yeah yeah it's cool it's fun I like what movies is that right now I am worried that people are eventually going to all be living in some sort of a VR world yeah I mean I feel like it's design and to move that way right you know what I'm saying like you give people something and they're gonna use it and they're gonna get better yeah a new one yeah yeah it wasn't have extra feature yeah so it's like all right you know I get it like fuck have you fucked with any of that VR stuff yeah VR is awesome do you ever do that there's a thing outside of Disneyland where you there's a VR game that you go through you go through like this little like they have a like a giant room and the rooms set up for the what it was they called the void yeah holy shit avoid VR and there's a Star Wars one and there's a wreck-it Ralph one okay and they're hilarious I mean you're walking around you heat from fire pick up a plastic gun you're shooting at stormtroopers mm-hmm and you shit's crazy it's crazy and while you're doing it you like this is just step one exactly this is gonna be a saying yeah there's one here in those pieces yeah bits and pieces like they already have more you think that oh for show really one or two percent I don't think that really yeah why not because I think that what they're showing you right now state of the art they're selling it it's the best again it's in competition it's getting better and better all the time but that's a good way to look at it because they put it at myself I'm you know no worries man yeah I just think these people were very competitive yeah the the the the money is in getting the best shit out the quickest okay and they're all competing with each other so they're putting out like the bootleg version and letting somebody smarter test it work it and make the better version and they'll come back and do that later well that definitely happens to I mean that's what China does better than anybody yeah I take some shit and just redo it I'd be feeling like this is just my theory is like VR right it might be so fucking dangerous that they don't know like how it was enough yeah exactly so it's like they give us like little bits and pieces of it it's it's like lettuce you know they spoon feed it to us so you don't kill us in the world just go crazy and it's like you know what I mean like yeah because they probably tested it on somebody and they died like or you know what I mean for sure yeah they look like oh shit we went too far as I want let's like pull it back a little bit and just give them that like you said give them this version of it you know what I mean but I feel like there's more well I think when they when you really don't know what the fuck is going on that's with military stuff I think military stuff like weapons and you know space ships and aircrafts that they're developing mm-hmm we don't know what the fuck they're doing they're doing some shit that we have no idea right but I think with things like consumer electronics like technology I think what you see is what you get I think this is as good as they can do anything now they're working on the newest best shit right you know and that's coming around there was they're always constantly in development we're all competing against each other there's no way they would hold anything back really yeah I don't think so damn I feel like there's a phone that charges into second okay the way you have it out if you're in or war right and your cellular device goes down it's like you can't plug it in and charge it it has to like happen quick right right so like they have that is in my opinion they just don't give it to us but that all that stuff the I could see your argument because it's you're in a war they might have better batteries like that the military develop some new kind of batteries and that's possible but there's so much money in batteries mmm like there's so much money if they had a better way of doing it right if if Samsung came out with a phone right charged 100 percent in 30 seconds and it eating Apple would have to do we'd have to figure out how to compete with them right they would have that out I wouldn't hold on to that they no one would hold on to that Kyle was just dominating the powerful right it would dominate the mark it is powerful but that happens that's what it always happens me that's how blockbusters out of business right you know right right right that's why there's no more Tower Records mm-hmm although jumping in our lifetime yeah for show like 100% music isn't even physical right like and I make music and this doctor is not real right it's a sound yeah it's a sound and fuck you know I don't know that is a crazy way to look at music what is this the r17 Pro which the company's latest the fastest charging smartphone in the world it advertises that 35 minutes is all it takes to entirely fill up a dead battery I was 7 months ago so mmm so it's probably faster they got something like that for sure 35 minutes so what do you think they can do look for a full battery I would say that there's probably a hundred cell phones out there that can charge in five minutes there's not a million right as they can't source that much they may charge more than this can well yeah I would say like there's a military phone that they might have a hundred of them okay around the military but it's not mass per day and it can charge up in five minutes sure for sure for sure and if this can do 35 minutes I mean to me doesn't leap to me that shit is normal this is energy that we're talking about right right right bro like cars still move off of gas like that shit's like the Stone Age bro like shits going electric you know what I'm saying like that's not some spaceship shit so they mean like at the end of the day like they have this shit they just can't give it to you because they they're killing people testing it it's like it's like food you know that I mean like they have to approve this shit before it comes out but they have a car that goes here it just crashed into the wall you know what I mean and somebody died in and they're like well we can't put this on the street yet it's like all that shit energy yeah like what do you think they have a car that's so fast they can't put it on the street they had I just feel like transportation in general you know I mean communication transportation of Technology the way we hear music the way that we view things and shit like that our whole experience tech technology whatever the fucking word we're being spoon-fed FaceTime you know what I'm saying it was like you used to have to have the service to pet to FaceTime now everybody can FaceTime you know what I mean it's like people don't call each other no more they just FaceTime so we feel like oh man we came up this is this was bah-bah-bah like we feel good about that we feel excellent about it but there's more I feel like this just me I just feel like they're just sitting on it you know I mean oh wait and they give it to us I don't think companies have any reason to do that yeah the only reason to do that would be to get rid of the stock of the stuff authority selling that'd be the only reason because sometimes when companies announced a new products coming people stopped buying the old product like Corvette is having a problem with that right now okay because the Corvette let's call the zr1 right thing yeah it's a demon ridiculous you can go to a store and buy a car that has that much horsepower but a lot of people don't want to buy them because there's a new Corvette coming out in like a year right that's a mid-engine total read new design they don't want to be stuck with the old one gotcha people get weird yeah that's true so in that sense they might be holding out on what they're about to be able to do but like we saw with that foldable phone that Samsung tried to come out with mm-hm and then they had to take it back mm it's because it was so defective so many of them were breaking right a giant embarrassment and they pulled the whole thing right and now they're trying to rework it and figure out what to do with it that that's like if a company has something like that happened and that's the number two smart phone company in the were their number one right Samsung's number one Huawei's number two apples number three mm-hmm that's the number one cell phone manufacturer in the world and they got that kind of a fuckup there's no way they're not holding back anything I don't think so I think they're trying to sell the best shit they have right now and then they're in development with the next level shit right now but as far as like what they can bring to market what they have is what they bring the market and I think like those on-screen fingerprint sensors they didn't use to be able to do that now they can you just touch the glass and it reads it mm-hmm all that shit is like they're just trying to get it dialed in to the point where they could sell it to enough people and it doesn't break mm-hmm like like that stupid folding did you see that folding screen yeah it's like a fucking you could like it was a regular phone but it folded though yeah yeah yeah you know what fold opens like an iPod iPad yeah yeah yeah that's stupid but that thing kept breaking okay and you know when it came out everybody's like holy shit this is the future the glass bed I think there's like like you said there's like the the people who just freaked out about whatever is new right right and then there's like shit that really moves the you know I'm saying like like really changes shit you're not even sure and there's a huge difference between those like you got the people who just want the new shit and then you got motherfuckers who's actually like doing shit that changes things forever like streaming changed music forever you know and I'm saying so it's like mini disks and all of that other stupid shit that people were trying to do to change music it didn't work you know what I mean and it didn't exist so it's like the one thing that stands out and changes things forever that's what people motherfuckers remember I don't know if they're holding it or not it is what it is but like there's some smart motherfuckers who designed this shit for us you know what I'm saying you know and at the end of the day like that you got people who just consume it and they're just like oh man I'm here for whatever whatever like you know what I mean and then I feel like there's a lot of people who understand it and know how to play off of you know what I mean those people's emotions and that's where you get like you know I mean what we have now and me personally I love everything like I'm not a person who like it's stuck with the old shit or has to have all of the new shit either I'm just like obsessed with life in general like all of this shit fucks me up but it's crazy it's insane we live in insane time we live in insane time it's cool about today too is that we can go and still like appreciate and use some of the shit from the past like a record player yeah use a record listen to some old records right you know and then and realize that wow this is how people used to get their music sit in front of the record player with headphones on I remember being a kid doing them right right would listen to albums they open up the album looking at the art mm-hmm that was a big part of an album right was the photo lay out what was the the pictures were it's crazy I write things like the new shit ruins the older shit - right it's like people still enjoy everything yeah you know it's just stages of it I love that that old should exist yeah hell yeah go back and listen to some of that old stuff people don't watch tapes anymore though UHF that's that's not the move yeah those are dead and God vhses never once someone would give you a copy of a copy and it was all like it every now and then I have lines through it and shit you get like second third generation copy friends yeah VHS is our done bro you've every I don't know if you remember this but you used to be able to buy movies right after they came out especially in New York because dudes would sit in the back of the movie theater like the little bootleg join us yeah yeah yeah watch the movie from like it was like a video camera be like in their video and the movie yeah yeah that was that was crazy that was a crazy time getting more hide and shit back then they were using all of their technology as everything they had that was everything they fucking had the crazy thing is that's not that long ago terms of the human race that's not that long ago that's the 90s that's that's so this is what 2019 is I was 20 years so you go back 23 24 years maybe imagine if you could see what the fuck 24 years from now is it's crazy I related to like when I was younger in the 90s because I was like a baby in the 90s I wasn't even a teenager so 20 years from then was the 70s yeah and shit was totally I'm saying so it's like now from 20 years from for that to be the same timeframe like that shit is crazy to me you really wanna know how crazy it is man get yourself into like a 1970 Plymouth mm-hmm and drive that thing and realize that in 1970 that's how people drove they drive this thing they like it barely knows where where you're sorry yeah hell yeah I do this with the steering wheel I didn't even power steering and in the 60s and shit bro like yeah a lot of them didn't yeah a lot of them didn't but do you those cars were terrible and that was just a few years ago I mean in terms of like human history right if you in a block of time in history like if you look at the difference between 1820 and 1840 in our head it's like that's the same shit mm-hmm 1820 1840 what the fuck was different there was nothing different yeah but if you look at our generation yeah 40 years ago to now it's insane true that's it since it doesn't make sense it's nuts it's a bear we're barely the same thing bro it's crazy it's crazy have you driven the Tesla no I have it very good the preposterous it's a preposterous car what's the deal with them there that's so fast it doesn't make sense really every other car you drive afterwards will feel stupid you could drive mine yeah yeah you drive it their dad legit it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever driven in my life fuck it doesn't make any noise it doesn't make it makes zero noise it's a fucking rap music video entourage style girls in their underwear house dancing bottle the champagne a girl in my house just follow you to the camera just to see who rings your doorbell what were we just talking about Teslas oh yeah yeah it's a spaceship it's next level if you think that they're holding back anything in the automotive world drive that thing that's C nah that's that's the thing I feel like all cars are gonna look alike and they're gonna look like Tesla's mmm so you're gonna have this superfast woman for like the elite motherfucker but they're gonna have like regular ones and then we're all gonna have the same car we're all gonna have the same fun we're all gonna have the same watch and well because it controls everything like you're they control your house so it's like everything is integrated the TV the Xbox that's like you all want it in one so the only way to do that is for everything to be the same so like if the Tesla is that ill I never drove driven one but if it's that ill I don't see why people wouldn't be into it like it's just the pain the acids it takes a long time to charge okay is it I mean even if you have a test little supercharger thing like I one a wall-mounted charger that's it's like more answers height it's nice but it still takes a few hours to charge if it's almost dead okay well where as you can get gas in like five minutes exactly don't they have like portable chargers no no no you needing same amount of power tell Howard that thing but how long giant batteries in it it takes hours and hours to fill up that doesn't sound like fluid well because it goes 317 miles you see this race they did with the tunnel is that two Tesla's at the same spot like I guess it's in Hawthorne where they have it the one on the right is using the tunnel they have use leader than the one who left is going above ground now is this tunnel like auto-drive yet so I fuck I think I kept those tracks on the side so that it could stay oh look how fast at 127 miles an hour I'm so not comfortable with that and it slows right down the way that it moves differently that's how robots are gonna kill us that's crazy it's so fast you can't believe how fast it is that's it that guy's not moving at the top and the guys moving very fast take some four and a half minutes to go the same time it takes this guy of minute I hope that guy's battery's dead as fuck on the right I'll tell you that if you stomp on that thing for that long you better be prepared for that shit to drain quick especially when it's in ludicrous mode that's what they call it ludicrous mode yeah and now they have Ludacris plus I don't even want to turn that shit on I don't need that what kind of assholes unhappy with ludicrous mode doesn't ask before don't you think there's some car company trying to beat them yeah well be right Tesla has a roadster have you seen the Tesla Roadster oh my god Jaime pull that up it's a spaceship it's just little sports car looking spaceship that goes 0 to 60 in 1.9 seconds it's a spaceship it's a spaceship that's the Tesla Roadster yes I like that it's a dope looking little car the roof comes off - that's real oh my god that thing's a demon what I think is a Dean how much does that cause I think it's $200,000 it's real yeah it's not out yet I'm working on it oh ok they're working on releasing it soon yeah 200 grand look at that 1.9 second zero to 60 yeah I don't need they just seen the electric cars it seemed like the future but again that one's gonna be interesting cuz it has six hundred miles it you know six hundred and sixty miles I think without without charging which is long-distance minds like 317 ok the ones they have they are like three seventeen that's dope yeah that's amazing it's wild like my mind is literally blown by the shit yeah make mine too like for real like that shit blows imagine imagine if you're one of those people that makes those things yeah like that's your job I feel like it's like really a process like scientific like you know cuz you don't want to buy you to hurt themselves something you know what I mean so you have to get it just right sure I was like what's the process of that like what are the fuck are they doing like with technology in in electricity in a car yeah and they have all these safety features they've Auto Drive that's the thing so it's gonna be so fast gotta have a hella safety Jesus Christ I can't turn this thing off oh there it is the same girl I don't know she's persistent she's a go-getter I don't know she gonna go get some knows but yeah man I mean it's when you drive something like that and you realize like oh okay just 30 40 years ago cars are these stinky weird things that barely steered right and now you have these things that it seem like they seem like they're from a futuristic movie mm-hmm and you can get them right now it's crazy uh like it's insane because people like okay what are we gonna be without transportation we got to go somewhere right we got to get there somehow what is this Jamie I was looking up I thought I saw something today about a Lamborghini electric car but this fell into this hole of the terzo Milenio some new it is electric car by Lamborghini that self heals it has some sort of carbon fiber technology that allows it to fix itself if it cracks while it's dry I don't know oh yes we text cracks and damages we go it's a fucking transformer there we go it's a transformer it's gonna heal itself out when you'd heard of it no self-healing oh my god there we go he's gonna fix itself sorry to distract from that but yeah but it's Italian right yeah listen to me that's my people it ain't gonna work those savages it looks the same though this they're thinking big if you want to go on a long trip in a Lamborghini you're out of your fucking mind that thing will leave you in the middle of the desert they think and be that's it yeah that is a tease weird unbelievably good-looking car like tires are god damn that looks like the future that's fire look at that thing so spaceship but you if you take one of those you know that it's made by Italians right you know [Applause] it's the accent with the car it makes it it's so flamboyant look at the wheels on that thing what the fuck is with those wheels wow that's crazy an Italian spaceship yeah yeah cars are getting closer and closer to spaceships yeah what if people start flying around you comfortable with that I'm not want anybody landing on my house landing on the house air Accidents yeah man those don't seem too good no in the regulation of what Lane you staying yeah we worked so hard to develop these roads like we're huh where are we going now like what's going on here do you imagine if we had like a floating bubble highway system right like there's a these balloons held on by by rope that go all the way to the ground and that marks the pass where you're allowed to fly your own car through huh but people don't look and they slam into each other or not man you're out there in the park with your heads regulation would suck on that yeah man how do you stop people from they would have to be autonomous it would have to be like Tesla Auto drive so it just takes you up and it just brings you around mmm would have to be something like that that makes sense yeah we couldn't leave it up to people not with flying hell no it's too many different personalities yeah but then it's gonna be lazy people that don't charge they're fucking flying car and then it gets up there and it's like that did that that that that like you didn't charge it you shouldn't be able to take off if it's not at a certain but if it's if it's capable of dying I agree ground it then when you're gonna need more regulation so we have more government ha ha air laws have to that's the only way may we need more government more regulations air cops oh my gosh the air police let's not talk about those air police they'll be even more on edge the ground in the ground police oh yeah yeah cuz they're there in the air yeah yeah they're probably gonna be super paranoid up there or sure for sure well if we ever do eventually get to space travel if human beings ever do figure out how to like go to other planets to set up a civilization on Mars or something that's probably what the real next level future of humanity is gonna be push other than artificial life if we can really figure out how to set up a base somewhere mm-hmm do you think you would ever go if there was a base on Mars it takes six months to go to Mars if there was a threat on Earth a threat yeah it was like you know earth is about to be fucked up like an asteroid yeah I would you know I would if if Mars was alright I would try to go I would take my family and go yep totally Wow to save my family that makes sense to save your family yeah whatever yeah what if Mars was awesome what if they figured it out if it was awesome yeah I rather just die on earth yeah I'm cool here oh yeah I'm good yeah I just wonder once they actually do start going from Earth to other planets how many people are gonna be willing to do that rich folks you think so I think rich folks want to go into orbit I don't think they want to go to Mars I don't think there's a way to live there just mate maybe if you can come back let's say we're far in the future vacation yeah take a little vacation to Mars it takes money to get there everybody you think if it takes six months to get there hold on that's another one so long I think I think a lot of people would do that I think a lot of people would do it I think you're right if they knew they could come back because then they'd be able to brag about it mm-hmm people would love to brag about going to Mars it's like that time-travel thing we're like take six earth months get their butt over you it's like two weeks oh I don't think it works that way but yeah I was wondering how doesn't have to be like at the speed of light yeah yeah now again Dee interesting you might be able to go save some time if you do do that you could lose some time though I know that's a fact like if you go into space at a particularly high rate of speed and then you figured out how to come back like your brother your twin brother would be way older than you mmm yeah damn yeah that makes sense I want to see this Brian Cox show do you know Brian Cox's the astrophysicist he had a show he did in LA and in the back they have this gigantic screen and it's this real high-resolution screen and it showed all of the galaxies in the universe it showed all them that you know just all jammed in together with like appropriate space in between them and you look at it and you just go what what the fuck is that we're in that thing we're one dot in just trillions of dots of all these other galaxies data through the known universe I've never seen anybody show it that way mm-hmm and one of the things he talked about was that the rate of time is not the same for each person even on earth like depending on where you go and what you do what speed you travel at if you and I were born on the exact same day and we both got a watch and that watch was perfectly calibrated and you put your watch on and I put on my watch on then we met when we're 80 if our watches are still working the time would be different mm-hmm because we've lived through different time and it might be only increment like a tiny increment like a second or a couple seconds but enough so that in the the whole unit a no sighs fuck so while I'm there watching this thing the whole thing just blew me away I was like this is a crazy way to look at the universe this is it right here ah yeah if anybody gets a chance to view that's just one galaxy that they're showing those it's a one galaxy colliding with another galaxy it's fucking spectacular whoa yeah [Laughter] do you get in the space documentaries about to you got to I just don't believe everything that everybody tells me so what about shit like that so I would have to get it from a reliable sports source you would have to tell me like the good okay space shit any Neil deGrasse Tyson ones Lawrence Krauss has got some good stuff he's got good audiobooks to that Brian Cox guys as good as it guys he's a genius he used to be a musician okay he's actually in like a pop band okay I think in the 80s in the 80s yeah like a popular pop band and he's a legit astrophysicist he just talks about space yeah he gives these very entertained with this guy Robin ins and they have this like stage show mm-hmm and you know he comes out and talks about things and explains things but explained when he explained that time thing to me that if we live the same life that our watches would be different yeah that's crazy I love shit like that I'm writing his name down Brian Cox CEO X not like the dicks yeah I wouldn't put that name in there course that could be a problem yeah if you get a chance to see that show man it's it's a it's a good thing to see too because it's so different than anything else you go to see like for me I'm always at comedy clubs I'm always hidden you know either in the audience or on stage so to be there at this place in the audience of this weird kind of like show slash science seminar and it's amazing now it's time yeah that shit seems crazy as fuck to learn it laughs yeah I gotta I gotta get you on some science documentary oh yeah when you're smoking weed and watch the science documentaries that'll help my music listen the real thoughts come out kids we realize there's no getting away if you if you you know that paranoid feeling that you get sometimes you get too high if you have that paranoid feeling combined with a science documentary on space hmm then you realize yeah we're we're all very insignificant exactly and you seem extra high because you're high watching space yeah it's like you others do too stars how have you gotten high your whole life I started when I was 16 when you were 16 mm-hmm I started smoking every day wow they're so right around the time where you were becoming successful as a rapper mm-hmm it was really like high school because I hated school and I was just so done with it and I was selling pot and my mom found out and she was lowkey just super cool with it was like like I smoke you smoke we smoke and you mean wow it actually helped me get through school like to make it made it tolerable right sure I was able to deal with like the shit that I didn't want to deal with because I'm an intelligent kid I just really didn't like school I didn't like the school that I went to was good I went to a nice school but it was just I grew up in a time where it was like mmm saying was we're so well every school for every kid is not what you want to do every day it was just not what you want to do every day and like you got teachers who say certain things to you and it's like all right I understand what I'm really here for you know I mean and I see Who I am to you and you let it be known it's kind of hard to like take those people serious and want to do the work and all Russians want to follow their lead yeah that's like for me that was the bare minimum was like graduate high schools like I could move on with the rest of my fucking life after that yeah we'd help me get through high school hey everybody help me I believe you yeah it makes sense yeah there's a lot of shit that's not that fun but when you're high becomes interesting a lot of shit yeah yeah it's why air travel air travel is always better when you're high way better way better and you could take THC pills you gotta bulls you do whatever you will come like appreciative of the experience exactly yeah yeah yeah just be up there flying for real yeah uh there's something to me about music listening to music - in a plane while you're high hmm she said it has like extra impact putting headphones on a plane surrounded by all these people no one's talking flying through the sky going 500 miles an hour and 30,000 feet above the rocks and that music kicks in hmm yeah yeah something about old music - for me like like lately I've been getting into a lot of like really old rock and roll mm-hmm you know just lit just imagining what it would be like to like to be around those being alone you know see Keith Richards and Mick Jagger in the 70s or you know see Little Richard mmm to see James Brown's live hell yeah James Brown perform a lot mm-hmm yeah yeah there was nothing it's hard for us to imagine there was nothing like that before them mmm you know mm-hmm like there's there's levels of like impact that those early musicians have that it's hard to really historically put into place because there wasn't anybody like them before that nope no rock-and-roll stars no rap stars mm-hmm think of how reason that is yeah super new stand-up comedy is only about maybe like 70 years old shit like that maybe maybe really maybe you could say a hundred if you want to get crazy hmm but rappers like 30 30 years old 40 maybe maybe Ford yeah yeah and it keeps evolving names of origin yeah like music in general my favorite genre is like pop music like I love anything that could be considered pop because it changes with the times but you have these mega stars you know what I mean who just transcend like like it's like soul they're beat there's larger than life like Michael Jackson you know I'm saying like he's bigger than just music you know I mean like and you you become a legend like as time goes on but like to be a living legend like living in those times and to be around those people that are really hear their music and experience them in shit like that I feel like that shit is crazy and it's like it's a gift like for the fans it's a gift to be that person it's a responsibility as well but just like to be the one like like Beyonce you know I mean yeah like that shit is crazy to me like to be the one yeah yeah Michael Jackson was the one when there was no one before mm-hmm there was no real one like him I mean there was Elvis and that's about it right it was other ones that were big it was very popular very famous but Michael Jackson transit he transcended so hard I was listening to WB CN radio in Boston as a rock and roll station and they were like I know as a rock roll station but this song is so fucking good we're gonna play it anyway yeah and they played Michael Jackson yeah and we're like wow he'd been performing as a kid so he worked his whole life to get yeah to be what it would look like 30 or something like that one yeah probably when he was on his PGA there was no there's no roadmap for him ah that shit is amazing amazing and he did you know funk music and he went to disco wow yeah yeah man and I would have loved of seeing him live before the controversy right you know just to just experience him as an artist yeah without having anything attached to it yeah what he did or didn't do I don't know what he did right you know have no idea right doesn't look good right but I would have loved have seen him without the burden of that filming it must have been insane and only just to just to see like he was like a like weird saying it needs to be a different word for work mm-hm you know because sometimes does not work right passion price just it's way better than work mm-hmm he's a different you should have a different word for a star yep because he was like a supernova yeah he was some rare thing yeah yeah yeah that might happen once every hundred years yeah yeah yeah there's legends like Elton John watts do right didn't fucking there's lay all kinds of legends well then there was Michael Jackson right he was above all of them yep it was a mania yeah kids would dress like him everybody wanted to wear those thriller jacket right right yeah there's an art to it I feel like every musician has a choice like if they want to go there with it right yeah I feel like L like the Elton John's and like even like prints and shit like that they stay true to exactly who they were not that Michael Jackson didn't stay true to who he was but he put himself into he put himself out there for the world he did everything he dad car toons mm-hmm PS sneakers he had he did everything you know out of the Beatles music yeah he bought yeah like you know I mean fucking dude on other people's music yeah but I yeah hell yeah he was doing the hell of shit yeah I just think there was no roadmap for the poor guy right you know yep when you're living in that fantasy world that nobody else can understand right right and there's no one before you and then everywhere you go people screaming mmm-hmm he never had a break done there's no breaks there's no you can't do it he couldn't do anything no no no not normal nothing that's crazy that was so the I wonder if that what that would be like into like if Michael Jackson came around today I mean didn't exist before he would for sure be a huge star but I wonder if it would be as crazy because there's so many more stars now than there were back then mmm-hmm because of the internet because just more venues and outlets for musicians for me for basically everyone for comedians for everyone right there's more outlets yeah so because it's more outlets there's more famous speech right I wonder if he would be as correct it would be as insane because back when he was that famous it wasn't like anyone that was parallel not even close mm-hmm no man what do you do listen to old stuff yeah listen to I like we I'll do like 90s R&B now I like funk music I like like Bootsy Collins alright I love Jimi Hendrix he's one of my favorites I like Curtis Mayfield Marvin Gaye freaking cool in the game fucking I listen to everything bro I like a lot of the older soul music like The Spinners Patti LaBelle you know I'm sampling I was raised on everything my dad listen to Bob Marley he listen to freakin oh we listen to a lot of sting in the police really yeah I love staying he's one of my favorites just the auto jams you know what I'm saying like the classic shit like you could put on any song like for real for real and I fuck with it because I listen to a lot of different music and yeah oh yeah Marvin Gaye man yeah he's one of my favorite he was phenomenal yeah and Marvin Gaye was really good and this is tragic story that was crazy his dad shot him it's so crazy I I dated a girl once this girl was so nuts mmm and I we were talking about shot okay no no we were talking about Marvin Gaye you know saying that's like it's so insane that his dad shot him and she said imagine what a piece of shit he had to be for his dad to shoot him Yeah right and I was like what I go no no no no no no no why would you assume he's the bees each it was dad fucking shot if he's a piece of shit why does his dad just get away from that's shooting him his dad's a piece of shit like but it was amazing she was like instantly thinking he's a piece of shit yeah like I'm like I don't get your logic it's really she's someone who grew up with a good she's still loved her down uh-huh she was close with her dad yeah so I was like that what I don't know my dad so doesn't to me I'm like that dad shot him because he was Marvin Gaye and he's probably upset that his son had become Marvin Gaye truth imagine being Marvin Gaye - we all your songs are like the best music - fuck - yeah and he didn't have there was nothing there was no slide into the dm's now they had to find him physically yeah but he seemed like kind of like a faithful guy like you seemed like he would find like one shake yeah just fuck her right album about it that would be a good narrative mm-hmm I think it's hard for those dudes if they're singing about fucking all the time it's coming their way they usually like just wanna fuck one girl like that right those those love songs yeah exactly when the music's dark like easy either you mean they he's fucking mad bitch he wasn't like this one he was known as Marvin Gaye that was all I remember he said sexual healing I mean when you get that feeling he needs sexual healing but the shit made him feel better yeah when he was with her that's a big difference between the NWA's first album sexually there's some shit from like the early gangster rap days you listen to today like woah yeah yeah like this is this is crazy stuff mmm I remember it at the time when it was first coming out mm-hmm and no one knew what like no one could understand there was no music like this before and then all sudden you have iced tea yeah that was before date what the freaking parental advisory on there they made that because like there's like your parents make sure y'all check this out before your kids get it it was Al Gore's wife it was tipper gore mm-hmm it was she was the one who was in charge it was like she was leading the charge yeah against I think it was her make sure I'm right about that is it I'm not mad at that that may wrap music better you think so oh yeah it's like made it more dangerous I'll be put to the extreme yes these shoes they were trying to irate at our movie they're trying to ban some stuff though they were trying to ban some using like oh well that was Florida or it is crazy don't fuck around in Florida they catch you in Florida yeah they arrest people for anything you can get it rested for obscenity in for I'm straight I'm good not going in Florida Florida was a go but I'm not going crazy in Florida yeah Braddock County yeah yeah just don't get arrested for swearing yeah that's what they got to Live Crew for explicit lyrics yeah fuck I'm good or no forget about that right yeah like those guys would like the Lenny Bruce of rap right like Lenny Bruce's a guy want to get arrested a bunch of times for stand-up comedy he wouldn't change his words and his you know swearing on stage for the court that was 2 Live Crew never going to jail for like for rap yeah that's crazy it's crazy for saying some for saying something somebody doesn't like it so they want to put you in a cage Wow cuz they don't like how you're saying wow they don't like what you're saying they don't like how you're saying it like could you arrest someone if they just that's somewhere what if there in the comfort of their own house mm-hmm and they said the things that are in that mm-hmm is that illegal yeah could you yell it out the window yeah could I Drive down the road yelling it out the window right should be able to it should be able to fuck are you to tell people they can't do that but then Florida they're like nope obscenity rap Florida's

everybody gets Lyme disease out there yeah damn I don't I don't know I never thought about that but the shit hits the fan I love California tsunami rolls over us maybe I'll go to Australia every time I'm on the highway nowadays and it's jammed up bumper-to-bumper I just say imagine something happened mmm this is just Thursday there's no regular Thursday and it's bumper-to-bumper yeah imagine if some shit went to have you fucked up you wouldn't know what to do when it rains out here people don't know they panic they slam into each other drive it's like dog it's just rain it's just water coming out the sky oh Jesus Christ it's a strange place to live right because people aren't tested out here by climate yeah yeah on the East Coast they're tested by climate yeah yeah that winter comes that's snowy wind comes you gotta fucking ride you got to winterize your car yeah got to get snow tires don't know about that 350 tornadoes last week where ya heard about in the Midwest where every tornado alley shit yeah they got framed up yeah I was like Ohio and where else Kentucky I think it bunched handing out roses here he got hit hard yeah man I mean I don't know if that's really because of climate change those are ramping up but if they've ramped up in unprecedented levels like that and it becomes impossible to live in Ohio or Kentucky or anywhere with this tornadoes you imagine I'm nuts that is if we find out that the center of the country it's just tornado like a tornado bowling area Wow bowl filled with tornadoes Florida you're just dodging hurricanes most of the year basically lucky if happened where you are yeah you get lucky yeah you're a dick sticking out into the ocean and right where all the tornadoes deformed or all the Hurricanes conform they it's like warmer waters right here we go we'll get started right here yeah fuck hurricanes I've been in a little baby hurricane before and I was living in Boston which is pretty far away from the ocean in terms of where my house was and it's still it was like wow yeah and I was a little baby one it was nothing by the time it got to us it was nothing I lived in Japan for two years and there's gonna have some crazy fucking earthquakes over there oh really why you were there yeah they had earthquakes and typhoons you saw both yeah fuck yeah oh yeah wait was an earthquake bug bad you've never been in one here yeah I've got a baby one I look like a 5.5 bro like I'm talking about whole room just shaking like it's like a ride or a universal light because you see shit moving it's like damn is this really happening and this shit happens bro like the earthquakes over there are insane wow man you know and they get some crazy rain like when the typhoons come that shit gets really violent yeah yeah yeah the Japanese are you know they they hold it down and said what were you doing living over there my parents are military my mom was in there for a little bit but then she got out and my dad was in there he got out but remarried so that's how I stayed in the military thing was my stepmom and I would move we would live on base you know I mean for like two years or whatever and then I would move back with my mom Wow what was it like living in Japan it was crazy like it was fun I lived in the late 90s so it was like when technology was first changing mic music was just now going into mp3s and shit like that so there was that Pokemon was really popular over there yeah it was fun like just being a kid like running around fucking it up in Japan it was cool man that's funny as hell that's a and an interesting little extra level to your brain right yeah you grew up those two years in a completely different kind of culture yeah so have a different understanding of what's possible right a lot of percent I think that's so big for show them shit yeah yeah how about a lot for sure it was cool it has to right as far as your perspective uh-huh it's being around well I've only been a Tokyo for a few days only once when I was like this is one of the trickiest place I've ever been in my life phrase so interesting it was crazy living there was wild like no TV like regular TV they don't got any like American TV stations so for two years I was just like haha disconnected yeah like I didn't have shit yeah and this is so this is before Netflix and everything to write more YouTube mmm Wow yeah that's amazing yeah it was probably really good for you nice sucked I couldn't watch wrestling but it was really good for your brain no no I need it I need my entertainment fuck that I need to be a part of the world hahaha I couldn't buy all the CDs and shit that everybody was listening to it was it was wack did you learn to speak Japanese this a little bit yeah yeah Wow baby Japanese just to get around a shit but I forgot it though you forgot it all it not all of it well it'll come back if I like yeah I mean you run me through it but I can't sit here and say no Japanese words how hard was it to learn it wasn't difficult no no no it's not difficult reading it is difficult oh yeah a friend because they have symbols or characters so it's like one character means like three of our words um Wow yeah yeah and then they have like three different styles of writing it too so it's like we have print and cursive they don't know re different ones oh that sounds so annoying yeah it's weird on one hand you don't want it to go away because it's an ancient language but another hand you like you clean this up simplify this ship I honestly think they got it down pat you know they said LD want us to have a fucking know that shit you know I'm saying like at the end of the day that I we'll learn English if we want to but if you want to learn Japanese it's gonna be difficult bro I want to learn some Asian language because I buy reading like Twitter messages mmm from you know how much the many more characters they had yeah they can write books yeah 140 characters like how many words is that though yeah you know that's a lot of fucking words if it's 280 so I mean 280 are those Asian with this Chinese or Japanese those little symbols it's a lot of talking man yeah and it's hard to put like the ingredients on shit oh yeah do they have symbols for numbers or just use numbers I forgot what the numbers look like I think it symbols really yeah yeah like not imagine that is like 1 2 & 3 oh wow right yeah you know I never even thought of that yeah what does what is uh let's go with Japanese does Japanese does the japanese language have symbols that record numbers like you would write the letter the letters th r ee 4 3 like that like you would write 3 or you'd be the number 3 mm-hmm do they have that in Japanese not cuz Japanese like each each knee son she there's different different whole different words for it so it's like one is Ichi so this symbol where have you spelled that in Japanese I'm starting to kinda remember what it looks like now do you think if you could move back there right now you just get right back and explain things after a while sure David Lee Roth moved there van Halen the lead singer yeah he moved down there and took kendo lessons mmm he lived there for like more than a year I would probably appreciate it more now as an adult do you think so yeah yeah cuz that's the kid you kind of just want to run wild and do everything that's right on TV but oh he must be an annoyed you were stuck there it was kind of weird you know what I mean I was 13 like when I go crazy it was fun for a little while but yeah you want to go back home you mean of course but as an adult I feel like I would I would benefit a lot more from it a so at this stage of your career when you're when you're looking at like what you're putting down when you're making albums when you're putting together your music like what what excites you the most about it um I'm a huge fan of music in general so I get just inspired off like production and shit like that like the newest producers and shit mm-hmm like cuz I like to go out I like to enjoy myself I like that fun so whatever is poppin like at that that time whatever the sound is whether it's West Coast inspired or if it's down south inspired I'm just interested in finding my own way of doing what's new and what what my fans would love for me because like as a music person you want something new every time you don't want the old shit all the time you could go by that so I just love creating and just coming up with what's new you know what I mean like I work with the newest producers I work with the newest artists I work with you know I mean I try to I try to make my shit sound different every time I always tell my engineer I'm like yo let's fuck with the shit sonically so it don't sound the same as the last album like alright come up with new ad-libs or just different shit to just kind of keep it fresh still do what people know me for you know what I mean but it's like just coming up with new ways of doing that I get excited that's awesome here mm-hmm I love it when someone loves what they're doing and it comes out great yeah thanks it's beautiful seeing it it really is and that to me is one of the most inspiring things that I get out of any artist it's like hearing them talk about their process right no I get I always get jazzed up I love it it's crazy for me because like there's different ways to do what what I do like I have so many ways like I could sit there and just come up with some shit like brand new or I have like this the Oriole commercial with my son where it's like there's a team of people who like come up with what could be the best for me and I just do that shit and then it just goes crazy you know I mean it's like see you again is one of my biggest songs and that song I like eight different people on it but I wrote two verses that the person who made the original song I wrote two verses for it that they loved more than anybody else's song I mean anybody else's so they gave me the whole record and it ended up being my host I mean one of my biggest songs you know what I mean so it's like the process of just like putting yourself in the situation and just being my alright cool that's work that's beneficial as as beneficial as being you know I mean a creative just okay I'm gonna do what I do you know I mean sometimes you got to step outside of that and just use your talents it's like being an actor or you know what I mean like you just fill in that spot that people need you in and I'm kind of at that point in my career because I worked so hard and grinded and done so many things and come up with so many waves and ideas that didn't exist before now I could use other people's ideas and just be myself and still and get you know a really big effect and everybody is happy beautiful yep dude you live in the life - got it nailed Elian graduation oh yeah I had a great time talking to you - very nice thank you that's it everybody bye idea [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
