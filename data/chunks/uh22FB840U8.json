the girag and experience and so when you ask me do i infiltrate it's like no do i do i watch a steady diet of fox news no do i read right wing your sites all the time no do i try to read stuff from all over the world from different ones of you yeah yeah why Greg cuz it's interesting hmm you don't have to agree with everything you read and I always say this to people about comedy do people that come and see you and don't like your politics and then get up and a half and fuck off I always think you're not sophisticated right you're not sophisticated I don't mean that in like a smart or like you went to college way I mean there are people who have no education who can understand a whole bunch of ideas at once and see the humor of mm-hmm you know what I mean well there's some people there's lunge you cannot cross their pea brains won't allow it but that's what I mean like competi subject at off-limits mostly I find that if you are disagreeing I remember last year or two years ago when the election was going I did a joke in Eugene OR Portland no one of the places Morgan it wasn't eugene which is wicked liberal but it was a like clam flan or the fuck it wasn't Oregon it was a city in organ and I I said something I said the Republican nominees aren't just the worst group of nominees I've ever seen from the Republican Party in my lifetime there the ruse group of people I've ever seen in a room you know and started to go through them and when it was Herman Cain a new camera and someone in the back yelled no it looks like no you don't get to veto jokes and a guy I'm not kidding a guy wrote me the other day on my email like I take email from people and I read it I don't know his answer but any wrote I was at your show and Chicago and it was podcast so my focus is not advertised as a stand-up show it says podcast mm-hmm you know like and therefore there's a different thing that's happening uh it's a lot more real and you know as you know Anna here ebony said odd i didn't spend this twenty bucks or whatever to hear your fucking politics and I didn't think was very funny and anyone that would like to show behalf wit and shit so normally i would just block them you know but i thought i'm gonna ride him back and i wrote your hostile tone is not conducive to discourse and understand this you chose to come in the room and you pay it if you'd ask for a refund of the time that's another matter and I go and by the way for the show's over you don't get to email the artist and ask for your money back because you disagreed with them you take your chances whether you go to see a symphony or a movie or a fucking whatever it is you're gonna go to see man when you go to Jack in the Box you might not like them sausages but you don't get too fucking right me after and tell me you want your money back and then say every one that liked it was a moron when he was the only one who didn't like it you know and it's like I don't understand that well there's always going to be people that can't wrap their head around the idea that there's different people and different people like different stuff yeah and if you don't like something it's okay there are other people enjoying it well then you know that's for them it's not for you right but the anger like letter like I didn't I don't like your politics on fucking that wasn't very funny and the people are assholes and he's just sending that letter you're an asshole didn't mean you might want to tell when he friends like I didn't have a good time just talking all this liberal shit trayvon martin's by the way than not yet denied i did it was a the 50th anniversary of the march of on washington for jobs and freedom and i played a clip of Martin Luther King's Speech the part I have a dream and shit you know because I didn't think the crowd had heard it before cuz a lot of young people haven't heard it I have a dream exactly and everybody listened really intently and I thought this is what you objected to objected to the biggest cry for peace in the last fuck in 50 years that the the idea of getting out of your own way that's a big one how'd you figure that out I mean probably the same way you did you know I mean I think it's the it's anybody that's trying to do anything in art or you know filmmaking painting whatever it is you find or sports or golf particularly you find that the tendencies to try too hard right you're so you want it so bad you don't want to screw up you want to get it right you want to you know not embarrass yourself right so you wind up trying trying trying so hard that nothing comes you know and finally like over over time I'm sure this is the same for everybody you kind of sadie's up man i just have to lighten up a little bit because when when good things happen is what I'm not trying so and in many ways I think that's the hardest thing of all I mean I agree what you're saying about being in the jungle you know psychedelic jungle what that's really all about is not trying it's like it's like the hardest thing in the world is to say somebody says to you relax right or be yourself you just be yourself Joe no I mean and and yet I think as we become more professional and better at what we're doing when somebody says to you be yourself you can you can you know you're not burdened by these false selves and these things that that you think you ought to be or ought to say or how you want to look or what you ought to be you've kind of gotten rid of those you know over time deliberately very deliberately and I certainly have you know I mean I very deliberately tried you know when I feel myself going that way to pull back and let go but and I think in many ways that's what any artist does as they become a professional at what they do they learn to kind of get out of their own way and it's the hardest thing of all I think and the people we talk about resistance or the way people screw themselves up right that's how they screw themselves up is there in there getting in their own way right and they're listening to their own bullshit they're believing it and and there and they're blocked from whatever they're trying to do I'm sure that's what the comics right when they get on stage and they bomb right that's what's happening yeah that definitely is a big part of it the the what but what I think you're doing that I think is really cool is that by living your life and figuring things out and then documenting and sharing them sharing them like in a really honest way we are all providing together what's basically a direction manual on how to live your life and avoid a lot of bullshit that most people get involved with this is right this is the stuff they don't teach you in school exactly because they don't know what trying to do now the real problem is there's a the human body and the human mind is probably the most complicated vehicle that the world has ever seen forget about all the rocket ships and all the different things that you have to go through you using years of school before they let you fuck with whether it's f-18 fighter jets or helicopters there's I've watched a friend get his pilot's license just studying all aerodynamics and all these different things you have to know to take the test and wins and you'd have to do shit to be a person you're just a person I mean it's way crazy to operate this thing I mean it has emotions attached to it can make other people with its penis which it likes rubbing this is ridiculous is a ridiculous animal and it's a ridiculous sort of a thing to try to manage with no help and by you writing this book and people sharing their their own personal experiences and that's one of the things that young men appreciate the most about old men is an old man who'll tell you what he did wrong like when I meet young kids and was like dude listen to me I'm not gonna bullshit but don't do that whatever you do don't do this one because that one stupid of course nobody listens people do but if they said an old expression that a wise man learns from the mistakes of others right Phoenix's own episode yeah you're a fucking human being
