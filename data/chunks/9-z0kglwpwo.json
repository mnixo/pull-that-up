three two one boom here we go what's up man what hey did you trim your beard since I've seen you last no I'm afraid like you have no it might be a fraction shorter but that's only because we're falling out more it falls out oh yeah I mean all the time you know it's computed oh and so then you get these weird hairs they have - so the beers the same length have you gotten any younger since I've seen you last okay hard to say but that is your does your business how many years has it been since I saw you for 15 and you have not you have not gotten younger have you maintained I think yeah but not through my own work so the work is still very much ongoing though we have come a long way in the past five years but you know this is a complicated thing to fix yes and we need to fix all of it in order to really make people start getting biologically younger so let's bring people up to speed what what have the what are the latest revelations what's the the latest in terms of what we understand in terms of what could possibly be fixed about human aging all right so the fantastic answer to that question is there are no new revelations in terms of what we understand our understanding seems to have been pretty much complete already like 20 years ago the fact that we haven't found out any fundamental new stuff that we didn't know before then is fantastic news because of course it means that we're unlikely to find anything out in the future either it means that we are pretty much on top of the description of the problem and therefore it's all about solving the problem is it possible summarize the problem what is the problem what causes human agents sure that's easy so aging is simply the same thing in a living organism like you or me as what it is in a car or an aeroplane or any other simple man-made machine it's a fact of physics nothing to do with biology that any machine that has moving parts is going to do itself damage in the course of its normal operation as an intrinsic consequence of its norm operation okay so in the same way the a car Russ Jim is gonna bring that microphone good yep yeah sorta keep it about a fist from your face yeah so in the same way that a car rusts or you know accumulates junk in the oil or whatever similarly the human body does damage to itself and again just like a car and airplane the human body is set up to tolerate a certain amount of that damage so that we can get through to the point where we have kids before we start going functionally downhill when a mentally or physically but after that evolution doesn't care about us anymore and therefore we are only equipped to tolerate that much and eventually the damage that's being done accumulates to a point beyond what the body fed up to tolerate and that's when things start to go wrong and was about to function less well what is the difference physically between a young person an older person in terms of their ability to recover from the damage of just regular everyday life and exercise and abuse and running around yeah all that so that's just one aspect of the difference between a younger person and an older person so let me answer that question by stepping back one step okay so the difference ultimately arises from what the body is made of at the molecular level and failure level the body accumulates various changes that are chemical and biological consequences of what the body has to do to keep us alive from one day to the next even starting before were born and those changes so if I'm using the word damage to describe those changes because eventually things don't work so well so you're quite right that recovery from injury is one thing that doesn't work so well but so are plenty of other things so whether it's how fast you can run how fast you can think you know how strongly you can grip something how fast you can walk you know all of these things become progressively less good but the point is that the amount by which they become less good is pretty negligible until the age of 40 or 50 it's only then that the decline starts to accelerate so what do you do in your own life to try to mitigate that acceleration yeah I'm a really bad example of this for tuning that's crazy but you're this is your business so there are two reasons why I'm bad okay the first reason is that I'm really well-built I'm just lucky I'm just one of those hateful people who I can eat and drink exactly what I like and nothing seems to happen and I don't even need to exercise to speak of and you know I'm for biologically far younger than I actually am chronologically how old you chronologically chronologically I'm 57 how old do you think you are biologically well I'm told that I'm a good decade less than that this is what I get told every time I do these tests which I've been doing for the past let me see 18 years yeah so that's pretty good news so you're lucky yeah yeah but the other thing is you know I'm working hard to hasten the defeat of Aging and maybe it's a net win you know maybe the amount that I'm hastening it is more than the damage I'm doing myself by for example not getting enough sleep and you still drink booze I still drink how often I drink probably more than the average American what does that mean three or four yeah three or four beers every day a must and a whiskey or two every day as well I'm left so six days a week or six drinks a day Wow one drink right now do any honey cancer we have the fig I only drink actual bear not Heineken was the actual beer well you know IPAs things like that like bit Heineken doesn't taste like beer of course not I don't know I mean we didn't fuse beer for a while but I think I've never smoked pot I mean I've experimented with it when I was younger but it never did anything to me hello let's get some ice get some ice some whiskey I don't put ice you're very specific with your booze well no no that specific when it comes to whiskey I mean Oh beer for that matter I'm not a snob at all I mean I was you know you don't drink Heineken you gotta be a snob delicious beer Heineken is refreshing which is you know it's like when you call research descriptive it's a euphemism for not worth much I understand refreshing meaning it's a cold beverage but it's not it doesn't have the stout taste that you enjoy it has the function of water right or lemonade or something along those lines yeah how found upon it is in the anti-aging community to be a person who drinks as much as you do everyone in the aging community knows me and they know that I don't drink to excess for myself right they know that what I drink is you know what works for me look at Violetta it's pronounced Hey look a feeling fucked it up Jane do you prefer this it's very have you ever Buffalo Trace that's okay okay like everything's better okay my PR people will will will get pissed off with me fit this yeah in the anti-aging community I am NOT frowned upon at all I don't know that I do what I do but everyone said you know there will be donors out there who will frown on you for that but it's your own fault that's all that tastes like smoke yeah that's right it's one of those um is it smoky smoky peaty whisky it's really nice it's very smoky yeah interesting only popular restaurants I know that's I that's why I know they're selling it yeah I prefer the Buffalo Trace it's weird though it tastes like go like it's made with smoke like some house right you say is it PD is it well that's the word love lies yeah that's the one nothing is um how bad is drinking four well of course it depends whether you drink too much and different too much is a different amount for different people yeah so you know if you took within your limits you know if you drink enough that you got a hangover in the morning you know once a week then you're definitely drinking too much last time I had a hangover to be when I was a teenager oh okay you just keep it going and drink lots of water I don't actually think all that much water really god you're defying all the rules that's confusing are you still rolling for exercise last time we spoke you were you don't remember enough so so when I used to live in Cambridge yes I used to be quite an expert at punting punting which is this thing that you're doing Oxford with a stick that's right I'm sorry that you push against the bottom of the river with no it sounds when you describe it like that like a really clunky you know activity but actually it's fantastically smooth and when you go to it's really easy doesn't it's not even tiring and it's ridiculously romantic romantic yes yes and it's definitely a babe magnet ooh there you go and good exercise yeah yeah yeah good for balance and this is that basically what you do for exercise are do not do that live in Cambridge anymore California now oh you do you live out here yeah I live in the Bay Area get uh what are you doing out there well that's where the foundation is back oh okay yeah I've been over here for ten years now so what is a day-to-day life what's a normal day for Arbor Day well there isn't really a normal day I spend a ridiculous amount of time on the road because I've you know being a high-profile member of this community I view the outreach side of things just educating people on this as an enormous ly valuable and important part of my work and also it's something you can't delegate because you know conference organizers or interviews for that matter they always want the frontman wears on the science side we've been able to hire extremely good people and so I've been able to delegate that to a very large extent now in terms of progress like what what has to happen for there to be a shift in the the biological age of people where you could actually reverse it or we could actually maintain the position they're at now for extended periods of time first of all let me onto that last part so reversing aging is actually going to be pretty much the result of maintaining it there won't be a just even tiny because that would mean that you are airing the damage of aging just exactly at the same speed that the damage is being laid down which is ridiculous you know you know this if you can do that you can obviously do it a little bit faster than it's being laid down so you don't really need to think about the maintaining part however what we need is we need to be able to repair all of the types of damage and because the human body is so very complicated there are of course a lot of different types of damage so it's a divide and conquer strategy any of these types of damage at the molecular level cellular level can perfectly well kill you more or less on schedule however well we fix all the others so since the beginning sense research foundation my organization has focused on the most challenging the most difficult types of damage because basically the easiest ones are being worked on by other people we have you see we set ourselves up as an independent charity we so we're charity we're a public 501c3 which means that if someone gives us money they get a tax break but we're independent which means that we do not rely on peer-reviewed government grants or anything like that we just rely on for that philanthropy the numbers advantage of that is that we're not competing with a lot of other people who have their own ideas about what to do and in particular the people who are deciding who wins that competition or not you know in when you prefer government grants it's terrible you know you end up having to basically emphasize really boring low-hanging fruit just in order to have a chance at getting funded because people want to avoid funding things that don't lead to high-profile publications soon so you know really ambitious high-risk high-reward stuff just doesn't get done and so that so we focused on that because other people can't that make sense and that's very unfortunate that that doesn't get done outside of what you're trying yeah I mean of course this is a recognized problem yeah and then I H for example have tried to address it with Awards with types of grants that are specifically focused on more cutting-edge visionary stuff but the magnitude there is time it's real tokenism you know it left the 1% of the NIH budget what's frustrating to you about the the state of understanding pair and understanding the the ability to fix things well I'm not the kind of guy who gets frustrated very much you know I'm always a glass half-full kind of person so for me what matters the most is the fact that the understanding that this is what aging is and this is hard to deal with it has improved so much over the years so I started pulling out the idea of that this was the way to go after ageing 20 years ago before up until then the only game in town really was we've got to make the body run more cleanly and generate this damage more slowly than it naturally does and that's a very big conceptual difference right so it's not surprising that it took me maybe 10 years to really get the damage repair approach taken properly seriously by my colleagues in the scientific community but about 10 years ago it was taken seriously and in fact over the past decade people have been periodically reinventing the idea and you know I don't necessarily always get as much of the credit as I probably ought to have but I don't care about that the main thing is I don't have to persuade anyone anymore people get it that damage repair is at least if not the way to go at least a very promising way to go so really what happens next is convincing people outside of the community right and there's been enormous progress as well so when you and I spoke last five years ago really that was the end of the story I pretty much won the scientific argument but still no one was really listening and then over the past five years the huge thing that's happened is the private sector interests in this has taken off so investors have been coming along typically it's been led by the angel investor types their seed investors people who are willing to do really high-risk high-reward stuff but they understand that we're getting close enough that this is the next big thing that we will actually have bona fide a genuine rejuvenation medicine in the foreseeable future how far seeable Wow you know some of its already in clinical trials like what kind of stuff so for example the stem cell therapy is now being used for aspects of Aging with a really clear understanding of how they're going to work Parkinson's disease is a great example of this well so therapy is the right way to go between clinical trials something that's been in the news a lot over the past couple of years it's in lytx which are drugs that selectively kill what are called senescence cells so these are cells that hang out in the body in a bad state where they're doing more harm good then not only are they not doing what they're supposed to they're also secreting nasty stuff that damages their neighborhood and so drugs have been developed that seemingly pretty good at getting rid of those so they're in clinical trials as well listen and so we don't work we used to work on that area we basically do no work on that area anymore hardly any and we may end up doing that or a couple years from now just because other people are doing it and so our money is better spent doing the stuff that's still at an earlier stage and beyond that you know we are able even for things that are a couple of years behind that so it won't be in clinical trials for another year or two we've been able even then to get investors interested so that we can actually spin the projects out and start up companies and focus on the things that remain it's not just us of course there's lots and lots of I mean literally way over 100 other companies now that I work with because they're not spin-out from my foundation but they are you know doing closely aligned work and so I'm I'm literally spending probably a day a week on average just making introductions between you know in entrepreneur founders scientific founders of with with great science and investors who want to get involved the stem cell therapies fascinate to me because I've had some personal experience with it I've had some injuries that I cured with well doctors cured with stem cells in a remarkable way we're at the point where I I was told that I need shoulder surgery and I had a large rotator cuff tear and it's gone I know it's incredible it's amazing but that's not really what I'm talking about that's gone really well you try and run a neurodegenerative diseases so well the big difference it's not just fairly brain versus anything else what I'm saying is that what you got was using stem cells to treat an acute injury right a tear and that's what stem cell therapies have been developed the most for so far and I've shown the most promise for but now we're getting to the point where we're in a position to use themselves to address certain aspects of aging in other words certain aspects of slow steady progressive decline that happens throughout life through intravenous use well not necessarily intravenous so let me talk about the Parkinson's disease case in a bit more detail so what Parkinson's disease is driven by is the loss of a particular type of neuron so of course in the brain there's lots of different types of neuron that's one type called a dopaminergic neuron and they exist just in one specific very small part of the brain core the substantia nigra so it turns out those neurons they well because they do a lot of work basically and they die at a much more rapid rate than other types of neuron so we end up all of this with maybe a quarter of those neurons that we had when we were young adults having gone by old age that's okay that with that amount of margin of error is tolerable in the system it just doesn't doesn't have a consequence but of course as with everything in aging some people have the problem accumulate faster than others and so some people by old age will have lost maybe three-quarters of the dopaminergic neurons and that is what gives you Parkinson's disease so what is stem-cell therapy if you think about it what it is basically you put cells into the body that have been programmed have been gotten to have been developed into the right state in the lab so that they know what to do when you inject them they know like to divide and to then transform themselves to differentiate into the right kind of other cell so what has been developed is dopaminergic precursor cells stem cells that know how to become dopaminergic neurons and those are injected into this one place a substantial Niagra and they do what they do that thing so they're injected right into the brain that's right Wow so actually this was first tried more than 25 years ago there was a clinical trial Sweden because people knew what bugs what what was the this was driving Parkinson's disease so they knew this ought to work but of course back then we knew almost nothing about how to manipulate stem cells in poetry so what they did was these people they took cells from the right part of the brain of aborted fetuses right and they just injected them now this was enormously speculative because you know first of all the brain of an aborted fetus is very poor very has hardly developed at all right and so just taking the right cells from kind of the right place with hit and miss and sure enough almost all the time there was no effect because you know they just didn't get the right kind of stem cell but occasionally it worked occasionally patients got lucky and got some of the right kind of stamps how often well I think there was a single digit number in the clinical trial that was done like maybe three or four but the question was how good was the effect when there was any effect at all and the answer was astronomical so a couple years ago there was actually a retrospective written by the group that did this clinical trial and it was written specifically about the first respondent the first person who really got lucky and responded well and it was written on the on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of that person being treated what happened with that person was they were treated once just got one injection and the pocke symptoms went away so well that the person was taken off their prime medication there's the standard medication for Parkinson's called l-dopa which is a precursor molecule for dopamine they would just take nothing again no symptoms symptoms gradually started coming back after 15 years 15 years and no symptoms retorted from one injection Wow that's about as good as you can get so of course now that we know so much about how to manipulate stem cells before we inject them and therefore how to inject the right kind of stem cell you know people are very optimistic and that's why there are clinical trials already ongoing right now that's fascinating so what's really interesting to me is that during the time this what person had this one injection the rate of progress the the amount of understanding of how to manipulate these cells and make them exactly what you want has increased well that's right I probably shall still increasing considerably that's right and so what I was saying about we House Research Foundation is moving increasingly away from bothering welcomes on sino lytx because other people are doing it that was already true when we started the fan in respective themself we didn't need to everyone else although all the important work with already being done by other people so where are they out right now we're here where you out in terms of like let's just focus on Parkinson's disease game so the clinical trials are in phase one early stage so we won't know anything really good for another year maybe but maybe two years but you know we it's not it's not just one trial there's there's several groups around the world that are focused on this some of them I haven't started the trial yeah but they're about to and so on so you know it will of that that gives you a sense of the level of optimism of the specialist in this area that's very exciting so you when you look at your future at 57 years old and you think of yourself at seventy-seven do you think you're gonna be the same well um if you had a guess so in order to answer that I have to come back to what I said about this being a divide and conquer problem and the fact that we need to fix all of these things in order to really give the the proper result in terms of biological age now that means that any speculation that I may make about the timeframe for when we get there in a speculation about the most difficult parts of the problem and therefore it's highly speculative because the most difficult parts are at the earliest stage and therefore there's more opportunity for things to go wrong between now and that and so to speak so when I asked to give a timeframe estimate on this I always make sure to emphasize that it's probabilistic that what I'm giving you is a time frame for when I think we have a 50/50 chance of getting a decisive level of comprehensiveness of these therapies and at the moment that number is 17 years now that's very specific well yeah and it's yeah I mean but the thing is what matters is how that number has changed over the time over time so I first started giving timeframe predictions about 1516 years ago and back then I said 25 years right so it's only come down by eight years in 16 years we sounds like bad news right but here are two pieces of good news first piece of good news is that it hardly came down at all for the first than right yes it was like I would say yeah um five years ago I was still saying 22 21 years so it's been it hasn't been hasn't been slippin any further for a little while and the reason why I think of speeded up to parity is because the only thing that we're slowing it down before was lack of funding beforehand you know I was always saying this is how fast the science allows the problem to be solved but the science only allows the problem to be solved if the fans can be done and that require ultimately biomedical research is inherently expensive and we are just not able to pull in as much money as we need for this so it's interesting because it seems like that would be something that most people would have a vested interest in fund you don't say and sure over the past five years as I mentioned as things have become investable things are changed a lot every time we end up being able to spin a project out from a lab into a private company another digit gets put on its budget like overnight just because it's so much easier to get people to write a check if they think was a chance even a really small chance that they'll get their money back in spades sometime later you know I guess that's what you would expect but yeah I mean of course the other thing that we always are up against is the mindset that people have got into about aging that they've needed to get into for all these millennia that we have been unable to do anything about it all have any prospect of doing anything about it anytime soon you know what are you going to do you've got this terrible ghastly thing that's going to happen to you in the distant future and um you can't do anything about it so you've got to put it out of your minds you're not going to spend you don't want to spend your life being preoccupied by it so you've got to find somewhere to like not think about it and get on with your miserably short life and make the best of it right and of course the work the only way one can do that is by somehow denying somehow tricking oneself into denying that this is such a big deal you know and thereby pretending for example that it's not really like a medic problem at all you know and it's like inevitable and universal and natural or alternatively saying well okay maybe we could fix it if we want to but it would be a bad thing that aiding is some kind of blessing in disguise that's where all the heat yeah and that's where all this stuff comes from about oh dear well we put all the people or how we pay the pensions or weren't dictators there forever or will it be boring you know which I have to spend my whole life contending with how do you say well hey get over the dictators living for everyone well you know last time I looked dictator was fairly high on the league table of risky jobs you know of Aging in the furthermore the ones that do die of Aging they tend to have organized their succession in advance anyway so it's as if they were already immortal so I mean come on not only the percentage of dictators versus the percentage of regular people is so incredibly small to not cure aging because of dictator seems like the dumbest idea ever well there you go I mean but people really you know yes this is what people do right that will come up with some reason why aging is a blessing in disguise and then they will instantly switch off their brains for fear of actually coming up with a refutation of that reason or even yeah you know because romantic aspects of Aging and the weird ones right yeah you know the inevitable like it though it's fine it's wonderful I'm looking forward to it it's it's essentially a disease that we all get yeah I mean I have to be very careful with the word disease some people aren't so you've heard David Sinclair oh yes he's been a great friend of mine for a lot of years and we've yeah we have a very similar attitude to you know authority we don't think much of it and so we tend to push the boundaries a bit both of us you know in different ways so he actually his view of calling aging a disease is a bit different from mine he's more comfortable with it I tend to feel that the probe there's a problem with calling aging a disease which is that it makes it sound like it's something that could be cured with one-off therapy like like you know an infection which is which it isn't it's a side effect of being alive and as such it's something that you know you can repair you can stave off but you have to do it periodically because the damage is going to continue to be created and the reason why that's important is that it determines what kind of what kind of medicine we look for a lot of Alzheimer's research for example in fact I would say most of Alzheimer's research has been predicated on this kind of mistake on the idea that if we can just cure Outsiders they know so I would say that actually it's not that the word disease is used to narrowly and should be broadened to include aging rather it's the other way around that the word disease is used too broadly and should be narrowed so it's not to include things like Alzheimer's that are actually parts of Aging because really the difference between the progressive chronic conditions like Alzheimer's that we call diseases and the ones that we don't like you know loss of muscle or declining the immune system or whatever you know the only difference is semantics some of them you know there are both parts of ating just some of them are ones that we've chosen to give to thieves like names - what would you call aging if you don't call it disease well I call it a medical problem all right okay that's pretty pure yeah yeah in terms of potential future treatments stem cells seem to be very promising there are there other competing treatments that you think are equally promising or yes sure but they're not competing so um so as I said because this is a divide-and-conquer problem with a bunch of different types of damage all of which we need to fix then we need to look at the war fixes are available for each individual type so what stem cells are there to fix is so loss where cells are dying and they're not being automatically replaced in the body by cell division have you personally experienced any stem cell therapy no I haven't done any therapy for any of any kind yet but of course you know I'm paying attention yeah I'll see you know of course the way the nature of Aging is that because it's progressive and because it's only it only causes functional decline after a certain point there's a trade-off that one always has to keep in mind in terms of timing of a therapy between how badly one needs it and rapidly the quality of the therapy is improving so you know if I take a stem-cell therapy now then there's a chance that'll be bad for me for whatever reason okay whereas ten years down the road I will still I would have needed it for those ten years today is that the right I may start to knead it a bit more but they will it will have benefited from ten years more of research and refinement so you're a cautious paycheck oh sure I mean I don't think anybody wants to be the first patient I'm in I'll tell you I'll be the first guy I'm already doing a bunch of stem cell therapies will do intravenous stem cell therapies - well sure but I mean the point is you you weren't the first to do any of these I'll for sure right yeah so yes in terms of other things so synthetics do not compete with stem cells because in oolitic for that to do a different thing to reflects a different type of damage namely the accumulation of these bad cells right and then you've got to have you know cancer therapies you've got to have therapies that remove molecular waste products through inside self a couple of our startup companies have have doing that you've got a remove waste products from outside the cells for example so people of use the immune system to do that you've got a repair DNA in in the mitochondria these special parts of the cell that do the chemistry of breathing you know there's a bunch of different things we have to do and another piece of good news I told you earlier on that there's been no real change over the past 20 years and our understanding of what the problem is better than that they'll also been no real need to change our preferred approaches to each of to each of the damage repair technologies we haven't had we haven't you know found bad news that said oh dear this potential approach to fixing this particular type of damage isn't going to work for this new reason that we didn't know before therefore we have to start again and think of a new one that hasn't happened to either that's excellent so it's just essentially refining the procedures while actually implementing them yes is this is this something you still truly enjoy doing I wouldn't say I ever enjoy doing it yeah really I mean I enjoy life I enjoy just you know staring at the sky from my hot tub and it's just that I want to carry on doing it rather you know doing instead so almost investment it's an investment it's also I mean it's obviously some sort of an intellectual pursuit epithet I mean some people view is an intellectual patina I don't I I really feel you know I've ever ever since there was a young kid I have wanted to spend my life making a difference to the world improving the quality and of course in this case quantity of life of humanity and I've got just one of those incredibly lucky people I've been able to end up in this position of essentially leading the crusade to do that in the biggest possible way so this is something that you felt compelled to do from a really early age not the specific thing so what actually happened was that as a teenager having pretty much decided that this is what I wanted to do with my life the first thing I did was I got into artificial intelligence research and the reason that happened was because when I was a teenager I tried my hand at programming I find that was pretty damn good at it and I thought well ok I'm one of the big problems in the world is the problem of work the fact that people have to spend so much of their time doing stuff that they would not do unless they were being paid for it and therefore we need more automation so I work on that because I'm good at it and I had no reason at that time to believe that I was gonna be any good at biology specifically particularly and there were other people who were particularly good at biology and I had made the mistake ins but absolute assumption that everybody realized that aging was by far the world's biggest problem and therefore biologists would be working on it in grudging away and of course he didn't hear much but hey it's a really hard problem so that's not surprise so it was until my late twenties that I found out that I was wrong what happened was that I met and married a biologist quite anyone actually who was a full professor at that time at UC San Diego she was in England on sabbatical and through her I not only learnt a lot of biology just by accident you know over the dinner table but I also found out gradually that she wasn't interested in aging I just kind of it hadn't occurred to me so it didn't come up in conversation I began to notice that it wasn't coming up in conversation started asking questions and she would say things like you know well I mean like it's just decay isn't it and I would say well yeah but so what and she well I mean you're not gonna learn any fundamental truths about the universe from studying decay and I would say well that's true yes but but but it's bad for you and she would say but that's not my problem and I would say well it kind of is and that would be about as far as we would ever get so eventually I came to terms with it because it wasn't just her of course it was all the other biology if I was meeting as a strange closed mindedness well you know as I say people have had to find ways not to think about it yes and so eventually I thought well that's just someone do I know I'd say I better switch fields and I happened to have inveigled myself into a position where switching fields was something I was able to do I had a very undemanding job at the University of Cambridge doing bioinformatics which allowed me to do my artificial intelligence research in my spare time I was being paid well enough and you know I had access to university facilities and all that so all I needed to do was repurpose my spare time and you know start paying my way to go to conferences could of course back then nobody knew me and I wasn't being invited and and so I and it went pretty well I started doing quite well-received stuff and so I became quite well respected in the field very quickly and for the first five years that was all that was happening because I was basically harmless and it was then five years in in the year 2000 that I had this kind of Eureka moment that damage repair with the way to go and started talking about what the impact could be and people start to think I had gone completely crazy and it took a little while for people to come around so when you say that at an early age you felt compelled to try to help people like whoa what was that so what actually happened with this it was all down to my mother's desire for me to practice the piano you know she wasn't a particularly good pianist herself but she wanted me to learn how to black how about the other and sure she was she put pressure on me to practice all the time and I was resistant but somehow or other my mother had already instilled in me a sense of introspection you know a desire to understand why I thought what I thought so I actually decided to think about why I didn't want to play the piano and it took very little time for me to realize that the fundamental reason I didn't want to spend so much time tapping away on this thing was that the best case an outcome of this would be that I would become a good pianist and that was just not good enough you know we're already lots of other good pianist so I would not be you know contributing significantly to the quality of life of mankind by becoming just another one an additional subpoena that's right yeah and so I thought well I want to be could have but and of course it was gradual after that probably eight or nine so over the next few years I'm gonna say this general idea that I playing the piano was a waste of time crystallized into the understanding you know I could actually articulate that I wanted to make a difference to the world and so that's how I you know by the time I was fifteen when I thought I programming and I've just told you the rest that's an interesting mapping out of your future you know at nine years old recognizing you're not going to make a significant contribution to the world by doing something that other people have already done yeah that's right that's a really interesting way to look at the world we're nine I have a nine-year-old daughter I can't imagine her thinking like that I think when I started um working actually at this bioinformatics project that I mentioned I came I had a lot of exposure to a lot of top-flight biologists and it turns out that there were fields that were just fashionable right and but yeah and lots of top biologists would be competing for Sepphoris lee with each other to make the next advance in one particularly narrow narrow area that was just really fashionable and other areas would be just completely neglected I thought is going on here why are these smart people choosing to do something that minimizes the likelihood that they will have any impact in other words basically whatever they whatever they find out they didn't matter they themselves didn't matter at all because they could have been hit by a truck or done something a bit then someone else would have found out the exact same thing 10 minutes later so they were making no difference I never understood I feel that I understand it so you've always felt compelled to make a difference is there something your mother instilled in you is it something you just had yeah I don't really think my mother instilled in me I think the introspection was and I if you ask me how she did that I had no idea but but yeah somehow or other no I don't like that but no I think we wanting to make a difference you just intrinsic in me and it's something that I just realized as a result of the introspection mmm when you look back at that now that's got to be an interesting course where you've recognized at a very young age that you wanted to make some sort of a difference but that knowing that you would have that epiphany at a young age when it comes to like being a pianist or doing something that's going to significantly impact people that is not a standard path that many people are gone that's a it's a very interesting way to set up your life well I wouldn't say I set my life up I say I once I had intentions but if we look at how I got from there to here enormous enormous amount of it was just sheer luck mmm right I mean you know if most people's lives right exactly so I would say you know I had a hope I had a you know general you know aspiration but you know I would say that I'm just incredibly privileged to have you know being able to reach the pinnacle of my chosen field of endeavor you know hardly anyone can say that yes no that is you you you're also well you fit the part - you're a weirdo you know I mean you know you're a weirdo suddenly you know I say that with all due respect cause in a compliment as well of course it definitely yeah it's definitely difficult to make a difference to the world if you are following the rules and so on I'm always instinctively looking for ways to do things things that other people might have overlooked I mean even trivial things is there anything that frustrates you about this pursuit I'm not an easily frustrated kind of guy I mean of course sometimes it gets to me how slow how slowly things are going how resistant people are how irrational the resistance is but even there you know I've you know I've already from some of the things I've already said you understand that I'm I'm I'm really sympathetic to humanity in this regard I understand that most people just you know the psychological burden of the positive the prospect of physiological decline is so enormous that they've got no choice they've got to put it out of their mind yes and you know some people feel why don't I psychologically stronger or whatever and they can bite the bullet and actually work on this even though it's a very very long haul but some people aren't and that doesn't mean that they are know that I left a serving of the benefits it's a very strange thing where people put on intellectual blinders and they're talking about aging and dying it is very weird if you had heated discussions with other intellectuals about this because I would imagine over time over time yeah yeah I mean the whole thing came to me first when I was a Cambridge actually and as an undergrad this was some time before of course so when I was in my first year probably 1982 they brought in a stage hypnotist to do a show you ever seen a safe position yes okay so this guy you know he's got an audience of a few hundred people all of us you know can be undergraduates and so the first step is you know do some stuff that gets some particularly amenable people into a light trance and he brings a few of them up on stage and starts to go further right so there was this one particular part of the show that stuck in my mind what happened was this one guy was brought up and got into a but really really cheap trance and then the next step was that the hypnotist says okay this is actually your right elbow and this is your left elbow so you switch the guy's elbows right no elaboration of the continent the implications of this just getting the button to completely completely implicitly believe this thing right and then he said right I would like you please to touch your right elbow with your left forefinger right and so of course it was all this reeling and writhing and so on you know couldn't do it and that was funny in and of itself but that wasn't the coup de Grasse what happened next was the key thing the hypnotist says ok can stop now and the guy stops and ellipsis and says he couldn't do it good you and the guy says now and then let me just says why not that's the guy to explain why I couldn't do it and here is the coup de Grasse because what happens is the guy gives a completely unhesitating lucid grammatically correct explanation for why couldn't do it and the explanation of course will have a hole in it the size of Canada but the fact is that I won't see it he'll just be staying sitting there with a straight face just doing this and his friends all right the user came to undergraduate right high IQ highly respected each other's intellect bro for one for their own intellect and rationality and and they're rolling in the aisles and the guys is unaffected so when I started to have these discussions with people about aging I'm sorry to find out that people make these unbelievable arguments in favor of it um you know I click on this rail I call it the pro aging trance and it was based on that experience from my youth yeah I've always said to people if there was a pill that you can take that would stop all aging all deterioration and all diseases you'd be a fool not to take it you'd be a fool do you want to suffer the idea that this romantic look if it was a rare thing that people aged a very rare thing we would look at it with great sadness that someone was afflicted with this aging we saw someone hunched over with severe arthritis and osteoporosis and deterioration of the joints and decaying of the cognitive function and they don't know where they are who they are we'd be so sad but instead we think of it as like well he's 90 he had a good life that's exactly right it's not just the fact that everyone gets it it's the fact that everyone gets it I'm more or less the same a chronological age you know so it's considered to be this leveler and Jeff yes absolutely people do a little bit better you know 20 percent better than average they were people that were already you know happy is there any concern or any thought whatsoever to the idea of exacerbating overpopulation of course this is a legitimate question the thing that's frustrating to me is that I've been answering it for 20 years people kill dummies right well of course a large part of the reason why it's difficult to get their real answers across is because so much fiction has fiction has been written and across movies giving wrong answers and you know making a dramatic element out of it yeah whether it's Blade Runner or in time or you know any of these movies they all make it as if in fact they kind of reinforce the Probation trance right they make it as if life would be even worse if we had no aging okay so what's the real answer the real answer is very straightforward it's simply that other technologies that are coming along already and will be established well-established and ubiquitous before we get this to happen are going to solve the problem because they will increase the carrying capacity of the planets remember that the reason why we have too many people today and we've got environmental consequences is not because of lack of space it's because of the amount of pollution that the average person generates specifically of course how biggest thing being pumping carbon into the atmosphere but of course you know whether it's plastics or whatever and we're fixing that you know we've got solar energy and wind energy now that are completely exploding and they're going to completely replace fossil fuels and we got there without people even having to wake up and realize that climate change is actually quite an urgent problem we got there simply because the technology got to be good enough that the production of a killer of of energy is actually cheaper with the renewable energy mech mechanisms than it is from fossil fuel of course not just that it's also agriculture so artificial meat you know within not very long it's gonna be both tastier and far cheaper than regular meat and the amount of space we're gonna save not let alone the amount of methane that we're not going to be generating it's going to you know I haven't heard anything saying it's gonna be tastier a view of Cordoba tasty how so well we know how would it be popular if it were not tastier tastier I don't think it necessary would have to be tastier especially would be good but tastier would be better jackass you know this cheap desalination the you know plastic eating bacteria all these things are coming and so there is no way that one can make a realistic plausible argument that denies that the carrying capacity of the planet will rise far faster than the population even to a certain extent we don't even need to take into account other things like the fact that fertility rates are coming down everywhere and that once you can live a very long time they're probably going to come down even further because people who are now choosing to delay having their kids by five years will be able to delay having them by fifty years right Jesus do you have the same optimistic perception about the ocean well first of all let me say well I think about the word optimism because I know that you're not doing this but a lot of people when they talk to me and call me an optimist they actually means running over optimist and when they call themselves a realist they mean that they're a pessimist so but but anyway about the ocean of course I mean what's the difference you know there's certainly there's a lot to do one big problem right now of course is the ocean is storing a lot of carbon and releasing a lot as its warming up so we definitely had to fix that as well but it's part of the same problem you know the less carbon there is in the atmosphere the less the less of a problem that is direct carbon removal from the atmosphere in technology that absolutely you know burgeoning now and direct carbon capture from the ocean seems to be something that they could be plausible that obviously different I'm I'm optimistic in terms of the ability to clean up the ocean I've had boy onslaught on a couple times aware of him dude his devices that he's created to remove plastics and other garbage from the ocean my concern is wild fish that the depletion of the fish populations is an unprecedented rate and it seems to be we're somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 years away from a catastrophic complete collapse of wild fisheries well right and of course this is again a problem that can be fixed by technology you know if you can make artificial red meat why not make artificial fish well that wouldn't sir that would be good that we can have artificial fish but that wouldn't necessarily make that population rebound we would have to make large steps to try to bring back the the equilibrium of the ocean that's not clear I mean it's not clear it's not clear no I mean most of it I understand anyway this is not an area I'm expert on of course so I may be wrong but most of the surveyor depletions of populations of specific fish fish species because of fishing fishing so if we're not doing the overfishing we're making the same fish elsewhere on land mm-hmm well I'm sure a lot of it is being done by the United States but I'm sure and Great Britain and a lot of first world countries but I'm sure a lot of it is also being done by countries that can't afford to make this artificial fish or don't have the access to it or at least in the time period that it's going to take before these fisheries rebound it's it when I talk to people that have an understanding of wildlife in the ocean they say it's a desperate time and it's a desperate time that is not really being recognized by the general population because they can still get sushi they can still get a little bit at the local market but that if you talk to the fishermen if you talk to the wildlife biologists that are really studying the levels they're like this is nearing a point of no return yeah III wouldn't dispute that I think it's urgent but all that really says is we should be investing more in the development of these new technologies that will hasten the ability to and if they won't even bother with wild fish if they mean if they can make artificial meat I wonder if the people really get into artificial fish as well dr. Ewen oh I guess so but some of them are not gonna make the cut like no one's getting artificial tilapia why not it's not that good well yet so they've looked at it why didn't even call it tilapia then but like to cook people like the night like yes I'm really optimistic about artificial meat I mean it seems that they're I mean at one point time was like a quarter-million dollars for a hamburger and now they've got it down to a point where you can actually make an animal meat product that does not come from an animal dying that's right they're very close to be able to make this in a mass marketed way that's right that's interesting I'm excited about that I think that's very interesting and I'm excited about what you're saying that I think people think about overpopulation one things that you should take into consideration is that as populations increase in places urbanized the actual birth rate goes down to the point where places like Japan there's actually concern that they're not having enough children right and of course it is driven by prosperity yeah a male education and emancipation countries in the world the largest dozen countries in the world the only one that has really high 48 still in Nigeria you know if you exclude sub-saharan Africa it's basically completely solved a problem really Nigeria is the only one yeah if you look at the country you would not expect like Bangladesh or Pakistan or India you know their photo here right it's down below three now really yeah that's interesting so their population will level out over the next few decades well yeah it's still declining yeah it's plummeting you know people often used to say that the only reason why China's fertility rate is low is because of the one-child policy which of course they haven't continued with ophélie because of problems like this basically I mean other countries were a little bit behind the one-child policy did certainly accelerate the process but if you look at Brazil or into need here or any of the countries of your fake factory the same phenomenon plummeting have you thought about what the future looks like when people live to be four or five hundred years old like how first of all how wise will people be that's actually interesting because so ok so here's here's a really important thing that I want to get across when we think about longevity well actually three things are worth saying first of all longevity is a side effect of health right right so you know huge amount of the so-called debate that goes on about the desirability of all of this just goes away when you remember that people actually quite like being healthy but in terms of how the world will be which is the question you asked there's two questions here one question is how will well actually be and the second question is how well people in the niche and expect the world to be and the reason why those two questions are are important to distinguish is because the question of how the world will actually be is very obviously completely unanswerable even if we look 50th in the future I mean if you look 50 years ago right how much of what we have today would have been predicted right yeah it was completely different and certainly in terms of longevity you know we're only gonna be getting older at one year per year it won't actually be any 500 year old people for another 400 years I'll realize well yeah I mean the past change the rate of the passage of time it's my point right I understand we're saying right but expectation is a completely different thing and here's why that matters there's going to become a point there's gonna come a point where people in general the general man in the street starts to realize that they're probably going to live an awfully long time because they're not going to just get progressively sicker as they get older and you know lots of other reasons are going to exist why they're going to live like we're gonna have self-driving cars that pretty much eliminate you know road accidents and so on so they're going to want a lot of different things than what they wanted when they thought they were gonna live only slightly longer than their parents they're gonna want very different pension plans very different life insurance health insurance very differently inheritance arrangements and these are huge big-ticket items right they basically drive the global economy suppose he makers and decision makers around the world had damn well better be ready for that shift in public expectation of how long ago live right yes now therefore is is absolutely critical to estimate and to communicate the estimate of how soon that shift in public expectation is going to occur which means how well what events have to happen how much progress needs to happen in order for that in order to cause that shift now this is where I am terrified because I think it's gonna happen really soon I think it could easily happen in the next three to five years and that when it does happen it's gonna happen incredibly suddenly it's the sequence of events that I think is going to happen step one we're going to have sufficient progress in the laboratory or the clinic that most of my scientific colleagues are going to be willing to come out and say more or less yeah Oh buddy grabbers right although they're gonna say yeah you know it's very excited about that no I'm terrified and I'm gonna tell you what I mean I know I have been but yeah they're gonna they're gonna come and say yeah it's only a matter of time before we let this aging thing now what do you think's gonna happen next you're a media guy right yeah well I think it's gonna happen but I want your I know whether you think I'm right okay I think the next things going to happen is that real informers people like you people like Oprah Winfrey are going to hear that being said and written you know in the media and they're gonna say oh shit this is actually gonna happen and they're gonna say so on-air and they're going not only to say so what their opinion is but they're gonna say what they think people ought to do in particularly they're gonna say well look you know let's actually if we if if it's only a matter of time if we're losing a hundred and ten thousand people every day worldwide to this phenomenon then we do kind of have a bit of a moral obligation to make it less time if we can so my sense is that once that happens the following day it's going to become impossible to get elected and if you have a manifesto commitment to you know have a war on aging you know throw proper money at this I mean I really mean a proper war in aging not just like the war on cancer was lots of money not just really the research but also to front-load all of the investment in infrastructure and you know training and medical personnel and so on okay and everyone's gonna know it like the world the public is going to make that switch I just mentioned of expectation like at once so it's going to be ridiculously sudden once it happens and the first step is going to be that shift in what my colleagues in the Bo gerontology community feel able to say on camera and on stage now therefore the question is what amount of progress is going to be required for that to occur now here's the thing there aren't very many of us it's a small field the number of people at the top of the field who actually talked to the media quite a bit it's you know a dozen maximum there's me this David that you've had on the show there's you know very few others and we all know each other we're all good mates right so we know exactly where our heads Lee you know what they drivers are the number one reason why my colleagues don't already say what I say is funding the fact that unlike me those people are Relient for most of the money that drives their research on peer-reviewed government money government grants and they just won't get them if it's possible to accuse those accuse them of saying irresponsible things for the media things that get people's hopes up unduly remember this hardly isn't there's nowhere near enough - less than 10 percent of the necessary money to fund research at the moment so the committee's that decide who gets money and who doesn't are always desperately scouting around for reasons to say no that can be justified and saying oh this guy says they're responsible things for the media a totally safe way to say no right so anyway so this is this is the problem this is why my colleagues have to be really pretty curmudgeonly even David David is probably the person out of my colleagues who pushes the envelope as much as possible out of people who have regular faculty positions but you know he's just written a book which I see you have on yourself and called you know why we age and why we don't have to he could not have written that book with that title five years ago and kept his job Wow so you know the question is how much has to change and actually it's not very much you know there's a balance here the tension here between on the one hand not saying things that can be characterized as irresponsible but on the other hand not saying thing that could be characterized is simply untrue right so the more progress was made in the laboratory not even in the clinic just with mice right in terms of actually you know rejuvenating them making them live longer with treatments that were given to those mice when they were already in middle age the more progress was made you know the more impossible it's going to be to carry on being pessimistic and refusing to to make timeframe predictions or anything like that so there's a almost a forced pessimism created by this time correct well I think what you're saying makes a ton of sense and that once it does get to the point where this is undeniable there's is peer-reviewed proven established science and also implementable this is something that can be at scale distributed worldwide yeah things are gonna get real weird so people are already people are obviously still gonna be saying it can't be done in humans you know it can't really be done you know until the cows come home you know just in the same way I've had happen for any other pioneering technology throughout history but what matters is what the center of gravity of expertly stated expert opinion is it is a really really polarizing subject I mean it is funny how what you're saying brings so true that academics and intellectuals have to be cautious about talking about even what is potentially possible even though in private they probably are more than aware that there's just a few steps to go before this stuff gets implemented and we see really catastrophic tacular rather changes yeah I mean I'm not saying that all of us absolutely agree on 100% on everything in the science certainly I would say that I'm slightly on the optimistic end of the spectrum of expert opinion but yeah my colleagues are not all that far behind me in that in terms of what they would say the time frames are what you're saying in terms of people discussing it the media makes absolute sense to me that as soon as that that Pandora's Box gets opened then people are going to be looking to establish clinics everywhere and it's it could be very strange well even if even if even if a lot of these things are not yet available for clinical use even if some of them are still at the beginning of the clinical trial process and we're still maybe 10 or 15 years away from the real McCoy you know that will still be enough to trigger this pandemonium and that's why policymakers decision makers in every way and but in government and in key aspect of Industry need to I call it anticipate the anticipation they need to be have already thought through and prepared for this change in public expectation of how long they're going to live so you think that this one day will be a gigantic public issue in terms of elected representatives that they they're going to need to have some sort of an anti-ageing policy that's right and the switch from essentially situation normal usual to this completely new world will be ridiculously sudden that will happen in a week and do you think one of the motivating factors would be the price of healthcare that the argument would be part of our issue with healthcare and the an incredible amount of money that needs to be spent on hospital as I hospitalizing peaceful people and treating them with diseases we could eliminate that oh yeah that's a huge part of it you know at the moment when you talk to any you know any people any elected representatives any way of a very persuasion about the aging question than the immediate knee jerk reaction is always oh god we definitely don't want to fix that how would we pay the pensions alright because they obviously they know if the economies feel a bit right it's delayed yeah and so that's what I think I think and the fact if you're not going to be able to get away with that kind of thinking anymore it's going to have to be a case of redesigning a large number of really big parts of the economy from the ground up well especially places like where you live in England or use where you're from rather in England where they have socialized medicine the enormous cost of that would be decreased radically we're healthier it's it's got nothing to do with private versus socialized medicine in medicine yeah in the US and the UK and everywhere else the overwhelming majority of medical expenditure is on the health problems of the elderly which will go away now of course the medicine that makes those problems go away is not going to be free I mean to produce and to deliver so but prevention is always better than cure but that actually is only a minority of the economic benefits the real economic benefit comes from the indirect cost first of all the fact that the kids are the elderly are going to be more productive because they're not having to spend time looking after their sick parents and you know relate things like that but also the huge thing that the elders themselves are still going to be able bodied and therefore in a position to you know continue to contribute wealth to society right now that doesn't necessarily mean anything to do with the retirement age this comes back to another aspect of the interaction between emerging technologies so of course we've got automation coming I don't work on any more but let's people do right will make a huge progress in artificial intelligence and most people even conservative commentators say that most of the jobs that exist today are going to be gone 20 years from now said machines will be doing things perfectly well so you know we're going to happy completely unable to continue this system of a an economy based on full employment you know last time this happened with the Industrial Revolution we got away with it by inventing an entire new sector you know the service sector that replaced all the jobs that people didn't have anymore in manufacturing and agriculture you know it's not gonna happen this time it's not gonna happen you know how many people do you need in the entertainment industry you know we've got you come on so you know we're going to have a different well of course people are already thinking about that with things like you know universal basic income yes which is an extraordinarily blunt instrument it's just a starting point but you know that kind of thing is going to have to going to happen I can totally imagine a situation in which you know 30 40 years from now work is something like national service used to be yeah yeah well you know well yeah when you're young and insignificant you do a bit of a few years of actual work and then yeah but that means that the whole concept of pensions it's ridiculous to think about that so we've got a gas policymakers out of that mindset and to get them to think in more global terms about the health benefits and the benefits the quality of life of everybody and so on it is funny that work or the concept of work is sort of inexorably connected to society to the point where you think you have to work but you know meanwhile people lived for hundreds of thousands of years without even the concept of that you know I got a place where you go where they give you gold coins all right yeah yeah I mean of course you do have to have something something something that fulfills coming to do that you find fulfilling that's the argument for universal basic income right the argument against it is human nature that people need to be motivated and they need something to sort of guide them towards excellence yeah my take is the other thing that needs a better education which of course is something that we could spend the money on that we save from not having to yeah my glass half full guy well I don't know anybody well educated who gets bored you know yeah I agree with you or anybody who's been exposed to interesting things right there are so many things in this world I mean if I had I would love to live five different lives concurrently I would love to I would I would I would love to it I don't have to be concurrent that questions you just dive into they like I would love to live different lives because there's so many different things that I would have loved to pursue well you can't let currently can one brain but let's try to make you live them sequentially instead yeah well seeking which will be fun I'm it would be really interesting to take up a whole new career at 70 you know and so there's three to five-year timeline what what makes you think that three to five years from now is when all this stuff will take place well of course it's subjective it's based on aggregating a whole bunch of different areas of research but of course I'm fairly well-informed about where is that currently isn't how rapidly it's moving in a broke with variety of different areas I'm so just you know just I'm putting all that together in my head and I'm saying how soon are we going to be able to take mice that normally live let's say two and a half years and do nothing whatsoever to them until they are one-half and get them to an average live to four instead of two and a half right now if you can and of course those extra years would be healthy years because we would be rejuvenating the mice right so I believe that that would be sufficient any of it that's actually a little bit conservative I think a less dramatic breakthrough than that might be enough to switch most of my colleagues over that get them over the fence but I think that would definitely be enough and I think that that is close what was the research done with mice with myostatin inhibitors did not increase lifespan as well yeah sure I mean a lot of things have extended extended lifespan a fair bit but what we have at the moment is not all the components of what I just said if you do something genetic to mice or if you do it you know to them throughout their lives then we can already get that year year and a half out of mice certainly yeah okay but not if you start at 18 months if you've got 18 months the best we can do it it may be four months so that's the difference you've got to be able to start late and get the big expansion and you're not gonna get that without bona fide origination hmm so that's not gonna come by way of genetics well even if it did come by web kinetics it wouldn't matter it wouldn't persuade my colleague or me that we were on the brink of doing it for humans who have the misfortune of being already alive hmm so the rejuvenation is going to come through some sort of biologics well yes through the kinds of things were working on that I mentioned earlier stem cells gene therapy to do various thing to introduce for example bacterial enzymes that can break down waste product sima lytic that I talked about pharmaceuticals to do other things um what about the use of CRISPR sure what crispies are very very important part of this so can you please explain what CRISPR means and people don't know what we're talking about sure yes so CRISPR is a technology that was first developed about eight years ago now and it is the exploitation of a bacterial mechanism that allows bacteria to defend themselves against viruses essentially how it works is that it allows us to change the sequence of our genome in a particular cell in a very specific way it's often called gene editing and there are other technologies for gene editing that already existed before Chris but a very laborious very expensive and very clunky this is far far cheaper and easier to use so what that does is it allows us for example to inactive energy or for that matter to change the sequence of a gene from a mutant form into a normal form so that it works when it was previously not working now doing that in the laboratory in a petri dish is fair enough the question is can we do it in the body and initially no initially this technology was too error-prone it was primed to do what what George Church has called genetic vandalism and make have what's called off-target effects in other words basically do other changes to the genome elsewhere that you didn't want but of course people have known listen people have been working really hard to improve the technology and it's getting to the point now where it's possible to actually use it on humans maybe you know it's getting it's getting that now you can't do everything with CRISPR one thing you definitely can't do with CRISPR is insert new genes into the genome and that's something we really need to be able to do but actually one of our big projects is a kind of two-step thing where we use CRISPR to make a small change to the genome that allows us to insert large genes where we couldn't previously so yeah so the CRISPR is huge and it's used not only in aging research but across the whole board of biomedical work that's they have done some work in China apparently on live human being so this was very controversial what happened was that a group in China used CRISPR to alter the DNA of embryos that were going to be used for IVF in vitro fertilization and the change that was made was itself quite a curious one essentially what they did was they tried to change a gene called ccr5 into a mutant form that doesn't work but that in its inactive form protects the body from infection by HIV this is something that was discovered a long time ago and maybe 1% of people have this genotype and so this was introduced unfortunately first of all it probably wasn't done very well but also well what people who looked at the that the process and it probably didn't they probably didn't make the correct modification but also it's not clear whether doing it for someone lifelong is actually a good thing because as I say it's an inactivation of a gene that must exist for a reason or it wouldn't exist at all right but didn't it also have a side effect of increased intelligence that is complete speculation is it yes why what would cause them to speculate that I people speculate all the time that's just like clickbait stuff that gets people excited about it yeah okay but yes so anyway the other thing was that it's not obvious why it's even worthwhile to make an embryo genetically resistant to HIV first of all they don't have HIV yet in the first place and they may never get it and secondly we've got drugs that work pretty well to control HIV antiretroviral tears yeah so I'm so it's not obvious why this was a sensible thing to do in the first place however it certainly got a whole bunch of debate going so yeah well when I hear about something like that I always assume first of all I mean just American prejudiced you assume that it's in China they're doing something crazy right and you also assume that if they're telling you about someone who's been altered that means that they've probably doing this for a decade or since Christopher was initiative initiated eight years ago you never know yeah you never know it's just it's interesting to me and I don't want them to do it on people but when they do do it on people I'm fascinated you know it's I don't you know well that's right I mean that's the attitude that I have and a lot of people have to medical tourism in general yes that the you know these are not adequately regulated treatments and they are certainly not adequately characterized in other words the people who kept the treatments people who pay for them rather than people who have been chosen to be in a standardized group of any kind and there tends to be very still follow-up but still it's better than nothing in the sense that you know some information exists about the efficacy and safety of these treatments as a result the more that exists the better the more the people who are administering these fields can be induced to reveal their data the better hey even if it's anonymized but you know a some scientists quite a lot of scientists take a much stronger view that you know we just should oppose all of this period and we should just say you know everyone who indulges who gives treatments to people in offshore places should be shut down as much best we can and should be demonized I don't really think that's true I think there's a halfway house personally I've had my family my mother has gone to Panama okay twice and she was on the verge of a knee replacement and now she walks without pain yeah I bet you actually went to nil really yes yeah yeah yeah I mean there are a lot of people who have very good story that I've nailed group and I of course the thing if you don't know unless someone has a really bad story whether things are going wrong so I I mean I don't know whether Neil release is numbers that the total number of patients per year that he treats so we don't know if it hit right yeah I don't know I just do know that I have speaking spoken to several fighters from the UFC that have gone down there and again my mother was I mean she didn't want to get a knee replacement so when I sent her down there and it took she's times 52 she's 73 so it took her somewhere around 6 to 8 months before she started feeling anything she was really worried that it wasn't gonna work but then in eight months in just the pain just went away and it's continued to get better and then I sent her down a second time and I'm gonna keep sending her down there it's just it's at a pretty profound effect was fascinating to me is they do three days of intravenous therapy and the intravenous therapy has I don't know if it's just my imagination but she looks younger like she looks she looks more vibrant you know like when I saw her she came to my house for Christmas I she looked better she looked a year younger than she did the last time I saw her yeah I mean um you know this is what we would hope that stem-cell therapy yes but I remind you of what I said about that original Parkinson's try from more than 25 years right for 15 years really didn't know that was the one that was affair right exactly so only a few people benefited the people who did benefit benefit benefit enormous leap but huge numbers of people had no benefit yes know that it's the kind of stage they were in for a lot of stem cell therapies right now Parkinson's disease is a kind of outlier in the sense that the desired function of the stem cell is really well understood so what kind of stem cells to introduce into the body and where to introduce them is you know not in doubt most them self therapies are not that far along so every time anyone gets treated right now it's still an experiment and that's okay up to a point but it doesn't mean that we're all learning curve and it's vital to have the people like Neil who are administering the therapy to quite a lot of people to actually not just you know live off the stories of high-profile people who get good benefits and talk them up but actually two goalies the day release oh got the full data on instigated you know including any negative stuff and including follow up that's the key thing yeah so many therapies in regenerative medicine in general have the potential to be beneficial over the first you know a few months to a year or whatever and then to start having side effects that those detrimental what have you heard that are no side effects oh well of course the biggest thing that we always have to worry about is cancer because and this is true for a whole bunch of things you know telomerase activators and so on the thing is that aging can in some senses be characterized as a trade-off between cancer and everything else in other words a huge amount of what goes wrong with the body late in life is a result of a kind of dialing down of regenerative functions that we actually do naturally have in the body but which are not as active in older people if they are in and so of course we have to ask why are they less active and a lot of biologists including myself believe that a huge part of part of that is adaptive in other words it is kind of the body recognizing that varies as time goes on a progressively higher number of cells in the body that are almost cancerous and that have to be kind of kept in check in her not to become properly cancerous because of course cancer is the result of the gradual accumulation of mutations and so on in the cells right and so yes I'm every time that you are improving regenerative capacity whether of the cells that you put in or more importantly of the cells that are nearby the cells you put in you are potentially taking the risk of hastening the onset of actual cancer what is your opinion on the benefits of fasting in that regard okay fasting is that okay well let me first of all talk about fasting in relation to cancer that's important people have certainly found that it's a good thing to do which is somewhat counterintuitive because in the later stages of cancers of course cachexia you know a lot of loss of muscle and so on but earlier on it seems that we can set things down I mean cancers are greedy metabolically you know they consume a lot of energy so if you're putting a lot putting if you have minimizing how many calories you put in then you have a chance of slowing the cancer down so the therapies may have a better chance that certainly been found let me talk about fasting more generally that so for sure in I mean it's been known for nearly a hundred years that if you give mice or rats less food than they were likes and they live longer than they otherwise do and this is certainly the most reproducible and best study phenomena in the whole of biology of aging still there are mysteries about how it works but a lot of stuff has been found out and many of my colleagues including David I've made their careers by making progress in but making discovering insights in that area there are a lot of that is that we now have something that people have always recognized to be rather important namely drugs that trick the body into thinking it's fasting when it isn't yeah they called calorie restriction memetics and you know that's good that's that's also worthwhile think because of course people like eating and so um you know it would be useful then there are variations on the themes a guy from close to hairline insulted longest for us sake in photo longer has has been really the pioneer of intermittent fasting which is basically properly starting a hundred percent but only for two days a week or something like that you know different people have tried different schedules and all of these things are pretty interesting in terms of being good for your health but in terms of increasing your longevity by thirty or forty percent the way they're doing mice and rats no way it turns out and this is a prediction of evolutionary theory but it's also been found absolutely clearly in data that different species react differently to to starvation - it's a factor - fasting in particular that longer live species get less benefit from fasting than shorter live species so if you do it just right in nematode worms that normally live like three weeks then you can multiply their lifespan by a factor of five or more right you sure if I can't do that with a mouse however you do it you can get up to maybe fifty percent maybe sixty percent if you really really work at it some of the person you might be able to eke out a year or two with yeah that's right with with dogs that's been tried you get maybe ten percent with monkey if you get a few percent if you're lucky that's a bit controversial right now you know yeah that's why is it a bit controversial because there were two studies done really long expensive studies obviously cos monkeys live a long time and they got different results and so the question is why they get results if you look closely exactly how the experiments were done that it's pretty easy to see that they've got different results because of different methodologies slightly different methodologies and that the real answer is somewhere between the two so yeah hmm and with dogs you said you get 10% about that yeah this with Labradors that live eleven year oh but isn't that normal that's like website I'm saying if they got about another year Oh they've got to understand that's done so fasting with human beings you think is it's interesting it's something but it's not gonna mimic these biologics and what what you believe is on that rise right I mean I'm not against it at all first of all as I say it is generally good for health you know you definitely see people getting sick less you know regular sickness like many infections and so on people seem to stay healthier for a bit for a bit longer but in terms of really pushing out the boundaries of these age-related progressive chronic conditions you know it's maybe a Oh - there's a few other factors in that are taken into consideration when people talk about longevity and health and those are community enjoyment friends loved ones satisfaction with what you do for a living how do you take those into consideration and what do you think is going on with those yeah these things are definitely big so all of these things only go further than that it extends to like you know meditation and yes yoga and so on everything that relates to stress is very important in aging it's you know it's it's reasonably well understood that when you're in a stressed-out state you create you synthesize elevated amounts of certain hormones that interact throughout the body and in various ways accelerate the accumulation of these various types of damage I was talking about earlier um so it's no surprise that there's a mind-body relationship there and in fact if we so people often study centenarians people who live an exceptionally long time right and why do they look obviously because they want to find out what the tricks are unfortunately it's quite frustrating because there's not a lot in common you know some centenarians a little bit overweight so I'm sitting there in smoke you know it's it's it's not easy to actually figure out what they're got in common but there's one thing that almost all centenarians have in common which is nothing bothered it's not necessarily that they have had particularly stress-free lives the thing is that when they encounter a stressful situation they cope with it really well and you know so you know the hormone level feather thing you don't get elevated interesting so the cortisol doesn't rise adrenaline doesn't spike they don't freak out slightly for spike for Mom or yes they don't lose sleep they can handle it that's interesting that's so it really boils down to the effect that's going on inside the mind in the body yeah that's how it the body's reacting to the stress do you meditate yourself no no I'm just show anyway well you're also satisfied well I certainly can say yeah yeah so you don't feel the need yeah at a physical level I have a very stressful life I spend my life running around airports and so on but at mental level macho do you take any dude are you doing any exercise do you take supplements hopefully holding my way through a poet is my exercise hauling your way through airports how often you flying ten percent of the time do you just take one of them berries you have to carry rather than a roller bad idea do you remember us yep for extra work or you know for extra work no it's just because I can move faster that way without okay but yeah I mean certainly the fact that I've actually I've actually got some weight on my shoulders yeah probably good in itself yeah I started carrying a backpack instead of a roller bag I've just it's just easy to move then hold it on something and dragging it behind me and I found that there's something I have a bag that I could stick a laptop in and I can stick all my clothes and it's just a larger bag yeah I cry too generally well I mean like well I'm doing a date for it like today I only carry my laptop back then but it's a really cavernous one so it's pretty heavy it's got everything in it like you know that I need for a day or could need and then when I'm traveling a longer trip I just have one other bag of sports back you know that I'm carrying is there anything that you think you should be doing that you're not doing that you maybe you would like to plan for in the future um it's hard to say because I mean I do have a lot of freedom about exactly how I spend any particular day I mean it's more a case of what I would be doing if I didn't have to do the things I'm doing now which he's obviously doing all this advocacy and yeah have you ever used a sensory deprivation tank no no I'd like you to use that I'd like to hear your feedback I have one here what would you like I just well you know because it was very relaxing I'm relaxed already you say getting there say you know what it is right it's it's beautiful feels amazing yeah no I'm into sensory deprivation in general you know when I'm asleep I I don't like to have any kind of noise or light you know one of my Bane's of staying in hotels which don't have proper blackout curtains and you know I typically when I'm in a hotel room I unplug the refrigerator the noise yeah so you're you basically got it dialed in well I'm optimistic because you're optimistic when you tell me three to five years from now we're possibly looking at some sort of a breakthrough where things start moving into the public eye where people are really taking a consideration like this is this is real technology that you should we should all start implementing on our particularly on people that are older and ailing well right I mean at the moment even though there are some things in clinical trials we always have to remember that the most challenging areas are still at an early stage so that's why I make and not only do they have to individually guess you know it's all the way through your clinical trial so they're safe but also they have to be combined you know each of these things individually can be applied to a small subset of the population that happen to have you know early onset diseases arising from may be congenital acceleration of one particular type of damage right but then to work to be useful for the people who don't have any congenital problems who are aging a normal rate we've got to actually combine them all and of course that's going to throw up on unanticipated interactions so that's why I put this time for him as far out of 17 years and even then with only fifth that probability right but the anticipation is the thing that's where the shit's gonna really hit the fact you know there's gonna be an enormous turbulence in society arising from the knowledge that this is coming I for one am very excited about living to be 500 I think I can get a lot of shit done I learned about myself you know people I think it's I think it's I I think it makes no sense to think about what one's gonna be doing in the distant future yeah people was one time I was on stage about I guess a five or six years ago and somebody from the audience for about the thousandth time asked me um you know how long do you want to live I just lost it's like how questions just one more time to other okay I've got a question for you I said I said right what time do you want to go to the toilet next Sunday I said yeah you haven't the face idea why I asked you that question D but it's exactly the same kind of question yes you know you may have an opinion about what time you expect to go to the toilet next time they because of habit but having an opinion about what time you want to go to the toilet is completely crazy so you're going to have better information on the topic near at the time and you're going to be able to act on that information it's exactly the same and also the idea of how long you want to live is going to be irrelevant if they can repair disease and fix all these issues it's just going to be the quality of life professionally I mean having an idea of how long you want to live even stating that the quality of life is going to be like a young adult physically and mentally you know it's crazy to have an opinion because it's going to be determined by other stuff yes well I'm fascinated by the future in every aspect technologically with artificial intelligence with automation just the just the the way society is shifting I mean I'm a very optimistic person in that regard and I think even the problems some of the problems that we have socially I think those are just a a result of this shift towards a more aware more conscious society I'm very optimistic I think all those things are good so I think that the extending lifespan and getting to see these real exponential changes in our culture and in our society and just our way of life I'm very excited about it I think it's I think it's one of the most intriguing things about being a person is to see how things have shifted I've been reading a lot of books lately about Native Americans and things how they shifted from the early 1800s to the you know 21st century the early 21st century 200 years later things are impossibly different unimaginably different at the time if you could talk to them about what life was like 200 years ago it'd be fairly similar 1620 to 1820 not a lot of difference right you know but 1822 20 20 good lord what is 2220 going to be like I mean I I just think that we are at the cusp of one of the most spectacular errors in human history things are changing so rapidly and so amazingly well of course the thing that one has to recognize is that we have no particular reason to suppose that they will ever flared out yes so you cannot really call this one of the cusps it's just you know we're in an exponential fall area and we happen to be noticing it more are you since you started off as a coder I'm gonna wrap this up soon but I'm gonna leave you with this because I'm really fascinated by artificial intelligence are you worried at all about artificial intelligence do you you like here the Elon Musk's and the Sam Harris's of the world that are like sounding the alarm like hey don't don't hit that switch don't turn this on I think it's a legitimate question whether the progress that we're making might lead to development perhaps accidental development of technology that is so autonomous that it gets out of our control however I do think it's very unlikely I think that the ways in which we have succeeded in making the progress that we have made so far in over the past decade especially relies enormous Leon human-computer interaction in other words the the the machines get their information from us and from the world without which they can't make progress and I don't see that changing really a time soon I do still you know pay some attention to the progress of AI well my other good friends a guy that I knew from way back at my Cambridge days is the guy who runs deep mind which is one of the most high-profile they are companies and you know I'm definitely you know excited about what's happening but no I'm not particularly apprehensive however I do think that it's better to be safe than sorry and therefore that what what's being done to look at the possibilities all things getting out of control or indeed of things just being misused by humans is you know is a very legitimate and valuable area of work well Aubrey the next time I see you if it's five years from now I hope you look younger I hope the world has changed and everything's groovy and I appreciate you and I appreciate everything you're doing well thank you so much please tell people if they're more interested in finding out about what you're doing what is the website of your organization yep that's especially for elephant infinite member efficient lrj all right thank you thank you very much thank you bye everybody [Music] what's wrong [Music]
