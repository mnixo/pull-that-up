the girag and experienced a lot of us get there right a lot of people that we know came from a place where when they were really young they were like what the fuck is going on with the world yeah well how old do you think you were when you had your first oh I think my parents might be fuckin crazy thought well you like these people are in charge of telling me what to do this is nonsense you're making you're talking crazy talk here it happens it happened for me the first time that I took LSD and maybe before that but when I took LSD I when I took LSD for the first time I can remember whenever you take LSD especially you know I mean it you know when I took LSD what worries do I have I'm in fucking high school there's no there's nothing in it there's nothing - there's no demons to come swimming out of my brain and taunt me with like all the myriad of things you get when you're older there's just fucking nothing you just open I might be upset as like a cheerleader that came over to my house I couldn't figure out how to kiss her maybe that's like the biggest problem I'm having at the time so but I you know at that time when I did it for the first time and had that initial experience you know and you go back to your parents who've never taken it and if you mentioned to them that you'd even taken it they might want to put you in a drug rehab or they think you're insane or they think you're getting down the wrong track you're forced into this place of like fuck man I can't I you guys don't even you don't even know you you don't even understand this this new way of experiencing life you know so and I think there's a lot of people who spend their whole lives never knowing that you don't have to take psychedelics to get to that place there's other ways to get to that place but yeah it's a very strange thing and those people who never get to that place they're the ones who are a lot of them are in control right now so your life took an inexorable change when you did acid that was like the point where you look back and you said this is the point where I went off into this direction um well I know I'd say that the taking acid started with a series of like books it started with contact with like you know the whole weirdness my whole weirdness weirdness start with as I recall it started with me coming upon this book that my mom had called Raja yoga by yogi Rama Chaka who by the way it was never a yogi which is some English mystic fucking lied about being a yogi but it's all just a fascinating story but the book uh you know that was the first time I'd ever read the idea that you there that you're an observer observing yourself that you you aren't necessarily the you that you think the you that can be observed is not you you're the observer State the mindfulness the watcher that's when I that's the first time I'd come up on the idea of what that's called the Ottman the thing that observes yourself you know when you you know someone will say I'm really mad right now the moment you say I'm mad you're creating a distinction you know between the thing that's observing that you're mad and the thing that's mad so that observer that watcher that's the thing that that mindfulness is what you know throughout my whole life I try to you know go into that place of observing myself rather than being the thing I mean it's a game that you can play in it really it's quite helpful with a variety of problems especially if you get really angry if you get really angry and you can stop yourself and just watch and there's tools you can use in that book I remember it said as you walk around start thinking he is walking that was like one of the tools like it's in a book and your character notebook so when you're going around you're like you know right now he's doing a podcast right now he's talking and so that's these are these are activities designed to create this like the watch or the state of presence of watching so that started it that led me to like you know the eye and then I found out about you know I I think I read the electric kool-aid acid test you know about fucking Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters blasting themselves on acid and going to the World's Fair and a bus then I read that shit no I remember wait I'll tell you that I'll stop is weird weird rant I remember now fucking filmstrip that's what it started in my head I think I was in like a fourth grade and they showed us a drug film strip filmstrips yes fucking popped up this guy like it hot there's a guy iced over it's a guy in it it's a guy in the fucking um empty apartment and he's curled against the wall in the fetal position and it's at LSD and it looks terrible and then the narrator says LSD can make you experience hallucinations you can see dragons and I remember I'm saying you could see dragons I'm like I want to see a buddy that sounds awesome fuck the empty apartment the fetal position I'll figure it out that guy's a pussy yeah like what are you crying son dragging little bitch it's a Cassidy expect ya Iren and that was that put it in my head it's like well you know I think that's a interesting thing to explore but yeah that's hilarious so you think that you were like two Duncan's like Duncan one and Duncan two like Duncan one is like regular Duncan growing up innocent boy boom psychedelics and then Duncan - yeah I know yeah yeah there's definitely a Duncan to that happened I'd say and then that that Duncan - changed - man because you you know as you get older the best thing there's - great the best thing that can happen is you get knocked off track that's the best thing that can happen to you in general because generally the track you're on has been set for you by people who never got off their track you end up what you know you end up the child of someone who decided to have you in their 20s 21 22 they're not going to know a lot of stuff they're not going to understand the universe that much unless they were like came from a really good family of like artists or intelligent people chances are they're scared hungry desperate angry they don't want to be in the relationship anymore they don't want to be monogamous anymore the idea of non-monogamy to them might just seem insane you know like who the fuck knows hey but you're born into that planet you're that's the atmosphere you're born into that's what you're breathing when you're first born and that can set you on a weird path and that's a very sad path that you can get on and so hopefully if you're lucky you'll come across somebody who knocks you off that fucking path you know I remember the guy who hooked me up with acid I remember sitting in the theater of my school because I was taking I was a drama nerd and I sitting in the theater of my school next to this guy to a show the two next to this guy Brad and uh I remember sitting a night and we're talking and he mentioned tripping on LSD and I'm like what psycho yeah I took acid over the week I'm like what why you can get acid the movie the life the life of duck somebody must animate this here's somebody please I know your folks out there that animate shit you gotta animate this that that moment took me to and this is really weird tell me what the the first trip was like I love to the first trip was uh it was white blotter white blotter paper I don't it was just white blotter a little Pete you know for somehow if you don't know this LSD gets put on sheets let's just look like blotter paper and sometimes they have designed sometimes they don't but the name is always a reference to usually as a reference to the design on the sheet so you know purple Jesus white blotter lips you know there's a million different names for the different types of acid but so this is just white you knows what it was but it was really good and I can remember I took it and you have to you know it takes 30 to 45 minutes sometimes longer for it to kick in I still remember sitting into my friend's trailer in a trailer park in North Carolina sitting in an empty bath like when it like an empty Jacuzzi tub that was in this trailer and I'm sitting there and they're watching Star Wars and I'm sitting in this bathtub and all of a sudden the greatest it's the greatest feeling just started going through my legs and up into my body and it was a fucking sword fight it was a lightsaber fight beyond beyond beyond when I'm listening to that but all of a sudden now the sounds echoey like someone's turned and echo up on it so it's like you know we don't you know won't bear it's kind of bouncing around it's beautiful and I feel so fucking good started laughing it seems so funny then I went outside and lay in the grass I'm staring at the sky everything's beautiful trails you put your hand in front of your face and it's just this rainbow of hands drifting in front of your face everything's breathing then my friends come running out because they knew this is the first time I was tripping and they all start jumping over me they're like jumping over me as I'm laying there laughing and we're all fucking laughing and it's just perfect then I was somebody pulled a cock out that's when they pulled that we all started fucking we fucking fuck and then a dog came by and we grabbed the dog and started fucking the dog no you know it was beautiful in spirit of us it's very now yeah there was no fucking happening there was a lot of like laughing there was I remember going into my friend shitty high school car and like sitting and like pulling the seat back and looking at the ceiling and I'm looking at the ceiling and it's fucking hieroglyphics or some kind of like ancient writing you know I don't even think I knew what Sanskrit was at the time but I'd probably be like oh I'm seeing Stan script some kind of runes or glyphs all over my friends cars it's just kind of breathing and warping and it's just beautiful so yeah that was the that was the first time and once you've had that experience how do you go back to a world a normal kind of world the first time I ever did acid I've told you this before I met Kurt Cobain how crazy was that whoa Wow tell that story again I I think I died this night by the way I have this very that no I that this is what made me think of a theory that like every time you die you don't know that you died but then you left this world and everyone else in this other parallel world you know they think you die like you know Rajee a funeral this is where I thought this from was uh the first time I did ask of me and my girlfriend at the time it was Marisa I we went to go see halle-loo yeah we went to go see Nirvana and she had acid and I I've never done it before she goes let's do acid and see Nirvana so we took acid and the opening band was on which which is some Asian band that just screamed the whole time it was like you know it's kind of like annoying so I was sitting next to the side of the stage and Kurt Cobain comes around the corner and just comes out it like was really dark we could see it and he's just standing right next to me I look over I'm like what fucking guy it's Kurt Cobain and I was like hey what's up and goes hey what's up you wanna cheat oh and you're like like held out his bag and I'm like yeah and so I held on the cheeto and then suddenly he just like somebody goes Oh Kurt and then he just like throws all the Cheetos out in the crowd and then a cuz returns backstage I'm holding the cheeto and I'm going through the Cheetos of the crowd yeah like he had a bag of Cheetos that he was eating from he just threw it at the crowd yeah he just threw Cheetos everywhere I mean was this is like a mosh pit at in Dayton Ohio you know like sided stays like a rock club you know hey Arena I think it was a fucking video of Dana White getting in a mosh pit no yeah he went to arranging the machine raise against the Machine concert motherfucker got in a mosh pit she had security guards we're gonna out pharmacy jump to the mosh so I took this cheeto and I put it in my pocket like I'm like I'm going to save this cheeto you know and then I start you know tripping really hard and it was that amazing concert on the way home we're driving and we go by and like I'm driving it and this is a thunderstorm of rain I'm still tripping on that and I'm tripping on acid cuz it's Wilson oh and then and then this is even better and I swear to God you could ask her I'm not gonna say who she is on it but I we started fucking while I was driving oh the rainstorm on acid for my first time fucking bait and that's where I think I died the first time one of the first times I died it might be son iTunes oh shit iTunes recording - server get the fuck out of here server
