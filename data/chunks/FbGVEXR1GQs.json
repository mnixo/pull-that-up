podcast thank you very much for coming on you're one of our first serious guests you're like a legit human that was working for CNN like we have credentials now dude do you feel this brand yeah II feel a change coming I could get a wiki someday you can get a wikipedia I think this week I think we're gonna make it happen but uh thank you very much for coming on show I became aware of you because of the internet and I became aware of you specifically because of your interview with my crazy friend Alex Jones Alex was great he had me to talk about I mean this is a topic I'm discussing that is is difficult to get people to have you on to talk about it because yeah not Alex though no no it's like there's we found more corruption I can't believe this the insanity of it all you have to love his passion love him he's a good friend of mine I love him yeah he is so passionate and and when you follow your passion successful follow and that's happened with with Alex so he's so passionate that people think it's fake they think that like he's like some sort of a CIA plant and he's like you know living this lie of you know it's like the idea of putting up I almost wish it was fake that because like I feel I always tell him every time I hang out with him like you stress me out aren't just stress like like I feel bad for him like I can't calm down he's always yeah he's intense when he's eating hot dogs hot dogs yeah he was uh we came with us to the UFC great time with that guy he's fun dude I have to tell you after interviewing with him for an hour he's genuine no he genuinely cares about the director in this country's going in and he's willing to put his neck out on the line just like you you do Joe and and and that's admirable because you're seeing a lot of people just kind of shut up right now yeah it takes the real heroes to really come forward and talk about everything that's going on or crazy are you freaking out of your mind you know for folks who don't know the story the the the story that I got from the Alex Jones Show is and this is a subject that I have been really curious about why this wasn't receiving any mainstream coverage when we would see all this coverage what was going on in Syria and all this coverage is going on in Egypt and in Libya but no we never saw anything on Bahrain and I saw some horrific videos that I found online of just the military assassinating dissent assassinating different people that were protesting and you you looked at the video and you like how is it's not huge how is this not all over the news every day how is how are we not you know imposing sanctions on this country how are we not you know speaking out against this horrific show of this it was just horrifying to watch but it was weird how silent the mainstream news was about it it was like there was nothing and you ran into this oh yeah run into it I was knocked over by and run over no did they just hire you thinking you're a beautiful woman you just want to be like a model who's gonna read the news and you're just gonna shut the fuck up I think so and and unfortunately I'm Greek and I'm a Scorpio and I don't think they I really don't think that they knew I wasn't just a talking head puppet when I was hired I was actually hired by someone who ended up leaving the network and and so so I think they were surprised I fucked up they didn't see coming I think in ten years of people backing to evaluate the situation though they thought you are gonna be a female Ryan Seacrest and just run with this well there's a weird trend especially in Fox News they have these gorgeous women reading the news I'm like that is such a sneaky trick because especially if you're a guy who can't get laid like having a beautiful woman talk about anything like I just want to hear talk I just want to just tell him telling us going on and so like what better way to program people for your right-wing agenda then have like the hottest chicks on the planet tell you what's wrong with the left and then also have them say weapons of mass destruction yeah and it worked you know obviously we ended up in Iraq and Afghanistan and they're continuing bleeding hot chicks yeah the propaganda is strong for sure well tell us your experience cuz you you know better than anyone you were working on CNN I I saw some of the other stuff that you did that was amazing though especially the thing the piece on the child prostitutes in Las Vegas no you watch that dead yeah it was hot that I felt for that mom it was so horrible seeing that mom holding one baby talking about her other baby who's now 13 and it's just running around as a prostitute it was insane it was insane to watch so I know you did serious work for them that's like so that was some really deep shit it was a long piece what what is it like to go from that to just running into this wall and this one particular subject that set you off this Bahrain issue like what was that like it was well for me it was really disturbing I was it was horrific because I knew these people in Bahrain were being tortured and abused and and systematically killed and doctors could be killing doctors doctors were taking care of people who protested who got shot for for treating these people they got tortured yeah they got tortured some of them are still in jail these are genuinely good people ambulance drivers were be journalists one was arrested his body showed up a couple days later just full of of torture marks and and what really bothered me is because I grew up in the Midwest and I know how the American people get taken advantage of and our tax dollars are going to this bahrain regime to support them and they're the ones doing this to their people how much money do we send to Bahrain every year we send I don't know the exact amount of money but I know that we send more than a billion dollars worth of weapons we've given them more than a billion dollars worth of weapons they're using some of these weapons some of this teargas that they're using to systematically gas their people which they are doing they're taking weapons that they're allowed to use which is tear gas and birdshot and instead of using those for crowd control they're using those to systematically kill their people and gas them and this is being made in Pennsylvania with tear gas yeah they're there because it's UN approved so they're literally dropping tear gas on these villages every single day all day long and night and.and physicians for Human Rights a Nobel Peace Prize winning organization has been trying to raise hell about this because it's it's tearing up these people's lungs people who are asthmatic are dying elderly are dying they're suffocating in their homes and they're misusing this gas and it's a very system at way that they're doing it people are having miscarriages women some of these doctors are now connecting it to the tear gas so so this is something that needs to be talked about urgently because these people as I speak right now they're they're being gassed how many people have died from this so far is it so far they don't know because they can't a hundred percent you know say you were gassed and a couple days later you die because you have respiratory issues you can't 100% connect it to the gas but so far more than a couple dozen people have been killed and they just continually do this they just continually all day long yeah and and I think it's a way it's a way that they're trying to suppress the protest it's also a way that they're trying to to silence the opposition and get people in these in these neighborhoods to convince the youth to quit protesting because they keep getting gassed as as a result of it what is our business there what is our business with Bahrain that we support them well this means everything to us right now and a lot of people will say okay Bahrain is so far away what does it matter to me I always explained this to my sister because she's in that mindset she doesn't really know about the politics in the region well we keep hearing more and more about Iran and a potential war with Iran so we need we have a Navy base in Bahrain and Bahrain is right across there's a body of water separating buffering and Iran so we need that naval base if we're gonna go in and eventually attack Iran it's very strategic for the u.s. that's why we have Bahrain as an ally and so this situation is a situation where the u.s. is giving Bahrain money and keeping our base there and allowing these atrocities to happen because of a potential war with Iran so so your tax dollars are going directly to this regime not only that covering up this story further gets us into some a potential conflict with Iran because you're not knowing we're demonizing people who we want to attack and then we're praising people who we want to keep is our is our allies who we really should probably should be attacking exactly if they really wanted to stop atrocities in the world you wouldn't be looking at a you'd be looking at fucking Bahrain exactly you know we were detained violently there we were thrown on the ground we had machine guns pointed at our heads and they tried to erase all of our video and this was about 10 a ten minutes drive from the naval base where 15,000 Americans are living and you know and they tried to to bury the story but but fortunately I was with another female producer we were able to hide these these media discs actually in our in our bras during the detainment yeah now that I look back on it it's kind of funny but at the time we were very worried about the the discs falling out as you're laying on the ground you have a gun pointed at your head erasing your video you don't want that just to drop out on the floor what do you say to them oops I don't know sorry I denied my taxes I forgot so it was a it was a situation that was just pretty eye-opening that's intense and you tried to go back oh I've tried many times they won't let me back in why would you go back after that because you find a connection to this story as a journalist when you know something's happening I II you're crazy in other words no the people are really good people when you meet them you you just remember them you know you hold a big place in your heart for them and and for for their survival and and you feel duty to tell their story what isn't about the Middle East that makes these crazy dictators I mean that's really the last place in the world where dudes are still rockin an old school like that or there's like a king running a whole country there's only the Middle East and it's really fascinating when you look at human history and you find out that that's where the original civilization the oldest known civilization is Sumer that's where Iraq is it's like so those people that are there essentially the Townies of the world it's like people in the Middle East they're like these dictators I mean they really are running things the way they did thousands of years ago they have never had to evolve they've never had to move on like the rest of the world has so I don't think we can even wrap our heads around the idea of kings in this country it's like it seems even though as our police state clamps down on our rights starts slipping away every with more of these insane bills that passed I still don't think we understand what it would be like to be under the rule of Saddam Hussein and having his day and whatever there's other sons name those crazy evil psychopath sons running around torturing and killing people I don't think we can even understand that I think that's almost outside of our range so as long as something like this Bahrain isn't reported on it's not talked about in the news we don't have to focus on it we don't we don't really it doesn't it doesn't register with us and and we're keeping them in power we're keeping these dictators in power so that's another thing that I don't think our current government wants us to discuss because they they don't want the people to be outraged and make us leave and they don't want this protest to succeed because if the protests succeed these protesters are going to kick the u.s. out I mean the US has aided this regime and oppressing them for decades and and so so that's another reason the US doesn't want this reported on in the mainstream news Wow it's so crazy because I guess the idea is by not have taking military action against someone like that you're you know but what are you just turning a blind eye to it I mean how are you how do you continue to how do you to send them weapons how's that possible it seems it just seems unconscionable it seems like it at a certain point time someone has to cross some line somewhere and just go what are what exactly are we doing like is it really that important to go into Iran that we're allowing this country to run like this like but why are we supporting this like what are we doing as a country are we completely about dollar bills now is it just about controlling oil ports and and and and pathways I mean that's really what the Iran thing is about right it's about controlling the about being able to get oil out of what is that that that shipping route yessir and and it's about it's about exactly and it's not don't let people lie to you and tell you it's about they're worried about human rights abuses in an Iran because look what we're doing in Bahrain in order to potentially attack Iran where we're helping them oppress hundreds of thousands of people on a daily basis so so if we really cared about human rights we wouldn't we would have left buffering a long time ago we wouldn't be sending them weapon we would be in Mexico right exactly and and we're being in it and once again Joe this goes back to the American public being lied to systematically by the media and it's a real shame I think so many people say oh well the Americans are stupid and they don't know what's going on and no it's Americans are being fed lies constantly all day long and and it really needs to stop it's a shame now you were there you're inside you're on CNN now what was it that you wanted to report on that you couldn't what was the the exact censorship what did they tell you what you could or couldn't say about it yeah well what happened was once I got back from Bahrain they were surprised went obviously the Bahrain regime when we started airing this video because we were able to sneak out with the video they thought that they had erased all of our video and so we started airing these stories and at first it was great CNN was letting us air all of these and that was for a you know about a week or so it was very easy to get coverage on but then Bahrain started calling and complaining and their PR companies they pay US citizens and US PR companies to do PR for them the people can't afford that but of course the regime can and and then eventually three months later we finished our documentary and we found out that it wasn't going to be airing on CNN international it aired once on CNN US but never on CNN international to the target audience which is is the most in the most viewed English news station in the region and so we need these people needed to see this documentary and it wasn't airing and and I've had documentaries I've done at CNN the de Narron CNN international but this entire documentary was shot overseas and and what really got me was my bosses directly above me where it were dumbfounded we would have phone calls and emails and people said I don't know why this is an airing I don't know what's going on my producers were very very upset I mean they had risked their lives to tell this story our sources had risked their lives to tell CNN their story one guys who worked for Doctors Without Borders his house was burnt down after he talked with us and and yeah I mean in our main source and the documentary he's in prison right now his mom just died yesterday and he didn't even get to say goodbye to her nabil her job he's in prison for the next three years and he's a peace activist who has a picture of Gandhi on his cell phone and so all of these sources that helped us film this documentary were punished and harassed for helping CNN and so we still couldn't believe why they hadn't aired it on CNN International and and so I kept getting people writing me and calling me and telling me you need to look into this there's something going on here there it's a it's a much bigger story and seeing as how I don't have a family and you know I'm not tied down to a retirement plan or I really could give a crap about about the money I started looking into it and realizing that Bahrain is actually a paying customer at CNN they are literally paying the network for programming journalistically I don't know if a lot of people out there listening know about journalistic ethics but we're supposed to be watchdogs on government we're not supposed to accept money from them not only accepting money okay that's different if you accept money and you air a commercial but they're actually airing hour-long programs on CNN paid for by the Bahrain regime not only Bahrain we're talking Georgia Kazakhstan and other other regimes and this has been going on for decades and and it bothers me because people are being lied to so it's just paid propaganda their their programming unit for propaganda so instead of being the news they're their select pieces of information that these governments want Americans and whoever watches CNN to see so they pay them for it yeah they paid legal well journalistically it's it's I would if there were journalists police I would arrest them but it it is legal but is it right because when the air some of these programs Joe they don't let the viewers know that that's paid for by the government right when you watch like one of those wacky fake talk shows where they're selling a blender they have to tell you this is a paid infomercial they have to tell you when this blender guys and his talk show so now it's showing you know how you make cucumbers slice real easy and stuff they have to tell you why don't they have to tell you that on CNN that seems way more important than the fucking blender well exactly because it's shaping our foreign policy I mean they're feeding the American public this propaganda so that they think everything's rosy and happy and in Bahrain when really the situation there is is horrific and if you look at one of these programs you can YouTube it it's it's called I list Bahrain they have their host Richard Quest they have him live at the racetrack for a week in Bahrain talking about how wonderful the country is and how progressive it is and he interviews the Crown Prince and calls him a reformer and and this is the same Crown Prince he was in in power when troops shot and killed in broad daylight these tanks just shot out into a crowd of protesters and just killed him in broad daylight this is the the prince that two years earlier CNN was telling the public was great was progressive a reformer and and it's not fair to the public when you watch these the disclosures are so minimal or they're not even there if you go on YouTube the videos you know it's not fair to not only CNN's journalists to our sources but but to the people watching because they don't know they're getting propaganda so this has been going on for decades so for decades we haven't had real news we've had a mixture of some real news and some bullshit that's paid for by other countries yes and we wonder why we end up in Iraq and in Afghanistan and and these conflicts you know and this is where we're seeing it now yeah our striving to meet international expectations for a high profile football tournament Europe second largest country if you look up yeah the Ukraine I mean are they letting the Ukraine pay look up I list Bahrain commercial and you can watch the whole commercial and you'll see not once in the commercial that's like progressive fabulous new this week we're talking about Bahrain you know it never says and then commercial that this is paid for by buffering and and so it's that's not fair to the people it's not it's not fair to view no it's just beyond creepy how big is Bahrain Bahrain is about the size Bahrain is small it's about the size of San Francisco population wise you can't say by every time right actually gotta say Bahrain Bahrain okay you know what I mean it's like one of those words like if you commit to saying it correctly every time bah rai n and and also we can you can see a video of these protests they're insane you watch them and you just see miles of people protesting and and then you really realize this is a true revolution they're trying to have their but it's being oppressed by the United States because you know if the people get empowered they're gonna kick the u.s. out they're very upset because the US has has kept the regime in power first so we're helping this creepy fuck by giving them a billion dollars with a weapon just tear gassing people to death oh yeah and and not only that they're systematically getting it off the the news in the US as what happened to me it was it was it became nearly impossible to cut through the red tape this is really disturbing if you had any hope whatsoever that we were going to avoid some sort of conflict with Iran it seems like that is just they're dead set on it that's why another reason I came forward urgently because this is about much more than Bahrain and the systematic cover-up of what's happening about marine only tells you what's what's potentially gonna happen in the future and and in the near future and that's an attack on Iran or potentially some people if you go to the far side who have really analyzed this could say this could potentially become world war 3 Jesus Christ I mean is that what it's about I mean it's just a control oil and it's just this is the way they've always done it so they're going to continue to do it this way even though now people are paying attention finally for the first time in human history yeah well they're gonna tell you if you talk to people who are very pro-israel and and once again I don't have an opinion on on any of that area I try to cover that objectively I've covered stories in the West Bank and in Israel but they're gonna tell you that Iran Oakland and Ishod said he will wipe Israel off the map and they're gonna repeat that over and over because that's there for award propaganda that they're gonna start feeding to you and they already have four years and actually if you go back to that speech that they're referring to Ahmed in Azad never said that it was mistranslated but instead they rolled with that and the US media's continued to roll with that watch erin burnett show yeah I've seen the the original when they when it's translated correctly it's a totally different meaning it wasn't that we were but it wasn't nice but it wasn't the same thing exactly I think it was in response to if Israel attacked Iran you know we would wipe them off the map or something along those lines wasn't it I'm saying that they want the regime out of Israel they want that government out it was more rhetoric than physically that we want to go in and murder you all and kill you it was more we want you to be be kicked out of office so we sort of have equated it to like Khrushchev banging his heel you know saying we will bury you like that that sort of a thing that's like so we've we've decided to run with that as the big threat yep exactly and they say if Israel Iran gets a nuclear summit right in and wipe Israel off the map so that's what they're trying to use that for and everyone needs to pay attention it is it is propaganda it is a forward it's just like weapons of mass destruction I see them now now that I've been in inside I know how they start feeding propaganda and this is exactly what they're doing was saying well it only Ron's gonna wipe Israel off the map so we need to go in and attack and and guys I mean this could potentially get us into a conflict with much more permanent and damning implications than then Iraq and Afghanistan ever ever were yeah it seems like this would be huge this would be much bigger if we actually went into Iran it's a it's another level of civilization above what was going on in Afghanistan and and in Iraq and there's there's no reason for it it doesn't make any sense and there's no way the rest of the world is going to tolerate it it's gonna be it's gonna be chaos yeah we have Russia and China to worry about as well if we go in yeah and and and and Lord knows what could happen from there I just hope that the American people realize that there they are being fed propaganda with with the Iran situation now and the same people behind Iraq same forces are behind this push to get us in Iran did you see of course he did but what did you think when you saw the Netanyahu cartoon when he's explaining with his fucking wily coyote bomb you know what I wanted to laugh but it was it was so sad because I just see the logic the the lack of logic and how they're actually able to get that to work he's just saying okay you guys are children so I'm gonna draw you a child's cartoon and see I can't explain to you this I'm gonna show you on the fake bomb that no one's ever seen a bomb it looks like that that's a bomb from a cartoon I mean it's so weird that they chose that image for this like really ridiculous propaganda well you know what that tells you Joe that tells you what they think of the intelligence of the American public that they think he could go up with some stupid-ass cartoon and and try to feed us that bullshit to get us into another war I mean it does does he think that the American public is that is that stupid did you see the lobbyist for Israel who was thinly veiled trying to promote some sort of a false flag event he was talking about what we need to do we need to have a green light to start our war with Iran and it's just like we needed Pearl Harbor to happen for us to attack Japan we needed the Gulf attack he's the gulf of tonkin which is a known false flag event I mean it's been proven that the Gulf of Tonkin it was the whole thing was a big fake story in order to get people to be excited about going to war in Korea or in Vietnam and he was talking about that as if it was like some sort of an actual historical event like to bring it up like that in 2012 it's either you have to either plead extreme ignorant or you've got to say that this is a thinly veiled statement that we need another false flag event because we're gonna go into Iran no matter what so let's just pretend Iran tried to blow something up and go fuck him up and they did try to do that in 2007 and perhaps the most hunted whistleblower is not Julian Assange it's a woman named Gwyneth Todd who who worked for in the administration she was an adviser to the military and she actually blew the whistle on a 2007 false flag event where they were going to try to do exactly that that was Bush's last thing before getting out of office they wanted to take out Iran and she blew the whistle and potentially saved thousands of lives now she's in Australia hiding well now you just gave her up no they know she's enough no no uh there was a story done on it a couple stories guys I'm not trying to not trying to get her in trouble here but she's a real hero and not and that did they did try to do that what was the false flag event though it's it's funny when you say they to look who exactly is it it's doing it like how many people are involved in something like this well that's what worries me is because when it says that the same forces behind that and Iraq are now behind the current push to get into Iran and I trust her because she risked everything to come forward and and reveal that and now is in hiding in Australia and I don't know all of the details about it but I do know that they were they were going to try to make it look like Iran had had blown something up or attacked one of our US bases I don't know exactly listen to me rambling I yeah if you look it up it's called um if you just look up just look up Gwyneth Todd and gwy n ETH and then Tod D do won't even let me it just says do you mean Paltrow Google's trying to fucking yeah look her up it's a pretty unbelievable story I tweeted about it if you go to at amber lion and scroll down somewhere down in my timeline I tweeted about it days ago she was a US senator I guess huh no no no I'm sorry this is Patrick Leahy and a u.s. senator who is I guess there's responding to what she revealed yeah he's saying that there should be an investigation of the false flag terror plot yeah and it was huge I mean this this was they were going to try to start start a war with Iran with this and this is the u.s. making up lies and they and and one thing they were gonna do is use these protesters in Bahrain and make them also look like terrorists and in this attack had it succeeded and it would have worked because most people haven't been to Bahrain they don't know if these people are extremists or terrorists how did we get to be such a nation of cunts what what went wrong with us because that's not what the American people if you talk to the average American person they think of what is America well America is about freedom we're about carving your own path we're about what how did we get to be this nation of people that are led by these really evil corporations I mean that's essentially what the military is if you look at the military it's it's it's something that the the banks and the people that are in power the people that put presidents in power are using in order to force their corporate agenda it's all about controlling some resource you know extracting some resource controlling some areas that's all it's about it's not as nothing like whenever they call it defense it's so offensive because like what are you defending us against see you're out there fucking people up like it almost has nothing to do with defense it has everything to do with offense if you say the best defense is a good offense well then I guess maybe you can call it defense but it's not what we think of ourselves we don't think of ourselves as this horrific force that's destroying you know parts of the world in order to control its resource we don't think about that at all we think of ourselves most people like to think of America is a fucking eagle or something you know we like to think of ourselves as proud people who you know can come here and anybody can make it and there's no caste system here and you can really work hard and get ahead and how the fuck did we become this nation run by assholes it's just it's weird I know and it's it's weird when you wake up at that moment and realize oh my god you've been lied to almost all of your life about about certain things that are happening in this country is it just that we have too much power there's too many American military bases there's too many areas we control is that what it is is that is it we're just too greedy with it you know I I don't know exactly what's behind this but it but I do know that I mean if you look at NDAA and things that have happened over just I know just in my career over the past decade I covered the oil spill I've covered the nuclear industry the all the wars and really getting into it I start the more I analyze it the more I think we've really lost control of the country that people have it doesn't seem to me about the people at all it seems to be about having the legal means to squash any dissent any way they want and that's in place now because of NDAA which people understand keep rallying against it talk to my like God why are you so freaking out about this well this is why because they can essentially throw you in jail you can't call your lawyer you have no trial they can do whatever they want with you now there's no rights anymore it's essentially they put into law that they are just like a king they can do what a king wants to do now this Bradley Manning guy who pulled the pulled the plug on WikiLeaks and the guy who distribute all the information to them or who blew the whistle rather he pulled the plug documents he's in he's in solitary confinement and they've they've had him there for years now do shit with him they're just gonna let him rot you know they're gonna barely feed them and keep the lights on and let them go crazy good luck you know that's that's America that's America if you if you expose the bad things that we've done we're gonna do a horrific thing and literally torture you for the rest of your life and that's torture 24 hours a day of light you know no note people to talk to and no booth books to read just dis you by yourself good luck and and that's another story it was really difficult to cover stories of leaks and stuff well while I was at CNN and overall in general because of Obama's war on whistleblowers and journalists now isn't that amazing when you think of Obama you think a guy that everybody thinks of as this really progressive guy well he's a socialist even you know he's a guy who's had a single mom and was raised in a very very moderate family you know didn't have money and it really made his own way very intelligent guy made through Harvard and here he is doing some of the worse shit to this to the Constitution to the to the the principles this country is founded on that has ever happened in our lifetime and this guy's doing it this guy is going after whistleblowers in a way that even Bush didn't and journalists he right now he's been subpoenaing journalists for their sources and and he's gone after more journalists and whistleblowers than any other president in history and including one journalist James risin of the New York Times of clit surprise winning journalists he's gone after him with subpoenas to try to get him to reveal information about his sources as journalist we don't give up our sources I mean that's a number-one rule so and in effect he's turned journalism into a criminal behavior and turned us into criminals and and and that's for me that's it's terrifying because if someone comes to me and leaks a document that's vital to the public good that we need to know about in order to fix our government then I become a target too because they come after me and NDAA that's another fear they have a fear it will be used against journalists because they will because we're not giving up our sources they will consider us to be aiding terrorists or terrorism and and and lock us up as well and I think there's a lot of fear amongst the investigative reporters investigative reporting community that this could happen under NDAA so you're at CNN all this is going down and you're you're you're realizing that your piece has been pulled from the international arm of CNN and what is uh what is the next step what do you do do you do you start asking questions do you try to poke around or is it a what it what kind of atmosphere is CNN like when it comes to this issue yeah I I did I I went on on behalf of my my crew and I went and made a meeting with the head of CNN International Toni Maddox and and not a lot of people do that and my crew was was I just saw the looks on their faces they were very upset so I met with him and you didn't give me any answers as to why it never aired I met with him twice what What did he say what was his response when you asked him why didn't it get aired the first time he said he'd get back to me and then he never got back to me so I made an appointment months later and at that point he questioned me as to why a well-known New York Times reporter Nick Kristof had tweeted about the fact that they never aired the documentary he tweeted something to the effect of CNN why didn't you air amber Lyons I revolution documentary intimidation suggesting that Bahrain had intimidated CNN it's not airing it and so he only questioned me about that and a more of a kind of condescending you better not be talking kind of way and then I eventually our unit was dissolved at CNN so I was forced out they dissolved our doctor an investigative unit and and I kept having this in the back of my head like you know when you can't sleep at night because you know something is going on and I didn't know how to come out and tell people about it because it's it is a very I had to get all my ducks in a row because Time Warner is very powerful enemy to have against you and and so finally when I came out and I just to test the waters mentally I eat it about the fact that they had had censored the documentary and then right away my agent was called and I was told on behalf of all the main executives at CNN my agent was called and told on behalf of these executives you need to be quiet or you're gonna lose your health insurance and your severance and at that point when I knew that when they called to threaten me I knew that that I had to come out with this full fledge because because at that point it solidified that they're they're trying to cover something up and shut me up Wow it's so creepy it's so it's so such a movie it's uh who would be the star of this movie John Cusack yeah I think John Cusack would be like a guy who you worked with in the office no I wouldn't offend you like that how dare I'm thinking about who'd play you I guess you could go with Jennifer Aniston Oprah but she Jennifer Aniston's a little long in the tooth for you we need what she's still pretty hot long in the tooth yes well how old are you you about let me guess I was gonna say 28 you're right I'm 29 Oh see you figure you're there Jennifer Aniston is gorgeous but she's 40 you know that's creepy absol ad play it was like this you'd watch the movie like this bitch is not 28 the fuck is going on you know I've been compared to Claire Danes on homeland I haven't I've never watched that show I never watch that show I don't know if that would work you're a more attractive version that really annoying check that's in a lot of movies for the one from the the doctor TV show the Fox her name the one who was in the movie with Seth Rogen where he got her pregnant katherine heigl there you go yeah that's she seems a little annoying really not really just the type it's it's not her I'm sure she's a great person just the type of movies it's always these wacky romantic oh she's got handcuffs dangling from her finger she's a rascal and this guy they're not gonna get together well but maybe they are you know really serious what's their you know yeah they look brutal have you ever worked with the Vice guys before or vice calm I am a fan of their work I I do like I like the stuff that they do I like their style of reporting is very candid it's I mean that's been one of the suggestions that keeps coming up over and over on Twitter people are like you got to get amber together with the Vice guys cuz they take you back in they don't give a fuck they'll drop you from an airplane in a parachute and to Bahrain yep yeah I've been trying to figure out how to go back in there you're crazy you need to stay out of there they're gonna kill you well I was thinking about if I borrowed a friend's passport and then you know it cut my hair brown but I don't think it would work well specially you talked about it on the internet now that I'm letting them know exactly how chance guys know what you need is like one of those Eddie Murphy Big Momma body things yes no a full big fat bodysuit I smell sex change yeah but Eddie Eddie Murphy when he had that a big suit on what movie was a big momma how many black guys have done that god damn it Martin Lawrence does that shit he's got the the big momma right is it Martin Lawrence big momma yeah that was a good movie I like big momma let's not dishonor but it's not them listen I'm saying it's a weird phenomenon that these black dudes will wear these giant black woman outfits and a black dude will pretend to be a black woman an older black woman it's like super common you know Madea and that Tyler Perry guy and I pee non-stop non-stop that's what he does he's a guy and he pretends to be an old black woman it's weird but it's a black thing it's crazy and Chris not not Chris Rock I think Dave Chappelle was was talking about how strange that is once in an interview it is strange it's very strange how many versions there are of it you know like Jamie Foxx and in living color remember he was that crazy crazy black woman yeah what was that a Sheneneh yeah that was that I don't know guys I think that was I think that that was what it was but yeah that's a weird phenomenon you know there's not a lot of like guys that pretend to be women it's like Robin Williams miss Doubtfire was like the last one I can remember whatever dudes white dudes pretending to be women not that many right Robin Williams mrs. Doubtfire yeah what was the the show with Tom Hanks bosom buddies yeah this might be the last time [Laughter] the white girls but that was the Wayans brothers they pretended to be girls right I don't know how the fuck we got on this tangent I don't think that's gonna work you in a black as a big black woman do you think you do a big black woman voice like say welcome to Bahrain why are you here I'm just here to check out your country honey you got a beautiful country up in here I just want to go shopping oh that's terrible it's a white woman under there pull that rubber off this shit is not real my impersonation is always about end up becoming spenders well then you should pretend that you don't speak English that bet they don't speak Spanish I bet you know you'd fucking fudge your way through the whole experience she doesn't have a voice like way she looks do you find that knowing Spanish you realize how perverted all the Mexicans here you know oh my god story about that not only that in so I grew up in the Midwest so the middle of the country where no one were banished st. Louis Missouri and and so I was at a restaurant there where all the a lot of the staff speaks Spanish very loudly because I know no one in st. Louis no Spanish in one time I'm sitting there and I'm ordering food and I hear the guys talking about my and breasts and everything else and clearly understand it and and toward the end I let him go on for a couple minutes and toward the end I turned to them and I said Katie stick a pianist and a bad gut begin yeah which really means how sad that you have a small penis and they laugh so hard they were throwing stuff around the room and and and I really got him and that's kind of the way to do it like if I hear something I'll turn it and I'll just say that kind of slide them and then they get a laugh out of it and then maybe know in the future that people speak their language yeah especially Spanish that's a pretty common one yeah it's one of the most common second languages that's probably tele yeah it's got to be a weird thing to be able to just yell shit out and nobody understands what you're saying you know yeah my ex-girlfriend she could speak and she would tell me like all the time like that person just said I had nice tits while we were walking by him but she learned after a while she wouldn't tell me for look until like minutes later cuz I kept on getting pissed a bit what the fuck you know dude try to get all aggro no I just become an asshole like I'm gonna do some nice ism yeah they just think it's almost like they doing it on the Internet yeah you know like they doing it anonymously I think they think they're just getting away with it and it's not even really what's actually the opposite of doing on the internet because it's only for them you know it doesn't even reach you it's like them saying something kunti about you but you can't even read it you know you see my George Washington pictured the George Washington with a Terminator gun artists on Etsy just makes all these like like presidents like like in like crazy situations like riding horses and unicorns and tigers and stuff it's fascinating that when you go back to the Constitution and when you go back to these guys that were originally starting off this country and they kind of saw this shit coming it's really amazing when you really look at like the obvious patterns of corruption that people in power seemed to follow over and over and over again those guys all saw it coming they all they all saw it coming they they had you know they had provisions they had it set up so you're supposed to protect people from that as much as possible I'm not supposed to use the military to control civil unrest you not suppose we use the army on it's us citizens all that was changed by NDAA and that's another thing that a lot of people don't know that was you're allowed to use the military now the military can come in the army against the US citizens that's that's crazy the whole country can be declared a battlefield yeah and that only you only know what I mean if they're going to all of these lengths to to create the ability to do that what what's in store when it comes to dissent you know I mean did you see the photos out of Anaheim yes of all the police Dresden yeah I with camouflage you see the Walmart one the other day no I'd like the sound canyons and everything like that at a Walmart protest some of there's a protest yeah I find it find out um the Anaheim thing was weird because there was a media blackout about it and you know that was it was really ugly the watching people wearing full military gear with camo desert camo walking through the streets is really unsettling because first of all why are they wearing fucking camo you know that's a what do you call you hiding are you pretending we're in Iraq are you reminding me that these people are our trained killers that go to Iraq and now I'm the enemy is that what this is supposed to be am I supposed to feel unpatriotic for not giving in to what's going on here a cop shot a kid in the back and people are freaking out that's everybody should be freaking out obviously some horrible thing happened everybody should be freaking out including these people that are holding these guns including these people wearing camo with body armor you should be freaking out too because this is all America this is all part of your community and someone who is in a position of power made a horrible mistake and these people want justice and you know what they should get it there's a they should they should be able to feel safe there's a terrible gap between the way people are in power whether it's police officers whether it's anybody that is in a position of power and the people that get suppressed by those people then that gap is a really scary thing and what a cop who was in a position of power shoots a kid and then they see no repercussions they see a completely different reaction than if the kid had shot the cop everybody has a right to freak out because we are supposed to be equal in this country and someone who is in a position of power clearly qua all the legal lines they clearly fucked up they clearly violated the relationship between the person and power and the person they're supposed to be protecting and to see people reacting that's the way they chose to react by sending in the military whoa oh that's that's not how you're supposed to do it you're supposed to do it by sitting down with the community and figuring out what we can do to make sure this never happens again and to make sure that the person who did this never has the opportunity to do this again whether it's put him in jail whether it's take them out of office you know fire them instantly and put him in jail whatever it is whatever you know the courts being the correct action but you have to have justice do you have to have justice for everybody it can't just be for you know people who can afford it it can't just be for people in power it can't just be it's it's it's we're in a weird place now it's a weird place is this what is this this is the Walmart photos check out check out these like that that's one of those sound Oh an LRAD device yeah now what happened and they have look at that other dress I mean it looks like something out of Judge Dredd i I just you know what that is that's an intimidation see that see those people there they're not armed they're not look at that old older man it's it's an intimidation tactic I saw that when I was covering the protest in Anaheim it's a way to try to make people scared too so it's not that they're they're anticipating that they're gonna need all that armor they're only doing that because they want everybody to freak out that the stormtroopers and you're starting to see that we solved at the Republican National Convention you're starting to see that all over the country and that's why it worries me as a journalist Anaheim was I mean that guy Manuel Diaz was shot in broad daylight so people were obviously upset and I remember being there and we were in the middle of the road at a March and I looked over my shoulder and I saw the trucks coming down the street with guys with police officers dressed in camo and I had I it's almost like everything just came to a stop even the protestors everyone could not believe what they were seeing that these officers were dressed like that for unarmed children and women and and men who were protesting and you know it's it's I I feel a systemic crushing of dissent or bye-bye police departments across the country was there any danger was there any looting or any rioting what was going on that they would feel the need to bring in and essentially you know tanks and military what is that they were trying to head to Disneyland so the protesters are upset they feel like it was influenced somehow by Disneyland because they were going to March and they felt that the you see them you know there they are on horseback oh I remember I took a shot of that lady tale and so they they literally made it impossible for the protesters to march look that's that's what I saw when I was walking down the street shooting photographs and I couldn't believe it yeah and and look they're carrying bo cans in their hands those are wooden Japanese swords to hit people with see that officer there not only that they were firing beanbag rounds and interior gasps the horses are my goggles on and right there that's that the intersection and they wanted to go down that intersection and turn and head to Disneyland to protest because they felt soldiers with fucking guns if you have another video look up Tim Poole and amber Lyon shot it by Anaheim police because we were trying to cover this Joe and and the police we had noticed kept setting up walls to keep us behind the police officers as we were covering it so we wouldn't be there with the people to see how they were being treated also to see how they were being shot with these non-lethal rounds and at one point I was actually fired on by the Anaheim Police Department with less lethal rounds but they I was clearly standing in a busy street and they knew here we are so we're in a busy street and there I am right there and the guy yells fucking pigs and then listen now and see the u-haul right then I stopped and I was literally sitting there and I hit him between two u-hauls as as rounds kept going past he was able to smart enough to be able to scale a wall but watch he gets fired on again by the way those bullets the non-lethal they could take your eye out easily and if they hit you and you're dead not only that if they hit you in the ribs and your your ribs go into your heart it can kill you if it hits you in the neck and and in the head it can crack your skull I've seen it happen overseas Jesus Christ and this isn't just a neighborhood of in Anaheim people were were so they fired on you like you guys like this is a war yeah and I was hiding between the two you halls and and I was yelling for Tim because I didn't know he had gotten away and and I thought he'd been hit and so I kept yelling for him to see if he was okay and then and look he's running now because they're just shooting down the streets I mean these poor people living in this neighborhood Jesus Christ and and so at this point I come out this is just the cops doing this yeah this is the police so who are we really scared of here and the protesters or the police because the protesters weren't shooting at me and and I and I clearly have blond hair and a bright green shirt on and and was shooting photos of a dumpster that had been set on fire and I and finally when after a couple minutes I ran out and I screaming press and they quit firing and one of the officers looked at me and said I was really worried about you and then and then he also said don't you know how to cover a riot and then he pointed back at a photographer who was behind the police line with them following the police instead of actually hanging out with the protesters like we're supposed to do as journalists where we're out there to be a watchdog on Authority and protect the public and in other words that's that's what I believe they were doing is trying to keep me from being with the protesters to film their injuries as civilians and bystanders are getting hit by these these less less lethal rounds and and that that's pretty scary because they're trying to oppress not only these these voices of dissent but journalism and how is that possible that are the system of government that we have that the people that are in power are slowly tightening things down on us in the same age as the end of the information we're getting from the internet now the the same age of instant information instant about anything answers to any question the the distribution of information through you know social media through podcasts and Twitter and Facebook it's never been greater the access to information it's like so instant and so so yet at the same time you have this crazy crackdowns this crazy police state it's almost like we're putting turning the light on a vampire and it's shrieking and reacting and showing us its true self like in this these days gone by when we didn't have the access to information when we didn't know what was going on during the Gulf of Tonkin we didn't know what's going on during who knows how many different United States ventures overseas we when we didn't know we we had a different impression of ourselves we have a different impression of the whole system of government that we operated under we had a is it that or is it things are getting worse is it that or we really do have crooks in in office and they are acting differently than Jimmy Carter would have or Bill Clinton would have I mean is that what's going on I think that it's a little bit of both I think that it's surprising law enforcement that oh my gosh wait a minute I can't just shoot it someone now the video is gonna go on YouTube and people will know forever that I did this so so thank goodness for social media it's making a lot of this stuff what happen with this video this these cops shooting at you people picked it up arty picked it up people criticized our tea but our tea at least is covering what's happening in this country why do people criticize our team because it's they say you know it's state-sponsored and they're not accurately portraying what's happening in Russia but regardless there they are accurately covering what's happening here in the US and and and that should have been if you're really looking at the situation with journalism and in the US and the survival and what's an important story that should have been on all of the mainstream media outlets when we were we were just we were shot it but not just that those cops should go to jail like what the fuck is that someone yells out pigs so you start shooting them really shooting them with rubber bullets that's an asshole that has rubber bullets that's all that is that there's no this guy getting shot right here yeah Rococo and right now he's loading a shotgun with those are beanbag rounds it's essentially a Ledge this is could maintain your line and look at them they're the majority of the so the community there is more than 53 percent Hispanic the police force is about twenty four percent this is so hard to talk that I get tongue-tied I get baffled I don't know what to say it just it doesn't it seems it's like a horrible scene in a movie it doesn't seem real you know when you see this weird tightening down this weird police state this in impending police state that just keeps getting bigger and bigger and worse and worse fucking flaming dumpsters means it's a goddamn video game yeah and these guys were just they were walking down Andros the police just walking through these neighborhoods and you would see people peering out their gates ferret they're looking just horrified as walls of police officers would just come through their neighborhoods and just start firing and going through dark alleyways and firing there are many times I had to scream press see look at that right now they're just walking through these neighborhoods with their guns pointed and these are elderly people and right there's those are beanbag rounds and then the red things are pepper balls and what the pepper balls do it's like a paint ball but filled with with pepper spray and and it comes out you know makes it hard to breathe the beanbag rounds those are what worried me because those have a lead pellet wrapped around a pillow wrapped around a lead pellet and they can still tear open your skin and like we were talking about earlier if they hit you in the chest and your ribs were to break and pierce your heart you could die as well as you could crack your skull it's killed people if it hits you in the neck and that's why it's terrifying to be shot it like that and you saw those people just standing in the street and they're doing it like it's nothing just like it's nothing and where they're shooting at that guy when he's just standing up hold his hands I said fuck him insane that's insane yeah a lot of pedestrians were were hit or had to dodge bullets because they they just came out to see what was happening they saw a dumpster on fire and said what's going on and they would stand on the street corners and just look to see what was going on they weren't even involved in test and they were fired on is this how it's always been it doesn't seem like it it doesn't seem like that would have happened just a decade ago does it mean doesn't it wasn't was was this how it was I mean obviously they had a clamp down during the LA riots but it seems like the LA riots was a far more violent protest it was it was far crazier and it was a huge racial divide but even then I don't remember seeing this I don't remember seeing people just walking down streets just firing indiscriminately into alleys and shooting at reporters shooting at people that call them pigs I mean someone calls you a pig you're allowed to shoot at them I mean really that's crazy yeah and and I think that you know that has been a journalistically a lot of us have been trying to analyze whether things have gotten worse or they haven't and I've just noticed myself I've been covering the protests for a year I've noticed things getting worse as far as the garb that police are wearing the video game like intimidation tactics when they wear these ridiculous uniforms to a couple old people and in front of Walmart you saw that this is systematically dangerous for this country because what it does is it instills fear and and people and it makes people scared sometimes to get out and protest not only that it agitates people look at Anaheim they were fine they just had come out to get upset about Manuel Diaz and then the police show up and start firing on them I don't know if you saw the video of the police dog getting loose on the crowd I did yeah I mean that's another hard one to watch anyway and the cops said that it slipped I lost the leash whoops sorry I let the monster go on women and children yeah and they were walking with their guns and just firing on people in broad daylight and what did the protesters do that started I mean there was it was there any violence at all that started this escalation I I think it first it started with the police dog getting loose on the crowd are you talking about just Anaheim system yeah like what did what did Anaheim do what did the protesters do that started this escalation well what happened was first the police dog got released on the crowd and then they're firing on women and children and so that created a lot of anger then they went to City Hall to complain and then the protesters didn't leave the front of City Hall so that night a I think a couple rocks had been thrown or I know a bottle at one point came right past my head and hit the ground so I don't know but I didn't see who threw it but it did come from the crowd of protest or so so that could have been what agitated the situation but at the same time she was fairly minimal for what the way the escalation that you see in that video yeah and right after a bottle or rocks were thrown I mean the a wall of officers when I say a wall a wall of officers just started Bam Bam Bam Bam into the into the crowd and there were women and children and so crazy it's just I mean I know that Obama can't have his finger on every trigger he can't be the one that's calling for all of this but it just it's so shocking for me after the the idea that everybody kind of thought when this guy got into office that at least socially this was a change for the better this was a guy who was obviously really intelligent really like a highly educated thoughtful a great speaker young and vibrant and this sort of represented hope a black guy he's the president just represented like this new breath of fresh air like finally we got this guy in the off this is a fuckin president my whole life I've been waiting for this guy to be in the office and then this shit happens it's like it's it's it's it's crazy it's it's the best evidence ever that the president doesn't really get to ever really be the president that the president's just a puppet and that's when I came to that realization because I when I saw that that everyone everyone had called for change and and then when I saw not only that but the historically speaking the Democratic Party has been more favorable toward journalism and journalists and and to see the way he's attacking systematically journalism with NDAA and with the subpoenas and and how things just really haven't changed the only thing that's changed as we've had now are our First Amendment rights taken away from us at an alarming rate and it kind of makes you think you really have to you really have to stop and think you are not being an extremist in your views and you're not out there to really logically put things together put the pieces of this puzzle together and realize that we don't have control of this country anymore it's it is a nicely dressed dictatorship that's what it's like it's uh it's kind of a cute costume on it's got this costume on it but if you look at the rules the rules are essentially a dictatorship with NDAA especially that's just once you become I mean Julian Assange is essentially just did what a journalist is supposed to do I know there's a lot of people that are confused about what he did there's a lot of people there's lot of misinformation about his releasing of names of people that were undercover but that's not true at all if you if you look at what he actually did what he actually did was release some horrific facts and that's supposed to be what journalism is about journalism is supposed to be holding people accountable so that we don't have to have this distorted perception of what we're doing overseas so we actually can see the horrific nature of these crimes they're fucking war crimes they're horrible things and it's a daily day-to-day thing and all of a sudden it was thrust into the public eye but it wasn't by the New York Times and it wasn't by The Washington Post wasn't by the Boston Globe it was by this one freaky dude with white hair you know and so it was really easy to call this guy an enemy it's really easy and that's what they've got him labeled now he's an enemy of the state they have him labeled as an enemy of the state but you look at his actual actions there really has been nothing horribly even if he was a United States citizen there's nothing he did he what he did if he was a United States citizen would essentially be patriotic what he did was expose the bad elements of our government so that the good elements could clean up the mess because when you find a cop that's doing something illegal you find a cop at selling drugs you don't it's not you're not supposed to bring that up and expose that and then you go to jail for being an enemy of the state no it's supposed to be you have exposed a corrupt part of our system thank you very much for doing that we got him now we arrest them like on CSI or in some fucking movie they would arrest him and throw him in jail but in the case of the u.s. most in the case of the US military we're we're completely beyond that we're completely beyond any accountability they're completely beyond any any exposure of any sensitive information that they don't leak themselves is thought to be treasonous it's thought to be a crime against the state and that's a sickness that's a real sickness you are there's a bunch of crazy fucks in power that are treating us the same way King treats his disciples it's really the same thing if you can't release clear video that show something wrong that has not been addressed and that people did not know about and something that was gonna make people reconsider the way they think about the military reconsider the way they think about what what it is to have your own children over there as as soldiers doing these things like what are we really doing if you look at that Collateral Murder video that's a disturbing fucking video and that's a good video for everyone to see because it lets people know the truth unless people know this really happened and your government did not want you to know about it and they tried very hard to keep this information from you here's a bunch of other shit that really happened I mean with each passing thing that they release it becomes more and more obvious how corrupt this entire system is from lobbyists to special interest groups to being beholden to corporations to get into control to controlling natural resources in different countries it's it's a giant money grab I mean that's all it is it's and anybody that steps in and tries to fuck the money grab up is a terrorist exactly and that's what's so terrifying about NDAA and that's what has journalists concerned and whistleblowers concerned and and I and I love Joe that you guys talk about whistleblowers and hold them in the light they should be the light that should be shown on them and that's what they're heroes we need them we need them to point out the broken parts of the Machine so that we can fix those parts one by one and keep the machine going yes the machine needs to be going it's not like the meat we want to overthrow the government it's not we just don't want it to be corrupt thought that's amazing that that is that that is controversial in 2012 with the amount of access to information that we have we we should have evolved much further as a civilization if we had or whistleblowers we would because they'd be able to do what would I've done with CNN and I said that this isn't right look what they're doing with as a viewer you should know when you're watching this at state-sponsored it's just a little thing that will help enlighten some people we need that information it's power and I'm overall overwhelmingly Americans are amazing positive people who who are able to make a difference and would be horrified if they knew of some of the things that are happening in the military and in these corruptions and that's why they're going to such great lengths to keep people from coming forward amber why do you hate America yeah why do you hate America I know what that scares me ever hear that do you ever hear that kind of talk to speak dude you get that I I do and I and I also get the og government oh the sooner we all get arrested on unveil hopefully the cops are UFC fans yeah yeah do you worry I do worry and I've had I've actually had hundreds at this point of emails mostly from Alex's folks worried about my safety and they just want to talk to you about your safety lucky I have body armor specifically for your size in my compound that's plenty of food we could live on the ground for six months that so long it takes for the radiation to die down yeah I have had a lot of bodyguard offers yeah yeah so maybe that's why I'm getting that but I know there is a feeling in the journalists community now that especially with NDAA that we are scared that one day there's gonna be a knock on the door and get arrested yeah and you get taken away and you can get detained and you can get detained indefinitely and that's that's the law now you don't have to you know you don't have the rights that you had just a year ago and for people need to wrap their head around that like you it's not innocent until proven guilty it's there's none of that it doesn't exist anymore like that's gone away and that's not what we think of when we think of this country we think of the Constitution we think of all the rights that were endowed with we we don't understand that that's gone yeah and people don't people like you Center just why are you talking about NDAA well it's so terrifying because this is now and come on let's get to it the black and white of it what's a terrorist anymore Nelson Mandela was called a terrorist Martin Luther King and I mean now you can use terrorists to pretty much to try to take out any of your enemies or anyone who is is maybe an investigative reporter or a radio show host who's against what the government's doing and and that is so scary for so many of us I love him when they became insurgents it's going on now have some become an insurgent you know you know you're not the enemy anymore they're insurgents they're doing battle with insurgents I don't even know what the hell it is but it became sort of a word that was forced into the vernacular it's like that although I never used that word insurgent my whole life I went 39 plus years not using the word insurgent and then also did just be tossed around in the news every day and I'm like well fuck that work come from never even heard of it before it's just a cute way of saying you know some dudes we're gonna shoot you know some people are angry at us the enemy whatever it is woody what else did you see that you thought was being censored or downplayed how mean how much of WikiLeaks was how much of that was was you know censored over there yeah I mean I don't even know how much I can it's just like I could talk about all of this forever but this is really one of the first times I'm I'm talking about the WikiLeaks issue but that was that was another hands off kind of red tape story as well and and that that was that was it was difficult to get coverage of that especially with any type of leaks this is what's happening now someone comes forward with a leak to the mainstream media now because of Obama subpoenas they have to analyze the legal aspect and whether they're willing to pay the money if it's potentially subpoenaed and so that makes stories more expensive when it comes to leaks also a story that I saw that was very difficult to cover was I see you have a mask over there anonymous yeah that became really difficult to cover because pretty much at this point the FBI came out last year in last winter and talked about how they feel cyber terrorism is one of the biggest threats to the country and in in that speech Robert Mueller also mentioned he threw in a line about script kiddies and people working on computers in the earth and their parents basements which pretty much meant he was referring to anonymous so so journalistically that became if you cover anonymous you have a chance of getting subpoenaed because the federal government is against anons and so it became very difficult to cover that story as well and and became more of an analysis on whether we were able to spend the legal money then whether the story is journalistically important I think the anonymous story is is very important because we can't allow the federal government to come out and just call people terrorist or cyber terrorists cyber terrorists or try to instill fear we need to know there's a mask the Guy Fawkes mask we need to know we need journalists we need to be able to talk to these people to see what they're really all about we all know now we can't trust our government to tell us who our enemies should be we need to know as journalists we need to be able to go and talk to people even down to al-qaeda we need to be able to get in and talk to these individuals what could possibly be the justification and on the side of the government could could they be like we have to do this to protect people could they be thinking that we have to clamp down on all these rights in order to ensure the safety of the United States I mean what what the fuck or they or they just look we're corrupt we're just corrupt is how we do it we're just assholes nation you know or or it really lets you know whose agenda they're there on like if you look at the situation with the FBI going after anonymous and spending those kind of resources on on anonymous wait a minute why aren't you going after the bankers here why are you spending these resources doing these elaborate missions to to try to crush hackers who the majority of them are actually on human rights missions and aren't even hackers they're just disseminating information on the Internet and that's when I knew that that was another thing because they'd hit some corporations and so as it's like okay so they're going after anonymous because the corporations are controlling our our law enforcement decisions I mean that was the black and white of the situation why aren't they going after bankers why are they going after anonymous and and that's why it's so important for us as journalists to be able to get in and and talk to these individuals I wonder how they justify it at the highest level I really would would love to see the meetings when when they get together and draft something like the National Defense Authorization Act I would love to see what the the conversation is like when you like what do you wanna put in there we fucking lock them up like for whatever for whatever for anything for you want to just put for being an enemy of the state yeah let me say that's good it's good any other state which is such a vague you know terminology that you can use it for a journalist a guy like Julian Assange because Julian Assange is with WikiLeaks and not with the New York Times if Julian Assange was with the New York Times The New York Times released all those WikiLeaks documents it would have been a very different story but because he's in this WikiLeaks what the fuck is a wiki leaked it's connected to Wikipedia which sort of silly as it is not completely reliable you know so it's sort of this we're easy lead it's dismissed it's not the New York Times New York Times has been around this is a new thing because it's a new thing we can say it doesn't count like you can't have New Journalism doesn't it doesn't exist only the stuff that area is here because we've got that shit under wraps so because it wasn't with the New York Times then all of a sudden this guy can be labeled an enemy of the state I mean could you imagine it would be a very different reaction if the New York Times printed that and the government went after the New York Times and called it New York Times enemy of the state then people would have to go whoa like what's going on here but because it's WikiLeaks they should have but everybody should have every journalism ever ever every person that cares about true principles every journalist should have stand stood up and I mean it should have been the front page of every newspaper it should have been like this can't happen this is why it can't happen this is why we need people to watch after the government we need we need people to make sure that all you can't just trust the government to look out for the good of the people you need people watching them and that's what journalism has always been about it seems like that's what that guys doing it seems it doesn't seem like he's doing anything different but yet he's not hiding in a fucking Embassy in London now and they're circling the house trying to figure out how to get him out I mean it's it's nuts it's really weird because essentially they're saying I mean they're talking about going in they've talked about going in several times but essentially they're saying that the rules bullshit like we move tennis rules but there really are no no rules you what is it you consulate an embassy look it's a fucking house it's right there the guy we wants in there we're gonna go and get him and that's really what's happening right now and he's just there just waiting him out he's in there for months waiting him out and they've succeeded and their main goal in all of this was to distract it's a PR tactic let's distract distract distract and they've succeeded they've distracted from the actual leak and now it's become more about Julian and him hide it having to hide in the embassy and and these you know accusations out of Sweden and it hasn't become about what we really should be looking into and that was the leak and how we can can fix that in the future so so that horrific situations of civilians getting shot by US troops don't don't happen again but but we're not focusing on that now because we're too busy focusing on where's Julian now in it and that's what they want and and they've succeeded and the fact that they're putting so much attention emphasis and focus on this one guy and that they're doing it because he had surprise sex with someone really doesn't mean it's not even they're not even calling it rape I mean it's not he's not a murderer he's not a armed robber he's someone who had consensual sex with someone and then then there's some like weirdness that went on I don't know what it was but it's whatever it was even if he was guilty of it it doesn't seem like it's nearly enough to warrant this kind of attention I mean this is fucking crazy if we had to go over every guy who did something creepy sexually and we had a you know send a fucking army after them I mean this is that that's never happening that's not that's not gonna happen this is it's bullshit and it but it's the most obvious bullshit it's like it's so thinly veiled it's insulting and how ridiculous it is if you look at them like the Julian Assange standing out on his little balcony and you can't leave the embassy yo why is he there for and then you find the actual thing they're going after him you're like what wait a minute what that's crazy like they're this is what they're using there's some weird sex thing that he did in Norway or Sweden or whatever the fuck where was it Sweden and you know they're also trying to send a message with that to journalists like myself and others is look what's gonna happen to you if you if you leak the leaks and and and that's what they're doing to its a systematic way to try to prevent people from leaking information about corruption but those leaks are vital to the survival of whatever ounce of democracy we have left in this country and we need leaks we need whistleblowers their heroic their fantastic if something is happening in in your corporation that you know is is violating the public good you should leak that information too because if no one knows what's happening we can't we can't fix it a true patriot is supposed to be someone who protects against enemies both domestic and foreign that's supposed to be the idea is that it's not that we can't have foreign people that we love and that our allies and it's not that we can't have domestic people who are truly our enemies I mean and anybody who's trying to turn this country into what it's becoming when you see these fucking soldiers walking down streets when you you read the language in the NDAA and you go home I can sign this like how did this get through that's the enemy there's there's a net and wonder if it whether or not that enemy I don't know I don't know if it's on the political side I don't know if it's corruption I don't know if it's incompetence I mean they say that no one ever reads any of those fucking bills anyway that they're too long they say that if the Congress really read everything that they sign it would be and physically impossible like they would at like if you talk to them about what's in things like but there's a lot of them that that don't they can't read it they can't you know that's where journalists failed in journalism failed because we should have had a tremendous amount of reports on NDAA and really a lot of more people raising hell about it but it's been censured by the mainstream media and and so Congress reacts to pressure if the public doesn't pressure Congress not to sign the NDAA then then they're gonna sign it and and and that's what happened god it's so weird it's a it's just you you you look towards the future and I have young children I have a two year old and a four year old and I look at what their life is going to be ten years from now 20 years from now and if if things keep clamping down the way they are it's it's a fucking horror if ik mess and it seems to be if you look at the amount of money we're spending overseas and if you look at the incredible military budget I mean it's just astounding how much money it's not a lack of resources that we have it's just how those resources are being allocated those resources are being allocated in these really weird ways is it because we just need in order to keep our lifestyle we need to control these natural resources whether it's in Iran or whether it's in weather whatever it is that we need to do in other cut is that really what's going on is it to protect our lifestyle here I don't know I don't know what it is but I definitely know this is not the right way to do it it's there's got to be a better way for the whole system to be run unquestionably and it seems like it's almost like there's like like they're conceding that it's out of control so in conceding that it's out of control they're like look we've got a fucking take away the rights we got to make sure that we can take their computers we want to be able to just fucking to take all their money on the bank we can do that whenever we want we could just say you don't have any money money anymore now it's all ours we've got to be able to figure out how to stop some Arab Spring type shit from happening here and this is how to stop it stop it what we make essentially doing whatever we want legal so all shit that should be completely illegal because they wrote some things down and some assholes signed it that didn't read it then what's horrific now becomes law yeah and it's and I think it they want people want you to think it's out of control but this is very systemic that language in the NDAA is very systemic the crackdown on dissent in this country is very systemic and the crackdown on journalism who could expose the dissent is systemic and the fact that this stuff is not airing on all these mainstream outlets that are connected to all these corporations and governments is systemic so they make make it appear to be more chaotic than it is but but it really is a systemic crackdown on unda sent and and people who are criticizing the government the average person who works eight hours a day who has a mortgage bills car lease things to think about really ship troubles do they even know what the fuck is going on does what percentage of the population is waking up I say it's it's small but it is there's an army of people waking up and I know that from after going on Alex Jones Show and in the response I got after that I was really relieved I said okay I'm not shouting alone there are people out here that see what's happening but at the same time you know I'll then go and talk with my family living in the Midwest and they're not aware of what's happening there they're busy watching Real Housewives of Orange County or you know or they'll say something like well they're over there fighting for our freedom yeah or just yeah the propaganda they'll just recite the product data that they've been fed that's one that hurts they're over there fighting for our freedom that one fucking hurts that hurts my brain it's it is hurt it hurts when you see the caskets that they're not allowed to photograph it hurts when you hear people that have lost friends loved ones you run into people that have no legs that come back from Iraq and you're like for what for what what are they doing this for really this is the only way to do it this is the best way to do it where's that money going billions and billions and billions of dollars a month I mean it's somewhere around six to seven billion dollars per month it's costing us it's insane it's insane when you think about if if that money could be turned on just just helping the United States just helping the poor communities the United States trying to figure out alternative fuel sources trying to I mean just putting - it's like there's a stranglehold on the way things are run now and the the money that's being extracted with the way things run now has such incredible power over our lives it's really amazing how small groups relatively small groups of people if you stop and think about the actual amount of people that are involved in oil corporations the amount of people that are involved in government you compare it to the whole world it's a very it's relatively small but that relatively small group of people has this insane effect on our day to day lives and the future of humanity the future of literally the human race because if we are the biggest superpower in the world if and that's what we are mean there's never been any like the United States Rome was never even fucking close to as crazy as we are we have military bases in over a hundred countries and there's a lot of people that don't know that and this is all falling apart right before our eyes and it's all crumbling right before and it's all going down like a crazy fucking movie like some crazy apocalyptic movie it's going on right before our eyes and most people are just stuck in traffic they just listen to some fucking Kanye West song can't wait to get home to watch the latest Kim Kardashian show and it's it's we are we are fucking strange and it's been set up that way I mean the more ignorant people are the more you can get away with and look at our programming our television programming it's I was talking with some producers other day who've been trying for years to feed these networks intelligent programming and hardcore news shows and shows to educate the public and instead they said a show about some people catching alligators and swamps was approved so this has been a systemic it is a great show honey boo boo honey boo boo yeah yeah that's Bigfoot hunter okay I want a Squatch Finding Bigfoot rather dude I'm not going off on these shows so we meet we need some educational program we do we do we we need a better system we need to mean a better system not just of government but of life you know there's there's too many people in this world that are living these really horrible unfulfilled lives and I don't think that's necessary I think there's too many people out there that are in what feels to them an unproductive unsatisfying cog in a wheel and all of that leads to this feeling of detachment from the events of our world and we sort of allow the people that are in the positions of power to manipulate these great masses of people I mean I've always said that the idea of a country is really kind of ridiculous at a certain point if it's not ridiculous today it's ridiculous 100 years from now the interconnectedness of human beings through technology is eventually going to make the ideas of physical boundaries and barriers or you can't go over there because this dirt is control by these people but you can go it's it's crazy it doesn't make any sense it's eventually we're gonna have to accept the idea of a world community and when you think of the the future and you think of what a world communicate community would be like one thing's for sure is you're not gonna be able to control all those people you're not gonna they're gonna have to the it's people are going to have to be served by by by the notions and then the the beliefs that they have by by the ideas of community by the ideas of sharing the ideas of making and enhancing each other's lives the idea of having a real community of human beings on this one planet instead of these ridiculous little teams that were on whether it's fuckin I hate Texas cuz I'm from Oklahoma or you know the United States and England will fuck themselves you know it's it's at a certain point in time we're gonna we're gonna connect to each other to the point where we realize we are really just one giant community and if we're one giant community we can't get led by these one people that have more ones and zeros that want to send giant metal killing machines to places we've never been because there's minerals there or because there's heroin there or because there's oil there because there's whatever the fuck it is that's not gonna work anymore it's gonna get to a point in time where that's not gonna work and I think that's what this big clamoring for taking away rights is all about I think the writing on the wall is that the yet the internet the Internet is changing the game it's changing humanity it's changing weight I don't think we even realized when when history looks back and they look at 1993-94 whenever AOL started when they look at that - now that is a crazy change in the way people look at the world in just just just by access just access to each other just the ability to communicate with each other and find out those other people to think like you find out there's other people that are scared and confused and find out there's other countries that are taking over their country they're taking it back and they're fighting against corruption and then you know the United States sees and goes fuck this start cotton cords you need to we need to be able to cut the internet we need to be able to shut off people's cell phone which is the latest Apple thanks a lot Apple you fucking twats this ridiculous new thing that they've done where they've made a third party option so that someone can turn off video cameras so all you can't take your battery out of your your iPhone you shut why can't you take your battery out i've always wondered that well because it's supposed to be a larger battery if you if you have a smaller battery if it's a removal if it's removed you have to have a housing and a place where it attaches and that that space is all used up really you know i i've just heard a lot of people within the security community and train of thought that that right now are speculating why can't you take your battery out well if you can't take your battery out then your gps can never shut off and you can never i've had meetings with sources where i've had to throw them literally throw my iphone out the window because they said they wouldn't talk to me if i had an iPhone with me because there's no physical way to shut that phone off so if anyone was monitoring me there there would be no way if i had that phone in my presence to keep it off it's really creepy that apple decided to include that the ability of a third party to shut off your video camera remotely and they say well they well hey it's for concerts it's for guys like you joe rogan to do your comedy we don't want anybody recording that's not what stopped it undone yeah can't shut that we could jump Brian loves it he loves it though he doesn't care he's like dude track me he makes love to that phone the phone is sexual to him i I've had to put post-its over my my camera's on my phone and on my my laptop oh absolutely when I see this cert the software that they have one of my friends who is a very savvy with knowing software and hacking and stuff has shown me programs where they can install it on your laptop and someone can get in and they can control your camera so they can monitor you all the time oh they can they can literally if you have a Wi-Fi connection they can go and suck your information out of your laptop through the Wi-Fi and send it to another computer I mean all this stuff has been going on for years you know but it didn't never really hit me in my head and I said gosh how many times have you had your laptop open when maybe you haven't been dressed or other things you know so so now I add a sticky sticky note over my laptop camera there yeah there's gonna be completely grossed out by made-up yeah just maybe enough yeah non-stop I had a friend who was hired by corporations to hack into computers and he he said one guy he hacked into his computer and he has he was recording the video of his computer camera he has all these videos of the guy picking his nose and doing other things that men tend to do in front of their their computers I'm not going to say what it is but you can videos of this guy beating off yeah and he actually brought this stuff to him as part of his you know look what we have on you now reveal the other information so just so you know I would what was it what was the guy doing like what was the would they so interested in him for well well it was it had to do with a legal dispute with a law firm but something to know is that you know is that anyone can access your computer at any time so to be sure we should start shaving a little bit better how long is this technology been available oh gosh four years we're just anytime I figure anytime you find out about security technology or hacking technology that's been out for years sometimes decades think your mom finding out about the iPad or something that's so crazy and scary how many people do you think that they've done that in lawsuits and stuff like that way and people just shut up about it because their photos of them mm-hmm in front of the computer well I think that's what's so scary for people about this new NSA facility that they're building yeah the next thing I want to talk to you about Bluffdale Utah wants to take a vacation for your civil rights that's where you should go okay you know tell everybody what that is they're building a two billion dollar domestic spying facility to to literally gather your information and your communications and most people say I always hear this over and over well I'm not doing nothing wrong you know it doesn't matter if they're monitoring me it does matter because they're gonna have a file on you for your entire life of communications so say one day you do something that upsets someone or say potentially a potential employers hack into this database okay so we want to find out what Joe's been - over the years all we see based on his phone GPS records that he tends to visit the casino too much so we don't want to hire him or we also see he's not religious or we see that you know he's been visiting an oncologist and he potentially has cancer so we don't want to we don't want to hire him for those health insurance reasons it is dangerous to allow the government to collect this kind of information on its citizens any of that information can be used down the road to blackmail you or keep you from whistleblowing or as a journalist keep me from leaking a story or keep me from even having the story in general because they know know what track him on do you think there's a way that they can ever stop everything from being public information because it seems to me that that's the trend it seems that privacy is slowly eroding and it doesn't seem to just be like one group of people that has access it seems to be that there's going to be a point in time where everybody's going to have access that technology is going to really it's gonna bypass boundaries there's going to be no boundaries anymore we're almost getting to that point I know as an investigative reporter now we kind of a lot of us do things the old-fashioned way we write things in notebooks now or just remember things because we can't I can't trust oh I just dropped it well now it's broken you're sending your tracking device I can't I can't trust my tracking device and I can't I can't trust that this hasn't been hacked into or do you have an Android phone because you can take the battery out yeah I got rid of my iphone specifically because of that because I went through six iPhone yeah that's one think about it I went through six of them because of those reasons I'd mean resources they said what you have to get rid of that phone or you know I had weird things so I yeah I don't I use the Android system now you are living a very non stereotypical twenty nine year old life this is really great you're you're liking a crazy movie I mean you're you're going to foreign countries and exposing things and removing cell phone batteries you're worried about being spied on covering your your lens of your laptop like what a weird world we live in what a weird world you live in I know it is strange but that's I mean that's unfortunately that's the way it's become the reality it's become press journalists I even know journalists now who are contemplating leaving the United States Wow and don't where where would you go I um I don't want to say really yeah I want to keep it on the DL yeah I'll tell you where I'm going where Vancouver Vancouver where is Columbia Montreal Vancouver I've heard a lot of miles called yeah I know who doesn't get that called a source of mine in a documentary I'm doing went to Canada you know a lot of people are people and that are planning where they're gonna go if things get really bad would say Canada Toronto is amazing yeah it's amazing I love Canada I don't know what her secret spot is though she's not a stalker boy when the apocalypse hits you can't live with her okay I don't need any bodyguards I don't need no I I don't you know because I haven't I've been thinking about it and I don't quite know I don't know I think for me it's almost too much to handle the thought of having to leave but for especially investigative journalists after the NDAA passed that's a reality for all of us because we're gonna piss people off in the government so how are they gonna come after us you know and and why did you pick Canada why why was that your your choice Vancouver I love it up there I go there all the time I do a lot of gigs in Canada I probably more popular in Canada than I am in America like podcast the podcast is were regularly in the top three in the iTunes in the comedy section in America but in Canada we regularly number one out of all the podcasts it's weird we have a crazy following in camera we were just in Toronto did Massey Hall in Toronto it was amazing it's crazy the fucking people are so nice there's 20% less douchebags up there streets are way cleaner everything's cleaner you see people like sweeping up and cleaning things they're just it's a better country it's it's they're not greedy assholes it's a completely different vibe the way you interact with people they don't have the same expectations as Americans do they don't have the same the same point of view the same arrogance it's just a completely different vibe it's like someone took America and said we kind of removed some of the kunti nests out of Americans and try let's try another civilization let's try this this civilization that's not trying to overthrow the world they look the same they talk the same I think I'm a xscape to North Korea I think that's that go to me yeah that's good why North Korea no he's being silly no yeah that's there's another place if we really cared about human rights why aren't we in Mexico and North Korea those are two places we really would be cracking down and that's why everyone needs to wake up because we're being led into a war with Iran I the writing's on the wall and it's a rock number two and instead of this time it's with Iran and Iran has some pretty tough allies in China and Russia and the American public is being fed BS and and we're being led into Iran by the same forces that led us into Iraq and we need to wake up because it's it's it's going to happen soon and and because we I mean all you have to do this is everyone's test just turn on turn on the news the mainstream outlets CNN ABC CBS FOX and you're going to see a constant demonization of Iran not that they don't deserve it but based on everything happening here it's it's absurd what do they deserve it for if I Iran is doing anything bad what is it I think that you know you have Ahmed in Iran who doesn't have traditional Western beliefs when it comes to homosexuality and also you know if there is a beef they have with Israel that being said what he's been doing is rhetoric he's been talking okay we don't just go and attack every single leader because of their they're insane rhetoric or we would be in every country including Mexico and we're not and so so now you have to sit back and now that you can pull yourself away in first step to recognizing what's happening is is to know that you're being fed propaganda and once you know that then you can stand back and you can analyze it intelligently and realize I mean look at the movies we have coming out Argo you think that is just coming out randomly what is that I saw it's a Ben Affleck movie I saw it I had no idea what it is it's owned a hostage situation that's going on in Iran I mean look at the timing of that call me a conspiracy theorist I think this is systemic I think the public is systematically being fed fear of Iran but how is that as I've been afflict a CIA agent I mean what how does that work it is that is moving it's it's that Americans were taken hostage and Iran and so it so and in the end maybe it's a heroic movie but in the end you also feel you have a fear of Iran it's going to put a fear of Iran and everyone that goes and sees that and do you think that's a government plot or do you think that's just you know a movie that they thought would be timely I mean maybe they maybe they thought that but regardless it's going to have an effect of people that leave that theater are going to have more of a fear of Iran instilled in them at a time where the news is constantly demonizing Iran at a time where we're about to potentially approve the military action on the country and Iran contrary to popular belief the the youth of Iran are very westernized in a lot of ways and they are not happy with the way that their country is betrayed they're not happy with with the the whole situation the situation of you know the way Iran treats its its foreign policy the the young people there they're very Americanized there's a lot of that going on there you know you see them in the Universities and you see the different protests that they have over there it's really strange to think that you buy a shitty roll of the dice could have been born there I could have been born there and we could be a part of this youth movement that's trying to figure out why the fuck this country is so crazy why why are we trapped in this crazy Empire with this wacky a mini jot guy out there speaking for us overseas making a mockery I mean he seems like a caricature bad guy he seems like we gave him the script you know like listen dude first thing we want to do is say there's no gays in Iran he's like this yeah I know it's preposterous but we want you to say it there's no gays in Iran I mean he's like a cartoonish bad guy like the stuff he talks about is it's so stupid it's like how did you get to be the guy who talks when that's the shit that you're saying and and that's also the way the media I mean if you also look at the media's coverage not that I'm defending him but the media tends to pick up on only cover those kinds of situations they don't cover the times when when he's speaking intelligently right and that's what's that's what's dangerous too is because we're not keep being give the whole the whole story I'm trying to get an interview with him now well I want to sit with him and and I have a not well now that I mentioned it'll probably be stopped but I want to sit down with him and I want to get to the bottom of a lot of these situations with with the whole wiping Israel off the map and in other situations because I can't trust that we've been fed the correct story on that through through the mainstream media I mean it the situation now is that even the other day Hockman Dennis Dodd was speaking in front of the UN and there's a video on the internet now of CNN cut him off and then the reporters started talking over him at a point when he was talking about the fact that these countries all the countries could get together and get along peacefully he was talking about the potential for peace and said they went in and cut him off and then oh yeah I listened to him and now he's trying to do this and and really demonizing him and in journalistically you can't just do that and they didn't give him his fair share so maybe he's not quite as insane as we've been led to believe there are many forces very powerful forces they want you to hate him and think he's freaking nuts so that it justifies us going in and and attacking him and when you start to realize that and look back at the info you you realize you may be not being fed that the whole whole picture here knowing what you know and being in the position that you are you you know being a person who was behind the scenes at a major news outlet like CNN and you get to see sort of the the strings that that hold the puppets up is there a way to fix this is there a way to turn this ship around and sort of write America or is this a constant protest until we fall off the face of the earth and have a nuclear war is it do we just scream and throw our hands up and pout and yell and scream until they launch the missiles and that wipes us all out or is it possible that with education with the distribution of information that's available today with you know people like us talking about it with people that are young like David Seaman growing up and and becoming political leaders these these is is it possible that we can write this thing that what we have is a group of people that are in control this country that really came from another era they came from an era of no disclosure they came from an era where you know Watergate happened every now and then but really it was because they wanted to catch them you know there's plenty of information that they have on everybody let's just keep this thing going along the way it's always gone along I mean is it is it is it possible that we can end this era and move into an era of transparency move into an era where people who are the leaders of this country are doing it for the right reasons they're doing it because they truly are patriotic because they truly believe in that the real ideals that we liked when we think of ourselves in the best light those ideals the ideals of being an American they can actually bring us more in line bring our actions more in line with that is that possible it's only possible if people have access to information yeah and there and in a way that can compete with the mainstream and and that doesn't quite exist yet there are a lot of strong forces outside your show Alex Jones and and other entities that are that are actually bringing out talking about these things that the mainstream isn't talking about NDAA all these other issues affecting our civil liberties if those forces can't compete and get the message out just as loudly as the mainstream then then I don't I don't know what direction this country is headed in but we knew we need that information that information is power and it's it's definitely not getting to the masses quite yet but if we get to a point where we can compete with with the mainstream and and really get get this information out then people will be enlightened and they'll and they'll know when things are happening and and can make a difference and actually look for solutions the real question is how long can they hold that off for is it possible that they can fight that off with shit like NDAA with all these passing these sweeping bills about controlling the internet the SOPA type bills that they keep force feeding and pushing through you know how long can they really stop that from happening because it seems like this is a new era to me it seems like when I talk to people today like what I can mention this when I I spoke with David Seaman when we had him on the show it's like I didn't know anything when I was your age I was like he's 26 years old I was like dude when I was 26 I was retarded I didn't know anything about the way of the world goes and here you are educating me on things you're you're completely immersed in the way this country is being run the corruption of lobbyists and corporations corporate influence on the way we do everything from grow our food to extract oil is this a new era I mean are we dealing with this new wave of people who are informed who are growing into adulthood that push these old douchebags out of office I mean is that what's gonna happen or are we gonna blow ourselves up before we get there are these old fuck heads with hanging on by kitty cat claws on a curtain just barely hanging on they hit the red button and the whole thing gets wiped back to ten thousand years ago again I am an optimist so I hope that's not our future in our future plans but I I think they that the way things are going now we're not in control of our country the people of America are not in who is specifically well well that's a good question because obviously it's not the presidency because otherwise NDAA wouldn't have been passed and we wouldn't have this ridiculous war on whistleblowers and journalists who went to improve the country so you think the presidency has that's definitely not within what what they're looking for no and and I think that I because it can't be any more I mean if Obama passed signed NDAA with with those kind of provisions to be able to detain American citizens without trial that violates the Fifth Amendment it's no longer in on behalf of the people I don't think they're making decisions on behalf of the people you have some people that speculate who's really in control some people say the federal reserve that worries them significantly that's where we borrow most of our money no one really knows who's in charge of the federal reserve some people say they're the ones pulling the strings you hear all these conspiracy theories but but one thing's for sure is is the people of the United States I feel personally based on my last 10 years of really getting behind the scenes and investigating all of these you know major disasters we've had in the country the people are no longer in control decisions are not being made on behalf of the people if decisions were being made on behalf of the people the United States we would not be about to be entering Iran we would be taking that money and giving it toward education and health care and improving the economy if decisions were being made on behalf of the people we'd be going after the bankers that got us in this mess and what's staggering to me is that if you look at what we're doing overseas where we're spending all this money this a lot of the the contracts that have gone to Halliburton for reconstruction a lot of the the different desalination plants they have over there we could have easily had businesses profiting off of government contracts to fix our infrastructure to fix our bad communities to fix our impoverished places to try to heal up America I've always said that the best way that if you want to make America better the best way to do it is to make less losers right so the way to make less how you got to go after you you have to try to help children you have to try to brace poor neighborhoods and try to prop them up and try to figure out a way to you know to bring some sort of economic prosperity to that area in education help people work give them role models there's there's money to be made and there's satisfaction to be gained from the people that could help those people that's like a beautiful human experience of helping people on propping them up and it can be profitable because these is gonna have to there's gonna have to spend money doing that so this corporations are gonna make money tax dollars will go there it seems like it's just sort of a redistribution for you know of the way we're spending our money from spending it on war to spending it on love and it seems like there's money and love too but we've been tricked into thinking there's only money in war and to think that all of our resources and everything that we have and everything that we project can only be profitable if we're killing people that seems crazy it seems like that's just no that's just the way we've always been doing it and in viewing the world as one giant community which i think is inevitable I'm pretty sure if you just look at the way things are going the exponential it's it's inevitable it's inevitable that we will be just one big world community but that's what we've got to do it's real simple if you want to live and enjoy life which I assume everyone does we want to enjoy this life the only way we can enjoy this life is if there's the smallest amount of people possible that are not enjoying it small smile the smallest amount of people in despair that well that it's manageable the smallest amount you're always gonna have a certain amount of losers always gonna have a certain amount as long as there's variables as long as there's you could do you could go left whenever you want to go right which is gonna be mistakes there's gonna be a chaos which we're human human are humans are nuts but if we could drop that to a tiny miniscule number and the amount of oppressed people make it as small as possible the amount of people with no opportunity make it as small as possible then we can have a beautiful world for everybody but it's we're not gonna get that by supporting Bahrain we're not gonna get that by by guarding poppy fields in Afghanistan we're not gonna get that by multibillion-dollar no-bid contracts for Halliburton that is not how we're gonna get there what we are that's the last gasps of a dying Empire of douchebags you know and that's what I really when I look at this country and when I look at like all these people that are speaking out when I look at people like you I see real patriotism when I see people like Alex you talk all Alex Jones crazy all day I love that guy and he's a fucking patriot and he's a real Patriot and what he wants isn't not to expose corruption and conspiracy everywhere he goes what he wants is for all the stop he wants people to run this country with a real sense of morals we should be run by true more or less we'd be we should be run by people who feel responsible for their actions who feel that the the repercussions of the decisions that they make should be as positive as possible and we should be a nation of Heroes we should lead the world as a nation of Heroes instead of marauders you know American people deserve butter you know I - world deserves better the world deserves better yes the world deserves to know that that people are going to be in the best interest we we need to know that we can be run by the best possible examples of humanity and that we we can encounter the best possible examples of humanity in every single country if people just rise if people just get their fucking shit together you unanimously all across the board if we can figure out a way to truly enlighten and the way to do this is with mushrooms so what we're doing right now ladies and gentlemen we're fucking around and we're trying to do it on our own and it's too goddamn hard you only get so far with a yoga class every six months you squeeze in after Starbucks a fucking heart attack when you're bending over in warrior pose I think we need mushrooms and we need them now we need them from outer space we need them to just drop down just well we need something we need an Enlightenment we need we need the next stage of enlightenment we surely do and it seems inevitable and it seems like there's a battle going on and there's a lot of people that believe that you can't have the the true push and momentum of enlightenment unless there's resistance against it it's that our whole or our entire nature is that we we really don't achieve what we can achieve unless there's resistance and so we still have somehow in our alpha male primate DNA this desire to conquer and this desire to to fight against oppression this desire to rise against the enemy and compete against your your fellow man and it's almost like a lot of people believe that the only way for people to truly achieve enlightenment is to see a holocaust is to see an inquisition is to see like the horrific possibilities of humanity so it gives us something to not be you know it gives us something to rise against you know I think that's the past though I think I think really the future I think we're living in a weird world or we're living in a world that has changed a lot more than we're aware it's slowly starting to creep up on us and and it may I mean who knows if we've already missed this the warning signs but that's why people need to take it so seriously when we have NDAA is passed and when we see police dressed like Judge Dredd you know I mean this wake up look what's happening on our streets of this country I mean we think of ten years ago if you saw those police officers dressed like Judge Dredd standing in front of a protest in front of Walmart intimidating a bunch of older individuals who are unarmed yeah and you know Gary and it all could have been avoided it all could have been avoided if the police were different it all could have been avoided if that kid was not shot in front of everybody in broad daylight it all could have been avoided if the police reacted to it differently everything could have been avoided instead it's fuck you you do as we say or we're gonna bring in tanks and dogs and rubber bullets and that's not America well it's not it's you're being lazy you're doing it the wrong way you're trying to just control things and you're you're you're you're not doing it the way that an enlightened society and culture would handle it you're not and and that means that's the enemy that that type of behavior they marching down the streets and shooting bullets down the alley that's that's the enemy that's the enemy at home and the people that are doing it they think that they're doing well they think they're doing good they think they're doing their job and that's what's really fucked up about it it's like by by the fact that someone gives them the green light they feel like they're in the right you know like welp this fucking protesters just stop breaking the law and I'll stop shooting rubber bullets at their face like it's you know just because somebody wrote something down on a piece of paper doesn't mean that shit's right you know I mean there's a lot of shit that's written down on paper that doesn't make any sense and one of the things is that you're somehow allowed it bring tanks into a city and um guys with machine guns because the kid got shot in the back that's not the way you're supposed to handle that situation that's not the way an enlightened being in handles their society in their culture and that is where we are right now we are we are at a pass and human nature we are at a bridge we're at a divided where we have to change from the way we've lived for the past few thousand years we just lived like dominating creeps we have to change into a compassionate society of people who view each other as a community you know people who view everyone all around the world as a community and that's that's the only hope it's the only hope for Humanity and it seems to me that's like almost a race there's a race between the the assholes of the world that are trying to start conflict everywhere they can and try to extract resources and just fuck people over there's a race between them and enlightenment you know and one on one of the one of them is gonna win you know one of them is gonna win and either they get to the button first and they fuck flip the whole board over and we have to start the game over again or we calm everything the fuck down and we get out of this and we realize that you can't do all this corrupt bullshit anymore everybody knows what you're doing now and now we have to have a government that actually looks out for people and we have to make decisions based on what's an intelligent way to look at our possibilities for the future and that's what leaders are supposed to do and that's what real patriotism is supposed to be about it's not supposed to be about locking people up because they expose when you fuck up I mean it's it we're just at a time right now where I agree with you that was a beautiful way to describe it Joe where we were competing enlightenment is competing with corruption and you're seeing corruption slowly try to crush enlightenment by with NDAA with prosecuting whistleblowers and and who's gonna win and I I'm always on the side of the people I think that I think a growing number of people are realizing what's happening but it can only happen if you let it happen to yourself the NDA is the closest the best example of that that there is a battle going on because in in just in the language that they use saying that they can hold you indefinitely without recourse that alone is like saying no I have God mode that's like saying let's bring someone in to God note that's your fuck the NDAA yeah I had to create the meme I weave as journalists we've had to also become activists when we've seen the truth because we we are enlightened in a way that most the public isn't and and and now it's such a critical time I just felt like I had to get that out there to let people know as journalists we say fuck this section of the NDAA this is ridiculous it is a power to kill journalism because it will terrify our sources from coming forward not only that we could be accused of helping terrorists whoever our government decides are terrorists and get locked up forever and Obama says he won't use it on US citizens he promises that but what about the next president yeah and the president after that you know that old expression the person you say yes to today won't be the same person you say yes to 20 years from now and that's the problem with law is that you know just because someone put something into one sits down once it's written in the book it can be interpreted in a number of different ways and use the number of different ways as you're seeing in Bahrain where they're killing people with sanctioned methods of crowd control they're using it to execute people you know slowly with sanctioned methods of crowd control they're just using the law and they're using it to their advantage of teargas I mean they're if anyone research is that they're systematically gassing these people and if they continue this way doctors are terrified for the long-term health damage is going to have they're just gassing hundreds of thousands of people over and over every single day ten minutes from the US military base why aren't our troops complaining about this we need all they see this every day yeah why aren't they well I don't think they have what what can the troops do yeah well they can't they can't be oh if they all came up and rebelled against what was happening on down the street from them and spoke out against it it couldn't exist well one of the things that they do to keep the troops down is keeping poor you know what the the money that they make while in the military is shockingly low and the the scary thing is that when Dick Cheney was in office they passed laws that allow them to send people back you know even if your time is over they can bring you back because they need bodies and it's scary it's scary for those people I have a friend that was he was twenty days he had 20 days left on a 20-year stint in the Army Reserves and they sent him to Iraq for a year and a half and they sent him back again they sent him there for a year and a half and they sent him back again later and you know this guy was fucked there was nothing you can do about it he had twenty days left Wow yeah when they go tough shit see we can do it you can fight us you're gonna fight her so you gonna do what we tell you to do and they have to they they have those guys programmed to do what they tell them to do and they're scared and they don't have money to fight in court and they don't want to get court-martialed and they know that the the law is not on their side the the written law is not on their side even though it's not morally it mean it doesn't make sense it doesn't make sense legally none of it makes sense that you can actually have these essentially you turn people into slaves you turn that they have to do your bidding and they do your bidding for a minimal amount of money and it's it's fucking shocking it's shocking it's it's it's it's it's Orwellian it's disappointing it's when you realize that this is how the country really is run and our idealistic view of it as america fuck yeah it's just it's not it's not what it could be it's like we're embarrassing if you look at the amount of goodwill that we had after 9/11 you know and everybody was like 5 our hearts go out to America this is a horrible tragedy and then look at the way they look at us now like god damn whatever we did whatever we did to deserve that is it's just a mess so we're not as good as we could be just not period but clearly we were running incompetently and I thought Obama was gonna be able to do something about that yeah so did I I think a lot of people felt that the country would change and journalistically it's changed horrifically so so that only tells you I mean like I said earlier that that the presidency is no longer in control by the individual you know I feel like there are greater forces at play here and and our country's being led in a direction that's not in the direction the people want it to go so so what's gonna happen here you know the crazy thing is if they do do something when Iran they can't expect there'll be no repercussions I mean what are they what do they think is going to be the blowback what do they think is going to be the you the aftershock the aftermath would how much damage is something like that going to cause internationally Russia and China get involved it could be Quincy we were losing World War three and they have nukes you know and and and I don't want to be sitting here fear-mongering but but I see the writing's on the wall you just have to look at all the the the propaganda being fed and the the fact that Bahrain was so systematically censored that story and all of the mainstream media not just CNN and so you look at that put everything put the pieces of the puzzle together and to me it spells out war and and the American people need to wake up and realize that we are we are close to action being taken now is it going to be taken with the approval of of the people are we going to be given a choice and it's pretty scary that I'm even asked having to ask this question now do you remember when Obama was running for office and they were saying we're gonna he's gonna pull out of Iraq it's gonna close down Guantanamo Bay he had all these things that he was saying there's none of that he won't sign NDAA he'll take that out yeah but there's none of that talk now and in this series of debates it's all about the economy and it's all about business and it's all about taxes meanwhile we're about to go into World War 3 and we're like lalala not listening we're like completely blocking out like four years ago it was it was huge that there was the the entire discussion was what are we doing with these wars that we can't win you know when are we gonna pull out what how are we gonna handle this you know McCain had one plan Obama had another Obama was gonna get us out of there and it seemed like we had realized as a country that we were going to have to correct the mistakes of the previous administration but now that doesn't seem to be any of that talk they've just swept that under the rug it's almost like they're denying that hey there's still a huge conflict going on in Afghanistan we're still to this day people are suicide-bombing left and right there's all sorts of troops that we train are attacking Americans and using the guns that we give them on American soldiers means fucking chaos over there and there's not a peep about it no peep not a peep not a peep about the heroin not a peep about the fact that Afghanistan controls more than 90% of the world's heroin and that heroin use has gone up skyrocketed in the United States since our since our occupation in Afghanistan and some of that is going towards to make oxycontin yeah and painkillers that are causing a ridiculous number of addicts in villages and you've seen that documentary the oxycontin Express yeah fabulous I'm a huge fan of her Mariana van Zeller and Darren foster did that one for current they are extremely talented film producers and journalists it was scary shit when you watch that guy whose wife died of an overdose and he smoked oxycontin before he called the cops while his wife was dead next to him it's great my cousins in jail right now for that he grew up in like a upper middle class family in the suburbs and he got hooked on oxycontin after trying it at a party then switched to heroin and now now he's in the in the slammer unfortunately yeah I have a family member who lost his shit over it got injured got you know had a back injury took it and just lost it gone not the same guy anymore now he's gone just nuts and it's it's a scary scary scary drug and so easy to get just unbelievably easy to get and what people don't realize is that there's more addicts more pill addicts today than there have ever been at any time in human history I mean there's more people that are hooked on these fucking crazy pain pills I mean it's an epidemic a real epidemic meanwhile the DEA is fuckin going after Medical Marijuana fucking breaking down doors and sticking machine guns and tie-dyed kid t-shirt faces it's fucking unbelievable I love going to Venice Beach when you can just walk there and you just see people just smoking a joint on this side and not just because I'm I'm not saying whether whether I'm a marijuana fan or not but I'm saying that fan I you know I don't I don't see the problem with it I'm gonna go rob yeah cuz I've covered the oxycontin I I did a lot of reporting from Florida I saw my family member affected by it and I said this is legal and America are and marijuana is illegal if you look at the side effects well drew dr. drew on fuckin CNN tried to say that there was a massive withdrawal effects to the coincide with quitting marijuana which is complete physiological nonsense it's just not true there's no but it's not like heroin it's all you can die you know you don't has the worst withdrawal alcohol people die because they don't drink you get so addicted to alcohol that if you go cold turkey your body can go into shock and you can die it's not marijuana stupid and he's on CNN talking about that you know talking about marijuana being something dangerous only to pussies marijuana fucks up your life I've always said this it's just because marijuana got there first it could have been cheeseburgers scratch tickets it could have been anything you're you're an idiot you you let something that makes people happy it makes me more sensitive makes people it makes food taste better you've made that ruin your life that's you could ruin your life with anything if you so choose people are weird people get addicted to washing their hands people get addicted to sitting in front of shows and not leaving when the commercials on people are nuts like you can't say because a certain amount of people can't handle marijuana marijuana would do a lot of people that are in control of this world some good just to be paranoid and just think about their repercussions and think about the they actions that they've done what what that's caused to the the people that they have control over me maybe you should give a Netanyahu some a joint PACU maybe he would cry if you gave that guy a pot brownie Yahoo NetZero Yahoo yeah he's uh he would change his cartoon bomb for sure he would make it like the desk once someone had to be stoned when they when they drew that bomb because it's so ridiculous I I just can't imagine someone wasn't under the influence of some type of drug well it makes me think that this world's not real you know I go over this so many times that my fans are getting angry at me sometimes and Twitter me and tell me stop talking about simulation theory because it really starts that when you saw Mitt Romney the other day and he was wearing blackface when he's talking to the Mexicans I was like holy shit this can't be real that guy fucking Snooki tan on his face and he's he didn't even get it on his neck he didn't get it on the back of his neck so as his face is all like super brown and orange ewwww his neck is white his neck looks like a fucking t-shirt dude I've lived in Mexico and Guatemala and he is not Hispanic I don't care what he says if he wants to try to fit in well you know it's a shame yeah yeah he's from Mexico I've heard some I've heard different theories on that that that that that they were kind of forced down there it's family yeah they're polygamists yeah they wanted to fuck a lot of women they wanted to have a bunch of wives and so they wouldn't let him do it in America so they decided to move to Mexico but that was back when people were riding horses alright nobody thought there's gonna be a difference what's the difference Mexico America fuck it let's move there yeah we can have ten wives there and so they decided to move there and Mexico just didn't change and grow at the same rate as America so now they're stuck in like Wars and shootouts with the drug cartels and the guys from Vice broke this story about the Mormon compound the Romney compound that they have down in Mexico there's a the Romney family is from fucking Mexico Romney's dad wanted to run for president but he couldn't because he was born in Mexico in a cult and that's where Romney came from he came from there he lived there I mean it's fucking bananas they they're are a crazy Looney Tunes religious cult that wanted a bunch of wives and so they decided to go to another country and and I I hate when candidates try to act like they're so Chum Chum with with the black community or the Latino community or you know they always put a show on it's just so disingenuous and and the way I seem do that with the that the Hispanic community is just ridiculous you know thank you I don't see him hanging out in you know in LA and really you know really getting down with the community I could never imagine him going in a bar and hanging out with with a bunch of day-laborer Hispanic men I could never see them getting along with with Romney you know it's interesting though that that's where the the the debate has gone that's where the focus of our country is gone it's into these two very different personalities and what each one represents and then the dialogue is one of them represents a redistribution of wealth he represents you know he's gonna take money from these these people that have worked so hard he's gonna give it to these lazy folk to try to prop them up and then the other side is that this this guy is a businessman and this guy is gonna be able to figure out what's wrong with the business of this economy and put us back on track and he's got these steps that he's gonna take right away and then one sighs like this is gonna cost the middle class a lot of money and all while this is going on tanks are moving into place right now that's an Iran yes Ron and and I and I the more I look at it the more I'm starting to agree with people who think that the two-party system is just a distraction Bill Hicks said it best he said I like he was he goes I like the puppet on the left well the puppet on the right is more to my liking hey wait a minute one guys holding both puppets you know and that's essentially the dog and pony show that we got going on gay rights taxes what are you gonna do give it a lazy welfare people you know there's a people that believe that welfare is in place just simply to ensure that there's a certain amount of Democratic voters over here now they just continue the welfare so people continue to be on the dole so people continue to support anybody supports that it's a mess it's a fucking mess so what gives you hope I always ask people that because psychedelics give me hope for real not joking it sounds ridiculous because people associate psychedelics with with non realistic things with hallucinations they they they don't look at it the way I look at it I think that there are certain plants here that have aided in the evolution of human consciousness they have changed the way people look they've changed the way I look at people they've changed my relationship with human beings my the way I look at human beings has fundamentally changed by having psychedelic experiences and change for the better made me a healthier nicer person made me more loving made me more aware of the consequences of my own personal actions and I think that's one of the reasons why they're illegal and I think it's a really it's a shame that they've been derided to the point where it's it's a laughable topic you know if you say they'll you know yeah Rogan also thinks that mushrooms can cure mankind well guess what they could if we all had really intense mushroom trips first of all people would come out of that with a complete reset they'd come out without you would be healthy but you would have a complete reset of the way you view eternity the way you view this situation that we're in the way we're so caught up in our own little culture and our own little situation that we have constructed and that were fighting against in trying to control these various aspects that we don't even we don't even think we don't take the time to think about the incredible majesty of just life itself and how amazing it is and how incredible it is that you have friends and loved ones and how incredible it is that you can have sex and then you could drink wine you could eat steak and you could go to a movie and you can drive a car we live in a fucking fantasy world and I think that if people had some newfound appreciation whether it's from a near-death experiences whether it's from psychedelics whether it's from meditation whatever it is I think people operate their lives primarily on momentum they get up the same way they've always gotten up they move in the same way they've moved to get there everyday to work and they go through the same job every day and that momentum is very very difficult to break and even if it's not a healthy momentum whether it's you know beating off to your dick bleeds or gambling all your money away we still get stuck in that momentum I need a drink you don't even know why you need a drink you're stopped in some wacky momentum you could call it being addicted to porn you could call it being addicted to the Internet but we're stuck in a wacky momentum and the only thing in my experience that changes that is a complete reconstruction of how you view the world and the only way to do that is to step away you have to have some sort of a disconnect some sort of an experience where you get an objective look at things for the first time you look at things as if you were someone completely unattached to every single aspect of your life and the lives of all the people around with you but you get to see it like mapped out in front of you clearly and cleanly with no ego with no financial repercussions with no just you get to really see what it is and that's not fucking possible for most people without some form of psychedelic experience and so when you do these because this is you saw my first reaction was to laugh when you know everybody's is and yeah I know even it's just I've never really heard of it described this way so tell me when you do the mushrooms what does it do what is it like in in your mind what are you experiencing that allows you to have a greater understanding of reality well that's where it gets really tricky because some people don't experience that they just experience terror and dancing mice and alligator people that want to eat your ass like you have bad trips too it's not that it's not always rosy I've never done any any drugs like that so I I because I've always had that fear of something fatal happening or well McKenna felt the tarrant there's a guy named Terence Mckenna who was one of my psychedelic heroes and his or just a really brilliant fascinating human being and he had this crazy theory called the stoned ape theory and it was his belief that since psychedelic drugs unquestionably have existed since the beginning of human civilization there have been various sacraments various things that people have taken in during rituals to the point where a guy named John Marco Allegro is one of the scholars that described that decoded the Dead Sea Scrolls one of his translation his his one he wrote two books about the translations one of them is called the sacred mushroom in the cross and the his book but with his basic life's work was explaining was that the entire Christian religion was a massive misunderstanding and what it was really all about was psychedelic mushroom rituals and fertility cults and that this was how the original group of people like this they wrote down all these rituals in the form of parables than the form of stories and I mean it's you have to be some sort of a and you know in Aramaic and in ancient languages to even understand what the fucking saying to book two to when you would disagree with it but no question they had psychedelic mushrooms there's no question and there's no question that they thought that those psychedelic mushrooms were a direct connection to God and that's probably what represented God to them and that they didn't want other people to know about it and so they hid those things they hid those things and stories and those stories didn't represent necessarily Santa Claus or you know and various people that were Jesus one of the things that he translated was he believed that the word Jesus or the word Christ rather meant a mushroom covered in God's semen as that he believed that this is a Sumerian word apparently and he believed that they thought that when it rained that it was God like having intercourse with the earth and that these mushrooms would grow out of the ground like overnight and you know we they didn't have microscopes so they couldn't see the the spores that turned into mushrooms so they thought that this was like gifts from God then they would take them and trip their fucking balls off so if you really stop and think about that if you lived you know in a time where there was no science and virtually no understanding of the world that we live in and you found mushrooms and you ate them and just had this fucking mind-blowing transcending experience McKenna believed that that was responsible for us evolving past lower hominids he believed that the the the doubling of the human brain size over a period of two million years which is a huge mystery in the fossil record they don't really understand why the human brain size doubled and it was his theory that it they doubled because they started taking psychedelic mushrooms these monkeys came down off the trees they started eating mushrooms every day and in doing that it changed the cult of the culture music you're gonna scare her away Joe fascinating stuff dude if you look I don't have to tell you you've had many mushroom trips but when you have them there's it's such a powerful if I've learnt to rob a bank I'm still gonna rob a bank if I do mushrooms or not if I'm gonna rape somebody I'm gonna chew on mushrooms ago you know what I'm not gonna rape this girl anymore I want to like I don't think mushrooms fixes anything I think everyone did much the whole road it's not gonna fix anyone cuz you'll get ridiculous first of all you might be very different than a lot of people that have had transcending experience rooms I bet Brian is yeah they might be fucked up to begin with but you can't discount all the positive experiences and all the transcendent experiences that people have had yes you have two days no it lasts two days for you hey laughs when you when you I don't think about a mushroom trip after two days now okay well that's you Brian do you sit there and say every day we wake up I'm like thinking about how you argue about it you so silly that you're even arguing about it so what does it do to you when you take mushrooms like I know you guys say it's psychedelic what do you see what do you what are you well you know like sound experiences what he's saying I think in saying that you think about it for two days is that for two days you sort of reconsider yourself and then you eventually go back into the pattern of your everyday life right is that what you're saying yeah it doesn't do anything permanent where it's like okay I'm gonna always I'm gonna be a better person okay but that is that is extremely subjective and it does to other people and it has to me so when you say that it doesn't I say okay maybe to you but for you to say that just because you haven't had a life-changing experience where they've pushed you into a different direction of understanding doesn't mean it doesn't exist what I'm telling you that it exists for me and there's two of us so it's 50% of people in this room that have done mushroom getting eyes that you like I don't think if you had everyone do cuz you say this all the time about if you everyone just did mushrooms everything will fix itself I don't think for most people mushrooms has that big of an effect after a couple of days you know I think that's because because of momentum yeah I think that's because of momentum and because of the fact that it's so easy to go back and to think about your life the way it you used to think about it before you had that experience your ego will guide you right back to the patterns that you're comfortable in anywhere you know unless you've chosen look what makes a person decide you know I'm tired of being a fat fuck I am going to start eating healthy and I'm gonna drink water all day and I'm gonna lose this fucking weight for some people it's bullshit they try it and then two days later they go back to eating again I mean Brian you've been on several diets where you've lost a tremendous amount of weight and then you go back to normal patterns of eating right I've been on one diet but yeah okay you've been I thought it was more than once but you lost it you lost an amazing amount of weight like 80 80 something pal oh wow but then you know that was motivation because I got out of a relationship at eight-year relationship right see you had a transcendent experience you had something that made you change your life and for some people that mushroom trip that that reset they might have more questions about life than you do they might have more questions about their own consciousness than you do and when they have those psychedelic experiences they're truly life-changing and it doesn't have to be just for two days it can be for two days I've never darts you in a direction I guess I've never met anyone that did mushrooms and it changed their life forever ever okay silly because you know me yeah I wouldn't think that though of you a lot of people do that's weird you know Greg Fitzsimmons when he was on the podcast was talking about how much I've changed since he met me yeah a lot of that is psychedelic experiences man a lot of that is meditation a lot of that has attained isolation Tech is you Said's a age yeah thank you that's who Wade you know what by the way that that is all life experiences and psychedelic experiences are part of life experiences they're unbelievably introspective they force you to examine your life and really almost an alien way and again not for everybody different people Co into them with different baggage you know different people some people try to fight the experience and go crazy you know there's there's certain aspects to the psychedelic experience where you cannot control it you don't have any control over it but what what it does do for sure is humbles people and what it does do for sure is it squashes your ego you know and maybe Brian doesn't have ego problems maybe that's why you know it doesn't change him that much but for some people it's incredibly humbling it's just really cool like you get some cool movies and put it on it's really neat but I think that's about the height of it well I totally disagree and there's 50% of us here everybody's different some peanuts and it fucking kills them I'm wearing with okay do I try it or do I not if you wanted to do something what I would recommend is um going to Peru and doing like an ayahuasca retreat and do one of those I I scuba dive I do yeah Jerry Garcia that he wouldn't need he wouldn't need hallucinogenics if if he was able to scuba dive every day because to me that's that's when you're seeing all the coral formations and crazy huge fish and sharks coming at you that to me is another world experience that's easy to say for Jerry Garcia after he did acid a billion times a certain point in time are you even sober after that me do you ever get sober or who allowed him to scuba dive scuba buddy fucking just gonna die any second on you that guys held together by tissue paper yeah yeah how old was he when he was scuba diving I think it was I think it was later in his life but not not too late but but that's just a well-known phrase within scuba diving that that he would always say that especially when he was able to go down like in places like Hawaii where you have turtles and and that's like tripping when you see a turtle swimming right next to you and you're swimming and you're at the same pace and it's this huge huge sea turtle and you ever see sharks yeah I love love love seeing sharks only because they're so rare it's very rare - it's like saying you're you go hiking out in California you'll see a bear it's almost the odds are slim to none so when I get to see a shark I'm I get excited about it one time we were scuba diving below the oil spill on CNN this was really cool that they they let us do this and and there was an area where there weren't a lot of bait fish because they'd been killed by the oil so we're down underneath the water it was me and Philippe Cousteau Jacques Cousteau invented scuba diving it was his grandson and Jacques Cousteau invented scuba diving mm-hmm he yeah he he helped really know that yes things like I do we had that show are you being serious no I thought you were I really didn't know that one guy invented scuba dive well he helped here I mean but who knows if we can trust what was written he helped innovate it I'd say he was really the guy who brought it to the mainstream and and so we were there live on TV scuba diving and all the sudden there's sharks swimming behind us on air and a lot of viewers thought we were going to get eaten and and and so I was really paying attention to we were wearing has suits and I was paying attention to not drowning because my suit had flooded and there was wearing oily water and so I barely noticed the sharks but I went back and watched a video and and there are a lot of them that just keep swimming right past us and I later find out that our my asshole's South African photographer was throwing lunch meat off the boat was attracting all these sharks to come toward us I know right yeah he was throwing uh we had Walmart sandwiches and he was he was throwing the salami and the Bologna but he didn't like off the boat and it attracted one shark and he thought it was funny to bring all these other sharks on board but douche bag but it's cool to see them underwater they're fascinating creatures the way they swim and and also just to see something that massive they could potentially harm you it's kind of a adrenaline rush you know yeah for sure actually uh it's it doesn't seem like they invented it it seems like Jacque Cousteau sort of made it made it popular but it seems like the first inventions of it were in the 1700s 1771 a British engineer named John Smeaton invented the air pump and a hose was connected between the air pump and a diving barrel allowing air to be pumped to the diver so in 1700 they invented it people are so crafty I know it amazing it's pretty fascinating to be underwater and be able to breathe yeah it it's one of the most incredible feelings I highly recommend scuba diving Julia folic no I well I'm not I'm not a claustrophobic person so it doesn't affect me in that way but but I could see how some people would affect them because you have all this gear on and you're relying on this claustrophobic thing over your mouth to be able to breathe yeah it seems like if something goes bad it goes bad fast you know like if you see like a shark or something like that you better and just start panicking that's you dude that seems like it would I mean like she's got it together dude she's in Bahrain getting machine guns put in her head she can handle sharks I have an abnormal sense of fear I know I don't my whole life I just don't have that thing in my brain that tells me wait stop what you're doing really yeah it's it's strange I I I just it doesn't if I do have it it's very very minimal have you ever thought that maybe you have like a destiny and that the reason why you have this bizarre abnormal sense of fear where you don't react to it it's because this is your path maybe you're like a historical figure sorry hey yeah someday they're gonna be talking about you it's gonna be super important and you're just like this crazy broad who just didn't have this fear of sharks like machine guns no big deal let me get back in there trying to get a visa try and get back to your country where you tried to shoot me you know I mean that's that's a very weird possibility have you ever thought about that like you're your place in this whole thing there's something that you said in the Alex Jones documentary the interview rather that I thought was really fascinating you said that CNN is on the wrong side of history mm-hmm you know and by by doing what you're doing you're clearly on the right side of history you're clearly the mean that's what you're supposed to do and when you see corruption you're supposed to talk about it we see problems you're supposed to expose them you're on the right side of history do do you think about that yeah I I always when I come out with things full force it's only when I'm 100% know the truth because no matter what if you if you follow the truth I always say it doesn't have a shelf life whatever the corruptions gonna get exposed and and I think that I think you know I really do I believe my my lack of sense of fear also it enabled me to do that because I I don't have that thing over my shoulder telling me okay well what if someone comes after you for going after Time Warner or what if what if you don't have a job or money I've lived out of my car I don't you know I don't I don't have those fears so that enabled me to come forward and talk about this and make and bring this into the public light without having having fear Wow where do you see this this all going for you do you do you you know do you have like a ten year map out where you sort of projected what you're going to be doing or you just sort of living in the moment trying to react to the world changing around you I am trying to use everything in my power to to enlighten Americans and let them know what's happening I I don't know yet where I'm gonna be ten years from now hopefully safe and sound and working for a journalistic outlet that allows people to do real journalism again whether I have to create that or whether someone else will I don't know but to think that your bold choices will inspire other people that are in your same position that were in your same position like in places like CNN and Fox News to do the same and to expose things I do think it's it's really hard to do it's hard to do because you're no matter what you're gonna face criticism and then when you look at it journalistically how much power these networks have and how few companies own everything people don't want to take them off and people don't want to lose their health insurance and they don't want to lose their severance and they don't want to lose money and and it's easier just to go along every day and and pretend nothing's happening and and continue to just have that imagination that you're just a cog in the machine and you're not really the problem well every single person that's enabling this to happen is the problem and that's what I said I feel like these journalists are gonna go down and on the wrong side of history and they're just as guilty as the corporation's they work for because they know this is going on and they're not saying anything not only are they not saying anything they're continuing to go into work every day and and feed lies to the American public do you remember when they used to have all those movies about the McCarthy era and you know that one movie with Robert De Niro I forget what it was but it just showed the suppressive nature of you know the government back then and this this massive witch-hunt it's so similar to what's going on today it's so weird how things go on these weird these cycles these incredibly bizarre cycles another witch hunt is terrorist yeah we're terrorists yeah well well when that witch hunt becomes a guy like Julian Assange when it when it turns you know the word terrorism turns to a guy like Julian Assange makes you go work what is your definition like what are you what are you doing like this guy that guy has never killed anybody okay he didn't kill anybody and he didn't lie so what did he do what did he do this so terrible this that's a terrorist he was a terrorist on corruption corruption I'm terrified of him you know and I'm sure there's people that would consider me a terrorist because if I know that they're corrupt I'm gonna fucking expose them enemy in the state yeah and exactly and so maybe and some people's eyes I'm a terrorist but that means then I can be taken down by the NDAA and that's what's so scary about it they're cheating they're doing the wrong thing it's not the way you're supposed to run things you fuckheads you know it you know you're not supposed to run things like that you're cheating you you by instead of doing it correctly you've decided to take away all dissent and to slowly remove the rights of the people that are showing dissent that's some unamerican bullshit it can only happen if people let it happen yeah do you think it's ever possible to make a new country like the way we did America where everybody hopped up from Europe and like fucked this lets it was only a couple hundred years ago is there a spot maybe if global warming kicks in we could take over Greenland or Iceland rather or Antarctica right anywhere why smart we have what we have over there now we could maybe recolonize Mars that stomach sense you know or what about some type of open source government on you know on the Internet well about those people that want to build cities in the middle of the ocean and international waters those floating city ideas have you seen that yeah yeah maybe that's the future some fuckin Waterworld type shit or we could just yeah we could just put on tanks that allow us to scuba dive from descend into the oceans I'd prefer to for that to be my fate I gotta tell you Joe it wasn't there some recent there's something where they allowed some sort of an injection they allowed people to not have to breathe for certain periods of time some some new invention actually yeah yeah yeah some scientists know how she scientists swim without oxygen this was that the movie abyss that they pumped something in remember that shirt that movie was ahead of its time man yeah I don't know there's some new discovery I'm not googling it aqua Fox magic no there was a there really was something scientists suffered a way to keep people alive England they can't breathe yeah okay they inject oxygen into the blood they've discovered a new way of administering oxygen to the blood which could allow people to stay alive without breathing amazing breakthrough could change medical science by eliminating the need to keep patients breathing during complex operations okay so the idea was this is for operations but it could also be used somehow or another you could connect people some sort of a fucking thing intravenously and they don't have to breathe whoa and where is this taking place where's this research research it's a good question maybe I shouldn't say well they'll close down on them gotta got my door today Joe I got a free Scientology test on my door whew just had to fill out this like ten page thing and send it in they can tell me if I'm a Scientology ready it says are you curious about you yeah when the questions are like do you often make thoughtless remarks or her accusations which you later regret yes or no and it says you definitely there's just tons of questions like ridiculous questions you should say yes that's my whole career on podcasts you spend I'm gonna give this worries do you know no really needless worries are legit Lomb that's another thing that's been widely miss reported in the news is this attack on the US Embassy in Libya that they attributed to this fucking shitty movie that this guy made and apparently that's not true at all and then that that movie that attack rather had been planned for a long time before that and purposely took place on the anniversary of September 11th and that for some reason now that I decided to blame it on people reacting to this movie so sort of give people an irrational idea of how Muslims would respond to any sort of mocking of their faith and to get us even more you know angry at the idea of Muslims and more excited about the idea of stopping this Muslim threat this Islamic threat that the world sees and Iran as a part of that no exactly and and why didn't the government come out when they knew it wasn't exactly directly a result of that video why didn't they come out and talk about that right yeah well they don't ever it's like the Pat Tillman story or the Jessica Lynch story when they get caught bullshitting they never make it okay we were bullshit and they never do that and they never do that they just sort of journalists job to come forward and say that that this wasn't really a result of that movie and you didn't see that on the network's they didn't do that and instead they just continued to fill the public with this crap propaganda so what are you doing now as far as like broadcasting where where can people read your latest stuff who are you working for these days like how are you rocking it what are you doing I I'm working on a book I felt like the protests were under covered so the first thing I did was I I do photography it's one of my loves and impassion so I've been traveling to all these protests that's why I was shot at in Anaheim and and taking photos of protests here in the US and really showing people this is happening and not only that people are winning there are there are people man these people down in Texas that are fighting the tar sands pipeline they're crazy these old farmers are putting devices on to attach themselves physically attach themselves to equipment that law enforcement has to solve in order to get them away and and they're burying themselves in the ground yeah I mean they are fighting back yes you don't even know about it but I know about not being covered because they're winning and they're actually stopping this pipeline from going in or at least stopping the construction periodically where is it and what is it about down in Texas they're they're building a tar sands pipeline through some communities through some winery you some some farms and and the community is very upset and they've really done what's called direct action protesting which you can assume what that means that's direct accident I mean they're getting in there and preventing this construction from taking place they're also building house it tree they're taking over trees and forests and building treehouses and having professional climbers come in to keep that I know you don't know it's fascinating some are dense I would say there are thousands I mean it's going on all across the state and and so I'm covering not only that I'm covering women's right to go topless events there is a big event who is fighting that there are women fuck is fighting that Brian not me yeah I mean there's some cities as a woman man you go out there topless and you'll get cuffed for disturbing in Columbus Ohio it's uh it was legal to go outside topless but it was illegal to go inside a strip club and be topless kini you had to have pasties oh that's hilarious but you could be topless outside you can just walk outside and some guys have moves our man boobs that are bigger than the women and way more disgusting to look at you know better areola who the fuck is stomping women from going topless what kind of a weak-ass culture we have so they're winning these Proteas women are winning like we always CEO will occupy it's so stupid and they're not getting any change done and they're not winning actually they are winning and there's a lot of cases where they have have won and that's what this books covering in that but also it's gonna piss a lot of people off are you worried about this pissing people off you're worried about like their Lily alright now this chick is really a problem with NDAA yeah yeah I am but I think a lot like I said a lot of investigative journalists are but it will it stop me he'll know it just makes me put in now I'm putting now I put up that fuck NDAA poster and I'm putting that one in the book you know do you know anybody that's been put on like no-fly lists or any of those things yeah we had one of even a CNN journalists you think oh they don't mess with the mainstream media a journalist a colleague of mine investigated the TSA and was put on a no-fly list Wow yeah for quite some time to try to intimidate so if you investigate that TSA they can put you on a list that says you can't fly yeah they do that to critical politicians and they've done it to journalists and and they did this to a CNN journalist Wow yeah and and and as a reporter especially at CNN you need to travel that's your job you're traveling all the time so it really affected us so what happens when you go to the airport they say you can't fly that's it there's no you have no recourse I've never been on on the list but but I know he wasn't able to travel within the country so yeah until your fuckin cry so he has to go Greyhound bus everywhere or what they do is they say they're investigating it and maybe they drag on that investigation for months before they take your name off that list I haven't been put on that list yet but yeah I mean it's Big Brother trying to intimidate dissent and not only that intimidate politicians who would be against their behavior as well as as journalists I don't think they'd mess with me because I know I would I would race so much hell about it or maybe I haven't investigated the TSA yet I that's probably why yeah I mean could you imagine going to the airport you're going to visit grandma or maybe it's an emergency a funeral or something and you're told you can't fly for what because you're a journalist and you actually are exposing corruption in the government which is our job or or your Joe Rogan and you pick up the Joe Rogan experience and you spoke out against the TSA have you ever been on a list he's already given to get us in trouble he has too many people in here that are on the government list so we're gonna get the list by association I think well we're not doing anything we're just talking dude yeah we gamble I enough worry we're taking the easy route we're giving them eyes is that what it is or giving them the yeah the voice you know what it means that's a problem Arden I know it's a part of it though so we're probably on the list there probably but we're not on the list because we could still fly sure well not on that list we're on the webcam look at this master you know yeah they like us you know this is this the problem I've gotten I've gotten ya the masturbation videos host it over no good that you want to watch but what's worse that they're good and good and hear us you know that's even worse not being able to see us and just hearing us go okay so what if someone came to you and said they hacked into your computer and they had video of you masturbating kidding I'm kidding please don't put on light no it would suck but I wouldn't be like oh here's a million dollars yes but if they said okay you need to not have that guest on your show No or I'm gonna leak this video I guess you're gonna have to have a video of me beaten off because it's ridiculous it's not that big a deal you know it's like if you really want to have that video and put it out there first of all everyone's gonna know that you can do that and it's gonna be massive outrage that you turn on someone for whatever reason you just you've been videotaping them beating off the whole time that's some unamerican bullshit right there that's ridiculous it depends if there's any ass play on but there always is Brian so why you playing you're gonna come to me with a cold sweat we can't have this guy on David's team man really we're gonna do it David Seaman podcast again fuck that let's get Joey Diaz on sweatin and shit yeah you're so sweaty man this would be the secret word so you know what I'm doing you know I was thinking of your show and I was thinking on my way here of how I I think that your show will go down in history as a show that told the truth and actually had was it was a strange rise out of out of the mix into something that you know is really becoming one of the leading voices of of truth and it when it comes to podcasts and another content and you guys are really starting to fill that vacuum that it has been created by the mainstream media well it's just weird to me that there's not something like this in the mainstream media that someone I it's like I look at things that are fascinating to me and the world is filled with them and some of them involve corruption the other ones involve Bigfoot and crop circles and UFOs and aliens and all I'm interested in a lot of different things but you you don't see a a lot of discussion on these things whether it's odd crazy things like Bigfoot or UFOs or you you know you don't see much real legitimate discussion about psychedelics you don't see much real legitimate discussion about the possible repercussions of the way society is progressing and what is a solution to to do it to really change the whole thing you don't see much legitimate discussion about that and I've always found that weird I don't I don't know why that exists when that's always what I would get together with my friends and talk about when me and my friends would be alone you know at a restaurant somewhere and someone would talk about something or Eddie Bravo would bring up some video he saw or Brian would talk about something that was on the internet and and we would all sit around and talk about it I never understood why there was nothing no show that had these points of view there was no show that was like what is going on here where everybody seems to be pretending that everything's fine everybody seems to be pretending that everything is going along you know a manageable course and we're gonna be fine and I don't I don't see that I see madness I see chaos I see people that have way more power than they have knowledge and enlightenment they have this weird sort of situation where I don't understand exactly who's running the show and I don't think anybody does and then there's this dog-and-pony presidential debate and eventual election which if anything changes at all to be social issues you know that's all that ever really changed is gay marriage is the beach ball that gets tossed back and forth and maybe medical marijuana is gonna be the next one but Obama's already lied about that you know they lied about whether or not they were gonna use the DEA to go after medical marijuana dispensaries have been doing that like crazy lately it's it's a weird thing when you realize that it doesn't matter who wins it's a weird thing then it it's just as such a strange enlightenment to wake up and to clarify yeah doesn't I've recently had that and are you gonna vote me I just historically speaking I I don't vote because I don't want a dog in the race and I know I get criticized for this all the time but I know if I do go in and take the time to vote for someone I'm gonna be secretly rooting for them and that's the problem we're having now I think with people not criticizing Obama enough journalists because journalists tend to be more liberal and there's and they're scared to criticize him for NDAA and that's why we're not seeing these vital issues covered so I feel like as journalists I feel like we shouldn't vote we should not have a dog in the race we should be able to stand back regardless a party and and just look for the truth and really criticized go after everyone I mean that's our job is it's fuck yeah I say that's our excuse no Brian no voted yeah that's yeah well it keeps your duty I encourage everyone to vote in and be active but I is a journalist I encourage everybody to take mushrooms and be active that way Brian doesn't agree with me I encouraged as play I encourage everybody to follow Amber lion on Twitter amber ly oh and look thank you very much for just being awesome
