the Joe Rogan experience I guess this is a good time to bring it up as any you know obviously Anthony Bourdain took his life yeah last week and he was a friend of mine and it was real that was real hard Friday was real hard I woke up and I got a text from my friend Maynard from tool uh-huh Maine and said so much for the Kenan vs Bourdain celebrity jujitsu match you know and and he's like fuck and I was like oh no what does that mean yeah and so that I googled it and I saw it was like oh shit man I can't fuck Wyatt yeah just what why had to hung himself like what yeah I don't how close were you did you know his demons was friends with him hung out with him got fucked up with him did you get a feeling that he had that in him I didn't know that yeah but was really weird was like he had been saying really recently that he'd never been happier he was talking about his girlfriend saying that they'd never been happier didn't know he could be that happy didn't know someone to make him that happen oh man I am so terrible but who knows I mean they might have met a broken arm who knows yeah I mean who knows I don't know I don't know I don't I don't know I mean no idea sometimes people when they say I've never been that happy you're catching them on these ups and downs you know some people some people huh huh you know people get manic right I don't know if he was but some people get yeah they get up-and-down I'll tell you what he he liked to get fucked up yeah you know I he liked to drink yeah you know and he enjoyed it it was it was something that he enjoyed yeah but we did an episode of this show we went hunting for pheasants in Montana I mean we cooked over this campfire he cooked bland tastic and really and then afterwards we drank whiskey and smoke weed he goes deep he goes deep really yeah well I'm sitting down Mike I'm gonna just try to catch myself real the world spinning deep breath deep breath he's like where's the fuckin weed he just kept going Wow but I knew he drank I didn't know he smoked weed yeah yeah he um he had a heroin problem yeah when he was younger and he kicked it but he didn't feel the need to just be sober yeah that was kind of interesting about him that's a--that's a thing bright when ya get sober from a drug they feel like they have to get sober from everything yeah that did not feel like that and he by the way like he would drink but when he was home like with his kid and he's homeless right he didn't drink at all like he we don't have that he would only do that when he would be on the road right so he only shows stretches of time and he didn't drink it all in he was am addicted to jiu-jitsu that was that was a really yeah he's doing jiu-jitsu like literally every day now when I was hanging around with them he was he went we were in Montana he went to Bozeman to find a local jiu-jitsu club and trained with them in the morning she trained with everybody I never hardly ever get on the road yeah find a place I would just go to the gym and workout right wouldn't but he was so into learning and getting better at jujitsu I feel like there's a fundamental problem with the way people approach ideas and I think it goes back to what we're talking about earlier about right versus left or yeah you know Republican versus Democrat they're not thinking the consequences of arguing for against the possibility that climate change is a human cause thing they're not thinking to the consequences they just want to win right right and what their side they want their side to be right and that you know what what bums me out is they don't understand the the consequences of that for the both the American Enterprise and the human enterprise right I mean because you know if you if you keep calling one branch of science a hoax then what's to say the other branch is like well you know then you just your doubt you're rolling down this you know slippery slope or like the other countries you know like so most of the of the Nobel Prizes Americans have one were people from other countries they came here to do their science because we had the best scientific enterprise the next generation will just go somewhere else they'll go to China you know so there's that part of it and the other part is like dude it's just science it doesn't care about your political views and you know it's not fair to use the cell phone and take the antibiotics and then turn around and like and then suddenly treat this thing as if it was another thing in your bucket of you know ideologies I think also people think if you somehow another compromised industry's ability to to work that you're gonna kill jobs and you're gonna damage the economy and that's more important yeah but I think it's the exact opposite right and if people really saw right I mean um you know again just like I'm saying climate change shows how powerful people's become and also shows how powerful our enterprise right we did this by you know building businesses by building enterprise by and we built this world girdling machine of civilization and it you know it the planet actually noticed why do you like that term world girdling because that's it gives me the turtle because it's from like Shakespeare like from Caesar or something there's a lot of guys you could take out there that are tracking field guys or football players and you could get them to fight better than him in a couple of weeks right easily because there are athletes they're athletes they would understand how to shift their weight throw a punch and yeah the the sparring videos I saw was that and he was from his first fight but even then like he wasn't he signed for like two years before he had his first fight or something yes there's no way that you're six years deep in the game he was still in that bad you know I mean it doesn't have any talent that's all it is it just doesn't have physical talent whatever for whatever reason whether it's his approach his intensity whether it's it's not as coaching so what Duke fucking Rufus you know yeah I mean well the house dude coach I mean that he talks about Duke Rufus he and then one of the pre fights he said how do you see this place I got I'd really like a head kick Duke would love to see a head kick and like I don't think that's gonna happen oh that's so crazy that is so that's such a crazy thing to say um you know Duke's a beautiful person he's a great guy in every every sense of the word he just is he's a great guy he did his best you know there's only so much he could do I know I mean I'm sure you would love working with Duke I'm sure he would love working with you if you and Duke work together I'm sure you guys would have a great old time because you're Joe fucking chillings right and he's Duke fucking River though you know let him know but you know what I mean I mean you have to have something to work with you know I mean if Duke just grabbed some dude from a gas station that has been drinking beer and smoking cigarettes his whole life and and had him in a fight in six months how much can you possibly hope but I would rather see that fight against ego well a guy you can find at a gas station beer and say what's interesting is they both both guys fought Mickey golf first just weird did you see his Instagram Miki's yeah he didn't like his own pre-fight uh analysis of how it was gonna go it was really good yeah well a little bit that these articles get right about him it's that he's helping men he is yes he is also helping women but yes he is helping men well men need their shit together they need frame work for sure I mean people need this this thing about discipline and you know you're you are you're where you know you're aware of Jocko right yeah that discipline equals freedom it's like one of the best catchphrases it's so act it's empowering it's so empowering get your shit together and then you the time that you have for recreation you appreciate it so much more you don't appreciate rest when you're fuckin off all day yeah you appreciate rest when you've worked hard that's when it means something to you when you've accomplished goals that's when this celebration is is something that you get a good feeling from it do you have a part in your life that you feel like is lacking in that department in what department and just like getting your shit together like not slacking on no I'm pretty good yeah that's what I do yeah I mean I do a lot of shit the only way I could do as many different things as I do is if I just get after it yeah I get after it pretty fucking good yeah and I'm not I'm not insecure in that I mean whether it's through martial arts or any kind of exercise or work I just I take pride in getting things done I take pride in working yeah you know especially working towards things that are important to me whether it's working on my set working on my standup whether it's working on a podcast whether it's working on my martial arts or my fitness or yoga or whatever I get after it man just got to yeah and for me it's not a matter of whether or not it's an option it's like brushing my teeth I don't decide one day I don't wanna brush my teeth today I just fucking brush my teeth and when there's days where I'm doing fasted cardio when that alarm goes off it's not a matter of whether or not I shut the alarm off that's not an option yeah you get up you put your fucking shoes on you get the dog and you go running cuz that's what you do and if you just decide that's what you do then you get things done and then a month later you're like oh yeah we did this all month and then six months later it's like oh I did this half a year and then if you're doing jujitsu you're like oh shit look I got a blue belt oh shit now I'm a purple belt and that's how you become a black belt yeah you just you know and I got this is the good type of permissive because it gets progressively easier - I told you it doesn't though doesn't get easy you know thinks okay looking hard every time that alarm goes off like fuck but you're for you now then right when you started I don't know did you know the reward of it you know that that reward some enforcement there's some enforcement in the success that I've had in completing these tasks but every fucking time I go to yoga class my god Jesus 90 minutes and a 104 degree temperature with these all these women that are gonna humiliate me they can definitely do things that you can't do they just fight well they're just they're tough man there's a lot of these older ladies that are fucking tough yeah you know they just got it out I was just one lady that goes there she's like 60 years old she doesn't even bring water and this lady's in there for 90 fuckin minutes sweat it out she's there every time I go she's not bringing water you sure she see she could be like 20 and gray-haired and toughest shit she drinks water before she drinks it after but when she's in that class she's just tough it's just you know there now it's never easy to do you know it gets a little bit easier when you get better at it but then you just try harder and it makes it more difficult if you're always giving 100% effort it's always gonna be hard you know you take some pride in the fact that now I can go two miles through the hills and you know and reach the point of exhaustion where before was won or whatever whatever your little little progress markers are you get some satisfaction that but it's always difficult to get going the the hardest step is the first step it's not the 30th step or the hundredth step it's the fucking first one it's getting on the trail getting going it's the hardest thing the hardest weight to lift is the first one because once you get going like okay I'm a half hour into my workout I'm writing things down I'm supposed to be doing now I got you know 20 chin-ups and then burpees and then all you have to do it they just have to do it and so many people have a hard time doing it [Applause]
