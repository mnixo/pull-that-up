join my day Joe Rogan podcast my night all day you know or things they disagree with it's like it is a lot a lot riding on every aspect of fighting like to see the Bernard Hopkins fighting sad right it was sad Bernard Hopkins at 51 years old fought this kid named Joe Smith jr. have nobody seen Joe Smith jr. before he's fuckin he's a killer like Bernard Hopkins picked a killer and this kid fucked him up his kid has extra long arms he's got weird arms like his arms go below his waist like I was watched him fine it was like look at the length of his fucking arms like he just he beat the shit out of Bernard and he knocked him out of the ring but not caught him with some good shots he was timing him and he caught him with a few right hands where the kid was just eating them and moving forward and you know it looks like it's like when people have fake hands like the fake hands like sticking through the church slave yeah he almost looked like a cartoon guy with his extra-long arms but he's a bad motherfucker that guy and Bernard got knocked through the ropes and fell on his head it was crazy to watch and he got up he was all disoriented didn't know it happened thought he was pushed through the ropes but he was punched through the ropes that guy connected with like four or five big shots and and the last one was a left hook on the face as Bernard is going through the ropes and it knocked him all the way through but it was a hundred percent legal he didn't do anything wrong he did everything with punches but none of it was a push he was just bombing on them and it just was a freak incident it's one of the reasons why cages are so much better than a ring a cage is so superior like a ring it's like that that possibility that you could fall through like that that's terrible that should they should stop using rings and if they do use rings they should pad the shit out of the outside area the fact that someone like Bernard Hopkins who's been boxing forever can still get knocked through a rope like that and land on his head that that's a possibility that's a stupid way of containing people they should have instead of ropes like that what they should have is something that's a crisscross pattern or you can't go through it and you should have to just climb over it to get in it it should be real simple and there should be a way they could release the the like if there was a medical emergency at the end of the fight it should be like a latch they could pull and drop the ropes down and get somebody out but the ropes the way they use them now in boxing matches they should fucking outlaw those the fact that Bernard Hopkins can get knocked through one like that that's where the very least you got to protect the outside area you got to pad the shit out of it and you had to have you should have people around and most the time a thousand fights in a row it's probably never gonna come into play but the one time it does you're responsible for that guy falling through the ropes that's fucking stupid like literally he goes flying through man little lengthen that kid's arms so it doesn't look looks Photoshop like his head's not the same right size or something he's a he's built for it I'll tell you that he's got a great genetics worked hard tough kid really good fighter a chin line you like that huh mm-hmm yeah he's an animal oh I was I was super impressed with his poise - and fighting a guy like Bernard Hopkins mean that guy stepped up in a big way and he was a two-to-one underdog leaning into that fight which is really crazy what's up yeah yeah I was pretty convinced that uh Bernard was going to be able to stifle him and turn it into like the kind of fight that Bernard likes but I wasn't sure if Bernard win you know it's a long time off two years when you're 51 years old it's a long time off he still fought amazing but at the end of the day that kid merked him he just was he was just too much and he was he's he's a guy that would have been a real threat at any time in anyone's career like he's this kid has real talent and right now he's not thought of as being the best fighter in the world or anything you can closely regard was at one point in time Bernard like when he beat Felix Trinidad a lot of people were saying that might be the best pound-for-pound boxer in the earth like a lot of people thought Trinidad was going to beat him he fucked Trinidad up and then he fought Kelly Pavlik and a lot of people wrote him off against Kelly Pavlik he boxed the shit out of Kelly Pavlik and so you look at like Bernards legacy and he go man this is an unbelievably skillful guy but at any point in that career that Joe Kelly kid would have been a handful he's just scary he's myth rather that Joe Smith jr. kid would have been a handful because he's just fucking scary he hits hard and he's he's super accurate and he's got awesome endurance and a great work ethic he's fuckin dangerous no matter what era it is and Bernard you know maybe Bernard would have been able to beat him in his in his prime you know it's totally possible it's a hundred percent likely I mean Bernards an all-time great maybe would have been able to land more the punches that he landed in that fight but you don't know I mean that kid's dangerous boxing such a crazy sport [Music]
