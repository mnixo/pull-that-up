hello freak bitches what do you think about this fight card got a fox fight tomorrow night yeah we're gonna come back and watch the fights after I kill a monster buck it's on the books folks in the cards I'm making a prediction it's big fight the main event is huge it's half a el dos Santos who's the former UFC lightweight champ versus Tony Ferguson who is undoubtably without question one of the best lightweights in the world and the guy's been knocking on the door - a title shot for a while it's a really interesting fight because it highlights a real issue with MMA right now and that issues weight cutting high failed dos Anjos had a terrible weight cut for the Eddie Alvarez fight I'm hearing a lot of like conflicting stories but all of them really bad now I shouldn't say conflicting I should say different stories but of what went on when he was making weight for his fight with Eddie Alvarez and apparently he was in bad shape like a really bad shape like barely made weight for that and was you know just really in physical discomfort and pain and just all screwed up from that weight cut I think weight cutting is one of the worst aspects of fighting I think it might be worse than the beatings these guys take we don't see it visually you don't see cuts in their face we don't see knockouts we don't see blood when they're cutting weight so we don't think of it as the same kind of damage that we do from a beating but I think it might be as bad if not worse I would say worse it could very well be and then even more worse is the fact these guys are dehydrating themselves literally to death's door and then fighting trained killers 24 hours later yeah it's unavoidable it's unnecessary I mean it's not unavoidable its avoidable it's unnecessary and it's foolish I think it's a it's one of the most foolish aspects of the for the sport and you know we were talking today with some of the guys at your camp about like issues with MMA and what the new owners are gonna do now that the UFC has been purchased and I hope they Institute a program to eliminate weight cutting I think it is one of the biggest problems and biggest it's a time bomb and it's just waiting to go off in everybody's face yeah and a guy like hi fell dos Anjos who's one of the elite of the elite before he lost to Eddie Alvarez a lot of people including me were making the argument that he might be the best lightweight ever you look at he knocked out Benson Henderson he beat the shit out of Nate Diaz he knocked out cowboy Cerrone in one round he's a fucking monster I mean he's a killer it beat the shit out of Anthony Pettis for five rounds to win the title just rolled him over just beat him down uh you can make the argument he's one of the greatest Loeb certainly one of the greatest lightweights of all time might be the best in terms of like champions and the guy was so depleted from his weight cut that he was like I'd heard he's passing out backstage you know I just I just if that guy died let's imagine I mean God forbid right but let's imagine if a guy like that dies because of a weight cut and it has happened the last week the last death in MMA was in Brazil and it was from a fighter who cut weight he died from weight cut he didn't die from the fight itself I just I think it's a terrible thing that can be eliminated and I think that if we did you would see better fights that's what I'm saying yeah I think how I mean someone like that that's having to cut that much are they really are you really seeing them at their best absolutely or not there's no question about see I think cowboy looks way better when he's when he's fighting heavier much better look how good he looks at 1/7 I think that's it he was always he's always been an elite fighter even at 55 but at 170 he looks like a world champion exactly yeah I'm waiting to see a title contention right there that way I think it's an old thing we're talking today about cyborgs yeah did you tell me what she walks around at 175 yeah she's it's like wow and I said well as jacked as she is how does she how does she cut that much I mean that seems like an impossibility she does it just sheer strength of will george lockhart who's her coach who's a really really high level nutritionist and and weight cutting expert and he gets her down that way but it's not pretty you know there's a video of her struggling to make 140 though the weight classes in the UFC for women as of right now there's only two there is 115 and then there's 135 and they've experimented with 125 that talks about doing 125 pound weight classes um like a title at 125 but as of yet it doesn't exist but I think honestly cyborg has said that really her best weight class isn't even 45 well she's the champion of an Invicta her best weight class would be 55 yeah I would say yeah and there's other girls out there man build it and they will come you know I think 55 would be a really good women's class because you'd almost you would almost have that like Mark Hunt Brock Lesnar's style you'd get some real just powerhouses in there that are still not too big where they're out of shape but they could just I mean they could be like cyborgs I think if you built it you'd have people coming from other countries that you probably don't even know about I think I think you certainly would after a few years that's just an investment that I think they have to make within women's MMA right now women's MMA is where men's MMA was when the UFC was first purchased because a lot of people don't realize but when the UFC bought that when they purchased it from the old owners they eliminated 155 pound weight class because they used to have a 155 then they had a 170 and then they had I think they had a middleweight and a light heavyweight and a heavyweight still but they didn't have anything lower than 170 so a lot of guys either left the UFC to fight in other organizations or they moved up to 170 and competed at 170 and some guys were like really oversized or under sized for that weight class so that's not enough obviously I mean it's really important that for a guy like Mighty Mouse like if there wasn't a hundred and 25 pound weight class which where Mighty Mouse competes we wouldn't be able to see the best fighter of all time compete in his perfect weight class or one five you know you wouldn't be able to see Dominick Cruz compete as optimal weight class 145 you wouldn't be able to see Joe's a Aldo go on that reign of terror for all those years you wouldn't be able to see Conor McGregor fight at 145 and beat Aldo and then 5554 the long time 55 which is one of the most competitive and talent rich divisions in the UFC didn't even exist and you know so I think that the UFC if they really want to make that commitment for women's MMA they should have a full range of weight classes for those girls to compete at I think they should start maybe even lower than 115 I mean you could you can make a real strong argument for 105-pound women's class a 1 5 or 115 or 125 and then I think really the trend of those 10 pound per weight class that should exist the men's division as well there's two big the bet that gaps in the men's divisions are way too big there's 170 and then there's 15 counts higher 185 that's a big jump and then there's 20 pounds above that 85 to 205 20 pounds think about taking 20 16 ounce t-bone steaks and that's how much bigger that guy is than the air above form then you go 205 to 265 so think about taking 60 t-bone steaks yeah 6-0 it's stacking them up thinking about all the horsepower that comes with all that weight it's just there's to the the gaps are too large you know if there's too few weight classes so I think the UFC would be it would be very smart for them to make more weight classes do a weight class every ten pounds and eliminate the weight cutting if they could and I think you can be done there they're probably gonna have to get rid of some champions though not get rid of but they're gonna have to read gonna have to move with your allies around yeah I mean and the people boards and bills yeah they're not gonna want to do that you know you're not gonna be able to it's gonna be a hard fight to tell a guy like Dominick Cruz you can't cut weight you know when he's the world champion he's hit look man what do you weigh you weigh 155 you're gonna have to fight it 155 yeah you
