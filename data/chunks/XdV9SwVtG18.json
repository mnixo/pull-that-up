here we go four three two Henry Rollins ladies and gentlemen how are you fella I'm better now being here with you I'm better now that you're here we were just talking about a show that you got you and Ted Nugent apparently somebody did someone did you pitch it who pitched the show um it was an idea that my manager Heidi and I came up with well mostly Heidi it was like it was called basically Henry and you put me and someone I might have some disagreements with or a few agreements with and we just go somewhere and we weigh in with a camera following us and we're thinking what it'll be like a six-part miniseries like you know me and plus six interesting people and one of the names that came up was Ted Nugent because I am a fan of his music I think he's one of the best guitar players I've ever seen yet he and I would probably disagree on one or a few topics and so we actually picked pitched it to Ted who said he loved the idea but he said I gotta go I'm busy with he had a ton of tour dates oh I think he's on now but he said I want to talk to Henry to thank him for thinking of me okay and so Ted called like on my phone in the office I guess he got my number from the powers that be and suddenly it's it's Ted on my phone I met my desk like okay this is surreal and we talked for a few minutes and he said uh you know like what you think I'm a bad guy I'm like no I just some of the things you say I just like I kind of takes my breath away and then we quickly got on the topic of music he said you like all that old Detroit music I go yeah man I mean you Mitch Ryder the Stooges mc5 I mean it's kind of the best is some of the best music I've ever heard I mean as far as I asked I go what is it is something in the water what is it with you Michigan guys in guitar tone like no one gets tone like you Ron Ashton Stooges Fred sonic Smith mc5 huggy you guys I mean you're so good and he said you got a we got a hangout sometime and we'll just talk about music I want I'll do that with you so I'll be taking notes and he was just telling me you know yeah I used to hang out at the mc5 house and go see the Stooges I'm like you can't let me cuz this is like you know I that would have been heaven for me to see those bands like back in 1969 or whatever did you when did you know him did you know him back in the day or two July as a punter I would go see him like in high school in the 1870s Neil Carver administration I'd go see him at play in my local arena in Washington DC in a place called the Capitol Center in Largo Maryland and he was as good as rock and roll gets I mean it was I saw the the double live gonzo lineup and like forget it it was like two and a half hours of just getting beat up by music it was fantastic and to this day it's still a high-water mark as far as gigs and in the 90s I met him on politically-incorrect Bill Maher and I said hey man I'm a big fan and he gave me a bowhunting catalog I'm like well thanks you know for his wack master right yeah you get the croquet mallet in the end anyway I kept it I'm a fan and then I met him years later and I did this radio show like st. Patrick's Day 1997 to crassly promote my next record and I said we met years ago and and we got to talking for like a couple of hours and we it was just about music and I played him some of my new record which he really liked and he between the commercial breaks he was like playing riffs for me we had a little headphone amp and he was sitting across from me on a stool playing I'm like this is pretty cool and so that's the kind of relationship I have with him where I you know you read some of the things he says you're like okay that's really hard to take and but those records you're they're just so good to me and I saw him play in 2000 opening for kiss 2001 somewhere in there and he was great great the tone the playing just fantastic and so he's just an interesting bunch of guys a bunch of guys I mean because like he can finish a sentence he's not he's not he's not stupid he's hilarious he has a steel trap memory but then he'll just say that you know the Obama's a subhuman mongrel like man you don't need to talk like that right because there's people you will inspire to punch some black guy in the parking lot for no reason like something bad could happen if you talk like that to the millions of people who love you like someone will get that message and they'll go south with it and when you're in that position I don't believe in self-censorship but I think you should be careful of what you say I think there's some merit in having some control of yourself and so I don't completely understand the guy this currency and outrageousness that's what it is and you cash in by being the guy that says things you can't I can't believe what he just said and then you become the guy that goes places that says things that no one can believe that you're saying you know I I know that there's some people that's how they get their next book deal or whatever yeah for myself I would never want to trade in that because my reality coming up through punk rock and all of that is very very immediate in that I don't say anything about anybody without expecting them to hear it and with me turning the next corner like going to my car in your parking lot yeah and having that person waiting for me at the car saying hey you said this and having the meal to hold it up on a tablet and say and so I watch what I say cuz in my mind I answer I will have to answer to all of it and so I would never say something we're similarly really well today's a day we're gonna see who can kick whose ass because you know men have this wrong idea that they can't be beat are you kidding yeah anyone can get no jumper hats you think you're tough there's always you know you're in the business of tough guys there's always that tougher guy around there's always a tough guy but more than that it's like you don't most of the conflict that you get in when you talk and shit about somebody like someone like you or I can in an interview and talk shit about someone who didn't go public and you don't think twice about it but then now it extends to social media because actually anybody could do it at any time and it just seems so easy to do but I always tried to think if that person was in front of me how's that treated and if I would if I would say fuck this guy like when he's in front of me then this is a I have a real problem with this person here's a real bad but I would always wait until I was in front of that person and I have waited I've bided my time with people I don't like and you get into a conversation and all I have said you know very calmly III think you're a ridiculous person I think you're a standing walking talking billboard for cowardice sometimes people need to hear that too because sometimes people don't hear that they don't hear that from someone to help the guy yeah but I waited yeah until I was there the only people I'll rip on our politicians like some member of Congress I think is just an inactive waste of food that'll say anywhere hoping you know it'll bring him to me so I can say it to his or her face but for the most part the way I was brought up in the world of music and the street is if you say something that guy will be lining you up for a broken jaw so you better mean it but maybe just wait until you guys are in a room and see what you really want to say because sniping from a windowless room from somewhere or being a keyboard activist that's not that doesn't mean much to me yeah I think you know Ted is the spokesperson for the right in in that he's this contrast in so many ways he's this wild and it used to be long hair he doesn't long hair anymore but long haired guitar player from Michigan I mean he's Ted Nugent he should be this he should be a drug user or something right he should be on tour all the time but he's the opposite it was like doesn't do any drugs doesn't drink any super right wing and he supports you know Second Amendment and guns and he there's he's in this group of any as some very strong beliefs that he really does hold in that group but then comes the outrageous stuff that he says and you would get a mischaracterization of him because of some of the things he says but if you meet him like in person person to person he's a great guy yeah I talk to him all the time that's only been my experience he's a great guy is I've had really cool conversations with him now and I'm a hyper fan of the records I mean it's gospel to me that those records are in my DNA yeah I don't affect I'm with you in that I don't know what fuels those and I just don't you know I'm not here to rip on him I just honestly do not I can't reconcile the conversations I had a super friendly and happy that you're a fan of the guy and and then you you watch some things he says you know on some stage somewhere like wow that's that just bummed that my whole evening like that's like yeah okay but that's you it's the First Amendment go do your thing but like wow that's this currency in that though I really think that that getting that charge out of saying that outrageous thing it keeps the ball rolling in some way well it's not a ball I'd want to roll though I don't want to roll a boy it just doesn't seem sustainable yeah speaking of sustainable I hear you have a Showtime special coming out tomorrow night wow that was a great segue it's pretty good got a radio real radio show yeah yeah just one second Showtime special tomorrow Friday what's tomorrow the Aletta tenth a tenth sorry Friday August 10th 10 p.m. East Coast West Coast Showtime it's called keep talking pal and so the there it is ten seconds on that they said what are you gonna name it and I said keep talking pal they go what does that mean it's just it's how you talk to yourself in and out of trouble like you're about to get punched out like keep talking pal you know if you don't get a laugh you're not getting out of this bar and that's kind of how I came into talking shows was being as a young guy skinny on ritalin not a good fighter not a good fighter at all you know just not into it and you know their local bully said something snarky or funny and all of a sudden he's got me by the scruff of my shirt with a fist in my face and the only thing you can do is like imitate him so much that everyone else laughs and like he has to drop you cuz he's now like drop will drop your collar not your body because you're now making him laugh and so when in doubt keep talking pal and the fact that I have a quote comedy special on Showtime is so unlikely from some guy from the minimum wage working world I don't believe it myself and so they said what are you gonna call it night a lot of these you know people they have a lot of confidence I'm going to call it like destruction me and my mighty Wang take this so like keep talking pal because I know I'm really not supposed to be there so how did you do your first show like what made you do your first talking show five dollars 1983 a little venue on Hudson right off us like about ten paces north of Santa Monica Boulevard it's like a would treat the dead ends on to Santa Monica Boulevard was an art space there called the Lhasa Club and there was a local promoter in town amazing guy and he would get like 25 people on stage in one night everyone gets five minutes and to be the singer of that band the drummer of that band that artist that poet like real artists who speak for a living and then the guy with a funny tourjournal or the guy from the band that we all like and he's gonna be an idiot for five minutes and these shows were really fun cuz it just people on off stage all night long like running off stage and the bass player in Black Flag trucked to Kowski the fet fantastic intellect he would get invited onto these bills I would go with him because we were Beach guys we lived in the sticks and the gigs were in Hollywood so we'll go into the big smoke we'll go see the big city I'd go with him cuz he had the band van he'd go into town I'd tag along so he'd read out of some notebook his apocalyptic rantings and one night the promoter said you got a big mouth next week you five minutes were like whatever seven minutes five bucks all i could think of was the five bucks and like what I could goes we were starving yeah any band was and so the next show I got on stage at Lhasa told a story about what had happened to band practice the day before where I white supremists in a car tried to run over our guitar player because we had brown skinned people at our band practice and so he yell he accused our guitar player of being a babe lover and tried to run him over on his way to the liquor store to get some orange juice so our guitar player comes back a little shaken I nearly got run over by a neo-nazi and let's go back to practice and so for us that was this Tuesday in the life of Black Flag for an audience or like oh your jaw hit the ground and then I read something I'd written I go well my five minutes are up or whatever it was and I left the stage and it felt right I felt like a fish dropped into water for the first time like hey I'm a fish like I didn't have a band but I had no stage fright and it's me and a microphone it felt more natural than music ever felt which was cool to do but never felt natural just felt like is it this thing is in me it's got to come out I'm serving a monster where the talking shows like yeah this is me and after the show people came up and said what's your next show I said well I'm leaving on tour no no no when you're just talking I said well no that's a one-off I got this five dollar bill I'm out of here and so the agent that the promoter guy said okay you're very good at that you're a natural so how about this I promote all these different poets and performance artists I'll get you I'll give you 20 bucks you'll do 20 minutes opening for this guy okay so I'd you know did 20 minutes and then after a handful of those shows those poet types were opening for me because the Black Flag aspect kicks in like hard to do from Black Flag people show up and I guess I was good enough and so those poets weren't that happy like I'm now opening for this guy okay and that was 83 turning into 84 by 85 I had gone to Europe for some poetry festival which I kind of blagged onto in Holland I had done a cross-country tour 12 to 50 people a night sleep on the promoters couch go by Amtrak and started my little book company our 83-84 self-published to this day that's awesome and they went from strength to strength and now it's a 14-month tour that takes in 20 countries multiple nights and cities at nice theaters do you only use yourself for your publishing company or do you publish anybody else's books we used to Wow many years ago we people I knew who I thought were great writers I put them out we license Nick caves books from his publishers in Europe we licensed a few different titles we did photo books and a couple of novels short story collections and it's very hard to have a book company it's hard to sell a book in the world unless it's like Stephen King or Danielle Steel likes mega you know at the at the cash register at the airport store if you're selling poetry books different kinds of literature you are nothing but uphill my books did okay they still they always do okay everyone else's books is like trying to sell dead animal guts you know what I mean like no no one's that interested they look but they don't want to take it home and so we stopped signing new writers sold through the the press runs let the licenses run out everyone got to keep their masters and then we just concentrated on me because I keep a whole staff busy with all the stuff I've got going and so we publish but we published me and I've done a bunch of books how many boys you written about twenty seven holy shit I got nothing else going on all but two of them we I wanted to do a photo book a few years ago and Heidi who runs all my company she's the smart one so I showed her the manuscript she goes okay the book is great but let's not do it on our company cuz it's a lot of startup money for a photo book it's just a lot of set-up cost let's get you a literary agent and do it somewhere else and so it's a smart idea and so we got a literary agent and we did get a book deal with a very good Chicago as a Chicago company Chicago review I'm forgetting and they put out the photo book and that was a learning experience like working with an editor like oh well here's the cover like well we're gonna have a meeting about that I'm like you're having a meeting it's my book it's my book cover so I'm used to write owning my own machine but when you work with other people's money everyone has a big opinion so that that book came out and did and continues to do very well and many years ago I did a kind of a best-of if you have any best of material I did a best of four Random House many many years ago that you still see it's in print and that's a lot of people's first book of mine because it's in stores we pulled my company's books out of circulation because of Amazon because they can actually sell it cheaper than we can because they don't mind making five cents on a book because they're selling 80 billion books a second so we pulled ourselves out of distribution and now it's very much the website and it live shows and we have less returns we don't get a pallet of damaged books coming back that were you know abused in some book store in a shopping mall in the Midwest like heavily thumbed but never taken home so you can't buy your books off Amazon unless the third party seller right and on your own yep and you might not sell as many but you don't get 1100 returns you got 1,100 well you know what you know well when we were selling everyone else's books to get like a pallet of like books it look like a dog to them or like remainder stickers it is what it is and so I am extraordinarily small of Fame I sell lots of books they they're they do great as ebooks as well in fact that's kind of overtaking I'm not an e-book guy I like to take a marker and mark books up and so I buy paper ones but apparently the real world likes to read on their tablet and so all my books are on that platform thanks to Heidi and apparently they sell very well I don't keep track I just write them I don't count them if yet I suggest to somebody a good book of yours to start with what would you say to start with like I was gonna read your books which I start with oh I would tell you to read blood meridian by Cormac McCarthy oh just tell you read a real writer get in the van my tour journals from Black Flag is just a people like that book it's in a bunch of different languages it's just a cool insane read of like living this very feral life when you're fighting with and music and relative poverty so that's a fun one to start or I like the travel books I've been writing the last few years Ivy's I write when I travel all over the world and so I write these books from these places like from a ship in Antarctica from a tent in the deserts of Timbuktu and those travel books I like quite a bit and a dull roar they always have an AH an a at the beginning a dull roar I'll have to come up with the rest of the names your sort of your manic dedication to work is very inspiring like it makes me feel like I need to work more like when you're writing all the time and doing all these things like you're one of those guys it's like it feels like you're always with your foot on the gas yeah I'm kind of furious for work yeah I don't it's it's not what it's what I do but it's also what I don't do in that I don't have a family and I'm not putting it down I just don't have that I'm just not chipped that way I'd never thought of having kids I don't have a wife I don't have friends really I most of the people I know either pay a salary or a commission - my phone doesn't ring my old best friend from since I was 12 in makai of the band Fugazi he and I talk every Sunday if possible but past that my phone usually doesn't ring unless it's an interview or Heidi going hey you're late get over there is that good it it is what it is it work for you like it's all it's all I know I've been that way since I was five but they're the no friends part well I don't I'm not looking for enemies I'm not looking for right of course I just don't want to come over on the weekend for dinner no no III have a good time at dinner was something I'm just uncomfortable that I'll say the wrong thing and I just act like look at the table full of people go act like them you should be friends with comics cuz you can't say the wrong thing cuz no one cares yeah but then you have to then they'll call say hey come out with us we're going then you have to go you don't have to go deadbeat I'd be a deadbeat friend that's fine I'd never want to go with anyone to do anything you don't have to but but we'll look at all the phone calls I'm saving it sounds like you're managing expectations versus you know like it doesn't sound like you don't like friends it's just you don't want expectations I I you know it's gonna get in the way so well also I'm just kind of Moody and that yeah we're gonna go out and do this thing and then I don't want to see anyone to do anything until 2028 and I don't want to cancel and so here this is my big besides hanging out with you my big social thing is many many years ago 2003 I did a song with William Shatner Bill Shatner on this album and we became pals Henry come by the house for Monday Night Football and he invited me to the house for Monday Night Football he lives a few traffic lights from me and I'm walking up the stairs to the the living room where the big TV is and I heard all this laughter and voices and I froze and I was right at the threshold of the door and I said turn back turn back turn turning back Henry and he saw me and I'm like and I walked in and met all his really cool friends and he at least for me bill is one of the nicest people I've ever met in my life and it's one of the oddest friendships I have in that I've been going to Bill Shatner's house every year since 2003 so what's that 15 years right and I will be there this year I'm on his next record he's doing another record oh yeah I I did the vocal last year Rocketman this is it'll be fun all I'm not gonna you know this it's for him to announce it but um every once in a while his assistant will contact me hey Bill really wants to see you how about like next do you guys are you free for next Wednesday go meet him and the wife in the valley and go eat I'm like yeah and it's great to see him in his amazing wife and I truly value that friendship I mean I look forward to seeing him I really enjoy hearing what he's up to because it was doing like five things and it's become this thing where I really look forward to football season I don't know much about football I have no idea what a halfback does they run I think they run I've never knew but I like going there and it's always the same group of people people he's known for like five hundred years and they're super nice and I've kind of sort of known them for like 15 years and it's so odd because I have nothing else like that really in my life I'm just a weirdo just William Shaq man yeah it's weird the other thing I would do once a year and sadly it ended but for a few years I would go to Gail's APA's birthday party on January 1st because I would play a lot of her husband's music on my radio show Frank Zappa and one time someone in the family wrote me and said hey thanks for playing dad on the show I'm like are you kidding I loved those records and then Gayle the mom the wife wrote said hey thank you and you know we know who you are here and we like you I have a birthday party every January first once you come up to the house this year or next next year like he'll and I did and that was like three or four years in a row I did that until Gayle passed away and you know in the more you get there or whatever it is like 2:00 in the afternoon two hours before I'm genuinely nervous to go be in a room full of extraordinarily nice people with fantastically good food and there everyone was always so nice to me and like it's like a who's who you walk in you're like wow it's just all these people you recognize I'm not here to name-drop but some of the tables i sat that thing I'm like really am I really talking to like really is fantastic and she was always so nice to me and like last time I was up there one of my books is like in the living room I'm like wow and when she passed away I wrote one of the family members I said I am so sorry like thank you for the hospitality your mom was so great to me and I'm kind of like the rescue dog I'm used to being outside so I don't come inside very often and I went to that birthday party because they're just the friendliness of that I wouldn't as socially nerve-wracking as those things are for me I had such respect for that extension of kindness I cannot disrespect it by not going I wouldn't dare the samurai in me says you do not destroy you be respectful even if it makes you nauseous with social anxiety because I just don't know what to do I can't say no because it's such a nice thing to do for someone yeah play she must not really know how I am otherwise she never would have invited me so but things like that out of sheer politeness and respect for someone being friendly to me I'm kind of a pushover just because I'm like wow that was so nice I must salute that I think it's so good that you're open about your social anxiety and then about how you feel like being around all these people because a lot of people in the outside they see someone like you you know black flag all your spoken word things your books your fucking I mean I always go back to that the liar song your fucking neck was like the size of my waist and you're screaming you know painted red and like you're this crazy intimidating guy in a lot of ways so to hear you talk about social anxiety and how weird you feel and I think we all can we all feel that I always feel like that I mean it doesn't matter I think no matter how famous you get you if you're paying attention you're gonna have an impostor syndrome you're always going to feel like you don't belong there if you're actually paying attention yeah and if you don't you'll probably you're probably delusional it's some sort of I wonder about the people who don't write like I never I get to do cool stuff and a bit before I go into that the - on your point it's easy for me to be in front of people that's a very different than than being with people I can be the party but going to the parties difficult just put me in front of like five people five thousand people stagefright know I can't wait to be out there your performer type yeah like you love that audience see if they showed up like are you kidding can't I'm a dog with a wagging tail I want to get out there and get it going I can't wait I wait the whole day on tour to get out there the whole day is about eight o'clock you know stage time being amongst people like going to like a gallery event I go see a Shepard Fairey thing or something and people are super nice to me and I'm always polite back but I'm a little nervous but if they say can you get up and speak for five minutes oh yeah I got this it is strange but it's also um it's a way to avoid being with people be in front of them hmm it's a way to be in the room with people just be the center of attention so maybe that's coming from some kind of neediness or some deprivation as a you know what I didn't get as a kid but it that you make a great point about that when you really think well this is where I belong I think you lose all the fun of it yeah and you turn into kind of a jerk so when I every 500 years I go to one of those premieres I get invited and you're standing you're in a room full of tons of really good food and none of those people eats I just like go in there and come out nine pounds heavier bunch of shrimp I just eat but you you're I was at a big Hollywood premiere big big movie years ago and it's like that one that one that one that one and they're all I got it is their lives and I'm with a buddy of mine we blagged in there and we're like what are we doing here this is so cool because we know we shouldn't be here and after shaking Ike Turner's hand ten minutes later I'm back in my own kitchen going that was so weird like what a surreal evening and because my friend and I were staying next to and he said that looks like I turned I go no man that is Ike Turner he looked look like a human barracuda he's like terrifying I said let's go hey we bought a ticket we're at the dance let's go talk to this guy you like no no no no I just walked right over there I said you invented rock and roll rock at 88 anyway yes I did it shook my head Wow when I say first ever distorted guitar on tape which is kind of true anyone that's right and I fluffed him up and he was all happy to meet me and I said hey and here's my friend I brought my friend over and we shook his hand and kind of stood with him for a minute and went okay so it's probably not gonna get any better for us so let's get out of here so we eighths a few more handfuls of mini burritos and we bail but it was one of those nights like we weren't supposed to be in there and if I ever lose that yeah then just never talk to me again because I'll just my head would have disappeared a part of me with that anxiety and that insecurity is a big part of the fuel that keeps everything moving super fuel for me you analyzing yourself yeah and anger yeah I'm mad at I I like fighting and I'm not fighting like in a ring for me a lot of things are confrontation like tor is what you think I can't do 47 shows in 48 days no actually my next door is 47 and 47 I have a day off and I have two shows a few days later in one day so um you think I can't well then book twenty more 200 more in the winter and just give me a llama and a knife and I make every gig like watch this and and that's so much of what fuels me like yeah and like I come up with these ideas for books like that's gonna take me five years to write it and it did and I just finished it it's going to the proofreader sue not this epic project it's it's a series of music books it's four hundred and seven thousand words well yeah it's a bit much but but so am i it is this idea pages it's a I don't know it's a lot it's mostly on our hard drive so we don't have to like DeForest some Park but it was an idea I had I say okay this is gonna take a lot of years to execute this idea and so like watch me work seven days a week on this thing watch me stay up until the next day working on this thing and a lot of what fuels me that's what gets me into auditions like I think you know like a go audition for this TV show I'm not an actor so am I going yeah I'm going and I sit in that hallway like 20 years older than all these other people they got the good jim body zonic fantastic hair chiseled bodies and they all know each other like this weird old man go for the same part the only guy not dipped in Cologne I'm like oh man and I go in there and I bomb of course I get my parking fast validated and like listen to Slayer on the way home take the lump out of my can you do that I often you are auditioning for depends if I'm in town and there's interesting things happening more and more as I don't know what's happening but I take more meetings and just get more offers like hey we like you for this yes or no cool yes but there's auditions I do for voiceover for like animated or like car ads or what-have-you and acting I I auditioned for all kinds of things and every great once in a while the audition will writ get work but mainly I just get offers we like you for this it starts in October I'm in and that happens fairly often now but I get in those lines it at any major studio you want to imagine or I go in for the meeting with a casting person they kind of look you over but I do those raw auditions where as you leave and you see like five headshots on a desk it is what it is and you get literally you're out of there in about 35 seconds you walk in your Henry Henry are you ready sure you have any questions no stand on this piece of tape she'll be reading with you and you know thank you very much for coming Punk and you leave the trailer and you get back on the 101 and go home and you never hear from them again often for me most the time out of a hundred of those 98 times I think that's for everybody except putting it down but I I'm gonna saying you asked about auditions hell yeah I go in there I think that's one of the things that makes actors so fuckin weird is not just that they need attention in the first place where they hold no law they get told no a lot rejection it sucks it sucks and they're already insecure in the first place and then they sort of try to model their behavior based on what they think the casting agents and the producers want here and they change and they developed a style of communicating that's very actory it's a weird way to make your living I mean I've never relied on acting as my source income in 1984 when I was 23 I had a a thing that has been serving me up to sitting here with you now I was very young and you know 23 years of age a young idiot and I looked all around me and all my peers are super talented who are my peers my under threat Bad Brains who's good do the meat puppets the Dead Kennedys I'm just surrounded by really talented people who are brilliant great songwriters and between tours many of them are waiting tables living with mom living on couches you know sleeping at band practice you know with a kick drum a pillow as their pillow just like you know roughing it and I I reckon that I'm less talented than all of them and if they're Waiters between tours the only reason I'm not as black flag never stops touring like where the ball never hit the ground because we'd starve and so I better get plans BCDE F and G ready because musics not going to sustain me ironically it went very well for me and so I was doing the writing so I said I'm gonna really get better at writing I'm gonna really bear down on this the talking shows I'm getting 35 people a night I'm gonna get 50 people a night and then voiceover people started coming like hey can you do a voiceover I got a voice what do you want to put I better learn to say yes to stuff and by the mid-80s hey you want to be in a movie yeah like what do I have to lose except like calories from starving and it was fear of not eating that you know and knowing I better have a plan and so I started developing that in the 80s and 90s and from that came when I I'm done with this I'm gonna go immediately into this documentary and then I'm finishing this radio show and then I'm going off to do this film and then I'm going on tour and then I'm coming back and finishing this book and it turned into this like juggling all these things so I never had to be a full-time actor like that's how I pay the rent that would be terrifying right up there with being a professional comedian like I don't know how someone acts for a living without being really good or out of their minds with anxiety but being a professional comedian at least you write your own stuff so you're kind of in control of that and then you don't have to worry it doesn't seem that rough and then you don't have to pay people like you don't have to pay roadies you don't have a drummer that has to show up also you know have the bass player who you got to get along with like there's so many variables with a band that comedians don't have like we always look at you guys and go wow I don't know how the fuck you guys do it because you there's not as much like you you might do the same size venues that we do but you're splitting the money with all these fucking people yep you know and then a lot of times today the record company gets a piece they get a piece of everything right they get a piece your merchandise you see bands play really big places and it's amazing how much money they don't make yeah or each guy in the band gets like really yeah and then you see you know someone like a small comedian playing like a hundred and fifty seater for two nights two sets a night you know the the laughs whatever in the Midwest and you're like wow wow that's a pretty good weekend like cuz he's just taking it home in his suitcase yeah you can get by you get by yeah and you can work you could work everywhere you know for a band I think it's more the venues are more more limited places you go or more limited you know and I think that's interesting that you're it was almost like a desperation to not have to work a job as a waiter that kept you just hustling what did you know I just knew that the straight world had been in it I come from it you know minimum wage work and everything and I knew I couldn't survive in it because I you know you get as a young adult you start to figure out who you are and I go okay I'm not an artist but I'm an artist type I'm an I'm nuts you can't put me in a straight job I can pass for normal just because I can't ask it I can totally do it like you could put me in a Ralph's of Kroger's a Starbucks I will totally get in there and hit the work and clean it all and serve it up with a smile but I'll be going crazy inside I will be punching everybody in those places is going crazy inside I don't know but um I can't sustain in that and I haven't had to for many years I've been lucky I've been in the world of lunatics since 1981 you know being a crazy person out with other crazy people and when I look at a straight job I'm like man I don't think at this one I could hack it not cuz I'm spoiled just because I've never had to tether my adult mind to that I work seven days a week but on Henry stuff yeah it's me it's not it's a different thing it's a different thing yes you enjoyed that work yeah and it's it's way over 60 hours a week I mean it's I do two shifts usually to eight to ten hour shifts depending on every workload well I can't do four hours of sleep at night but I usually I time I sleep I hit the stopwatch on the phone before I go to bed just this clock sleep patterns I did about six points something hours of sleep last night that's good it's good I feel great today I barely ate and I got in a good workout and all last night I did a lot of pull-ups I played 15 7-inch records and between flipping them over I got a beam in my living room it's a beam coming out of the ceiling that supports me and I just run over there and just do a bunch of pull-ups and then go change the record so you want more music you have to pay them pay and doing all this by yourself all alone yeah but by bedtime you are hurtin and ready to sleep so I got good sleep last night so you mix the workout in with your enjoyment of music you just space it in between the song yeah last night was pulling tonight at the turntable I'll be listening to more records all I'll just do sets of push ups next to the turntable actually a smart move because like that's probably a good interval of rest like get a good hard workout in and then you listen to a four-minute song yeah but I do it all night and it's just I'm not doing 50 sets 50 rep sets I'm doing like 15 to 25 but I'm doing them for quite a while by the time I go to bed it's advil time I'm like do old for this but um I work on something every day on tour I don't take vacations I'm not trying to brag I just can't I can't have you not doing it whatever the thing is yeah well you found an interesting way to live life I don't know anybody like you but it's working for you yeah it works on all levels in like I I can sustain I pay my bills I'm not bored and I get for the most part to call my own shots and you seem happy happy when I'm working yeah yeah happy with the task yeah I value work I'm an achievement junkie like if I'm depressed I just pick something to do like finish a radio show edit this thing transcribed this chapter from a notebook and after I'm done I'm like okay that's the antidepressant was actually doing something which is not the worst it's not booze it's not a pill it's the treadmill yeah or it's the that damn thing I got to get it written well shut up and write it yeah when I'm done it's like an endorphin thing where I'm great for another day there was an article written about happiness and those one of the things they said that one of the things that seems to sustain people's happiness or facilitate happiness is accomplishing tasks like setting goals for yourself accomplishing those goals and getting this sense of completion yeah you've actually done the work and you did it and you discipline yourself and got through it and that this is one of the major keys to happiness for a lot of works for me totally works for me cuz I'm as well I've tried everything but drugs so I've been battling with depression since I was a little kid you know I just knew it what is this it's just awful and you know later I found out was depression and I don't want to do drugs I'm not I just don't want it my brain plus drugs it's like someone else's idea it terrifies me so I had to figure out what and so that's where the gym you're working out really is a big help writing but listening to music that is like kind of my drug you know I just put the records on and like three songs in you're like oh there's that feeling buoyancy neutral it's like floating in the tank or when you're scuba diving you get their air just right you're floating that's how I feel when I have the music on I'm like ah this is as good as it gets and that's why I always have you know record I'm always looking at new records going to the record store it's more happiness coming in does the exercise work better or the same as work like for managing depression the workout is maintenance it doesn't achieve much but you I achieved the workout but do you feel like the the endorphin release does that help you yeah yeah it does and I I as the Buddhist say I made merit I I went in there and did my time on the treadmill I don't want to be there you know yeah it's like the last 15 minutes I don't I'd rather be somewhere else like you know it's cool you'll be fine sit out do your work that's why before the podcast I was suggesting hot yogurt you and you you seem to be very stiff lately you've got some injuries and some things yeah yeah dude I'm telling you that'll fix a lot of that shit oh really yeah I know you you have you have a great workout diversity you when you and I were talking before we were at your place and you said some mornings you feel like training this way and you'll go to that gym where you'll train like wood judo or whatever and then the next day it's gonna be kettlebells so you really like to mix it up I think it's good for a body to always be guessing what's coming next yeah I think that's important I also there's some things that I really have to do I think I need at least one day of hard cardio a week and I think I need at least one day of hard lifting weights a week but I also think I need at least one day of yoga week at least Yoga is to me it's one of the most important things that I do because for that 90 minutes I can't go anywhere I don't touch my phones on in the room with me this is me and a jug of water and the yoga mat and the class and a bunch of old ladies that are kicking my ass these ladies are fucking tough man this old lady she goes to this workout class me I see there all the time she's got to be close to 70 she doesn't even bring water she just toughs it out she's there for 90 minutes sweating and grunting through the postures and those loud you doin an hour-and-a-half class those last 20 minutes in 104 degrees it's so hard to get through but when you get through you just feel like you feel better I just like almost like you can't while I'm in it I can't wait to do it again like while I'm struggling and I was like god I need to do more than this I need to do this more often rather I can't wait to do this again I always feel that and it just lengthens everything like all the back things and the leg things the hamstring things just stretches everything out lengthens it and all the tension it just straightens it out and loosens it up and I just feel like for a guy like you or I who does a lot of a lot of like especially used to a lot of heavy lifting you were saying a lot of lifts and squats this is the antidote for all that stuff it's decompression and and for your body maintenance it's just a phenomenal probably let's lose the lactic acid out of your muscle tissue oh yeah yeah you know here's what I've observed you know I live in Los Angeles so there's a lot of yoga people yeah but yeah I know them because they have a mat mm-hmm but you could also see how they walk how they sit there so in their body yeah and there is a a grace too you know I'm not I'm not trying to put anyone in the pejorative but a yoga person where there's not only are they limber they're just really okay though this their body articulation you're like okay I don't have that I'm a herky-jerky uncoordinated person but there's a a hum coming from that person's overall body it just it's a beautiful machine the way they articulate themselves and the way these sit like why unusual balance the balance of like the bee would tell someone who does it they have that yeah and it's not subtle I recognize you would love it man you know what you would love it cuz it fucking sucks and while you're doing it man you have the internal dialogues crazy you want to bolt well you want a ball but you also start going over your life and your mind and dealing with all your bullshit and your to-do list and all the things you're doing wrong or slacking there's something about really struggling in these static positions for like a minute where you're trying to like hold your leg up there and your sweat sweat is literally pouring off your arms and your head and there's something about that man that it's just really cleansing it just really empties you I just think it's a thing that you're missing that you would really love if you tried I bet if you did it and they came back we did a podcast year later it was like fuck yoga I fucking love it it's changed my life it's changed my life yeah I know a lot of fighters a lot of people who like are hectic for a living yep they're yoga people yeah and like in the seventies you say yoga someone's gonna punch you yeah like you'll go wham well you know what I found out about it you know Hicks and Gracie is well I'd are we talking about the Gracie that the family well the family hoist Gracie's the most famous because he's probably the most important figure ever in the history of martial arts because he won the first Ultimate Fighting Championship and showed that a small man can actually beat larger men with technique and skill well his brother is Hickson and his brother is like universally regarded as one of the greatest jujitsu guys if not the greatest of all time and he was different than everybody else and that he did yoga like his thing was like I've never heard of a martial artist that got into yoga but Hickson would do these breathing exercises and he'd do these balance beam exercises and he was always doing yoga and stretching and it was a giant part of his workout and he was above and beyond everyone else in his time period like in the 90s everyone was scared of Hickson he was the man I mean it wasn't like there was any debate it's very rare that you get something that is so antagonistic and so tightly contested as two men using martial arts techniques trying to strangle each other and one guy stands above all by such a large margin and that was Hickson and I really do believe that part of it was his mind part of it was his physicality but a lot of that physicality was enhanced by his dedication to yoga yeah he's a legit yogi like he does that fire-breathing shit where he sucks his stomach in in that weird way and has it move up and down Wow you ever see someone do that yeah does that like a like a real yogi look it's it's a real trip and I think because of his his is like physically like he could see you there he's good he's got this video here you could see him do this fire-breathing shit like watch what he does in this stomach because it's kind of fucking crazy he sucks his stomach way way way up deep into his ribcage he does this Breath of Fire thing and then as it gets going he starts pumping his like here you see it if you pull it up there Jamie the part where he starts to do it look at this wow yeah like what the fuck in that insane yeah it's crazy and this is one of the things he has abdominal muscle control yeah who gets that do you never try and articulate make it do any yeah well he you know he'd practice yoga for a long long long time and because of that he had this phenomenal core strength and phenomenal balance and he just had a giant advantage over everyone else and I think a lot of that advantage was his his ability to move his body was different but it's also just for a guy like you that's been just lifting weights for so long it's the perfect antidote for your body it's like your body will react to like oh yeah stretch this out thank you thank you been asking for this yeah you know but lengthen this hold that pose this is instead of just lifted something up you know which is like what men like to do instead of that you're holding your arms out there like that you like fuck I don't even have any weight in these things and I want to drop them yeah I did a you know every once in a while I've worked out with someone else I think okay we're gonna do this and this and then you work out with and they you let them you let yourself be trained yeah and I've done a few workouts like okay I'm gonna kill you I'm like okay what does that mean like by the end of this you won't be able to take your shirt off to change and I've done you know where you're benching this much than this much than this much you need to do like a hundred and fifty reps and by the time you can't lift the bar and you can't lift your arms you're literally trembling from exhaustion and I've told that to people they go that's yoga you will tremble from exhaustion and you'll be so happy when you leave because of how could you feel and you can't wait to go back and you won't blow your joints out the way you will with night lifting I already have yeah there's no one around I've paid yeah you know I did a thing the other day on on advice of Heidi the manager and Joey Diaz I tried that cryo cryotherapy yes and I am not I'm I'm a man a Sayer in lower-case I understand why would work and I'm not saying it's quackery but I just feel like I'm in an Annie Hall scene when I walk into these places like because it's like super hey we're that whatever therapy and I'm moonlight and this is it and then like you shake the guy's hand need a mere breaks your arm these people are in incredible shape and so I said okay you know I got in the robe and I went into that room for two minutes and 45 seconds and the endorphin rush it's like a UPS truck of endorphins yeah you come out of there like wicked like and since I got out of it all I've been thinking about is going back in in the parking lot I just wanted to turn around and get another shot and I asked the guy at the counter like what is that goes it's endorphins it does unleashes them like fight-or-flight you just get this rush I said I want to go back he's come and see us again sometime but um it was incredible and it's not long like you're out of there before you know it ten minutes you're in and out yeah Wow it yeah and I know that a lot of athletes and I know that you use it Joey Diaz but all the on their brochure apparently all these sports teams like it's just part of what you do but one thing that has been proven to do there's a lot of naysayers when it comes to this even scientists apparently that don't exercise but people that do exercise and do try it all pretty much universally regarded as being beneficial but one of the things that's been shown in clinical studies is that it reduces and produces more anti inflammatory bodies in the blood it's most yeah so it does reduce inflammation in your body and it just but I think just for the mood elevation it's worth doing I mean it does say that norepinephrine that you get when you get out of there it's it's unbelievable you get that it wasn't subtle it was like wow and the Sun feels great in your face and you get outside you like everything felt great yeah I don't do much on as far as stimulants like coffee and aspirin I guess so I'm not even sure what the effect is if anything and so it doesn't take much to make me go well that's different you know what I mean yeah and that I walked out back to the parking lot like damn yeah that was fantastic dude three and then I take ten minutes off and then I do three again so I do two sessions yeah I do two back-to-back so you go in the body warm with three minutes do three minutes and then my body warms back up to like once your skin temperature gets around 84 degrees I'll let you get back in there and then I go back in there again for another three minutes so wait how many in like you'll go into this place three minutes and then I wait for ten minutes and then go on for another three minutes so you two to session is two sessions in one visit yes yeah and how many times how often how many times a month whenever I can but I've been mixing it up more with sauna I've been doing a lot of sauna lately I kind of like that as much if not more awesome yeah sana sana seems to be really good for muscle injuries there's something about the sauna for anytime they like muscle tissue or soreness or weird shit sauna just blows that all out and so on is also one of those things that it's what it is is your body reacting to extremes right whether it's extreme cold or extreme heat your body produces heat shock proteins and cold shock proteins and all those things are doing is reducing inflammation that's that's the number one thing like you want to feel better reduce inflammation and this one of the best ways to manipulate your body is either through car cryotherapy or through sauna both of those things are amazing yeah someone I know that she says it's all about inflammation you gotta beat the inflammation yeah cut out all the sugar cut out all the carbs cut out all the bread cut out all the alcohol if you can do that you'll massively reduce inflammation yeah that's four Gospels all that there's nothing good in there for you yeah man once your body gets used to it - that's what's really interesting you didn't even really crave it anymore like I still like ice cream I still enjoy like a dessert or something like that but it doesn't have this impact he's still like I see a sandwich and I go oh get that sandwich look at that pastrami sandwich big thick bread and that doesn't do it for me anymore I know it doesn't I recognize what that is like oh that's a trick that's a trick that's not I'm really food yeah I I don't eat as much as I used to I just feel so much better when I just skip the middle meal and like whose idea was it three meals a day anyway you don't need that right now and I found that I can live very comfortably I'm not into like torturing myself like I'm gonna starve and nail myself to this chair but you know if I'm to just too distracted to work as I'm hungry I need to address that but what I have found is if I just kind of don't eat a lot after a couple of days I'm like a jet in the high air where you're burning no fuel because you're just in the thin air where I walk by food gone like dad I've had like two meals in the last two and a half miles like in the last three days and I feel fine actually I feel like really bouncy like I don't need the the post-workout 7 minute power nap i I'm feeling really good do you do intermittent fasting at all um yes on the the woman I work with you know Heidi she does that sometimes and I'll just follow her lead so she'll go hey I'm doing this I'll try that cuz I just don't know this stuff and she knows a lot more about it than I do so I just do what she does and so a few years ago I didn't do like one meal a day I was just trying it out no one told me to I was in India of all places and I was out all day taking photos and sweating and I would eat dinner and that would be it and I would like to sleep through breakfast and go back out and with my camera so dinner became my meal in the first three days of that was a little tough and then it was like I never wanted I kind of felt bad when I went back to the Western yeah boy I'm eating a lot of food your body adapts yeah yeah well we can adapt you can live on pizza for the rest of your life very happily Paul you know whatever but your body really does adapt to that intermittent that time will not say will adapt to anything it'll DAP to too much food and will adapt to like a frack of what you used to eat right here but just here's what I have found when I start limiting the food I'm more alert my sleep is more restorative and I bounced out of bed like I'm just flying out of bed I don't have that afternoon drowsiness I just stay with it and I just feel way more buoyant and present yeah type faster just concentrate more and if I when I'm on tour it's usually I do 1 point something meals a day like I'm about to leave on tour it'll be it's an evening meal post-show I put myself into an 8 hour feeding window and 16 hour or fasting window every day ha and I've been pretty consistent with that over the last like four or five months and as it has a big impact man when you when I eat dinner you know say if I'm done at 8 o'clock of just I just time it out 16 hours later is when my first meal comes I can have a coffee in between now and then but nothing with like any real significant calories I'm just having some liquid or something like that and that's it and then it just by doing that man it's just like I wake up in the morning I'm not craving breakfast I'm not I'm not even hungry my body's just totally adapted to it yeah it just gives you body a chance to digest I think we're always in the state of feeding and your body just never has really a chance to digest I'll sort of juggling you know the body's like as its processing its incoming like really another order it never gets to realize digestion like we're done it's always you're like a cow yeah they're always processing nutrition yeah and I wonder if that's a Western model yeah because in other parts of the world people live very differently than we do yes it is what it is and a meal is it's almost just a thing that happens now and then it's not like it's dinnertime and we're gonna talk about report cards and gathering it's like the whole family works all over the city and they're gonna eat I think at some point where everything even sleep you go to like parts like Vietnam and people are just like sleeping behind the counter of the store they work at because they've been for a day and a half right cuz mom can't come in so there were you running the store and then sleep is this thing that you get now and then and I think food is like that in a lot of parts of the were like a meal yeah the next time I eat it'll be the next time I eat when you go to these places and I know you travel pretty much all over the world yeah do you go out of your way to try to sample in as wide a variety as the local cuisine as you can no no depends on where I go and I'm not that guy who just brings it all from home and I never leave home when I'm abroad but I can't afford to eat a bad meal and be bedridden bedridden for the next day when I should be out hitting the streets looking at stuff and so I've had you know as you do you run into the bad meal where you're like hugging a tree watching the arc of vomit like wow Linda Blair and I've done that from here to my and Marc and Russia where ever I've had some bad meals and so when the food looks dodgy like in the interior of Africa when you pointed the meat object and go what is that and the guy will say I think it's goat just because I just can't and so what I've learned to do and it's hard on your back cause it's a lot of weight I take say I'm gonna be out in Africa for two weeks I bring about two meals worth of chow with me that's a lot of nuts a lot of Clif bars a lot of like peanut butter you know things that just don't go bad in heat where I can just look at the food YUM no not tonight it's gonna be a handful of almonds and this and water also in parts of the world where waters dodgy you'll find a store you buy the box of water rip it open to make sure it hasn't been tampered with by the whole box put it in your backpack and lug forty pounds of water for the next five days it sucks but you you can't be somewhere and go like I I'm thirsty and I don't know about that water because I thought that you know they have these portable backpack filters and steri pens and things that a lot of backpack hikers they use they're they're very small now they're very small and lightweight and you can get some like if you're staying in a place and you think it has dodgy you can get a gravity filter we put water like you could literally get rainwater from outside in the puddle and I know a lot of people do that and they take it and they put it in this large gravity filter in a drip down almost like it looks like someone's peeing at the bottom of this huge bag a 60 liter bag of water but it filters it all and it allows you to drink basically puddle water right no I've never gotten that high-tech I've I've been into some pretty dodgy places but I've always been somewhere in prep like a city before I go into the country Sun where I go okay it's gonna be 5 days before I see anything like this again so I'm provisioning for 8 days that's a good thing but you Google SteriPEN you should get one of these things cuz this this thing is so simple it's like it basically looks like a pen and it works with ultraviolet light and you put it in water like say if you have a glass of water you just stir this in the water it kills everything in the water everything Wow yeah it'll still give us this but there it is right there so there's Buffalo piss and nothing it's just gonna smell like Buffalo piss yeah but it's gonna kill you and it won't give you Giardia and it won't give you anything else well that's smart yeah and it's not big it's a small little device you see it this handheld again these those are drug that's smart yeah yeah yeah cuz there's parts of like mainly Africa where you go really in the water like that's a lot of mosquitoes locals drinking likes clearing the larva out of the way my dog do that like what do you mean that's that's our water my good friend Justin Wren he runs a charity called fight for the Forgotten where they build wells for the pygmies in the Congo and he's had malaria three times going over there yeah and he's a beautiful human being like this guy sacrifices so much he's in the Congo several months out of every year tough play it's very dangerous it is very dangerous and you know he's got some crazy stories about it too but I bet you know these people they like you see little children with horrible distended bellies cuz they're filled with parasites and it's heartbreaking a lot of it is clean water and so they're developing their there initially partnering up with water for now he's kind of doing it all on his own but in through this one of them are sponsors called the cash app and through the cash app they they we've already raised thousands of dollars to build several wells in the Congo and we're constantly like raising more money and building more wells and you know it changes their life they have free actual clear water that comes out of ground you see these people celebrating and dancing when the wells get turned on like this is so powerful you just think of water it's like hey here's some water I got a bottle but to them it's it's everything yeah I've been working on and off with a water NGO for many years called drop in the bucket and I've been to Uganda and South Sudan with them they drill at schools and you know as a westerner of water is just that thing we sing in the shower with you know it's just like it's always around you know you trip over the bottles there's so much water right in other parts of the world as you know not so much and when you when you see the impact of water on the school there's so many things you don't think about and so I was at this one school where they had drilled drop in the bucket had drilled like before and we were there to visit the well and meet the kids in Misaka it's I think north of Kampala and what one of the wood drop in the bucket people says like they now have toilets and running water do you understand what that means for female literacy like mmm what do you mean a woman a girl it's a certain age she goes through a major major physiological change there's not running water in a way for her to clean herself up there's a lot of potential shame and self-consciousness you stopped going to school because there's not a way to keep yourself together and you stop your learning stops at young adulthood but with running water and a way to you know as we Westerners do so you know easily you keep yourself hygienic and you can go back to class and learn to read and I was like I did I never would have thought of that had I not come on this trip and it hit me like a truck because you just think water I'm thirsty water means so much more just dignity you know I want to be clean you and me we throw our clothes in the laundry every day clean clothes I mean you see these women walking eight miles each way with the jerry cans of water so that's for drinking a lot of it's for cleaning clothes because they're sending their kid to a school and want the kid you know a human dignity water and all of that is a big you know you can't have dignity help of water because water means I don't stink right and you must take me you must respect me as a person because I don't smell like I've been living in these clothes for a week and I learned a lot of that by traveling but traveling with that NGO was a you know like going this class it was huge yeah man that's that's that's yeah that's something I never would have considered yeah in human dignity you know you it's why we have a lot of angry people in the world because you and I as Westerners we don't suffer there's a lot of indignities that we don't suffer that a lot of people in the world work hard to not suffer like they have to go like okay have to go get the water today you know that's a long long trip gotta walk to Long Beach impact to get the water because there's no tap and I got kids and you know infants and I got to make this work because I can't have my family stinking and I got to do the cooking and hopefully you don't get eaten by a crocodile by a monkey the the monkeys they smell the water a name they mug you for the water really yeah they just a salt you know bite and they grab the water knock it over and just lick it off the ground yet people get assaulted in dry season by monkeys Wow yeah so these were creeps but just you you see what people do they're not trying to be rock stars all they want to do is what you and I do just without even thinking twice and that you know it's made me as an older guy I'm pushing 60 it's made me really reconsider human relationships like our current political climate the way people talk to each other now it's sometimes kind of terrifying and it makes me really reconsider human dignity respect patience like there's a lot of people I disagree with but they're coming from something real like something very real they're an honest propelled them to make that sign or to do that thing and the cause and effect I think there may be wrongheaded but the cause is real and the effect is sincerely the action is sincerely held that the motivation and it's that kind of travel and looking out looking at how people they don't want much they just want to get by by and large and it's maybe reconsider kind of how I believe ooh with everyone out in the world I think I'm getting better at it because it's so hard it is hard but I think if you pay attention to it and you keep concentrating on it as you get older you do get better at it and the idea that someone who's almost 60 is still learning like that is just how we are you know and we have this weird idea that people are static and they that you know you meet a guy in a 70 when you meet him when he's 75 is gonna be the same guy if not worse but no people they're capable of growth as long as they're alive yeah and and motivated I mean you'll you'll grow as much as you want yes and I've met 70 year olds who wear me out like I can't keep up with this right like I go on some cool eco travel trips you go like Antarctica and these over come on you're like I can't you go take the photo or short and then you meet people or 22 and they're so burned out yeah and there's so hard to be around like man if I had your youth I'd be like bouncing off the planet what are you doing and it's just a mindset and you know all kinds of surrounding factors and forces but it's really just what you want to do at a certain part of your life I have very little sympathy for adults in that you're 35 this is all you pal your addictions your crap marriage that's all you yeah like I don't have that much well I did so much coke I don't have a house anymore that's a lot of coke and I'm sorry that you're living in a box or in a van down by the river but come on man that's a long hill you slid down yeah so get up and don't do it don't make the same mistake but adults come on man you know who you are at this point and you you know what you can be and at this point I I abhor rudeness I hate it and I hate when I'm rude my dam I have to punish myself and so I as I get older I'm working as best as I can to be more clear to be more polite and more patient just so I'm more it unavoidable like on stage I don't curse so there's no way you can marginalize me even but you're doing your your live speaking shows are you having these discussions and you're talking about crazy things that you've seen you don't swear how many times have I sworn in this room with you right now on that today I don't think you have I haven't I keep track why is that many years ago almost 10 years ago I was going out with a woman who never cursed and I work with people who don't curse and I the you they get their point across and I this girl I was going out with she's fantastic and she never cursed and my sailor speak I was like wow I don't have any company here and also Barack Obama and presidents you know traditionally don't curse but he's had such a good way with words I just admired him on the stump I'm sure was all written for him but nonetheless I just like how he how the man carried himself and I said I want to be more like that and I was just in Australia a couple of weeks ago speaking and I was on a very interesting panel about me too I was the only male on the panel's fascinating and a guy came up with his kids like hey big fan and I want my kids to meet you and my son's 11 and I want him to come see one of your shows one day I said oh I think he should see me on my next tour here in 2020 well he'll be like what 13 no problem and I'm not saying my show is namby-pamby but I want to be unavoidable where you can't write me off say I'm wrong fine disagree with me that that's fine like oh he's just a foul-mouthed so we don't have to take him seriously I don't want to give you that handle to jerk me around mine I have a plenty of other handle so you can turn around by yeah and so I'm just trying to not give people that angle and it forces me to evolve my point of view where those words are fun and hyperbolic but they just don't insist you don't serve me right they don't get across what I want to get across that's interesting yeah I would think that you're probably best but you should do it any way you want but what I'm what I'm thinking is that what one way to use those words is to have your point as clear as possible and then use them rarely you know like one of the things when I was starting doing comedy back in Boston they would they would call the fuck meter they would say you don't want to go onstage and say fuck every other word because a lot of people use the word fuck in place of the word um you know they're like fucking guys this fucking says to me fucking I don't want to fucking tell you what to fucking do that is you're just this is his poor communication this is a shitty economy of words yeah so that word you've given it you've used it so many times you've given away all its meaning it doesn't mean anything anymore so when you do and I'm like fuck you doesn't mean anything anymore yeah but if you say it like once a year it does right you say fuck you once a year means a lot everyone will believe it yes like oh he's serious but yeah if you just drop it all the time and I you know I believe in the First Amendment but um to me it's a when you use that stuff you come in as one thing but everyone you kind of read the result is you're something else to a lot of people in in front of some people's eyes yeah I mean you certainly limit your digestibility yeah and impact you know I'd rather be articulate than overbearing mm-hmm and I you know I watched the news and some of these pundits are very very educated and they're very very sharp they're pundits for a living they comp they make commentary for a living and they're damn good at it and you're like wow that's a hell of a sentence I might like to be able to have ROC something like that one day and that's that's kind of what I admire as you know I start shrinking with age well as you when you you know it's interesting that the difference between writing something and saying something so as you do your spoken word shows and you have these stories that you want to tell but I would imagine that you probably write out a good most of it do you do that but I mean or do you some of it you just know the story so you just tell the story the way when I'm out in the world I'll be out all day like taking photos or whatever voulez-vous in with the locals getting information then I come back somewhere and I write it up or I'll take you know sometimes you know place like Haiti you don't wanna be outside at noon this Sun will just like beat you up so you find shade make your notes so I'm always trying to make notes and then at night I write it all up a lot of that turns into a book like I use every part of the deer like when I go somewhere I I make soup jewelry a coat every part gets used and so the books come from that but some stories from those travels I mold them over in my mind and I like the the show for me when I'm onstage this can't be mere reportage there has to be something it there has to be an aroma coming from it there has to be a lilt there has to be a something that could Wis 'dom or some kind of melody that comes from the raw information like I took all these notes and got the houses of the Holy album which is just if its component parts but it was mixed together in a way where it's like this beautiful thing and so that often takes weeks well so I saw this what was the story well the guy fell over and but no it wasn't at six weeks of thinking about it it wasn't him he's not this story it's the guy who was watching and did nothing that's the story and all of a sudden the whole angle changes and so I'll mold these things over so I have a lot of time I live alone and so by the time a story gets to the stage it's like a stone that's been rolled and polished hmm and I will there's parts of the valley then sure a Boulevard where at night there's nothing but dog walkers and joggers all the shops are closed I will park in a parking lot and I'll walk about a mile each way talking out loud he's saying the stories out loud and you're looking for you now yeah Henry's practice on his one-man show that's why I don't give the location because you will go WOW I remember that one and I will let my brain hear my voice say them and I'll make edits while I'm walking okay no that's a dead end and and I and I've been doing this for years and I do it on the treadmill in my mind you know like all this like kind of a mumble to myself where people will come over to Jim like are you okay I'm like yeah I'm just you know just say actor and they'll go oh yeah yeah and that that's the kind of preparation I do because I don't believe in warm-up shows like who wants to see your warm-up show I go thanks for your demo like screw you I paid money I want a game and so I only understand come in with the a-game and so I do all my woodshedding alone and so by the time I hit stage it's that story is very evolved and then it continues to every night you know it keeps shading that parts off and it's a chiseled thing of beauty a few nights in yeah I've found that you really can only do so much on the written page or on the screen you have to evolve it in front of a live audience especially things end up which you're essentially doing you pretty much you're doing very I mean I listen to a bunch of your older stuff and it's essentially a form of stand-up you know yep it's like well there's different kinds of music right I mean there's rock-and-roll this blues jazz there's different kinds of stand-up as well yours is a storytelling stand-up yeah and with that it's gonna evolve in front of the live audience well like on my Showtime special tomorrow night tomorrow night at 10:00 by Showtime Showtime you'll hear stories and then I'll keep talking to it is and a lot of that is just storytelling and it is funny I mean but I always leave room in my resume because I don't want to tie myself to comedy because when I'm telling the story about the the the part of wherever with like Bangladesh I was in that wasn't funny I don't want to be in a comedy club with some guy going wait a minute I didn't pay for this make me laugh idiot and so I don't want to be selling a false bill of goods and so sometimes it's quite often it's funny but sometimes it's not but for me events plus if someone didn't if there are no casualties if it was this mirror injury maybe an eye it is pretty funny a week later after the scabs have fallen off it's pretty funny well the thing is also like you don't have a restricted sort of form in which you have to perform in by doing it spoken word style you essentially can do whatever you want yes and I need that freedom I can't be dependent upon to make you laugh all the time right yeah like that this is a thing about stand-up is part of it I really like because it forces you to use economy of words and boil your ideas down into this very clear rhythm where you really keep hammering and with laughs but part of it is I mean and where I get my freedom is from this like from doing podcasts like so I can express myself in ways and get thoughts across where it doesn't have to have any form it can be funny or it can be not it can be depressing or funny and sad or who doesn't have to realize itself in 11-cis right it doesn't have to have an impact like there's the thing about stand-up is that you're always getting your reaction and if you don't get that reaction is not successful you can call whatever you want you say oh this is stand-up but you know I'm talking about stand-up and or I'm talking about things that are tragic in my standup so it's deeper and more meaningful like okay but then it's not really stand-up you know stand-up is funny yep and once it stops being funny then you're doing something else you know you're doing spoken word or you're doing a play or a one-person show or whatever it is right and I would never dare go into a comedy club and do what I do you never do that you never go to like to improv or something like that two times in my life one time the venue I was supposed to be and got knocked out because of a storm and so they said we've moved your show to like The Laugh dungeon and I was in some place in the East Coast with like 80,000 headshots on the wall that little part K stage the PV boxes the PA screwed into the wall and I did my talking show in my audience they're all sitting at these tables going why are we here and on the last big tour in 2016 I don't like nights off they said okay Thanksgiving I said find me a show they said we found you a show it's a comedy club next to a strip bar and there's no backstage there's no monitors it says two boxes in the wall family-owned really nice people and I forget where it was somewhere in Illinois I was a one show one night my tour bus was rumbling away in the parking lot the next night I think it was like three nights of Ralphie May the the great comedian but it was a straight-up comedy club and I went in there and I just kind of did what I've been doing for like the last nine months on the road and a lot of it was very funny and the audience was fantastic and so the owner I came up to the ER I said I played this place again any time thank you so much and he said well you know where we are anytime we loved it we liked you and you're always welcome here and that I don't know if it was my audience for a comedy audience I said how did the show do so it's sold out in a day I mean you know you're your name and um I think but um this is I but I said so the audience you know I recognize these people this is my local comedy crowd they're just they just know you from Sons of Anarchy or whatever so we'll see how you go and it was fine and it turned into like this two-hour laugh riot if I mean it was just great this is super funny you don't have an opening act or anything you just go ready no because I torture him enough that's just me can I ask you a professional question or feel free to edit this out when you're on stage and like you're doing a big theater like we're you're the main guy like a big Saturday night somewhere how long were you on stage for usually an hour and 10 to an hour and 20 minutes okay 70 to 80 minutes yeah okay I was fascinated because I live in a bubble I just do my own thing I'm on stage for like two hours and 40 minutes I bring an opening act and how what do they do between 20 and 30 and how many openers one you sometimes I bring two that's rare but it's usually just for fun so it's 202 people the most and they'll do a total of 40 minutes and then there's a brief intermission this is like me 1 2 3 bang bang bang we go and the show could be 80 minutes 90 minutes and so the whole thing you two hours it's like to point something hours it could be two hours yeah easily yeah but that's the whole night that's all night and are you ever on your own with nobody never ok so there's always an opener yes usually one yes and so that's 20 minutes and 70 to 80 so the whole night is a little less than two hours depending upon the show whether or not we have two shows in a night a short show is an hour and a half which I like a Rock'em Sock'em robots hour and a half like a movie you go to a movie and it's two and a half hours even if it's really good it's like whoa I know you feel out of sitting that's 20 minutes you really feel the lack of editing but an hour and a half is bang bang bang bang bang good night yeah and so how many two night two sets the night do you do often yeah something like that I'll do it pretty often depending about the size of the venue you know some places is a giant place I'll do one show or you know but I've done I've done a lotta especially this last year I did a lot of two shows at night in big theaters and stuff you know oh it's a lot of turn around too cuz it you got to clear out all those people don't get a new crowd in there I just you know I work alone right and I don't have a peer group really if I do I'm not trying to find and I I'm just curious about how other people do their thing cuz I live alone in the tour bus like with you know ya road manager and a bus driver and a merge guy and I have no opener except in Australia there's a rule they want one for one and so there's this opener I've used for years on Australian oh yeah they want you one American one Australia which I really like they these two do that with music you know they don't do that with me when I'm there bring American openers oh well they um with me the last few years like I've gotten to bigger places and my agent has said okay you're gonna have an opener and I've met I've used this guy used him he's done like shows with me for like three tours he's hilarious really Loki's a really nice guy I'm forgetting well I see the guy every three years so sorry it's not in the memory but he's great and he's he's super fun he's real smart and the audience loves him I mean I think he's kind of known but he's great and he just like I don't know 20 minutes whatever it is and then I go do my thing but that's per its in every city in Australia it's like in a couple of places oh so there's and it's like some kind of thing regional rules yeah and that's happened a few times with what I would do music like okay four guys on stage we're gonna have a four person opener like okay men and I kind of like that like give that local band some time or give the local guy a moment in front of his hometown audience or let him tour with me I love that idea but that's the only time and every once in a while is that Bonnaroo once and it was tremendously lopsided it was me and TIG Notaro who's amazing I don't know her very well but I've seen her on stage and she was kind of she didn't exactly open for me but she did like half an hour and I did like an hour it was like and they cleared the tent and then Cheech Marin came on but a Lewis Black was before me like three tent loads of people in one night at Mono Roo and that's the only time I've ever done it it everyone's all be the festival where you're like the 8 to 9:30 guy and then the 10 o'clock guy comes onstage but quite often I'm just on my own on tour and I'm the only thing on stage it's a different thing for me I have to have my friends with me otherwise I get bored like I want like I go on the road like almost everyone I take in the road with me as a national headliner would normally be headlining somewhere on their own like there's no so cool double yeah yeah it's a cool double bill but it's also I want the best guys that I can find and I pay them well to go on in front of me I don't I don't want it to be a bad show by any stretch of the imagination so I try to get the best guys but also by that then I'm traveling with the best guys so we're having fun like we're you know it's it's a it's a weird group like stand-ups there's not that many of us there's like maybe a thousand of us in the whole country that are like real professional comedians maybe 500 headliners in the whole country so there's just not that many of us and so when we we relate to each other in sort of a weird way yeah well there's not many of you yeah it's like when presidents get together there's like four of them they all there kind of chummy because they might be opposed but they all kind of know they're the only people who know that stuff especially when they're out so I just when they're out they heated their time they can relax and they just look like they've been sucked dry by a vampire that's why I noticed wouldn't when Obama welcomed the president-elect Trump to the Oval Office for that 90-minute meeting that Trump thought was gonna last 15 minutes Obama looked like tutankhamun he just like his like skin was so drawn across his face it's like a snare drum my husband so exhausted I think any presidency is constructed over just any president like george w bush was to meet a handsome energetic guy when he got into office but eight years and 9/11 and in the invasion occupation of iraq on the way out his face had fallen his hair had died and i I'm not a guy who hates him just disagrees but the presidency killed that guy I mean I just think the stress cuz you don't get the nice phone call hey the cat we got the cat out of the tree it's like hey we lost eight guys look at that thing you said go it went south well I'm very curious to see how Trump comes out of this cuz he's one of the older guys to get in there I think he's 70 or 71 right and in just in the past year like there's a picture of Bush for two thousand and two thousand see what I'm saying that's crazy it just it kicked his ass and I'm not trying to put him in the pejorative reality it's like when you see those really amazing photos of Lincoln during the Civil War or Lyndon Johnson in those think-tank meetings him and McNamara his face is sliding off his skull because he's getting those phone calls hey we just lost six 600 guys mr. president really sorry to give you this news because he insisted on getting the bad phone call and you see what it does to a human being yeah and I noticed it with Bush and Obama because those were trying times for both presidents I was trying very trying administrations and I wonder what it's going to do to a guy who doesn't take care of himself yeah who is carrying a lot of weight probably nowhere near the best diet and I don't I hope he doesn't have some kind of heart attack I mean I'm not the kind of guy who wants people to die he's but a man you look at him like man you need to listen to the white house doctor get on a plan because they can really rock you they can help you lose 40 pounds by spring of next year and you can really be feel better you look at him you're like man there's someone in the white house who can help you with that like they're paid to get you on the track every morning they could get him up at 5:00 in the morning get him out there and it's not gonna do it he's got to watch Fox News something gotta agree or disagree with those people on the TV he's too bad because the president has all those people who are like ready they're already in there jogging outfits like a dog who wants to go to the park waiting to train him and it's um and a dietician they could like rock those calories how did you wants it I don't think he well you have to apparently drinks like 12 diet cokes a day huh that's one of the things they were saying um would that wind that Diet window you are talking about when you do eat are you eating you have a family yeah is it the dinner table when you're eating at home with that's that's the meal is your family is that meal targeted like nutrition for the kids nutrition for dad I mean do you guys eat smart we the kids actually eat very healthy yeah we've been eating together really healthy since they were babies that's all they're always eating vegetables and you know some healthy meat they eat a lot of wild game cuz I hunt right you know so they really healthy they have it's an interesting thing with kids too if you if you shield them from interesting foods like my eight year old loves kimchi she loves like you know a spicy Korean fermented cabbage which to a lot of kids would be disgusting she loves it she eats like fucking plates of it and because of that she rarely gets sick you know she she eats a lot of probiotics and healthy food so they're always eating fruit and vegetables they've been doing it so they're a little kid we don't stop them from eating candy but I do tell them what candy is and I showed them that sugar documentary and I've talked to them in length about how sugar didn't used to be something that people ate all the time and it's a really recent thing I've showed them photographs of people from like the 1800s in the early 1900s like look what these people looked like they were thin they were different they had a different diet but we just eat too many carbohydrates and it's it's fine every now and then like don't keep it from yourself but understand that this is these are empty calories and they make your body they actually make you tired well the thing I've noticed I look at people when I travel I just find our species is fascinating all over the world you look at people's teeth in parts of the world where sugar and corn syrup is not normal and you see it like these 75 year old women like carrying a couch up a hill and their teeth are these bright white tree trunks that's just like of like they're never gonna fall out of their heads right and like no dentistry you know that no noticeable dentistry and the teeth are gleaming white may be darkened from tobacco or tea but nothing like in the West where their teeth are just getting assaulted by our own diet and you see people of great age with like they look they're just ripped and you look at what they're eating like fish rice vegetables you know and it's all lean smart food and if the sugars are all monosaccharides like fruit sugar mm-hmm you know the occasional banana or orange as a treat but you know the sugars really not in the diet at all maybe rice should add a you know but not like we are doing it numb now no one's ever done it the way we were doing it and no one's ever been as fat you know and then we have these things to shield people from we call it fat shaming you know don't tell someone they're fat let them just be morbidly obese and go through life at a massive risk of heart attack or stroke or diabetes don't say anything because then you'll hurt their feelings meanwhile you you could say something to someone and it might be uncomfortable in the moment hey Mike listen I don't want to be that guy but you got to lose some weight and then that guy could go and look in the mirror and go fuck I really do need to lose some weight and then they'll lose some weight and they'll be healthy and they'll talk to you four or five months later and go you know you fucked my head up that day and because of that I really started changing the way I eat and I'm so much healthier and I feel better and cuz he's your friend my friend Tom Segar and and Bert Kreischer they did this thing last year well two years ago where they did they had a weight competition and one of the things they kept doing is fat shaming each other like ruthlessly and they would use hashtag Berta's fat hashtag thomas fat and they had this weight-loss competition oh and they fucking both lost a shitload of weight I think they both lost between 50 and 60 pounds yeah and they looked fucking incredible but then after it was over Tom was like dude let me tell you something fat shaming works it works it got me off my ass I realized I was a fat fuck and I'm it made me lose weight it doesn't feel good that shaming thing is you like fat shaming doesn't work on people weren't fat okay it works on people who have a problem but don't want to address that problem so you bring up that problem and then they go oh you're making me feel bad by thinking about my problem you're a bad person no you have a weak spot that weak spot shouldn't be there shouldn't you shouldn't belabor it and constantly ridicule someone for being fat but the idea that you're never supposed to bring it up even with someone you care about even in jest or friends busting balls like no no you should bring it up because that that bad feeling is a gift it makes you realize like oh my god I've been remiss I haven't been paying attention to my own physical sovereignty you know I have control over what goes in my body I have control over the amount of calories I take in the kind of calories I have control over how much body fat I'm carrying around and there's ways to fix it yeah I think you should use discretion she's maybe not in line at the supermarket lie yeah you know just but it was funny that to hear Tom just he was getting angry he's like fucking fat shaming works man all these people that say don't fat shame fuck that's how I got skinny fat shaming works yeah until you but you know like again yes don't be rude to someone out in public for no reason an 11 year old to suicide definitely don't do that so yeah little kids is the worst because like their parents will get them hooked on those sugary sodas and once it's the goddamn sodas man I mean that is one of the primary causes for people being fat in this country and just seems so innocuous it's just in a class I'll just drink this it's got some ice cubes no big deal those down so fast man taste on the weekends I I like ginger beer mmm and there that the Bunder Berg's it's the same power as a coke I mean it's a lot of sugar yeah and I buy a 4-pack and I have one bottle of weak Saturday night my big drink like new discipline he's going nuts look at who he's got his drink it's just the best tasting stuff but man it tastes good for a reason it's so sweet and like you just want the next one when you're done but man I and I could drink them all day but I just can't do that to my system so I do one a week that's good discipline yeah but it's like you know you something to look forward to do you have a diet that you follow other than that yeah I mean I love ice cream so I I don't eat it you know I try not to cuz I just my body is slowed down with age I just can't shed pounds but I've never really had a weight problem I've never like oh my god I like loose thirty pounds I've just I don't my metabolism is such where I'm always kind of like a greyhound like it was kind of nervous and what you're always working out as well yeah I have I'm always kind of like doing something yeah and just kind of uptight kind of nervy well you talked the last time you were about the fact that your parents had you on Ritalin from the time you were a really small boy yeah do you think that just like wired you in this anyway I don't know but I I mean I would need a doctor to tell me but it was a it's not a subtle drug especially when you're a little kid but I try and eat as clean as I can because more energy more less need for sleep and not feeling so bad all the time mentally like not feeling I don't want to do anything with a good diet I my I feel better mentally and like I said before I've been struggling with trying to feel okay not at all you need to feel good I just want to be neutral right not just like not in deficit okay to be here that's all I want yeah I'm not asking for much and good I found a good diet really really rocks that where I feel when I do the bad meal like a depression meal like tons of carbs for like a day later I'm just like oh man I'm feeling every byte of that and so I don't want to feel like that so I'm like nope can't do that cuz it's just not worth it so what kind of food you eat like what's a typical meal for you today I had a salad with some chopped up chicken with a low-calorie dressing on it and a cup of coffee and tonight I'm gonna have a glass of carrot juice with a splash of beet juice and probably a cup of half a cup of coffee the other half of the cup I started this that's your dinner yeah it's basically the salad with the chicken is your galley tomorrow why I'll be good and hungry tomorrow if I'm feeling like I can't sleep I'm distracted from hunger I've got some peanuts in my room and awesome a handful of peanuts see very clean oh I thought very clean was like some kind of thing no no no I try and eat clean because I have found I get great results with it like it is no joke it totally works and I as we do in our line of work I got a lot of stuff coming up a lot of stuff right you know I got a TV show a lot of shows a lot of a couple of speeches I got a teaching a class at UCLA what one day coming up November but in teaching they just want me to talk about music and culture and I just got asked to talk about change at another place and I have a bunch of shows coming up from here to Kiev Ukraine and just a lot of marks I got a hit it's just what I do and so I'm basically getting ready to walk out of the house until about Christmas and the hitting marks and not screwing up day after day night after night and so diet is a lot goes into that prep big time well that mean it makes sense if you if you're demanding that much out of your body you really don't want your body struggling with shitty nutrition I can't afford it like I my car can't go off the road I can't fail I'm gonna be screwing up like if I hit that set I'm gonna be on a TV show soon I can't not know the lines I can't be tired I can't look like I haven't slept I gotta be a game do you take any vitamins or supplements or anything like that I try and I forget and they go stale you know I have the 5 lined up my friend Hyde he said ok here here and I got into it and I you know eventually they get put in the cupboard and ice and then you look at my go three years ago and so that's why I do like the carrot and beet juice just so that those kind of vitamins are coming through and I do that like almost every day I just like the way it tastes - but no I I can't I've never been able to stick with it I just forget mm-hmm yeah have you ever had anything that you like took that gave you great benefits I could never noticed oh it's just the only thing I've ever noticed is restorative sleep for just general concentration and well-being and the cleaner I eat the better I feel caffeine I don't know if I getting jumped up on it I can't tell and so as far as anything I've ever done working out is an antidepressant good diet is an antidepressant and makes me a more efficient weight when I'm awake other than that like I don't I've never taken cod fish oil or whatever and said wow my joints feel better I've just maybe I'm just I'm not aware enough where I'm not expecting it to work so I have no thing I can hold up and go this this really helped me besides physical fitness getting the work done like you want to alleviate anxiety before an audition rehearse go in prepared and then there's nothing to be worried about because you can't wait to show the guy what you got right and so preparation good diet and and finishing the thing so you can really clear the deck those are the things cuz for me my whole life is don't be depressed I work so hard not to feel bad a lot of what I do is to will not feel really bad it's interesting that you've chosen to do this in a non pharmaceutical way like specifically you've got you've strategies just afraid of it yeah I just don't believe that someone I don't know can come with the drug that's going to work for my unique little mind and I've seen people on antidepressant such as so how's that working for you like I think I'm losing my mind like I've been doing this for three months and I don't know who I am right now I'm like okay I have that problem anyways what any pharmaceuticals to enhance that I'm just basically afraid that's a legitimate concern yeah I I think the brain is real fragile and I'm not one of those types you say all medication is bad I'm not that I just anything having to do with the brain I'd rather just deal with what I got right and use these more kind of on the ground ideas like I'll just sweat a lot let me do a lot of pull-ups and whatever I do oh like a ton of push-ups or I get on the stationary bike or whatever I do feel better yeah and when I eat the lean fish salad you know the salmon and the spinach I do feel better I feel great yeah and that's that's good enough for me yeah you've got successful strategies they working for me yeah yeah now when you're mean you do so many different things at this point of your life do you have like specific goals that you set out for the year or you where you would like to be a year from now or do you just do things that are really interesting to you and just pursue them with passion and just let the chips fall where they may I do that and I don't have a goal like it at 65 I want to be here I have no idea where I'll be I'm trying to get ready for 2019 I have no plans yet I'm just hoping for a lot of work I don't have those kind of long-range plans unfortunately I'm a short ranged - no ranged person and a lot of my motivation is vengeance and I know that revenge and vengeance are synonyms right however the fact that revenge has Ari in it like you do this I do that vengeance is just like the difference between aggression and hostility were you aggro no I'm hostile what does that mean Wham with the ashtray that hostility right you just hit me yes but I'm not aggressive I just like watching you bleed and so right I'm not saying it makes sense I know and so I don't believe in tit-for-tat mm-hmm I believe in tit tat watch me just jump up and down and just break it all do you want to prove yourself yes this is a primary motivation so I wake up every day wanting to get back at every teacher every guy at school every bad boss who whatever parent worked me and like every day I out everything you man and that's why I like hey it's 4:00 in the morning you want to work yeah like I'll work in a snowstorm like you know someone I know like they go on vacation like Gavin ice vacation and every day you're getting tan I'm not quitting like it's ridiculous it's I'm an 11 year old it's in fits read so juvenile and it's it's not cool but it has a fuel in some way I don't spray paint your house I'm not flattening your tire I'm just working and when someone goes oh I didn't get up early enough and get how did you get five of those cuz I got up at 3:00 and I stood outside and I ate this rat tail and I climbed the wall I got it and I got two of them and because so you could have none like just I'm so mad and I'm not you know I'm not trying to get somewhere by stepping on you to use you as a ladder rung be you you cling to this this is not something you ever plan on abandoning its the corner I come fighting out of it's my true north is like oh yeah all right you yeah and I it really works and it's not like I'm not I would never cheat someone out of something or steal from them but um whoever gets up earlier is gonna get it then I just won't sleep tonight my anger will keep me awake what are you having for dinner this and that's all I need like you say I can't like then I'll just sit up all night - what because that's all I need who are these people like when you say you say I can does anybody really say you can at this point in time we manufacture are you loser I'm a loser Oh what the fuck are you yeah yeah and this doesn't mean I'm walking over to hit somebody I don't know I'm not looking to get beat up I'm just motivating yourself yeah and I don't have a tee and I have a bunch of I'm have an aunt Russia I've just all I got is me so I get the pom-poms out go go push your back push it go like that is me I'm up in my office you know like at 4:00 in the morning just like okay I'm on Australian jetlag I'm gonna make it work I've been up since 1:30 I'm gonna work for 16 hours and I do why cuz I'm mad at it do I need to write another book probably not must I yes I must I must put that into the world and so you create these people that are telling you you can't do it don't worry tells me I can't the world I make money I never count it the the accountant does I just we talked a few times coming in I just say um am i doing anything horribly wrong and she'll say it will from your receipts it doesn't look like you eat very much but you sure seem to like records are you eating those but past that I just booked it put me in there like here's five shows can I have five more so I don't really count I I want to do well I want to pay my bills and I don't want to lose my house I want to keep eating and filling the car with gasoline and going to the grocery store but I'm not just trying to hey I got a lot of money I can hang around alright I got some money and excuse me I really got to go we still drive that boring car the mazda6 yeah still keys get me from A to B yeah yeah yeah super boring but damn does it keep starting on yeah got me here I love Japanese cars I got it because uh Heidi said you're getting this car the the other car I had they took from me they the powers-that-be I was the voice of infinity car for about five years and they give you a new car every year and there's a good car nice that's a great car had one of those big cute trucks those q whatever they are they're great yep and it's the car of the future and when the contract finally came to an end they said okay we'll come and get the car this is a perfect example Joe will come and get the car in 30 day so what No come and get it tomorrow morning screw you screw your car and I said to Heidi cuz she's the brains I said I need a new car because you're getting a Mazda 6 it's gonna be blue and I'm picking the interior get in my car why don't you just get it in infinity you're driving him forever told you they didn't want me anymore wow I mean all good things come to an end Wow double fingers you don't want me anymore and we went to the we went to the lot and two hours later I parked the Mazda 6 next to the Infiniti that got taken while I was on the set of a TV show the next morning and I drove my new car to the set and I kind of shit compared to the Infiniti though isn't it it's a different kind of ride it makes you very humble because you view flora and the 9 gerbils go come on working in the sunflower seeds fall out every other car passes you know I'm coming and yeah you get used to a nice ride but it's some and that was that she said you know what you will take a couple of days I'll go no new car right now but that's my question lean on afford a really nice car I mean you work really hard yeah like do you take any compensation or do you yes you have any like happiness that you derive from buying something I know you have a really good secretive stereo yeah we talked about a system you hear these giant speakers yes you want a car that has a crazy stereo as well yeah I just go to Trader Joe's and auditions and to the Joe Rogan podcast no I live the really utilitarian life like in LA when I'm off the road you don't even wear watch no I use the phone I used the watch from my travel just so I can just like see the time see the time but when I'm off the road I just used the phone it's just laziness I live very utilitarian here because basically I'm just counting down the days before I leave again because a lot of my work happens out in the world location like a film or TV show or just touring or traveling last year Heidi said something funny she's you're driving me crazy at the office like pacing and huffing and puffing like a wild animal she said um I'm gonna book you a trip and you can't know where you're going to the day you leave I'm just gonna get you out of here for ten days like you're driving me crazy I will kill you so I said book it and so I said all I need is the right electrical plug in the basic temperature range so I know how to pack she gave it to me and I picked the itinerary up got in the car to go to the airport this nice lady takes me to the airport she goes where we going today hon I said let's see where the boss is sending me I said I'm going to Lima Peru and so I was in Lima and Cusco for a week working on my book manuscript and walking the streets up in the Peruvian Andes up in Cusco and so I a lot of my life happens out in the world so when I'm here I'm just editing and prepping to get out of here and so a car low maintenance clothes low maintenance inconspicuous yeah I try sometimes trying not to have anything on this shirt I'd love to have a listen to Black Sabbath t-shirt on I'd wear that one every day I love that shirt but I'm always trying to slip through crowds and just head down you know just blank clothes that's a you have a very interesting philosophy and like I said your work ethic and your father it's very inspiring because it makes me want to work more it really does when I talk to you and I listen I think you get plenty done sir I know I did but that's one of the reasons why I do is because I get inspired by people like me I get inspired by you and other people like I love getting inspired I I live a fairly solitary life but I have a lot of Heroes I'm a fan of bands and people I just I dig presidents and other people in other countries I go to see bands play and they don't know but I have all their records I have the the bootlegs I'm super fan of so many people like a fraction my age it because I need that I need to be pumped up by other people and it works you put on someone's record yeah yeah man that's great well he's 19 what does he know plays a guitar better than I'll ever be like what what are you talking about yeah and so it can come in all kinds of ways I meet people amazing people when I travel so I need that and the only thing good about me in my opinion is what I do like don't be my friend I I'm no good I I'll help you move your house I'll help you move or paint your house but I don't want to come to Thanksgiving dinner I really don't but if you're in trouble I'll Drive from here to Ohio to get you out of the trouble I'm so happy to bail you out of a jam let's don't want to come over I don't want to come over for the holidays and I unless you're William Shatner Yeah right so what's good about me when people I would love to hang out with you like no just you know your books are interesting thank you let me go write them that's the only the the when I'm on stage or got the books or the radio show I do in KCRW that's my great human greatest hits the rest of my life I'm just a nervous wreck trying to get somewhere on time and kick ass and so I travel for months at a time with road manager Ward my road manager of many years a top guy fantastic guy there's hours that go by where we don't talk he's got a life I I have a life and we sit on the bus and hours go by and there's no sound except a TV whatever it's fine but I'm my what's good about me is what you see on stage on the page when I do my little radio show the rest of it I'm not good friend material but I will help your ass out of a jam like in Long Beach can you come bail me out of jail it's 3:00 in the morning I'm so ready to do that for you like that's a very unusual quiet what is why do you find I don't know but that doesn't bug me at all I'm just happy to kind of be the dog with the blob the bottle of alcohol yeah yeah yeah running up the hill cuz I'm so happy to get you out of a jam just hey come and meet the family please don't make me meet your family how did you meet Joey how'd you meet Joey Diaz I think Heidi set that up you'd never met him before I was via Heidi via you ah yeah I knew who he was and he's a really lovable guy as soon as I met him I liked him just by seeing him online but when I met on my route there's nothing not to like he's so honest he's full full exposure like who he is you get it in 60 seconds yeah and I think that's why people like him because there's no BS and like you know there's the good the bad of anybody he lets you know who he is in the first five minutes and you can take or leave it yeah but there's no ambiguity and I really like being around that because you can be yourself because he is show enough being him he's not holding back that's a really good way of looking at it you can be yourself because he is being himself totally and and he's not gonna judge you on that he's gonna give you the free he's gonna be himself but give you also the freedom to be yourself unlimited yeah I mean it was we we spoke for a while on his podcast had a great time and he's one of those guys if he called me at 3 in the morning hey I'm in trouble I'm in San Diego I'm like hold on give me three hours I mean I I'll help you that come to meet the family please send a card but I I'm just I don't want to come over but you don't want bullshit small talk and you've got things to do and you're obsessed but but I'm I'm not what I'm trying to get across as I'm not mean-spirited I'm just so happy to help yeah just a little a lot yeah but always ready to help I think that is thing the thing in that awkwardness is the fuel it's like we were talking about about having imposter syndrome that I don't think it ever goes away I thought one day it would gonna it would go away I'm more comfortable meeting famous people now than I've ever been before but I still feel full of shit I think you always will and everybody that I've ever talked to that's any good they all say the same thing like they all kind of feel like no one ever feels like they're anything special and you always like if they're any good they don't know and you always ruthlessly self-critical and trying to get better I mean I work with big actors big big rock stars and the big rock stars like one big rock star once one time said to me I opened he said is there anyone out there I said like 19,000 people you smell the wd-40 that's how they got the last thousand people in are you kidding he said I'm always worried that no one's gonna show up I said when was that ever been your problem he said we'll never but who is this Ozzy Jesus Christ yeah who's just one of my favorite people Jesus he's another guy he's honest how many people where like in some Floridian megaton those will be anyone other and he goes out there and the place goes nuts the show is great of course and I said you worry about people don't show I'll get really depressed on okay and you know I did the Beacon Theater once many years ago in New York beautiful room love that place I was I was a few days later I was at MTV doing something with like Matt Pinfield or somebody I was living in New York and I'm leaving and the courtesy lady she said hey George Carlin is in the greenroom and he wants to meet you I went wait a minute dumb question the George Carlin because I've been listening to that guy's since I was in eighth grade class clown and occupation fool actually came out for me to go to the record store they were not nice price records they are what on that's how old I am memorized in my eighth grade of course and I said George Carlin wants to meet me okay walk in and there's George Carlin he's there to promote his next HBO thing and he's gonna do like like multiple nights at the Beacon Theater place I would never sell out he was gonna do a month there or whatever and he said ham I said mr. Carlisle I'm George I'm like wow he said oh you did a book signing the other night at Tower Records I said yeah his ah man was so close I was in line for like half an hour and finally I got so cold I went home I said you waited in line to meet me like yeah I'm like why don't you just walk in like oh I can't do that man and and he said so you just worth the beacon I said yeah I was amazing he said did they get the jokes I said oh oh I'm not that's not really what I do I said I'm sorry what do you mean he goes like did did can you get to the audience from that stage I said it's actually a pretty big place it's a lot of feet to before the first row I said yeah I said you're George Carlin I think you're gonna do okay but he was sincerely wondering like is it gonna be okay in there I'm like are you kidding you were handcuffed with Lenny Bruce in the back of a cop car and you're asking me if it's gonna be okay yeah it's an eighth grade book it's in that great book ladies and gentlemen Lenny Bruce book it's a great read that's a read and a half I read it like 22 years ago it's fantastic forgot about there was a time when the you know as you know the First Amendment was not being used in Lenny Bruce's life towards the end of his life and that was his every stand-up thing he did was about the law towards the end and he was in doing a show one night George Carlin was there underage and George said something and they were waiting they pounced on him and then they went through the crowd ID ID ID oh come here youngster and they handcuffed them together so I said and that's how you met Lenny Bruce right he said no I had met him before but he said like we were literally one pair of handcuffs together just like the book but I thought that's it that's not how we met I said so how'd you guys meet he said Lenny Bruce was very sympathetic two young comics so what we would do is like he said give me your best five minutes and he would critique us I said is he trying to take your material no no he just he said look okay leave that part out that part sucks do more of that and that first part put it last you would like help he said he was great with all the young comics he said like give me your stuff okay here's how you redo it make it better I said so you had known him before he said yeah I said well because you know Lenny Bruce to me is a real getting a hero and inspiration fought back and um I I walked out of there into like you know the freezing you know he's New York to take the end of the are back down to the East Village like I but the fact that here's this guy the point I'm making is stone-cold Pro anywhere where I sell out half the tickets he does 20 nights there yeah I mean yo you'll never get out of that shadow and even he is saying hey I have a question yeah and here's what I found with all of your big actors and big the ones the ones I've worked with they are obedient to the muse they work for the art they are so subservient to the job it's not about hey I'm rich I'm popular it's like dammit I gotta make this script come to life right and they fear it like someone on their first job and there might have been a middle period like in the 70s they had their idiot phase for three years and they kind of went sideways but man the big actors I've worked with they're just so like okay this take is everything and it's a good lesson you're like okay never lose that yeah because that's what you have when you're young and you're coming up and you're starting to show promise yep and somewhere along the line it seems like some people get into this mindset that they deserve it yeah and when they deserve it it's a terrible thing that happens to comedians there's something that happens comedians when they can't relate to people anymore and they stop being relevant and by George waiting in line to see you outside in the cold shows that he never really got to that place that that bad place and he was probably the most prolific standup of all time because he never stopped he would do a fresh HBO hour every year every year he would just sit down and he would write at all he would write it all all out and then he would just kind of fine-tune it sort of like you were saying you do need fine-tune it and performance after performance and then put it on HBO and then start work on the next one and then just crank him out yeah I was told by someone who had him at his venue in Northern California he just sits in front of the mirror before the show and does the whole show at hyperspeed in a low voice I did that on a TV show once means the actors it was one of the actors ideas okay everyone in my trailer and we did the whole show at hyperspeed in a low voice standing in a huddle it was really cool because we were like in each other's face going on that's funny and we just kind of did it like this like crazy mumbling fest for like 20 minutes and we're like okay okay we got it whoo-hoo we went out there and did it it's like live in front of a TV audience and it was like I'd never done that before he was really cool and apparently that's how George preps Wow that's interesting I don't know anybody else who does that most people don't even look at themselves they don't stare in front of a mirror I don't look at myself I do one thing that actually works I pace and I I I quote Lincoln speeches as a centering exercise really yeah especially as speech from like January 19th 1838 give me some it's a famous speech he said when he was talking about will America ever be taken over by anywhere else and he said no the only way America's gonna fall is from within so he said should we fear some transatlantic giant to cross the ocean and crush us at a blow never all the country Asia Europe and Africa with their war chests combined ours were the treasures of the world our unaccepted and bonaparte as a commander could not in a trial of a thousand years so much as take a sip from the ohio river or lay a tread on the on the on the Blue Ridge Mountains if suicide if destruction be our lot we we must either live through all the time or die by suicide and I just take chunks of that speech because it's so he's like 28 29 years of age he's so eloquent a sentence of Lincoln is worth 10 of anyone elses it's all line for free but go to the it's called the speech to the young men's Lyceum or the perpetuation of our government institutions and it's like 3200 words and it's it'll be the best thing you read this week and how does it work as a centering exercise I don't know I just get in the Lincoln framework where words mattered to him he's a lawyer and a politician so he's a double bastard I was in the vault of the Lincoln Museum in Springfield a few years ago they let me in and they pull it out of one of his beaver skin top hats and they they won't let me touch it of course I didn't try but the guy with the gloves pulls it out he said do you notice an indentation on the right side of the brim I said yeah goes what do you think that is I said let me guess there there's one on top and two underneath and I looked and there was I said that's him doffing his cap his hat over and over again wait to it wears out the beaver skin he said yeah how do you think he ward out I said he's a politician and a lawyer so he's trying to get everyone's vote and win so he's like good morning good morning good morning award so I have an office and I'm running for office and he said yeah that's probably it and that's finally they you see but beaver skin the line there has yeah well it was the outside of it and this of those famous hats you saw him in the Lincoln museum they have one in the vault and literally he wore out the hide but I use Lincoln and amendments from the Constitution the 14th is uh this is it's in like four parts or five parts it's the top parts for We the People the rest is legalese and I'll do that or the fourth amendment the privacy one that's a great one it's not completely in the front of my brain pan but I carry a copy of the Constitution with me whenever I travel and I open it like people open the Bible I'll just pick an amendment and read it really yeah and I I have one of those the Constitution for idiot books we're like lawyers right about here's when it was brought into law here's why here's what it means in laymen terms and it's never not interesting to read it slow the Constitution is great it is faster than we think this is an experiment in self-government that these people from 300 years ago put together it's kind of they kind of are gods to me in that they could see the future maybe they couldn't see the ar-15 but Jefferson and company definitely saw how easily corruptible humans are yeah you give him a little bit of power we can get a little crazy and American democracy is really all about the checks you like you're you're you're a badass but you're not a badass is Congress Congress is gonna check we're seeing that with Trump I mean with Trump we're essentially seeing the reason why all these checks and balances are put in place in the first place yeah because guys like him yeah because we a president comes from we the people it can be you or me potentially and I think the framers really saw that like it should be from the people so we gotta put this person in checks because he might be a failed businessman bad reality show actor who doesn't understand I have to read 1,500 pages of stuff this weekend and have five lawyers advise me no golf are fun for me I'm the president and a lot of presidents do understand before they go and like boy this job's gonna be boring and a lot of people are gonna be mad and in my lifetime we finally have a president who really is from the people who says uh he looks at like you know here's eight folders of stuff to read and like I don't think so give me the CliffsNotes yeah like I'll play it from the hip like no I'm gonna watch Fox and Friends you tell me what I need and you know it's not for me to sit and rip on the guy cuz he's not here to defend himself but never in my life have I ever watched an American president and thought to myself I could have done better in that situation there's presidents I've had nothing but disagreement with but they were way better for the job than I ever could be I look at this guy and like man you just got played and there's something I when I knew I was going to be talking to you there's a thing I was thinking about because I saw I heard you speak many years ago about these politicians are gangster you said like okay what that guy did that's gangsta and what this guy just did straight-up gangster during the Bush administration you were just I think it was like Halliburton all these people in the Cheney world and you're like that's a gang to move that's a gangster moving like I can't disagree with anything he just said and on that kind of level I think what I never hear is that Donald Trump is a guy who gets consistently played rolled got rolled by his wife who a woman I have nothing against but she comes from a really tough part of the world Slovenia that's just a rough patch of real estate she's smart and she's tough and she got out got to America well he's not much on looks but its way in from the storm so he got played by his wife he got played by Paul Manafort he got played by Kim jong-un he got played like Jimi Hendrix at Monterey that that particular Stratocaster by Vladimir Putin and gets played like Rachmaninoff every single day and anyone he does high stakes business with were negotiations he gets played played and and man afford just used him to try and you know get out of debt and all these other people they just roll all over him and unfortunately his hubris is such he's like haha like no dude you just got blown out and like everyone around you is playing you well he probably doesn't feel that way with manna for because manna for it's on trial and he's not yet right but manna fort played him because manna fort really does play in that world of oligarchs and millions of dollars in laundering money if he wrote a book I was telling someone the other day I have all these people he should write the book cause it would be a page-turner if he told the truth would get him killed he touched the wrong doorknob right and he got poison because like Simon Putin can't have him telling what he knows he's a man he would probably will go to prison watch him have some kind of strange accident like he was liquefied in the shower something about the water because he knows a lot and there's a lot of people who can pay a lot of money to keep his mouth shut yeah well you know what's fascinating to me is that over the last year or two especially from the the fox crew you're seeing Vladimir Putin admired yep it's very strange as I never thought we would see that I was watching something a couple of years ago out a year ago and I was like some guy well he's a good Christian man and he believes in family I'm like he's the butcher of Chechnya yeah let's flashback to the 1960s I'm a young boy on the weekend visit with my father to the right of my father is a wall there's nothing to the right of my father just nothing and if he's still with us he'd be in his 90s and hard as a rock just like nothing he's like this a bar of hickory anyway he's an economist his numbers guy and PhD rule smart I'm coming home to my mom's apartment from this Saturday Sunday visit with dad we're in Washington DC area I'm a little boy five years old somewhere around there very small economist and communist I don't know what either of them are arguably to a five-year-old kind of sounds the same I'm in the big Buick station wagon um - my father's right we're pulling up to mom's apartment Henry dad are you a communist I don't think my father's facial expression changed his right hand came off the wheel and his backhand collided with my head it was just like I hear the word communist a boy gets smacked and it was without hatred or violence it was like national security like whack he didn't even know he did it it was like a sneeze like Kapow and it hurts so much my head went numb and it was not even the pain it was like the shock of a your dad whacking you with you had no idea what you did and all I could do was hyperventilate and he opened the door and he let me out he didn't say a word he didn't tell you that there's a difference between a communist and an economy no sir so I left like for like till I was like 33 you know you know what I mean because it's Saudi stable like your dad just walloped you and I get out of the elevator I go into the apartment smoke but yeah I did that till I was like you know until two years ago it was totally she said honey what happened I said I asked dad if he was a Commerce she's like okay the point I'm making is this there's a bunch of people who voted for Trump where you say Russia they say but a bunch of sons of bitches trust him as far as you can throw your car are you kidding and when I see staunch conservative Republicans going well that voting guy I'm like are you kidding people like my dad's heads are exploding he's an old cold war guy we would wash boris and Natasha whatever that cartoons as a Winkle yeah as a kid mm-hmm I'm laughing cuz the guy with uh my dad's laughing on a whole other level cuz for its Cold War funnies it's was written for the parents the kids get the cartoon the parents got the jokes that was for adults what with their kids on Saturday you watched them later on you're like oh this is Cold War humor I wouldn't have known but that's my dad's world you say Russia he'd probably hated my guts cuz I've been there six times for shows mmm undertake the trans-siberian Express and so this warming up to a guy who is a true bad guy he's scary there's bodies buried because of him he's one of the scariest guys on the planet in incapable violent and we'll have you taken out I mean like Anna Politkovskaya one of the greatest journalists of our time she was critical of Putin and she got assassinated in her apartment building her books are great her books from Chechnya are amazing and like he was she was critical of him and she had to go and when you see our president cozying up to this guy I just want to go bro let's talk like let's take a walk in the garden for 20 minutes you can't be friends with this guy my theory is he there there there's there's some kind of finances where he's he's got a stick up for him I don't think it's a tape of people urinating on anyone I think it's 72 cliche - interesting it'd be it's it's a it's a money thing it's a hotel deal it's money sitting in Cyprus it's something but the fact that we're being becoming okay with this guy that is the part that bugs me the most and why people in Congress or a guy like Sean Hannity who like probably likes communists as much as my dad even me I don't trust people like that at all Putin is a criminal should be in jail for a million billion years and the fact like hey he's a like when when he's a strong leader he he's a he's a human being we can talk like he's like ex-kgb guy who there's no such thing as an ex-kgb guy right yeah there KGB for life yeah for life and he's a Supreme operative and what he does is he he rolls people like you dude and like God you are a guppy he's a shark like a no two guys hanging out no one guy getting played and one guy playing someone I think he admires the fact that Putin is able to run his country the way he does - yes and that's why he looks Duterte and hoon and I've been - so he said about noon he said he's a strong head and I was like those countries I've been to the Philippines I've been to North Korea they're tough places to live and like you don't want your country looking like those places you don't want America to be like Russia the economy is destroyed and there's a lot of people like in the wintertime it's really tough how do you think this is I think he goes to jail no no because I don't believe in karma karma here's my two words that disprove karma Dick Cheney he's got a new heart and a new heart he has no pulse which is perfectly he's got a pulse now with the new heart okay because I machine yeah new machine he just heard of woosh yeah which is what's perfect for him yeah he may very well live because he look like he's watching his weight now he's like looking lean he might live to be like a hundred and five and so he'll never go to jail and and like how many millions does he make a year just from his dividends from whatever like who knows what you do with that kind of money I don't know what you do with it and so I don't think he goes to jail I don't think Jared Kushner goes to jail I think at most they leave like maybe next year and they got like I drain the swamp I did what I came here to do and the fake news media brought me down and all his people buy one of everything he makes forever steak vodka I think it's possible that Donald Trump jr. goes to jail it's very possible they're talking about perjury charges against him now because his own dad admitted on Twitter yes yeah no I follow all that stuff is you know I just don't think white collar guys go to prison for stuff I just don't believe it hmm you know I just don't believe it I want to be proven wrong but I don't have all the facts I'm oh I'm a news watcher I know nothing I don't get any classified briefs so I only know what I read and what I can't talk about any of this stuff and your stage act a little bit but knowing my audience they're very sharp and they read their readers and they don't need me repeating what they know right and so well good for you for that if I make a point as my dad used to say you want to score hidden where they ain't the baseball idea and so if I can make a point like if I was on stage tonight talking about Trump I would roll out that idea of Trump as a guy who's been played by so many people around him and no one talks about his wife playing him like there's no love in that marriage I don't think she saw a way out came to New York and went that guy yeah gets naked with the toad a few nights a month handful a handful of Prozac some Stoli and a credit card and a seven-figure expense account you can take a shower and make it go away yeah so I think he and I think he kind of knows that you know she's not like wow what a hot guy she's like hey and there's you know that happens a lot in this town you'll see that yield the couple you like okay yeah right whoa Harvey Weinstein before his for his wife left him Harvey Weinstein's wife was beautiful well yeah but you see that a lot in this town where you see the the old weird dude with like the the 8 year old girlfriend you like oh yeah that's that's a setup that's an agency that's an agreement that's someone's getting a salary or an implied you know it's it's a there's some of quid pro quo there's a credit card or there's an expense account or there's just a a big Fistful of hundreds and just let me chew on you for the next four weeks you know or whatever the agreement is Ryan and I so if I was gonna say anything about Donald Trump on stage would be who sucks and I I never talk about any problem on stage and I learned this from of all people President Clinton because some of his later speeches post-presidency I'm not a huge fan of the guy but he's a good speaker and he did some speeches in the UK a few years ago I happened to be in England when he was there and I watched him on TV the last part of the speech the last 10 minutes was here's a problem and here's three solutions here's another problem here's three solutions like for for 60 million dollars we could put Internet through this thing or we could open this waterway or we could reconfigure this workforce to upgrade so everyone can get a paycheck he just had logical ways forward so what I took from that is to my audience don't propose a problem well he sucks thanks goodnight don't give him a Gordian not unless you can go actually it's not a Gordian knot here's three ways to get out of this burning wreck and so like when when Trump became elected it was I was on tour I was doing a bunch of nights in LA and I said okay you have a new president and some of you are depressed hmm I said I know and so gay people are on the endangered species list as if they've never been brown people black people women people people with ovaries these are all on the you're screwed list so instead of being coming to press and oh no let's we get up we start doing more benefits now all your words matter your actions matter how you stick up for your LGBT friends really matters now how you stick up for women how you stick up for racial equality equality in the workplace like how you check yourself when you voulez-vous with other people words matter actions matter more than ever and so to me it's an exciting time to show how great you can be because now it's all on the line the fat is off the land we're being tested I love a test so let's get it on it's like in your line of work when the guy goes here we go that's how I saw it like okay let's writ let's get the money to the ACLU let's get some money to Planned Parenthood let's get a conversation going about child suicide intimidation through Facebook let's start making things better because this guy is not our ally government's not necessarily gonna help at its best it's inactive at its worst it's divisive and predatory so let's be the antidote by being cool by not throwing rock through windows or like you getting another tiki torch and beating him up come on you're never gonna convince that guy that he's wrong so get to the people you agree with and let's start sticking together more and raising more money and get some more interesting people in office and let's get some young people in office and I think that's what's happening like you're seeing all these young people like 20s 30s sadly there's a bunch of kids who died at a high school in Florida but look what happened look at all those kids hitting the streets look at all these kids who through cell phones and selfies and Instagram and snapchat they're already ready for primetime you see these high school juniors in front of a CNN camera going hi I'm 17 years old this happened to my school and next year I'm gonna vote and here's what's gonna happen and here's the March I'm starting like uh-oh that's a future senator you just that school shooting just birthed a voting demographic are you kidding all those kids are gonna vote all of them all those kids who marched there's gonna be no Millennial apathy with those kids they're all gonna vote I kinda have an idea what side they're gonna vote with and if you think you're gonna sell those kids on their grandfather's drunken homophobia racism and just overall bigotry and xenophobia you're wrong he never had a passport I don't need to travel I don't want to meet some damn Mexican trust me the kid's gonna travel he's gonna go to India she's gonna go to Colombia and meet other people and get a more global sense of the world a sense of water food energy where it comes from where what happens with money what happens with mediocrity the danger of it so I think we're in for some tough times but I think they're gonna lead to good times and so that's what if I get political onstage all I say is like here's five ways forward because the despair part you like you need me to tell you you watch the news so don't get down on the mouth start burning more calories and that and that's not my job but I would never weigh in onstage any other way about that stuff because all I would be is obvious and my audience is pretty sharp and they don't need to be told twice outstanding thank you sir well said I couldn't agree more Friday night show time August 10th Henry motherfucking Rollins keep talking keep talking pal pal keep talking pal thank you sir thank you sir I really appreciate it [Music]
