the girag an experience yeah but you ever have a friend go crazy on you yeah I've had friends that like legitimately lost their mind I can't talk to them anymore like like you had talked to him about events and his version of events were just like so not what actually happened oh this is a person that's lost their marbles yeah yeah it happens you can temporarily lose your marbles a permanent mention or permanently yeah but I think that like I mean yes permanently of course there's like no I'm not saying through psychedelics either well I know you're I know you I'm just saying people that just can't keep it together anymore and for whatever reason whether it's a combination of life stress and biological situation whatever the fuck they've got going on you know uniquely in their own brain but some people just all of a sudden not there anymore not keeping it together do they think they're keeping it together sometimes yeah I mean it's broad you know broad range right there's all kinds of yeah it sucks man people the brain is an organ and it malfunctions and and sometimes you go nuts and that's and you get stigmatized for it which really sucks because if you like because that just adds to the problem like if you you know I you see somebody in a cast and you're like oh what happened your arm and they'll tell you oh you know whatever I fell down but you you talk to someone who's been like hospitalized for a few weeks and they tell ya I to go to the hospital in ER vez break down I went crazy shit my pants threw my dog through a window yeah you're like you know you you'll want you want to be compassionate but there's some part of you that's like oh now this is a crazy person it's like it's just the something happened the operating system temporarily crashed and quite often I think that could be a very good thing I think that having your your personality or your ego or crash can often mean that you were trying to be somebody that you aren't and some people invest so much energy so much energy in defining yeah they just want to be something you know there were a kid their mother was telling them you should be like this and then they try to be like this and they hold up this thing they're always working to hold up this giant tail feather and it kicked their arms start shaking and that they can't hold it up and that's that's when they have like anger outbursts or suddenly like their friends are like you you turned into someone that I've never met I don't even know who that is it's like no that is you met them you met underneath the tailfeather the seething sea of anger and disappointment and sadness they move it you met that thing that they're they're trying to avoid by looking up at this mask they're holding up to the world but that fucking seething sea of disappointment anger and horror and sadness that's where it's at man you got to go into that thing and for some people the only way they can go into that is by having a full-scale nervous breakdown because then they can have permission to dive into that into that awful vortex of darkness because underneath that vortex of darkness is paradise underneath that that's love and happiness and joy and connection and tranquility and all that stuff and everyone thinks that the way to get to that point is by avoiding this awful black forest that surrounds the Garden of Eden which is inside everybody it's inside everybody it's there it's there and it doesn't matter you know you can work out and that will definitely give you a temporarily temporary good feeling but until you address the internal structures that you haven't acknowledged you're always going to go back to that place where you find yourself morose and depressed and angry and you don't know why you always go back to that place until you sit with the sadness inside of you you have to do that what you're describing is coming out of the closet and it you know yeah for a lot of people that is what it is man it's coming out of the closet and there's a lot of closet clothes there's not just the gay closet there's all kinds of closet there's the artist closet some people are fucking accountants they're wearing suits and their ties on tight and they're fucking like organized and discipline but inside they're probably painters they probably want it fucking paint they want to paint dayglo mountains down at the beach that's what they really are but their daddy or their mommy wanted them to be a good little business man so they became this thing that's the opposite of what they are this is the verse in the bhagavad-gita God forgive me because I've quoted it way too many times but it's it's better to be an honest street sweeper than a dishonest King it's better to be a happy guy brushing fucking Leafs up the street than it is to be some zillionaire who inside is dying or none or miserable mostly num-nums the work most people are just not as long as these people can quantify on paper I still have a X million dollar home my car still cost X thousand dollars this suit is an ex suit I am still ahead I am NOT going to abandon all these things as long as they don't see through the bullshit the game they think they're winning that's right yeah yeah it's almost like you have to fall to to really that's what you got to appreciate those moments when it all falls apart on you because that means you've got an opportunity to try it again let's take a new fresh perspective this is the cool thing that at this retreat I went to this guy jack Kornfield sigh which I really loved what a great name by the way yeah with a k' not a seed jack Kornfield mortal kombat k jack Kornfield but he uh he's really cool man but he was like a cool with a kid yeah he's with yet yet like the cigarette and corny no this guy was awesome and he was one of the things he talked about is in some religious tradition how they like hold the scriptures rabbi like had his students hold the scriptures over their heart and when they were memorizing them and they would say why do we do this and he said so that when your heart breaks they'll fall in and it's a beautiful idea which is that heart break is actually your ego cracking and the moment that cracks you're in the experience of truth and when you're in the experience of truth that's when you can really become who you are but but to get to who you are it's like when you know a bone heals the wrong way like that's what a lot of people's entire personality is it's like a bone that grew the wrong way and that needs a fucking take a snap a crack you know it's wheat you get that through Slava yeah you need that that initial fucking thing and it's a beautiful analogy and it hurts it hurts but we're paying avoiding creatures so we think that so we're always running away from this pain but the problem is as we're running away from pain we're still exactly in pain it's basically like being on fire and running away from water you're just running away from the water because you for some I don't know that's a stupid analogy now I'm doing great up into that yeah you had a lot of great points what it's true you know there's the monster in the dark and the faster you run the more likely you are to run into something that's actually going to hurt you as opposed to turning around and saying oh fuck there is no monster no monster you know but you're never going to know that until you stop and turn around ya know and in some cases people don't have the discipline or the the assistance or the the balls to stop and turn around so they have to trip over something and then there's like oh yep that is that story this classic story of someone hiding a secret and going completely out of control because of the pressure of hiding that like that's the Ted Haggerty who's the secretly gay guy who's preaching against gay people Ted Haggard okay yeah in Colorado yeah that could was snorting meth off his gay lovers yeah yeah yeah we was Jenna going so far the other way he's just so off the rails being himself he's beat himself he was a guy who likes to snort meth off of cocks let's do a little math and it likes it well does suck a few cocks but I would say he wasn't being himself what I would say is that his his behavior was so extreme because he was seeking balance between that and the other bullshit in his life whereas if he weren't living that he'd be right in the middle right yeah well to get to get to the middle you know the way to get to the middle weirdly is whatever the behavior is that you're doing that you're so horrified about and terrified of sometimes that the really weird idea is this is like something that I like that Rhonda says which is like don't if you don't feel like meditating don't meditate don't force it don't impose this on yourself keep doing the thing you're doing that's upsetting you so much have the balls to keep doing the fucking thing that you're doing keep doing it society is going to tell you don't be like this stop being like this you have to change that's what your parents always say the idea is like no sink into what you are right now just be that thing stop resisting exactly where you are right now is perfect and that's a hard truth to grasp because you think right away you think yeah what about fucking Jeffrey Dahmer is he perfect well what about the leopard when you're seeing a leopard rip apart of a creature is that thing purr is that a perfect mom I don't think the leopard fucks them and then kills them but you know what Ducks do Ducks are necrophiliacs are they fucking evil creatures yes I think they are well yeah they are made that Phil Robertson guy a very famous person he invented a call for the lamp lamp and now poor gay people have to hear that a man's anus is not as good as a woman's vagina can you imagine if you made the choice for a man's anus and you hear this fucking big bearded fashionista with his camel on a bandanna absolute fact that's so weird I never thought of that big bearded Christian Bible slang and fashionista and he tells you that your choice was incorrect and in fact the woman's vagina is the better choice the man's anus I mean come on guys but how can you say that if you haven't experienced it maybe yeah I think he has again the balance theory I think he's so outspoken on that issue like most of these Homo phobes are because their home jerking off to gay porn that you know otherwise you just don't give a shit it just doesn't actually matter right you know it doesn't come up in a GQ interview Duffing right it's like duh ready yeah really care people are gay duh you really care the two guys love each other and that you are you against love yeah you only like love if it's a man and a woman like a fuck man really yeah it's a dog it's duh and you're talking about men's anuses in GQ maybe you've got some issues to think about shouldn't we just be talking about ducks ducks anus isn't that your host you know ducks ganas like you shoot ducks all the time right that's your thing let's just talk about murdering ducks yeah why you gotta talk about men what I'm talking about asshole quality adding this into blood sacks well the only way you can live that fake life as if it's fake the actual you know this this like this puritanical ideal they've held up it's not natural and they haven't been really living it anyway they've been pretending to be living it be freaks in this sort of a rebound sort of a way to balance everything out and I think that ultimately that's being exposed over and over and over and over again to the point where it's not going to be a viable option anymore like powdered wigs aren't a viable option yes can't wear a fucking powdered wig you know and you can't pretend you're this you know Rick Santorum guy you know just as a it man who believes in the Bible and doesn't want to see gays get married doesn't want to ruin the institution of marriage with homosexual activity that's been shunned upon in the Bible may I quote and you're like oh fucking criminy what's going on really what's going on behind the scenes with you cat what was in your head yeah I keep waiting for it to get to that point where anybody who's got a big problem with homosexuality is by default admitting to their own homosexual life but I've been waiting 30 years for America to go come on this is too silly to be real Ronald Reagan are you kidding that guy was such a joke but you know he's Saint Ronald and the seeds mounted 30 years ago why even then well even then there was a lot of others who voted for him but do you remember the criticism though it was pretty open there was a lot of people that didn't like him I remember what he was in but not enough that he didn't win 49 out of 50 states in his re-election listen man I'm not saying that you know he didn't dominate the vast majority of the you know I mean there was a lot of idiots back then but the difference between the way people look at him now and the way people looked at him then now it's almost all glowing when people talk about ring and I hardly ever hear any criticism yeah you don't hear about iran-contra Nicaragua no serve it out Oliver freeze yeah Oliver North all over and all that craziness and you know yeah but my point my point is that this idea that suddenly we're gonna wake up and realize how ridiculous it is and it's a Rick Santorum is too ridiculous to be real it's fuckin what's her name Sarah Palin mmm you know I I am amazed that how flexible the reality muscle seems to be that people are willing to accept this stuff that Frank Zappa was laughing about 40 years ago boy I wonder if they're accepting it though I wonder I think that you watch these shows enough and it creates the illusion of acceptance but then if you if anywhere on the internet or and you just see this constant rebellion against that kind of square mainstream homophobic angry personality and but you watch Fox News and yeah you watch Fox News or you watched anything on TV and it's an illusion you know you watch the the commercials everything's this big illusion you watch the commercials and it's like people go in and buy a car and make it seems normal it seems totally normal that people are going in to get deeply in debt to the banks that all seems incredibly normal but then more and more on the internet you see like people rebelling against this and showing how the bankers like the whole system is this fucked up thing and emerging things like Bitcoin which are like slowly moving the energy away from it I don't know I didn't know you mean I don't think it's going to be a sudden thing I think it's going to be more like a just a gradual shift as people just stop watching TV that's that's going to happen people are just gonna you know I Drive down the street billboards for fucking like amazon.com shows you know like billboards for shows that aren't really controlled by these big Netflix Netflix you yeah yeah is an Amazon just another big networking I mean you know it doesn't matter if it's a network or it's a international conglomerate or whatever is it's big money it is but you're right but that's just the billions the reality is it's you're not that but them yeah but that's not it's not right because the media is a very different thing the media when you're talking about television you're talking about a very hard thing to get into the medium you're talking about in turn you're talking about an incredibly easy right get into literally open to almost anyone with an internet connection you can make a YouTube video doesn't cost you a goddamn dime yeah you have a laptop that has a camera on it you talk any what you make a youtube video that yeah that's a big change that's not just a big change that might be the biggest change in human history it might be the biggest change since a monkey ate a mushroom all right certainly since the printing press the practic printing press was a major for sure giant you know and in similar in the sense that it it took the power of communication away from very few and gave it to a lot more right sort and that's sort of one of the more fascinating things about this is that they're you know even if Amazon does put something online it's no better than I just Dean who has like you know 45 fucking billion write followers and cheap every video she put there's people like that that just became famous for the internet no jennamarbles is another one right yeah she's got like millions and millions and millions of hits okay yeah here's what it is here's what it is cuz I I've just been reading Sheldrake's new book science set free and he talks about morphic resonance or something and I know you have some I think you skeptical about Sheldrake but it's like when you just have TV TV is a tuning fork and when there was no internet it was just TV and it was a depiction of here's what a family looks like here's what people tend it's corporations saying here's what people do when they're healthy and that creates a tuning fork effect which is like if you're watching it enough you're going to either resonate with it or in and feel like yes I'm doing great I have a wife and a house in a car and a job and that's great I'm in tune with what everyone else is doing but that's an illusion that's never been what everyone else is doing it's just what massive conglomerates are sending out there either in the form of hypnotic content that keeps you glued to your seat as you watch corporations try to get you in debt to buy cars you know it's it's it's generally it's just it's it's a the whole thing is just a a tuning all of society in a way that society maybe isn't meant to be tuned at all and so with the internet now you have all these different smaller tuning forks you know your podcast is a tuning fork people tune into the stuff that you talk about and the different people that you bring on the podcast send out information that causes a new kind of tuning to start happening so that's why when you watch like Huckabee you'd really feel like you're like listening to somebody sing off-key because you're not resonating you're not resonating you've been tuned in to a whole different thing which is what the Internet's I think one of the major things the internet is done you know you get these communities read it you can get tuned into the reddit frequency quite easily where suddenly it all just starts making sense and that is why that you know the duck dynasty guy or any of these weirdos who are who are just ultimately just angry people that's why they seem so fucking crazy or they play angry people on TV right because I think a lot of these people aren't even you know like that the Republic dynasty guy the duck dynasty guy has been giving speeches like that for years these biblical retreats and stuff he's been doing that for this video so that's his real stick he's not he's at fire and brimstone god-fearing Christian man it was living on the wrong side of the law and Jesus at one point time and then turned it all around and wants to let everybody know about the evils of sin he's an old dummy that's what he is he's an old dummy that loves a scientific name for EM hey he's an old dummy - probably just one time suck the dick and liked it way too much if someone sucked his dick and it's his favorite moment ah look back as childhood and he's turned it into you know career I bet he was hunting ducks when it happened I bet he was not even that duck blonde they're all liquored up moonshine he wasn't hunting ducks at that right when he came into like some guy's mouth years ago out in the out in the mud he saw it's why they call it a duck boy yeah sorry ducky find pleasure and shame mixed inside of me like I'm just gonna kill dogs from now on and never think about this duck she didn't see shit your mother ng shit your father didn't see shit nobody son shit Jimmy bedroom khatoun could you humanity that's really what it was all was just a duck song get his dick sucked by a guy he's like fuck that it didn't happen did nap I need to kill ducks I think that's something like that happen man it's something like that happened yeah but you know man like what you do with with you know sex at dawn creates a residence where it's like it's a it's a shame reliever it's a shame reducer man because your book I think it has been it's such a compassionate book for people who are stuck in monogamous relationships and feel guilty about the fact that they are attracted to other people and that's like that guilt used to be a normal guilt that was actually considered like oh something must be going wrong with your relationship if you're thinking about fucking other people and your book makes shows like no actually that's just nature happening through you you don't have to feel guilty about it or like something's off balance in you it's just completely normal it doesn't mean you have to go and fuck other people but at least now you don't have to feel like I must not love her anymore or she must not love me anymore what's that have to do with fucking ducks country music song that's the glue yeah the glue that connects cheese fucking ducks and in the sadness you have for not wanting to be monogamous yeah muezzin chants Ricky right that's the glue yeah keeps it all together the glue that holds the oh that's why you need to listen to Phil Roberts and that that goddamn communist Andy that puts them on is that what it's on to any cuz not hilarious it's on A&E Annie used to be like fucking masterpiece theater shit yeah pleased to have like you know arts and entertainment live is you know interesting fascinating programming and stimulated the mind don't sell cars I know it's our entry yeah now it's fucking you know people let found a storage box what's in the storage box yeah yeah but there's a lot of good stuff in there I bet the nuttin in the war after the break yeah yeah I wonder what how much you take for that but 500 I can't give you five I need three yeah I gotta get at least four I don't know that's a commercial a narrative art I take this my last offer and I'll be in a serious cut to commercial Wow wonder what his last offers gonna be he got him down to three I wish I could
