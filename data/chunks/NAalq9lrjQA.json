three two one boom and we're live hello Godfather how are you sir good to see you buddy you too thank you for having me again my pleasure what's up what's up with you well before we start I'm doing well people ask me how do you define wealth you define wealth when you're young daughter before you step on the Joe Rogan platform writes this to you she wrote I love you that's very cute that's wealth I'm a billionaire yeah it's valuable wouldn't say it's wealth I think we're not being accurate with your words by the way I will probably keep this forever board you should yeah definitely don't put in your pocket what if you sweat on it yeah so we were talking right before the podcast started about what I was just talking about in the previous podcast about patreon and what patreon has done 2d platformer sargon of akkad and what I think we both agree was sloppy use of language on his part but he well I don't believe he was saying something racist he was using a racist word though it was using it to describe someone he was actually using it against white nationalists and against white supremacist and saying how ridiculous they were being and that they were being exactly what they described and when they're using racist terms to describe black people but he did it using those terms and it it wasn't a good speech like what he said and one of the things that I'd said on the previous podcast is when you do podcast you're not mapping out what you're going to say you're free flowing sometimes words come out clunky and and I think that was with what was going on in the case with him in this particular conversation that he had there wasn't even on his page and patreon decided to ban him and I think for him that was something to tune of like twelve thousand dollars or more a month yeah so quite a bit of his income you know a lot of us then suggested that people move to subscribe star which was a another platform that came out of nowhere and they've now been shut down how'd they get shut down I don't know the details so I hope I'm not miss speaking but I think PayPal and stripe decided that somehow they're violating you know their terms of their Terms of Service for whatever reason and apparently any payouts that have gone out are safe but you it won't happen through PayPal or through stripe so you have to find some alternate platform I think Payoneer or something yeah so it's getting difficult to to even receive the generous donations from people so a lot of people that are doing podcasts and doing these YouTube shows they operate on donations which is a really fair way to do things because your if say if you have a subscription-based service and you are asking people like say for Sirius satellite radio or something like that you might not be happy with the content and you might you might choose to cancel your subscription but these people can get what they get already for free right they choose to donate because they think it's valuable to them which is really interesting I like that that format that model because for the longest time people are trying to figure out how could you make money off the internet well the idea was advertising revenue and sam harris has a lengthy rant it's very accurate about this that he puts on his podcast often it's like a seven minute rant explaining why he doesn't use ads and why he prefers to have people just donate what they were like and he was one of the biggest patreon people he was one of the biggest accounts on patreon he pulled his patreon two days ago right and you know that was a huge statement because to him that is incredibly valuable I'm really curious to know what jack conte the founder of the of patreon what his ultimate trajectory is going to be as someone who would teach his psychology decision-making who studies decision-making who's housed in a business school I'm I think it would be a wonderful case analysis down the road probably Harvard will teach it of whether he just doubles down which it seems like this is what they're doing cuz they released a statement that didn't seem to suggest that there was any sort of possibility of reflection on their part do you have a sense of whether the the market will allow him to sort of realign his thinking or do you think he's just going to double down all the way to hell I think he's gonna weather the storm if I'm gonna be completely honest not what I would like what I would like is for them to support free speech and for them to make a differentiation between what is actual hate speech and what is a clunky use of language which is what I think Sargon did right it was a clunky use of language and I think Sargon is a very intelligent guy I've had him on the podcast I've talked to him he's very bright and he had on this show settled it makes great point yeah he's a very smart guy when he was on it's just well he's on someone else's show doing that you know I felt like and this is one of the things I said in the last podcast I feel like if people decide that what he did was offensive to them to the point where they decided to not renew their subscriptions or not continue to send him money through patreon that's probably the best use of that format and the best way for them and the market to decide that's really I think how it should be done incidentally regarding the N word and I'm sure Jamie will now double check what I'm saying as he always does there was a Dean at some University I think out maybe in Seattle I could be wrong that at some point had suggested someone had asked which book a student asked which book should I read or I kind of the exact story and I think the title of the book was the n-word and she had I think the Dean was a was a woman right if I'm not mistaken had simply recommended that book but she said the word outloud said that and she he or she I can remember again the person's sex got into trouble so you know I wonder if we shouldn't just sort of demystify this word I mean if if if people weren't so I mean we have to now say the n-word right we have to say the r-word I got banned from Twitter for 12 hours because at one point I was interacting with some schmuck who I called retarded degenerate fuck whatever it was I came up with the exact combination of insults and I was banned for using the r-word hmm so I mean where does this end I mean what how many more words do we have to remove from the lexicon I mean don't give these words so much power don't don't be so sensitive I mean I know we've talked about these kinds of issues in the past but does it not seem too outrageous that someone who recommends a book with the title being the n-word gets into trouble and it's insane well there's even better one Netflix there was an executive at Netflix that was forced to resign due to my friend Tom Segura's comedy special and my friend Tom Segura has a bit in his act about how there's certain words that are just gone you can't use anymore and he says retard he's like that word you can't use that word anymore and he goes on it's not about using that word he what he's basically he's not like he's not justifying the use of the word he's just simply stating that this is a word that you could no longer use so they get attacked a bunch of letter-writing campaign from mental health organizations and you know people dealing with people that have disabilities and they're saying that your your being able list and you're being discriminatory and all these different things and they're basically trying to silence him even though if you look at the actual bid itself he's not using it to describe a person he's just essentially acknowledging that the word exists so this guy who's an executive at netflix says in a meeting you can't use that word because that word it's like saying nigger around black people just says that you're gonna get in trouble now no I said it in the earlier show - I'm just saying when I read sargon of our cards thing like I said it's preposterous to say the n-word and I've said the n-word before and in most cases I will but he actually said the word and the reason why he said the word the reason why I just said the word is because he was trying to demonstrate like that this is an offensive thing like saying retard is just like saying that he gets fired for that for simply making this comparison that you know and we're talking about uncensored stand-up comedy by the way this is a network that features that word prominently on several different comedy specials in multiple situations whether it's Katt Williams multiple uses of the word Dave Chappelle I mean that word gets thrown about like a beach ball at a fucking concert that word gets tossed around a lot but this guy's saying it because he's white like 'i enough of your work here sir speaking of comedy and sort of political correctness with comedy and in my forthcoming book i have a section where I talk about professors who got into trouble I mean we've all heard about the comedian's getting into trouble for violating some politically correct victim but professors many cases very very high-profile professors getting in trouble for incredibly innocuous jokes and actually I brought a list of names because I thought I might not remember them can I mention if you saw a few the cases so Lazar Greenfield who was the president-elect of the American College of Surgeons and the editor in chief of a journal called surgery news had written an editorial a few years ago where he was talking about the antidepressant benefits of coming in contact with sperm in other words it and this was based on a peer-reviewed scientific paper actually two of the authors of that paper are folks that I know quite well friends of mine and they had demonstrated that women who have protected sex versus unprotected sex end up scoring differently on these depressive measures in other words there was some sort of protective element to actually being exposed to sperm and so in his editorial he made a joke it was during Tynes he said so now there is a gift that a man can give a woman that's beyond flowers or chocolates or something to that effect he had to step down from being president of the American College of Surgeons he had to step down from being editor-in-chief because a whole bunch of women were very offended by that sperm joke now the the the authors of the paper in question wrote a brilliant response response where they said how how could he be treated in this way when all he was doing is actually literally reporting the data the findings from our peer-reviewed study so that's one example another example is certain I think it's third Tim Hunt who was a Nobel Prize winner in 2001 right who he basically he was a speaking at yet in Korea at a you know women in science conference where he very in a jocular way said you know it's a real problem when you have women in your lab they fall in love with you you fall in love with them and so it's better to have segregated labs his wife by the way is a staunch feminist who was a very prominent scientist and she confirmed that he's hardly you know a rabid sexist he went through all sorts of hell yeah I remember that and he was joking and he was joking and and and I and in the book I discussed several other the other of these examples so so imagine you would think that a unblemished exemplary career as a scientist up to getting a Nobel Prize could potentially protect you but one comment that someone decides can can unleash the tsunami of outrage and you're dead well I think the problem is reacting to the people that are reacting to the common right it's not the common itself it's the cowards that are running things that give in to that and the Netflix thing is particularly disturbing because it was internal it was people that were working in this department that apparently went and protested and they just decided that his use was egregious and he shouldn't be able to say those sounds with his face yeah see I I get a lot of letters from people asking me well you know I'm facing this in my situation what should I do professors out I my answer is fight back hard so I've had a couple of these situations I had a guy on Twitter the guy at the guy whom I referred to as a retard started started contacting my University trying to get me fired when when it wasn't working with his tagging my University on Twitter he actually contacted the HR department human resources department at my university this is a random person it's a troll you got in touch with the troll and you gave him what he wanted attention and then he started to run with it you basically gave him an opportunity to score he's playing a video game exactly but now here's what happened the the university's HR person contacts me after hours I mentioned this actually recently on the Rubin report the the the the lady in question contacts me to say look here's a complaint that's been filed against you now my first react instinct was Oh someone in my job as a professor at the university has complained about me which I couldn't think who that would be but I would think that that's where the the template of their influence over me would reside no they had actually taken seriously a random person on Twitter contacting them and filing a complaint under the guise of he's a student well he's not my student right I mean if a student costs me in an alley to mug me I can't fight back because bruh he's a student or I'm allowed to to deck him right so this is a guy that I'm just having fun with I mean I'm doing it with a smile we're going back and forth decides that he's willing to go as far as try to get me fired now that's suppose that he had succeeded let's suppose that I hadn't fought back because basically what I did with the University I said are you literally thinking that it is reasonable for you to be monitoring what I do on my Twitter account and the example I gave her as an analogy I said if if I see you coming out of the pharmacy with your daughter and I feel that you're speaking to her in a curt manner that I don't agree with as a parent can I report you to the University and that pretty much ended the conversation very quickly but the fact that they felt sufficiently in Boldin to actually reach out to me to address this complaint shows you how chilling the environment is it is right but let's play devil's advocate sure if I was someone who was taking your class or if I was someone who is very sensitive or someone who has certain ideals or morals and the professor who's teaching in the class that I take called somebody a retard I would I mean just being honest and I love you they that I would I would say why is this guy doing that like that's a stupid thing to do like why are you engaging with these people online and these right these base insults like that just tasteful insults fair enough why engage with people like that I mean literally the reason I do it is once in a while my wife falls asleep I don't feel like working on my scientific papers or my book crime or whatever I'm tired and I'm on Twitter and I hated your advice to try to not engage with people some idiot catches might oh gee I use the word idiot strangers okay okay so so someone someone or word catches my attention and I decide to spar with them you you like to get into the Octagon and do MMA sparring I go on Twitter and I have fun with some idiot right but and I just enjoy it and usually we both laugh it off and we move on it's just part of my personality right I'm a fun guy I could be deadly serious and very academic and scientific and as you've correctly pointed in the past I could not take myself seriously and be just one of the guys so this is a manifestation of that now that this person felt sufficiently embolden and his indignation that he would try to fire me that's where you should be focusing on is sort of I don't think that's real I don't think he really felt so emboldened I think what it was is he recognized that there's a climate today where a person like yourself who's a professor who uses a certain word that is deemed to be offensive by society that he can call you on that word and get you caught right you got caught up in a net of your own doing sir well I'm still here smiling and lifting sounds so that's okay do you do look down do you regret using that word that more than anything I would bread that I ever get sucked into these baths yeah that's that's it's as much more because again it's a slippery slope today it's retard tomorrow it's more on the next day it's schmuck yeah well that is true in terms of like where people don't understand calling someone a retard like say if you're a thirty year old person today or twenty-five year old person let's try 25 you realize that that is a forbidden taboo war when you and I were 25 that word was nothing right that word you would get called it by your teacher right I mean it's true man that was anyway and it was known to be someone who was retarding your growth or retarding the class or saying things that were retarding development of ideas and and logic moving forward you're you're you're a road block you're a pile of rocks in the road right you fucking retard that's how people talked about it like that's how they said it but then it's become a new word that's victim to this war on words if you're not saying you have down syndrome right what you're saying is you're a dumb person you know and that terminology like especially the word retarded it is not even used medically right so it's it's not a word and the to say that there's no nuance and this word cannot be used again about a really stupid fucking person crying you know I as you know you probably know because I've sent you some clips of my infinite soccer skills I used to be a very serious soccer player yeah now if you you know this as someone who moves into MMA there's a lot of trash-talking right so that the amount of now I understand now I'm a professor and so on but the amount of trash-talking that I both dished out and was the recipient of actually allowed me to be a better person today it's a form of antifragility right I mean by yeah so so when you create a sanitized environment you're creating a fragile system you're creating fragile human beings so if if the if the worst stain in my 54 years on earth is that I use the word retard on this purse and I'm doing pretty well well I'm sure it's not the worst day but yeah it's not that big it's not that big a deal the only reason why it's a big deal is cuz the climate right you know what you're saying is this is a stupid person you're not accusing him of having you're not mocking a mental disease or a disorder genetic disorder it's not what you're saying and everybody knows that but they just decided that this is a new word that is now taboo a new sound you can't make with your face ya want to move on to other sure so first I wanted to say that I was very excited last year it's completely different this is a very hard Segway with last year one of my former professors at Cornell won the Nobel Prize in Economics that's pretty powerful yeah yeah at the first semester at Cornell I took his course his name is Richard Thaler maybe you should continue inviting him here I don't know if he does a lot of these podcasts but he should do your podcast he won the Nobel Prize for really the the area that I started off in before I you know developed all the evolutionary stuff that I'm most known for I came out of a tradition called behavioral decision theory is that was that ring a bell at all of you do you know what that is at all not totally No so classical economists have this if you like stylized Homo economicus this vision of how someone who is rational ought to behave and there are these axioms of rational choice so for example if I prefer car a to car B and I prefer car B to car C I must prefer car a to car see that's it that's called the transitivity action someone who doesn't abide by this is behaving irrationally if I tell you what do you think of this hamburger that has ninety percent fat free it's the same thing as telling you that this hamburger has ten percent fat those are two isomorphic statements it shouldn't alter your preference yet we see repeatedly that people don't behave in the manners prescribed by classical economic theory by homework analogous solar is the gentleman who demonstrated how many of these actions of rational choice are violated in behavioral finance and for that he won the No and economics and he came after the ones who originally wanted in 2002 Daniel Kahneman you probably know his book Thinking Fast and Slow Zyra novella yes right so Daniel Kahneman and his collaborator Amos Tversky were the pioneers of that field and that's really the tradition that I came out of my doctoral supervisor was part of that gang of guys who spent their careers demonstrating that classical economists are wrong in my case I became frustrated with that whole paradigm because it became clear that yes economists have it wrong how many more demonstrations can we show that they are wrong I was much more interested in knowing why the brain is structured the way that it is and hence that's how I got into evolutionary theory but I just thought that I would give him a shout out since he was a former professor of mine that's pretty awesome I'm just happy there's people out there trying to figure these things out yeah so I can read what they say and repeat it I know what I'm talking about I want to go back to targeted things being fragile and anti fragile I mean I think that's a really important point to develop and I don't mean develop thick skin like become accustomed to racism or sexism or homophobia or rudeness it's just I'm not saying that we should just tolerate those things and we shouldn't seek to improve our culture we definitely should but as a human being this celebration of all things triggering this getting upset at every single thing that comes your way and making it out to be some massive complication I think it's a direct result of how easy society is and how simple our lives are and I mean complicated in intellectual ways complicated in emotional ways complicated in psychological ways to think a lot of the way people live their life is very unnatural but simple in terms of not worrying about predators not worrying about real violence not worrying about real strife never worrying about food I mean it's very rare that people in this culture in this day and age are starving right you know it's which is what a huge problem for most of human civilization most of human civilization people had a to find food now for the most part it's very rare right and I think all these things have led us to seek enemies where there are none and to go out and find these problems that really are not that big and make them out to be huge right because they're fragile I mean you know this the idea that let's one of the the reasons why I like that expression snowflake like some some people get really upset if you throw that word snow the idea is that every snowflake is unique and special right right that's the idea and that you you are unique and special maybe maybe you're just lazy that's true too you know this is this is maybe you're an artwork yes I couldn't say that either I could link what I just mentioned about classical economists to the social justice warrior ethos so classical economists viewed the human condition through very cold calculational calculus you certainly like humans are these they they instantiate these algorithms without any emotions right if I prefer call a tow car be a car beater car seat I much prefer car to car see it's all axioms of rational choice there are no emotions in these models at the other end of that continuum lies the social justice warrior because all of life is through only the triggering of the emotional system there is no engagement with your cognitive resources it's all about outrage anger frustration and so in a sense they're antithetical to each other the classical economists in his worldview there are no emotions the social justice warrior in his world view there is no cognition of course the the right way to be is somewhere in the middle the right way to be is to know when to engage your cognition and when to engage your emotions yeah it's not the issue right is that there's always the middle and that things are rarely black and white or one and zero are often very complicated well Aristotle going back to Aristotle had argued about sort of what we now with color I would call the inverted u-shape so for example if more things the middle is the right place to be all things in moderation right if you have too little of something it's not good if you have too much of something it's not good somewhere in the middle is where the right virtue is and Aristotle had thought of that several thousand years ago I'll give you a specific example I'm I'm not sure if I've mentioned that before in this podcast perfectionism right follows an inverted u-shape if you have too little of it you're not sufficiently detail-oriented your work suffers if you have too much of it which I'm happy not happy I'm this place to report is me then it could be stunting because I check my work seventy three thousand times before I sent it off because God forbid I might have a comma wrong that so there is some happy medium of perfect on the perfectionism scale where we should all strive to be well Aristotle said that for most traits that's where the optimal is that's where the inflection point is hmm that makes sense I mean I'm not one argue against Aristotle I thought you would say you're not one side against me but YouTube I'm not one to argue against either one of you I just think most issues that people are arguing for or against one of the real problems is that they are married to their initial point yeah and they argue that looking for a victory they're trying to move a ball across the line and they do it by any means necessary right including by mislabeling people by mischaracterizing your positions on things and and categorizing you and some really easy to dismiss place like you are all right or you're right you know you're a fringe right person or I mean how many people have been called a Nazi over the last couple of years you've been called a Nazi so when I was supposed to speak in August 2017 at a event titled the stifling of free speech on University campuses it was on a university campus it was shut down the irony was larious it was with myself Jordan Peterson another clinical psychologist or an Hamid and faith called a journalist anyways and then we held the event about three months later but the people who shut us down had put out a Facebook page where they said we don't want these white supremacists Nazis in Toronto this is to a Jewish person who escaped persecution in Lebanon so yeah that's it's insane it's cute it's cute it is I mean they can't they can't be honest you know I mean this is not they don't honestly believe what they're saying but they don't care because they're just trying to move that ball right and the fact that that's tolerated and that not just tolerated but it actually influenced your speech and you guys weren't allowed to put on that event I mean with shame shame on the University for giving in you shame on them for not putting their foot down shame on them for not examining who you are who Jordan is who any of those people are yeah and realize you know you're lying you you are a problem you calling these people white supremacist and Nazis you're a problem and you're a liar and you're defaming these / this is defamation this is your libel this is terrible what you're doing is something that we should shun but I think it speaks to what you said earlier when you said it's all about winning getting the ball of process.i and that's another thing that I talk about in the book is the difference between the aunt illogical ethics and consequentialist ethics the ontology collects is where you have moral absolutes it is always wrong to lie that would be the intelligible statement the consequentialist bent would be well it depends on what the consequences of the lie is if it were to spare someone's feelings then it might have been okay to lie right yeah and so I argue that a lot the problem with a lot of these enemies of Reason is that they have a consequentialist relationship with truth right it doesn't matter if you violate truth if there is some greater goal that you're pursuing whereas I come from a deontological perspective when it comes to truth truth is truth no matter who whose feelings it hurts and so I truly think certainly as a scientist you truly have to have a deontological relationship with truth this is precisely why when a lot of people asked me do you think that there is for a bit and I think we even mentioned that last time I was on your show 16 months ago is there any forbidden knowledge that you shouldn't do as a scientist and my answer is always an unequivocal no as long as you are a honest adherent to the scientific method you should be allowed to traverse any intellectual landscapes intellectual landscapes can be problematic when they deal with things that are very uncomfortable for people and what big one is IQ right that's a giant one and that one has triggered so many accusations of racism and well there was a there was a gentleman I just covered him on my on my youtube channel I don't know who he is his name is I think Noah Carl he's a young I think postdoc at Cambridge University who from all I know you know is a very reasonable gentleman who had been invited to speak at a conference on intelligence and because of that a bunch of folks decided to put together an open letter arguing that Cambridge University should not hire this guy and so on this has now become the standard way by which the Bates are resolved you you signed these open letters so for had another guy on and you should definitely check this this guy out his name is Alessandro stroma he is a physicist do you know this case no he's a physicist at the University of Pisa who is also a was a research scientist at CERN the the nuclear research center in Geneva he was invited to speak at a gender and theoretical physics conference everything is about identity politics and of course the narrative was going to be you know women are discriminated against in physics and you know we need to help them you know improve their lot in physics and so on so he got up and he presented bibliometric data so let me just for your viewers explain what that is if the Oh metric data is is data that quantifies science so for example if I want to know which discipline sites which other discipline I will look at citation patterns across disciplines does economics ever cite physics as physics ever cites economics right so bibliometric data is a way to parameterize science and so what he did is he looked at for a given job in physics if a woman gets a job versus if a man gets a job how many citations did they have citation is basically how many other people have cited your work when you published it so you and I might have have published 50 papers each but you've been cited ten thousand times I've been cited two thousand times therefore your work is more influential even though we've both published the same amount of papers and he showed through very objective data that for a given position women were getting the jobs at much lower citations well that was construed as terribly offensive terribly sexist you know nazi-like and so over 1,600 scientists using the the appellation particles for justice i'm not making this up wise you can go to articles for just young Jamie can check it out yeah and you can you can read their letter and it includes I think one or two of your former guests who have become a very anti fan of anti fan not antifa because to me they're they're sounding like intellectual cows and fools who were these people I think one of them is Sean Carroll you know that is I think you know sure it's been on several Tom yeah so he's on that list and I don't know I don't want to misspeak but I think maybe Neil deGrasse Tyson is on it but maybe not so that one that one I'll hold off on though but definitely Sean Carroll is on it because I've even tagged him and I said hey come on my show let's discuss it so the letter was basically it starts off and it says we will not tolerate that someone within our community I'm paraphrasing will question the humanity of anyone based on their race their gender their gender orientation he did no such thing all he did was report bibliometric data to either support contention that women in physics were being discriminated against or not that should not yield an open letter that chastises and the way that they did now the only thing that he did incorrectly in my view and he's admitted to it he came on my show recently at one point during the presentation he showed his bibliometric profile versus two other women that had gotten a job over him so he personalized it anywhere and in doing that some people thought that that was inappropriate and that's fair maybe it's not a nice thing to do to present you know your CV versus someone else in a public conference maybe we can discuss that but the idea that we can't use bibliometric objective scientific data to either prove or disprove a narrative is insane and yet 1,600 people decided to sign that letter that does seem ridiculous especially when it's an accusatory narrative this you're accusing people of sexual discrimination and then this the the scientific data shows otherwise exactly but they're looking for a quality of outcome right they're looking for an equal amount of female physicists and on the mountain and that's you just you're not gonna get an equal amount of people interested in it so then you what you really have to show is you have to determine that there's been something that's holding those people back from achieving that goal there's some sort of a concerted effort to keep living out of that field that's what should be demonstrated and when you demonstrate that I think here's the here's the glass half-full version of that you're looking at that but blue bibliometric data what that shows is that people are encouraging women to get into this that it's the opposite right that instead of them being held back they're actually they're there looking to even out the playing field and help these women along the problem with that is then it makes it look like the women aren't as capable as thematic so they're not as effective as the men with their work and you know that's bad for everybody that's bad for women in for men it's bad for science because it makes it look like you're not being objective which is what all we want every everyone who's not a scientist like myself what I want more than anything is to know that you if you're a scientist I want to know that what you're telling me is a fact what I don't want is your own political spin on that fact because you don't want to be criticized at work by radical feminists or radical leftists or any people that might in some way potentially misconstrue your actions and your thoughts as being sexist or whatever feeling of like homophobic transphobic whatever whatever the fuck it is that you're scared of I don't want to hear that what I want to hear is that you're looking at reality right there are brilliant women out there there's brilliant men out there and a lot of those brilliant women choose not to do the same fields as brilliant men and as long as no one's holding them back that shouldn't be a problem the problem is gotta be in someone being held back someone discriminating someone trying to keep you out and you you're gonna have to demonstrate that and I'm sure that exists I'm sure that it exists I'm sure there's women out there that are hearing this right now that have experienced all sorts of discrimination sexual discrimination sexual harassment and they have their own personal stories this is true but that not is not necessarily why the data reflects that there's more men that are successful at this it could seriously this is this is what people are really uncomfortable with seriously represent that there's differences in the sexes right and I know that's so hard well listen so hard from the first time I think that I came on your show when I probably first discussed my you know evolution psychology research I mean it's a fundamental tenet of evolutionary theory that there are sexual dimorphism right when I appear in front of the Canadian Senate I had to sit there and lecture these senators that there is such a thing as male or female but meanwhile while many of them scoffed and laughed and tried to mock me it turns out a few days ago there's now an elementary school you're teaching young kids that boys to menstruate so literally every satirical every I always joke I always say that I have prophetic satire because every time I try to look for something that is so outlandish that it can enter into my you know satire two months three months eight months later it proves to be true so for example at one point I argued that I wanted to compete in the octogenarian under 120 pound Gouri in judo because you identify first because identifies 1825 and also I'm trans gravity I I set my weight you know whatever my weight is therefore and then because I can change my identity on a daily basis because Harvard University taught us that I'm later going to fight in the under eight-year-old category hold on Harvard allows you to change it on a daily basis University came out that's actually discussed this in my Canadian Senate testimony Harvard University's lgbtqa+ stars versus our infinite to the hashtag Mersenne Prime exactly they came out with a pamphlet that said not only can we change you know our gender identity but it can fluctuate on a daily basis right so I could be he/she gear Monday Tuesday Wednesday right so I took this idea and I said well III don't afire as an eighty-year-old under 120 pound Monday but then I'm going to fight in the judo competition I used Judah because my brother was an Olympian in judo as I figure out of this yes I'm going to fight and the under 8 category on Tuesday because I self-identify on Tuesday as being a child now it sounds satirical and insane a Dutch gentleman who's 69 years old did you know this case it's trans ageism he just he decided that he identifies with someone 20 years younger and he wants to use it on dating yeah exactly and then that would change his pension thing well whatever it was so so I mean we're then then I introduce a new term and then that proved to be prophetic ELISA satirical I coined a new condition called transgenderism by proxy so so if if if you're watching now enjoy this if Joe and God have sex if I self identify you as a woman then I'm engaging in heterosexual sex so it's not about me self identify me yeah I sigh I can change my identity Tyson your own interpretations exactly so it's not it's not that my self-identity changes into a woman the the guy that I'm having sex with I self-identify as a female uh well a few weeks maybe not even a few weeks later some trans activists on Twitter came out and said you disgusting transphobes just because you have excuse the term a dick in your mouth doesn't mean that that's a dick if it's a woman and I call this trans the cunnilingus it doesn't mean it's a dick if that person woman is a woman so just because you have a dick in your mouth it doesn't mean it's a dick because that's a woman you are giving sex to a woman do you know yeah there's a nine-inch penis in your in your thing but it's a vagina yeah I'll put they put tampons in the men's room yes sir of course I said not only women of course I have that's true that's my daily like that's called Tuesday for me man I have a hard time getting that out because I'm like why women aren't the only ones who men straight what yes they are yes they are god damn it what boys can have periods to children to be taught the latest victory for trendy there you go I love how they say that the latest victory that's right latest victory for who wrote that story who wrote that box who Elena hey Elena fuck off that's not a victory that's nonsense that is goddamn nonsense but can I tell you what's not victory that's crazy kids kids don't know if you want to tell kids that sometimes people are born in the wrong body that seems to be true there seems to be real evidence to that in terms of the way the brain works sure I mean you if you want to call it the problem is distinguishing it from normalcy in a way that makes it look inferior right right there's no there are real problems so if someone has this condition they shouldn't feel inferior and you shouldn't be bigoted towards them and they shouldn't live being exposed to any discrimination right but we shouldn't change our understanding of reality to celebrate your unique person hood exactly and incidentally one of the things I talk about in the book all of these idea pathogens I argue some of them come from really noble places I think so as well yeah so let's cover few DS so for example the empty slate premise tabula rasa were born with empty minds is a profoundly idiotic position but it really stems from the noble hopeful position that if we're all born with equal potentiality we could all reach the same end trajectory if only the environment were conducive for us being top athletes top scientists top mathematicians then we would have reached it there is nothing inherently at the start at T equals zero that differentiates any of us now that's insanely stupid and wrong but it is a hopeful message now extend this to other contexts right it shouldn't be that you're defined by your biological sex you could change it in any way you want that sounds very liberating right so I think a lot of these idea pathogens what I call these these parasitic ideas really come from a notion of trying to liberate people from otherwise they're the shackles of reality so it's insane yeah it's a form of delusional thinking but that is rooted it's Genesis comes from a good place I couldn't agree with that more and gender dysphoria used to be considered used to be considered a mental disorder right but isn't it right well this is it but what is it okay let's be honest if it's not if it's is it a physical disorder what is it I'll put it in a very ok charitable politically correct way it's certainly not part of the default value of human expressions do you see what I'm saying yes male and female is the default values we are a sexually dimorphic species now for all sorts of reasons ontogenetic developmental reasons when the brain is getting typed in utero things can happen that alter those default values now you come out with gender dysphoria you shouldn't be discriminated against you should be treated with complete respect you should be free of bigotry aggress mean that there is a spectrum of possibilities of which that one is one of the default values it simply isn't it's wrong to argue that but in the same way that feminists like to argue that there are no innate sex differences because that they think would help alter the sexist status quo this is what's happening with trans activism that's why they are consequentialist when it comes to truth screw truth screw reality screw biological common-sense in the pursuit of freeing the world of bigotry you should be able to free the world of bît-yakin bigotry without constantly attacking truth well and here's the other question if it is not this is what I was getting at if it is if if it's not a mental disorder what is is it a physical disorder is it a disorder at all and if it's not a disorder why must it be treated medically why must it be gender reassignment surgery why must there be exogenous hormones introduced into the body why is all that happening rhetorical question are you asking me but just to them I mean it's kind of rhetorical there's no one here but if it's not a disorder then why are these gender reassignment physicians here you if you don't have to have a sex change to be a woman if you're a woman with a big dick and broad shoulders and a big hairy chest but you're a woman right well what is the need for the doctor then if you're already a woman if we decided you're a woman so you just want to change your appearance to outwardly match how you feel inwardly well the exact seems a disorder well right there and I wonder I'm not sure so I don't want to misspeak but I wonder if I think in the dsm-5 gender dysphoria is listed as a condition is that is that correct it is listed as a condition but it's not accepted by that in in terms of like public perception and certainly in terms of trans activists or LBGT activists or anybody who talks about these things in a progressive way that is of taboo like the actual medical nomenclature that's used to describe those conditions is taboo well there's I don't know if you heard about this case there was a physician research scientist at Brown University who published a paper very serious data scientific data I think her name is Lisa limp allure lippel I can't remember her name it was published I think in plus one you know very serious scientific where she looked at the social contagion of sort of transgenderism how if you know there definitely seems to be well well literally that a social contagion effect now that paper was published Brown had advertised it it was published in a top peer-reviewed journal well the trans activists came after that paper and Brown decided to at least pull it off of it's sort of promotional key I reached out actually to a thing her name is Lisa to get her on the show but as you might imagine she was a bit that's it yeah she's probably shell-shocked she shall shot and so I'm not sure if she'll come but again here's a serious person who probably is a as liberal she's and she's a physician who deals with these issues who were simply talking about the fact that there's definitely a social contagion effect that is taking place she's a Nazi yeah there's people are just really really crazy when it comes to gender that seems to be the battleground the battleground between logic and science it rests and gender and I had this conversation with a friend of mine about the the gender pay gap and he was arguing it as if it was a thing where there was a man and a woman working right next to each other doing the same job and the woman was making 78 cents the man was making a dollar and he's a smart guy and I had to explain them I said this is not the case I go there they're doing different jobs they're working different hours I go you're spitting out propaganda as if it's true and he was reluctant to believe me you know he was like are you serious I'm he and he Leary said this he was I'm gonna be very upset if I find out that you're you're lying to me I go that I'm lying to you I go this is adorable you're gonna be you don't even know what the fuck you're talking about and you're gonna be upset if you find out that I'm lying I'm gonna be upset if you don't fuckin apologize to me when I show you this so that is oh I know he did not I sent him the information I sent him many articles on it and I sent him many critiques of the way even the president the United States was discussing this because they're doing in a very politically correct way that is actually disingenuous I showed him the actual raw data that shows that men work an average of I forget what the percentage is more hours that they they're more likely to die on the job they pick more risky jobs it's a totally different thing this is not discounting actual sexual discrimination at work which I'm sure exists but this is not when you're looking at the raw data which is what they're trying to say the 78 cents to a dollar they're saying this is just systemic sexism across the board there's no other explanation for it so I showed him no there is other explanations form it's different jobs it's working different hours it's there's probably a bunch of factors testosterone making you more aggressive making you more risk of a more risk-taker risk-taking there's all sorts of different factors his response was sometimes the perception of something is as important as the fact I'm like you motherfucker I'm gonna come to your house and smack you in the face in front of your woman you know but it's it's interesting that you say this because what you are trying to do there is is use information hopefully it's tsunami of information to get him to move away from his anchored position which is something that I discuss in great detail in my book and I think I've come to a similar realization to you regrettably and that that is that oftentimes all the information in the world is not going to help yeah he didn't want to lose he didn't want to lose yeah and it really is you're putting your hands in your lalala oh he was trying to find a way to say by him saying that perception is sometimes more important than the actual facts I was trying to say he was trying to say that women are discriminated against because these facts are paraded around in a way that make women feel bad right and because women feel bad that they're making 78 cents of the man's dollar that is just as important as the actual reality of how much they make oh my god damn it this is you just spun a web you spun a bullshit web and your legs are all trapped up in it you can't go anywhere now well it speaks to another thing that I discuss in the book so you are you familiar with poppers falsification principle no so Karl Popper was a philosopher of science as a general rule I hate to read most philosophers because they engage in a lot of highfalutin bullshit that really doesn't get us anywhere but philosophers of science actually are quite helpful that they really help us understand the epistemology of how to learn about knowledge create knowledge test knowledge and so Karl Popper argued that if you really want to test a theory you have to be able to falsify the theory that which cannot be falsified cannot be considered a scientific theory right if the observation is this way it supports the theory if the observation is this way it falsifies the theory so for example fate is not a scientific theory right because if I step out of my house today and the truck hits me it was my faith if I step out of my house and the truck doesn't hit me there was my faith so there are no conditions of the world where whatever is instantiated is not my faith therefore fatalism is not part of you know the epistemology of science right well so to speak to that point that we were talking about earlier how once someone is anchored in a position you can't get them away from it so I talk and I have a section of my book that is currently titled all roads lead to bigotry all right so let me give you an example a few examples of these if you say that you don't wanna have sex with overweight women grossly overweight women 500-pound women then the argument is you're a fattest right you are judging us based on the folds of our skin and you're dehumanizing us if you are someone who is specifically looking to have sex with someone who is overweight you are fetishizing our skin fold so if I love having sex with a fat woman I'm a bad person if I don't want to have sex with a fat woman I'm a bad person and I demonstrate through many of these examples how all roads lead to victimhood right I give the example I think the last time I was on the show of a woman who had done a study demonstrating that soldiers Israeli soldiers had never raped a Palestinian woman do you remember that case now she what she had done the study hoping to show that there was rampant rape of Palestinian women she couldn't uncover a single documented case of a Palestinian woman being raped by IDF soldiers Israeli Defense Forces soldiers what did she conclude from that well the IDF soldiers are so racist that they dehumanize these women so much that they're not even worthy of being raped so if you rape the Palestinian women you're an evil Jew if you don't rape any of the Palestinian women you're an evil Jew and so through all of these examples I demonstrate that all states of the world lead to you being a bigot and that if you like fails poppers falsification principle except yeah except the state of not choosing at all meaning meaning if you like if you don't choose between a fat woman or if you don't love a fat woman or you don't not want to have sex with a fat one you just have sex with anyone who wants up second right like that's the equal outcome I mean essentially that's what they're looking for right because if you don't choose but what's really interesting about people is if someone doesn't have your principles ideologically you're allowed to shit on them and body shame them like how many people called Trump disgusting and made fun of his little hands and how many liberals left-wing people's talking about how much much much he had must obviously have a little dick right right it's like yeah it's horseshit yeah I mean hypocrisy is across both aisles right yeah speaking of it I don't want to get into this at all but what did you think I know it's a bit old news now but what do you think of some of our common friends is response to the Cavanaugh situation our common friends responses some of some of our common friends I thought did not respond well they did not follow the intelligible ethos as far as I'm concerned like for example so for example the presumption of innocence should be something that is so profoundly a non-starter in terms of ever violating that that tenant okay that to the extent that we didn't come infinitely close to establishing that he was guilty of anything it's a non-starter that you don't there is no repercussions that should befall him and yet many folks that both of us know were not of that opinion so for example one of the one of our friends thought that well this wasn't a criminal case this was a job interview and so we don't need to reach the same exacting level of evidence evidence to determine for him to be potentially guilty I thought that was grotesque who said that his name rhymes with sham Paris well I think people were rightly concerned about Cavanaugh's ideology in terms of his record on privacy his promotion of the Patriot Act there was a bunch of issues that people had real concern those seemed to go away while this was all going on it was really confusing to me like there's real reasons to be concerned about this guy the Jordan Jordan said put out a tweet and I might have been the first one to to critique him for it where he said if Cavanaugh is confirmed he should step down I thought that that was insane why what he said well I you know subsequently he said oh it was a thought experiment no there's no thought experiment right I mean there was I mean any sane person would think that someone coming out 36 years after the fact five minutes before there's going to be the vote saying well somewhere somehow someplace not sure he may have been the one he's not going to like she was saying he may have been the one she was saying he was the one and she was saying that he covered her mouth yeah and that he was trying to get her pants off but she was wearing a one-piece swimsuit right and yeah I read into it I don't know what happened that's there's a little problem I know one knows what happened other than her and him and both of them are dealing with 36 year old memories but I'm saying right here I've already said this on my show I remember I think it was in 1983 I was at some summer camp and Hillary Clinton took me to the side and had my way pretty sure it was 1983 maybe in 1984 she had her way with you yeah sure yeah I'm pretty sure it was Hillary pretty sure pretty kind of sure I'm kind of confident was her kinda yeah look Elizabeth Loftus who is someone that I know well who's a professor at UC Irvine who is the preeminent researcher on memory and I eyewitness testimony someone who has demonstrated through many many decades of research that our memory is unbelievably inaccurate unbelievable our ability to remember sort of to identify someone in a testimony four weeks ago is unbelievably suspect let alone 36 years ago that's true so where was the science let me pause because there are traumatic events that you can remember very well particularly if someone tries to assault you or something happens to you that did get seared into your brain that's a fact I mean I remember I remember being beat up when I was seven right I remember being humiliated my stepdad everyone wasn't really beat up by a kid he'll hit me like once or twice or something like that but I didn't do anything about it I froze and I remember my stepdad came and rescued me I remember that I don't remember all the details but I do remember that I felt humiliated and that I lost and I do remember that my stepdad how to rescue me I remember that right like you can remember stuff from 36 years ago it is it is possible but the problem with this story is that they were drinking they were underage they were really young okay so you're dealing with all these factors there was some sort of interaction physically you know was she somewhat willing was she somewhat into him was she completely resistant to it I don't know she doesn't know he doesn't know but there's no demonstrated pattern of him doing awful things and then on top of that there was a couple at least two people that had completely fraudulent claims right that came out and they were ideologically ideologically opposed to him so they had concocted these stories that turned out to fall apart here's my feeling on that if someone does that intentionally they should receive the same kind of punishment I could not agree with that someone would get yes if they were convicted of those acts there's an article on this I just a few of you falsely accused some on a rape intentionally falsely accuse someone a rape you are literally subjecting them to the punishment of rape what if the prosecution goes through what if that person winds up getting incarcerated locked in a cage separated from their family taking away their ability to earn a living you should be treated the same way you were trying to get them to be treated I think it is almost an equal act to rape itself you know I and I hope I almost I hope it's not doesn't have physical violence I'm gonna go further than you maybe it's gonna get me into trouble I almost would argue that it is more diabolical because the rapist does a horrific act on you once every single morning that you wake up as a false accuser knowing that you have put this person in prison and you go about your day you're engaging in this form of rape if you like so I would disagree with that because I think if you rape someone that person who got raped has to deal with that the real pain of being physically violated and the guy who's in prison for 25 years and getting raped by seven guys guys got to learn how to fight cuz your butt cheeks closed and keep moving man by the way both of them are awful I think the rapist is far more awful because it's physically doing something I had a guy on my show maybe you know I've had maybe not as many people as you have but I've had quite a few amazing people on my show one of the most poignant ones was a gentleman that I invited and I was lucky that he accepted my invitation was a I think his name is David McCallum McCallum so it may be last January he had Jeff he had been released from I think almost three decades in prison for a murder that came up that wasn't him who did it move now the reason why I invited him more than just because it's an incredible story is that I had seen his response to the unimaginable injustice that he had gone through I think he went in when he was 17 and now he was in his late 40s and he had such grace such lack of anger I mean it literally was he was Buddha and so I thought how powerful it would be to have this person come on my show if only to tap into this unbelievable ability I mean and I told him I think on the show that if it were me I would be so eaten up by anger a sense of revenge I want to burn the whole planet down anyways this is a great guy you should you should definitely check him out he's written a book about it's pretty amazing story yeah false accusations are awful and and and people who are people who lie to try to punish someone who didn't do anything that's an awful crime and I think it should be equal in punishment to the crime that you are falsely accusing someone of doing I really do I think that's the only way to stop it the real problem is with false rape accusations is that there's very little punishment at all that happens to the women for the most part or the men men who accused men of falsely raping them there's very very little happen why do you think that is I don't know I don't understand I don't understand why people don't think about it as the horrific thing that it actually is I think it's partly because people are afraid of doubting someone who has been raped if you what one of the more horrific things you could do is I imagine if you had been raped and then you told your story and I came along and I have no knowledge of the actual event and I come along and I go p--'s dad's a liar this is bullshit it never happened nothing happened to him he's just a baby he just wants attention so he's running around here he was wearing a short skirt and he went out that night and you know you know and that's that is something that does happen so I think that is so disgusting someone who doubts someone who has actually been a victim that people are scared of that and then also there's the kid gloves approach we don't treat women accusing men of things the same way we accuse women accuse you know men accusing women of things men accusing women of things we're if a man accuses a woman of violence whoops you okay dude you're gonna be fine if a woman beats up her husband which does happen I mean I know a guy whose girlfriend used to punch the shit out of him and and I was like bro you got to get out like you are you're literally being a beauty you're done being domestically abused and no one's even gonna care right do you understand like you got to get out of this relationship because look if you were hitting her if a man is hitting a woman Dan I'm locked that motherfucker up that's how I feel and I'm sure that's how you feel true that guy's a piece of shit first but if a woman hits a man I'm like just keep your hands up man don't let her hit ya it's like I just but this is from me a man whose friend was murdered by his wife one of my good friends Phil Hartman oh yes more hurted by his wife so demand this is a woman who was always insulting him always like publicly humiliation saw this during saw her publicly humiliated insult him I saw it many times she's a very angry person she had a cocaine problem she was also on Zoloft they want some sort of a settlement with Zola if the family did because she was doing cocaine and zoloft at the same time and it's known to have a psychotic reaction but she shot him in his fucking sleep man I mean women do commit violence it's not as common but it's still gross it's still an egregious crime but good luck trying to go to get someone locked up for it Wow good luck getting anybody to be sympathetic even me did you ever I mean not that I can hear well I met your wife she's a lovely woman I'm she kicked your ass I probably be on her side you're probably wondering how how is someone so gorgeous as her choose me that's you're out you're thinking that lovely Meryl thank you buddy oh I wanted to actually share with you and I was I was hoping to only discuss this for you to only see it in the book but I can't you opened me up Joe Rogan I can't help but cheer sorry I came close to probably being a victim of some very serious I have never been sexually abused or anything but I think I escaped one narrowly when I was a child in Lebanon oh so this was during the civil war and that this has all discussed in the intro to my forthcoming book it was during the height of the I mean the start of the civil war where nobody would leave the house I mean everybody's being butchered left trying to center we're trying to leave Lebanon for obvious reasons my father had been stuck out of the country he couldn't get back into Lebanon it was myself my mother I believe my sister was there and a male friend of ours who was stuck at our and in the middle of the night there's a knock on our door now this is in the middle of the most brutal civil war you could imagine so if somebody knocks at your door it's usually not a good thing and I go to the door to answer speaking about remembering you were saying earlier this is I'm 11 years old or at least at the cusp of turning 11 I get to the door who is this the gentleman says it's me I can't remember if his name was Amador Mohammad one of the two he says it's so and so who's this now at the time in Lebanon in our kitchen we had you remember how in restaurants in the old days you'd have these in the bathrooms you'd have these sort of towels that you could use to wipe your hands now yes not not disposable yeah actual cloth towels hmm so we had a service where this gentleman would come and in our kitchen we had one of these things he would pick them up launder them and then bring them back so this gentleman who that's our only relationship with him knocks at our door with some other guys and says hey open the door now this is in the middle of the Civil War knife at that moment I opened that door if I don't have the instinct to go call my mother I don't know what the trajectory would be so I go to get my mother and now the guy's growing more insistent we call anyways there's a whole interaction that takes place but we refuse to open the door for him at the time there was still some sort of police presence and Lebanon the the unit used to be called 16 in Arabic the number 16 maybe for the precinct or whatever we called them up they come over the guy comes in and the policeman says to him what are you doing here knocking on these people's door in the middle of civil war he says oh we went up to the mountains we brought some Palmer greats for them and so the policeman looks at him and says you don't know these people other than changing their towel in the middle of the spoodle Civil War you're coming here to give them these fruits if I ever catch you here again you know whatever and then the guy looks at us and says I'll be back for you or something that and within a week or two I can remember the exact time period we had left now I'm almost certain I don't know I'm surmising but I'm almost certain that this guy with his buddies was coming over not because he wanted to share a coffee and you know cookies and my feeling is some bad stuff would have happened that night but through the grace of the cosmos we were protected so because I've often been asked what was the scariest moment you had in the Civil War and there were many many many things that I saw but nothing scared me as much as that interaction because I sort of pretty much knew what was in store for us dehumanizing that happens during war leads to all sorts of horrific acts you know it's disgusting and scary you know you probably dodged a bullet I really did dodge a bullet and we're so fortunate to have left I've actually been asked to go back to Lebanon many times and at this point by you know some pretty prominent people big politicians and so on and I really have a mental block I even get Lebanese folks saying listen we we know people who will protect you and so on I - do you live in Canada now it's one of the greatest countries of the world's ever known well I go back yeah fuck that you guys come to me don't visit Toronto the fuck out of here you liked it I loved it that's one of my favorite cities you know one of the things I loved about it it's like a big city but the people are friendly like it's a small town right I don't know how the hell you guys pulled that off we're just good people do you feel do you feel a difference between Montreal and Toronto because I like Toronto better sorry Montreux you hurt me pool I do like what what is it that you don't like when we go I do love montreal montreal it is the conflict like the adventure English yeah that conflict seems to me totally ridiculous the idea that you're gonna secede yeah good luck yeah get you're gonna leave Canada okay congratulations gonna be your own country that nobody goes to right you're gonna make everybody speak French that's so stupid they make they put French signs everywhere I get they're trying to like cling on to their culture I get it and their culture is wonderful the food's fantastic there's great people Montreal beautiful women they're beautiful I love Montreal but I love to run no more sorry incidentally I'm I'm I learned French before I did English so I'm a more francophone through through history and I fully agree with you about the stupidity of the French protection so I I I was yeah I was invited once this was probably in the late 90s I had been a professor a few years I was invited by one of the big business schools in Montreal HEC which is a French acronym I've been invited to give a talk there they were interested in potentially making me an offer and so I said are you I'm assuming that I'm getting my talking in English right because I mean my whole scientific career has been in English even though I'm fluent in French so no no we'd really like you to give it in French and I thought that that was so payzone Pirozhki it was so small minded right I mean I mean you don't see Israeli people saying hey how come we're not doing this in Hebrew you don't see the Japanese saying why isn't this happening in Japanese right the two groups that I see doing this are the Germans and the French but whether it be in Quebec or in France and I think it's in part because they don't accept that they're no longer the big bully of the world the positive side would be that they're just celebrating this language you know they appreciate their heritage but you shouldn't be protecting your heritage through draconian means correct so when you have language police going around measuring whether the French sign is bigger than the English one you're getting stuck in the weeds right yeah that is a weird one that they do but such a beautiful city and the people are really nice there too and they're hearty people in Montreal and people in Toronto they're hearty folk because the winter I think is yeah you got a deal with shit you got a deal with adversity over there but it's interesting in that there's so much nicer than the people that deal with the adversity in the cold climates in in America there's something about the United States when you deal with the cold climate people or mean yeah I've been asked and I don't think I had an answer maybe I think it was Ruben who asked me why do you think that many of the sort of people on the forefront of the you know freedom of speech you know debate all stem from Canada and I don't think I had a good reason do you have any any thoughts as to why is it just a will you sent a freedom of speech laws right that's one of the reasons so that it does not have a First Amendment so Canada does not have the same with what we have here in the United States is fuckin beautiful you're right it's one of the only places on earth where it is literally a part of our law that you should be able to express yourself freely right and that this ethic is something that permeates our culture it permeates our identity it's something that we all cling to freedom of speech this is very important and this is one of the reasons why we get so stunned when we see censorship when we see a censorship that it just doesn't make any sense right it's not justified what you guys have over there is a much more slippery slope human rights councils and all that weirdness that we've seen time and time again with people getting fined for jokes yeah you know I mean there's there's a lot of like very very weird stuff that you guys have to deal with up there because you simply don't have a First Amendment showing your thing that that that causes more people to come out of kind of the defending freedom of speech yes because you really can you're right next to us right you're right we're all spouting off at the mouth and fucking shooting nuclear bombs into the atmosphere I mean with this you're living next to a bunch of fucking wild hillbillies is what it's like this is what it's like if you live it in Canada you're living next to United States like what are those fucking crazy assholes doing but at least those crazy assholes can say whatever they want right you know I mean who knows if this podcast would be even possible in Canada I don't know I mean we could have gotten in trouble for some of the things that we've said along the way it's entirely likely right speaking of because you mentioned the Human Rights Tribunal I think at one point I discussed on the show the indigenous woman who argued that she should get tenure despite not having published anything do you know that story you know I don't so let me I mean let me stayed that story or okay or maybe stated for the first time because it relates to something bigger than I'd like to discuss in the Canadian context so there's this now push in Canadian universities to have what's called to indigenized the universities okay and to the indigenized means many things so in one case the case that I just mentioned briefly before you had a professor in the law faculty at the University of British Columbia who was an indigenous woman who had not published much if anything and had God had been given every single opportunity you know extensions on her 10-year clock and so on and then finally when she didn't get tenure she filed a complaint with the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal arguing that her tradition is an oral one and therefore by forcing her to write things down you know as a as an academic was right I mean it's unbelievable so that I saying her tradition is being on land and you should be forced to swim in a swimming event exactly they right but by the way Judaism is based also on oral tradition so by that logic all those Jewish scientists who won Nobel Prizes yes but the more nefarious manifestation of indigenous ation well there are two other instances one annoying but not so serious and one I think very serious the annoying but not so serious is we're now at every single event and Kant and Canadian universities that say you're giving out diplomas you have to first sell flagellate and apologize for sitting on stolen land right so here are students who've spent years getting their degrees this is their moment to shine this is about them but you have to first hear about why we're all evil because we're and transgressing on you know native land that's one example the more serious example is where it is no longer appropriate to say that the scientific method is the way of knowing that there are alternate ways of knowing that are just as valid and what are those so for example in the the indigenous way of knowing now I've argued that when it comes to content specific knowledge for example if you're going to study something in the deep north where the Inuits have lived for thousands of years they're going to have local knowledge about the flora about the fauna that is truly valuable that's that is in fact scientific knowledge but exactly that's exact but but we but I'm saying that's what I'm saying it's content-specific right okay we should be appreciative of that knowledge and listen to it but that doesn't mean that's fix your point that it is outside the purview of the scientific method there is no epistemology that is there is no Lebanese Jewish way of knowing there is no Joe Rogan's way of knowing there isn't any transgender way of knowing this information it's just the scientific method that's the only game in town while they're arguing that know there are ways of not just like the hashtag science must fall I mentioned this on the Rubin report did you know this hashtag science must fall yeah this is what's gonna rise they're called they're called Follis actually this is this came out of the University of Capetown one of the top universities in South Africa where the students were arguing that it is ridiculous that we only abide by the scientific method there are all sorts of other booga-booga ways of knowing that are just I mean I'm using Pluto but you know what I mean right you could dance and make the rain come down you know whatever I mean like spiritual shamanism ways of knowing that are that are outside the purview of the scientific method and that is grotesque and so one of the things that I argue probably doesn't make me a lot of friends at the University is that there is no indigenous way of knowing please jeez google hashtag science must fall I need to remember those a website for know your meme and I got the video of where it starts there you go dr. sad proves to be true again I have a feeling this is a 4chan thing on that that's real yeah two three years old please make that larger so my shitty eyes could read it science must fall is a hashtag mocking a movement to abolish society its mocking no but the original idea is that you should decolonize your mind I understand but it's blocking that movement mark movement to abolish the scientific method and replace it with a new understanding of scientific inquiry this movement was started by a group of students known as Follis at the University of Capetown who want to decolonize science from Western modernity as a an offshoot of the ongoing fees must fall movement protesting increases in university tuition that's one thing can ask going for it too yeah that you guys have no solution yeah way lower you doubt health care and and student we pay for it put times right yeah but it's worth it I mean I've said time and time look I I believe in the hybrid form of governing in a hybrid form of culture and I think that I've support a lot of socialized ideas sure and one of the reasons why is because I see socialism work with the fire department with the police department with with things that we all agree that we're going to chip it and pay for and the fact that we don't do this with health care that you know if my neighbor gets sick the community has to chip and goddammit that guy's been paying taxes his whole life he's a viable part of the community we should be taking care of our own this should be a primary thing like this to strengthen our community to strengthen our civilization one of the primary things is you we should be taking care of each other physically it should be like above all right education you should have to fucking be in debt a quarter million dollars if I get a fucking education don't we want less losers don't we want more people to have education don't we want more people to have some sort of pathway to success wouldn't that just logically lead to a a stronger economy a stronger community stronger civilization wouldn't it wasn't that logical let me give a devil's advocate advocate answer to the extent that they are now no longer any barriers to entry to get into university certainly in Canada at least not a financial one you get I think a miss allocation of talent and resources where everybody feels compelled to go to university where in reality many of the folks in question and believe me I'm the last guy to argue against education right I'm all about lifelong learning but it doesn't have to be through the formal Channel of getting a degree but it's not compulsory well it is compulsory unofficially in that it is now no longer acceptable to not have at least some entry-level degree well then we should concentrate on that as an issue right okay that should be the issue not this idea that somehow or another education should be expensive so it should be difficult so it should be something that's only sought out by people really not serve it fair enough so I agree should the barrier to entry shouldn't be that you know it's the finances that don't allow you to pursue your interests yeah but I know I mean just as a professor for 25 years now there are students that I see very early in a given semester that I know they're not there for entrance or they're not there for intrinsic reasons right right they just don't have the sparkle in their eyes and no amount of coaxing on my part is ever going to bring them out I mean I try I think everybody's redeemable but you can tell that they're there because they don't have it maybe those people would have had a much more lucrative trajectory where they pursue trade school mm-hmm so so I think we have to also be careful about how to allocate the talent that we have I know that that absolutely makes sense and I think that is most likely played out over the difficulty of pursuing an education just like it is with everything else every everything else like whatever you whatever you want to be a stand-up comedian it's not everybody gets to do Carnegie Hall like there's there's a there's a weeding out process of the difficulty of achieving success and there's a lot of people that fall by the wayside and don't make it and this is just natural it's a natural part of the process but if you say not everybody's a comedian that's true but open mic nights available to everybody true and that's why there's so many comedians that actually are good because they do find it through because there's no financial barrier to entry if it costs you know $35,000 a year to pursue an education and comedy and you had to be $200,000 in debt before you can make a living on the road there wouldn't be a goddamn thing to laugh at there wouldn't it be none of us right there'd be 0 of us and that's not a good X it's not a good example because obviously comedy is one of the rare things is a self-educated you have to yourself taught there's no other way you just have to pursue it but I think there's the rigidness of university studies you know the the rigidness of courses of determining what people should and shouldn't learn what they should and shouldn't be educated in who you know and there also the randomness of the professors that you get like you could get you and get a wonderful education I'm sure or you can get some dipshit and get taught about you know how gender is a social construct and you know and you're sitting in class all baffled looking at your penis going what have you done to me fucking monster you know it's I'm at the point now in my career as a professor where I'm facing a bit of a fork in that I I remain as passionate about teaching students but the meat this medium right appearing on Joe Rogan and then having 10 million people watch and maybe maybe be excited about evolution psychology is so much of a bigger platform that it causes me at times a bit of angst when I have to put in all the efforts that I have to put in to teach a class of 14 people not that each of those Minds is not worthy of being educated and being inspired and so on but I am facing at this point in my career you know I'm at the mid-career point in my life where you know I could turn on my laptop and put up anything and you know twenty five thousand people watch it it's nothing compared to your forum but it's 2530 ways and in terms of his classroom size exactly arena full of people exactly and so I think that's one of the things that I now struggle with I always remain as passionate once I walk into class I'm just as passionate just as committed but to the extent that we have this fixed pie of time it becomes so difficult to ever have the 12 students went out against the 12 million students here would be my perspective and maybe this can enhance this experience for you I would treat it the same way that a comedian treats performing live like I do this podcast and every time I do this podcast I'm reaching millions of people what if I decided well you know what I can't do The Improv anymore it's only 190 people do the Comedy Store it's only 400 people in the main room that's not that's too good analogy it's just too small yeah but doing that doing you know the belly room 70 people in the Comedy Store belly room doing those little small riddles your skills if it keeps you tied into people - it keeps you engaged with individual human beings it keeps you real it's interesting that you say this because this hadn't be out stitching an MBA course this semester where we have to miss two classes one because it was Canadian Thanksgiving on a Monday and then there was the provincial Canadian Thanksgiving can okay when is it I mean the real Thanksgiving well I really miss first or ours first ours is the second Monday in October that's ridiculous yeah right yours is also called Green Bay plays Dallas that's called American Thanksgiving it's called November 24th motherfucker right or whatever Thursday okay November so this mba class was being taught on Monday so I missed one Monday because of Thanksgiving and I missed the second Monday because it was the official provincial election in Quebec and by university decree we had to cancel classes and so the way that I made up those classes and I asked the students I said well you could come in on a Sunday as the university has dictated or we I could post them post the lectures online and then eventually I asked them would you prefer if I posted all my lectures online and then I came in and did other stuff in class or would you prefer that I actually deliver the material live in front of you and actually a lot of them answered in a way similar to what you just said which is there is something intimate about delivering the message right there physically tangibly that you can't capture online a hundred percent live performance in any way shape or form whether it's music or comedy or I mean I think teaching is informed a form of live performances when you have someone is disinterested and listless and just sit they have no energy and their teaching even if the information is fascinating it's very difficult to absorb whereas if you have someone like yourself was passionate and engaging and articulate and they have life to you like it's fun and it makes the educational experience something that it's it's it's a performance-art it really is it is you know what pisses me off though when I received the teaching evaluations I usually I get there they're great okay I mean I scored very well but once in a while you get someone who enters something that you know is a lie so I'll give you an example someone says he wasn't accessible to his students well the reality is there wasn't a single time that a student ever asked to meet me either during office hours or if they can't make office hours outside of office hours we could do a Skype chat we could do a phone chat I've never said I'm not meeting you I don't have time with it's never happened yet someone because they are protected by the cloak of anonymity because the teaching evaluations are done anonymously can write whatever they want and there is no opportunity for you to rebut now of course the reality is this has no effect on my career I mean I could easily say who cares what they say but I do care because probably like you you'd like to think that every single person and that audience is going to hopefully find you funny and they walked away entertained you know because of your set and there's no way for me to rebut them well especially when there's someone's lying about that that's that's really annoying but I feel like it's like yelps course you ever you ever read the up reviews like you read them and you'll see all these wonderful reviews the restaurant was incredible the food was fantastic the decor everything about it the the waitress was amazing the chef came over to our table and greeted us it was so good and then you'll see one person everyone was rude the food was dull you know they don't like waiting it's the same place exactly so and then so what I always love to do one of my favorite things to do on Yelp is I will go to a restaurant and if I'm interested in this restaurant I go wow look at this got four and a half stars that's fucking great and then I'll find a one-star and I go okay let me click on their profile and you will see a fucking tornado of one-star reviews of every one of everything fucking laundromats grocery stores they hate everything it's so universal right it's so common and then occasionally like one four star review of something like a movie theater or something what they're probably on a door that day or something it's it's fucking weird it's weird how many malcontent SAR out there just bouncing off of things and just angry at the world honking their horn and traffic writing one-star reviews I've actually thought of starting a project and I had a research assistant look at it you know preempted I mean not really exploring it for me you tell me what you think of this hypothesis so you have one star up to five stars let's say on Amazon on travel Expedia or whatever it's called hotels restaurants do you think that the amount of words that people use across the five stars changes in other words for example hypothesis might be the more negative the review the more words are used because the more yeah and so probably I hope nobody steals this idea because that's an idea that I'm hoping to test soon Oh scientifically right so if you look yeah yes yeah so you so your prediction would oh no way statistical difference between one-star and five-star reviews on Yelp there we go make that large place what what year was this 214 you're way behind bro okay many businesses in the real world encourage customers to read on Yelp Yelp the best way to find local businesses relies on user reviews to help the viewers find the best places both positive and negative reviews are helpful in this mission positive reviews and yeah back to what the thing was yeah no but what I'm yeah I'd sooner statistical differences in amount of text just text right it's not part of is that a part of the review is that what they're saying put it up yeah I've said word analyze how many the language present but Bob and $1,125,000 views using the data sheet containing reviews of businesses and Phoenix Hospital Papa okay when comparing the most frequent two-word phrases okay but this is just the content of the so that's also possible safe Jamie but look at that one star is hmm so there's certain words that come up and run star that's not what though good great happy in contrast to one-star yelp reviews use very little positive language and instead discuss the amount of minutes presumably much in this first section is only two word reviews the next section here is three word reviews and so he goes on further yeah yeah go back to where I was reading there it says very little it so five-star yelp reviews contain many instances of good great good that's just in contrast the one-star yelp reviews but but here's what's interesting use very little positive language but instead discuss the amount of minutes presumably long and unfortunate waits at the establishment that's interesting Las Vegas is one of the cities where the reviewers were collected which is why appears prominently so I don't know more people have to wait yeah that's that makes sense you're talking about the amount exactly and words in the review is exactly and in there at all the size of the just the size of the review because this is a statistical analysis of the the word content you exactly but anyway let tell you the background of others so I published a paper in 2014 in a journal called evolution human behavior where we looked at a skinny chance to give you a bit of a background so remember I talked earlier about the framing effect if I tell you that a burger is 10 percent fat versus 90 percent fat free it's the same description it's just one way you frame it positively negatively so I took this idea with one of my former doctoral students and we applied it to the context of mating so for example if I tell you you can go out on a date with this woman and seven out of ten of her acquaintances think she's intelligent this is exactly like telling you that three out of ten of her friends didn't think she's intelligent right right so I could either frame the information positively or negatively it's the exact same information and this is called the framing effect because just how you frame something causes people to change their evaluation of the person okay and so what we wanted to know is whether men or women are more likely to succumb to the framing effect within a mating context do you follow I'm saying yes well before I not not to put you on the spot but I guess I will can you predict which of the two sexes is more likely to fall prey to the framing manipulation specifically in the mating context females very good you never she's like oh I'm in our heart the men don't mind well that's not quite friends say she's a cunt yeah but that's because she's odd no reason the reason is because negatively framed information and this is how I'm gonna tie it to the study negative information right negatively framed information looms larger and the psyche of women specifically in the mating domain precisely because making a poor mate choice has greater consequences evolutionarily speaking for the woman exactly so this is called the parental investment theory so we took parental investment theory and applied it in this context to a framing decision and showed that when it comes specifically to the mating context women are more likely to succumb to the framing effect and and the reason again stems from the fact that there is what's called a negative negativity bias for this the same valence information looms larger when it's negative then it was faceted precisely because we've evolved to pay more attention to negative information rather than positive information and so that got me thinking about that hypothesis that I just told you which is in the consumer context do I spend more time as a consumer trying to justify my very negative decision and therefore that's why I got the word hypothesis if any bastard steals that hypothesis I'm gonna know the Godfather always knows there's more into this is a very long article that right but it doesn't top it doesn't do what he says I believe it does right here okay the amount of words in the review has a lesser negative effect review that has 333 words indicates a one-star decrease but the average amount of words and the Yelp reviews 130 words so the more words the the more likely it is to have a negative one-star review so it's already there so they aren't they did a multi-faceted analysis the model explains 25-point 98% of the variation the number of stars given in a review this sounds like a low percentage but it's for such a simple model using unstructured real-world data right this month this by the way comes from a other principle which basically says that when companies are trying to pay attention to people how satisfied they are one dissatisfied customer ends up having much larger influence than one satisfied customer because if you like the the mimetic velocity of someone who's pissed is much greater than certainly and that's why people were terrified of bad reviews and you know they don't really take too much here's a problem this is a real problem fake reviews there's a lot of companies and employ these really unscrupulous humans who will write fake reviews for your business they write positive reviews and make it look like your business is amazing and I guarantee you they use very few words because they try to bang them out they just have a bunch of fake bullshit accounts and you can pay someone and there's their services that do that is there any way restaurant is there any way to algorithmically identify who the fake review because of the structure of the words they use or the grammatical where you know it's somehow fake is I don't think so because I don't think the fake reviews are done with a bot I think it's done with actual human sitting yeah I mean maybe if you notice it's in broken English because we're all done in India or something like that I think a lot of it is just people finding a loophole in the system I actually heard someone discussing it in a restaurant we were in a restaurant waiting to see and this guy was telling the owner of the restaurant you know I have a service that can that I know of that can help you and they'll just leave you great reviews and it's an a you know you have an amazing restaurant I mean you should you should use this and it's not like your line of the people the food's good like people have all these weird just but that again speaks to consequentialism versus the ontological right sure I mean it if I were to point to a fault that I have it's probably other than perfectionism is that my mother used to always say you need to realize that the world is not as pure as the purity bubble that you live in and so for example for me to lose weight through liposuction is a form of cheating because if I don't go through the actual process of consciously altering my behavior I don't care about the end result the fact that you will say hey you look really nice and thin now the fact that I did it through quote an artificial way to me doesn't count do you think that that's too brutal of a standard or would you assume know it know not only is it not too brutal of a standard it's actually based in logic because the people that don't alter their behavior but instead get liposuction almost always wind up putting that fat back on because they're they have to change your behavior right they have an issue with their patterns yeah you know the number one pattern if someone is thinking about losing weight the number one pattern that I would always encourage people to do besides changing their diet to reduce radically reduce the amount of sugar and bread and pasta they which will in and of itself eliminate a lot of weight is intermittent fasting meaning have a timed feeding window give yourself eight hours a day and eat what you want to eat for eight hours but when that eight hours is done you don't eat for sixteen hours and that is that is law so you just decide what that timed window is you decide when you're gonna start eating during the day based on when you want to eat dinner and when you're done when you put that fork down there are sixteen hours between then and the time you ever stuffed food in your face again just doing that you will lose a lot of weight and it's a healthy way to do it and it's and it's mimicking or closer mimic of our evolutionary reality yes evolutionary reality you did not have shelves where food was available everywhere in pantries and frigerators and superheroes a strong proponent this is a plug for a friend who's the anti fragile guy Nassim Taleb as a who's also lebanese by the way someone who's into this intermittent fasting and i think he swears by it if i'm not mistaken yes a lot of people do i do i've had many many nutritionists and people that study the science of nutritional absorption and science of fasting there's a real science to fasting we Dom D'Agostino has done some extensive work on the positive benefits of fasting so as Rhonda Patrick has discussed this in depth but intermittent fasting and that timed feeding window is just it's so critical if you can just do that I had a friend of mine his dad just lost 100 pounds doing that over the last year and a half yeah he see alters diet you know just decided he needed to lose weight but the big one is he just had a timed window and that timed windows eight hours per day I organized in it was in April a mini summit on health promotion from an evolutionary perspective and so I invited several physicians who are very sympathetic to the evolutionary approach in terms of identifying ways by which we can promote health whilst recognizing some of these evolutionary imperatives maybe I could share one or two sure so it turns out for example that did you know who is the when you look at young men who suffer from erectile dysfunction do you know what's the one behavior that these young men because usually of course erectile dysfunction is something that is more prevalent as you get older for you to suffer from this condition as a young man is anomaly what do you think is the one behavior they share hmm it's quite obvious what so a behavior that's really the tremendous your health think of the worst one alcohol no lack of sleep and worse drugs smoking smoking yeah so heavy smokers are likely to be the ones who are experience erectile that's as young people overall vitality is probably decreased and that's one of the side effects or their body is probably like bitch you're so sick you shouldn't be breathing right as am i fact there is something she studies looking at you know how erect your penis is as a function I say as a metric of your overall health but anyways and so I had mentioned this in several lectures and then it actually came out in a promotional campaign I don't know if they watch my lectures this is I think Health Canada where they had a advertisement with simply a cigarette that's limp that was it that's the whole now that is exactly what an evolutionary health promotion approach would be like and let me explain why the typical approach with these types of social marketing campaigns is provide people with more information and that would cause them to alter their behavior if they're behaving in a maladaptive way if you like it's because they didn't know any better so tell them the likelihood of them suffering heart disease when they're 73 but the reality of course is that when I'm 21 73 is a long time away I'm immortal I'm never going to suffer from these realities right so I can easily discount that information but tell me show me vividly that I might not be able to perform with my really hot girlfriend well it doesn't take much of an evolutionary psychologist to understand that people will respond to this just to draw another parallel from the women's part women turn out to be the ones who are overwhelmingly most likely to expose themselves to the Sun whether well either this the actual natural Sun or artificial sun beds even though they're much more knowledgeable than men about the effects of sun exposure so it's not because they didn't know any better that they were doing the behavior because they know more than men and yet they do it more so they do it more because of an aesthetic reason because they think that they're going to get that health glow I'm going to be at tonight's party Tony's going to be there and I need to look good for Tony so if you simply tell them that when you're gonna be 74 you might suffer a greater incidence of melanoma who cares on the other hand if you show them aesthetic ravages to your skin that increases their attention to your message so the bottom line is learn what are the evolutionary triggers that get people's attention and use that rather than simply provide them with more information so that is one applied reality of this approach what are the evolutionary triggers that cause people to smoke in the first place well I don't think that's necessarily an evolutionary trigger I think it's just because tobacco is I mean there's addictive right and so yeah but what would but that doesn't explain the initial first desire start smoking the first time you smoke it's disgusting yeah I saw I'm going to I'm going off the cuff here so I don't know because I haven't thought about nothing's that question it turns out as you probably know that if you don't start smoking by the age of 19 I don't know why the number 19 maybe it's because it's the end of teenage years you're almost guaranteed to never smoke right so you so the tobacco companies really have to get you when you're a kid I know a guy who started when he was 40 actually I'm like Mike I have a cousin who started at 33 so they are anomalies that's so crazy isn't it so my feeling is it's probably a form so if I'm going to link it in some way to an evolutionary mechanism it's probably just pure conformity right to the extent that that young kids think that this cool to smoke they are just going to imitate others what do you think I think they want to look cool they see that character that's smoking and just takes that big deep drag in that exhale and they're just looking a rebel they don't even give a fuck about their health looking them out they're just smoking cigarettes I'm probably wearing leather do you know that I've never taken a single puff in my entire life congratulations have you fuck yeah I mean I'm not about drugs just smoke yeah yeah now I've I smoked a cigarette when I was 15 I didn't like it I quit my sister stuck with it for a long time we did it together I was 15 she was 14 she smoked for a long time after that so why did usually the first time I would have to go back to the time when I was 15 and asked myself I probably just wanted to try it I thought it was cool that was an adult thing we did a lot of adult things that were gross like we tried liquor and we would you know there's a lot of things that we did that you were supposed to do because it was supposed to be like a cool person thing right but it's gross I've done it since then before shows because I have friends that were smokers and I had read that there's a nootropic benefit to nicotine and that one of the things that Stephen King said when he wrote his book on writing one of the more it's a great book by the way on writing if anybody is interested in writing but be coming from a real master a guy who's been incredibly prolific but his attitude and his philosophy on writing is pretty unique but one of the things that he said that he straw after he quit smoking because of the synaptic the the the synaptic benefit the the cognitive benefits of smoking was really beneficial for his writing it like really fired up his writing and so a couple of times back with my friend Tony Hinchcliffe he quit recently he quit like about a year or so ago but he would smoke you know and a couple of times he would be smoking before a show I'd say give me one of those things we try that I have no fear at all that I would ever be addicted to cigarettes I was zero fear it's not possible there's no way in my mind said that I would ever allow myself to be physically addicted but using it as a tool right before I went onstage I found it to give me like a little bit of a charge I was like it's kind of interesting not valuable enough for me to pursue and not necessarily even better than other nootropics or other you know cognitive enhancing things like coffee or you know for me the real one is breathing and moving around I just like to get my blood pumping and take some big deep breaths and fire my brain up and get my like like here we are right here I had a cup of coffee earlier but the the stimulation of actual dialogue of talking to somebody and talking to an intelligent beautiful person like yourself aren't you lovely this is a it's exciting it gets you fired up and this is it gets all the cylinders pumping but there is something to cigarettes there's definitely something I'm I founded what is stimulating what is it that made you feel so confident that you would not fall prey to its addictive properties why do you think that I am confident and I'm not a loser period I'm not doing anything stupid with my body I don't I don't I'm not doing that but you don't think that not attractive properties could over overwhelm your willpower really impossible doesn't exist there's no door you're not getting in Wow it's not there's no fucking way I'm gonna get addicted to cigarettes and people are giving you pseudo belissa though to shut up pussy it's not happening so you could call somebody pussy but I can't call them the r-word yes crazy weird it's how it work the double standard well pussy's also good that's problem with pussy the word pussy's ridiculous as an insult because one of the most wonderful things the world has ever seen speaking of pussies did you see my probably not but I put out a sad truth clip where I regrettably apologized to the trans community because it turns out that I didn't know that my marriage was transphobic you know why your marriage is transformed yes how because some trans activists have argued that it is ridiculous for heterosexual men to strictly want to mate because we're talking about pussies too strictly want to mate with women you have sissies when there are some women who have 9-inch penises that are just as much of a women and I argued that now that I've learned this it's ridiculous that I focus on only building a life as a heterosexual man with a woman that has a vagina not with the woman that has a nine-inch penis and therefore I apologize for my transphobia well that doesn't make any sense because shouldn't it be just like with the fat thing that you just just choose whatever and then be happy with what you got that there's no discrimination at all you just manage to fall in love you just got lucky and it's an actual and it's a lots of vagina male woman right who has about a vagina that's not surgically created but had I been more progressive and open to that necessarily no did you ever date a trans person no so there you go you don't have to date a bunch of people like that you know like to say that you've never dated anybody who's over six foot five well you're tall phobic that's that's a ridiculous statement that doesn't make any sense you know to say that you've you've never dated anybody that weighs more than 300 pounds you know you're you're Mass phobic yeah that's ridiculous the baddest yeah it's just all of it's stupid it's all stupid people telling but this what they're doing is it's a bunch of people that are pushing this idea of being open entirely open to all things trans that you as a heterosexual person should not just recognize that this is a woman because they transferred from a male to a female but recognize even if they haven't transferred and recognize them in terms of sexual selection in terms of a date right and that's just fucking stupid because you can decide right you're not into certain things like I'm not really into girls with short hair you can decide that it's not my thing I don't like girls with shaved heads I don't find it attractive like a woman can say that too I don't like guys are creeping mustaches and nobody gets mad at them right but if a man says to certain people I'm not into chicks with dicks then that guy's a piece of shit or what about there's a thing called sexual racism where you specifically you know are not attracted to a particular you know yes I don't like Asian men I don't like black women right you're not supposed to instantiate those sexual preferences if the racial cue is the one that's causing you to either be attracted or not attract someone what do you think of that well there's certainly beautiful people of all races not of sense to me in terms of the person selection like if you tell me you've never seen a beautiful black woman like you're crazy like you haven't met enough black women if you tell me seven seen a beautiful asian woman like what what are you saying like there's beautiful people in this also you should be allowed to to be with whoever you want in terms of not but why is it it's always sex right because like obnoxious people here's a perfect example I don't like friends that are loud and get drunk in public Oh what are you drunk phobic no I just don't enjoy that so like in terms of sexual selections are the dates I tell you why that analogy might fail okay that's some of the professor's you could alter your level of obnoxiousness you could grow out of your boxers well I know some people conceivably feel and I know some people are fucked that's just who they are fair enough you want to name any names no yeah but your race is a immutable part of you okay that's the perspective yeah I see that I mean I'm playing devil's advocate I'm not agreeing with it okay well what about tall versus short you know what if you're a woman volleyball player and you're six four three you don't want to date a guys five feet tall you know are you what are you what do you by the way that is one of the biggest problems of being a very tall woman because one of the one of the so there's something called assorted of mating in evolutionary theory a sort of mating is basically birds of a feather flock together and that's very much the mechanism that drives mate choice much more than a it's a track so one of the sources of mating cues that people most assort on is height so it's not so much that women want guys that are only six foot or taller it's just that the woman wants a guy who's taller than her right so if you look at there is a study that I've discussed in the past that looked at something like seven hundred and twenty actual couples and I think there was only a single one out of the seven hundred and twenty where the woman was taller than the man now once a woman gets to be over a certain height she's six four to six four three her potential pool of prospective suitors really shrinks and so if you have a daughter you really want to pray that she doesn't get too tall because boy or her choice is going to be limited because few women want to date a shorter guy than them yeah when you're at six foot three six foot four woman that's got to be a tough spot being you're basically relegated to big athletes or big giant people the other place where you get this sort of a sort of amazing is where you get women who are super educated that makes sense the exact same thing happens for the more educated a woman gets the worse her marriage prospects because the more sophisticated women are the more they insist on a high status male and therefore as I get more educated as a woman there are just fewer men who are as educated or more than me and therefore I'm doomed to a life of solitude that totally makes sense that totally makes sense especially considering that men you know in general they get insecure around women who are more successful yes and more educated or more intelligent like very rarely are men comfortable with a woman who has to explain things to them absolutely Anna yeah by the way I think so I have another theory which I'd like to at some point test maybe someone will steal it now so when you have a couple that gets married very young they are judging one another based on their made value at 18 or 19 right so Tony is the high school quarterback and so he's the hot guy and I'm the cheerleader and then later he stagnates he doesn't go on with this career whereas I go on and become a physician I'm the cheerleader so at 29 there is now a huge inequity between our two mating values on the mating market right so when we were both 19 the fact that we had roughly the same mating value made us a very attractive stable couple but Tony turned out to be a fucking loser exactly he's a lame duck exactly and so I so have a theory that and I'd like to at some point that's it maybe some graduate student will write to me saying I'll work with this on you dr. Saad I have a theory whereby I think that in many cases where people end up divorcing when they married young it's precisely because that which started as equitable mating values at time t0 turned out to have huge divergence and our trajectory on the mating market and that puts a huge strain on the marriage especially when the wife status is going up the best way to ensure that the marriage ends is for the status of the woman to keep going up and that of the man to either stagnate or go down that's going to be doomed that makes sense it may it makes sense that also you know obviously the young marriages are rough because people grow and they don't necessarily grow together all right you catch people ten years later and they're oftentimes radically different people right but then there's also the thing that women don't seem to for the most part respect a man who's not doing as well as them all right that's that's a giant issue even if the guys doing okay like say if your guys making $50,000 a year that's a very good living he's out there doing well but you make 300 I make 300 grand a year and it's fucking losers over here what is 50 grand like you're kicking ass you're like some bigwig it's some big corporation like that that seems to be a real sticking point and with men especially if they have a household where they contribute in come together they they pile all the income and the man start spending the woman's money on stuff you know he starts buying stuff you got a new fishing rod what did you get that with your money or my money you know it gets weird right and incidentally so speaking of could say consumer psychology stuff that I study when you take a very rich woman and you go out on a date with her even though she obviously can afford the dinner and she can afford anything that you're going to buy her if you exhibit cues of frugality cheapness mm-hmm that's the perfect way to ensure that you won't have a second date so it's not so much a question of you know it's an all sexist ritual whereby men were wooing women it really is an honest signal of your commitment to a woman so the best way and I get many of these letters where people ask me hey professor where you you know what you know dating advice well you do have to exhibit generosity when you go out yeah that's I mean nuptial gift-giving natural gift-giving is sort of a fancy term for courtship rituals across animal species so many species you have typically the male engaging in some form of courtship gift-giving and depending on the quality of the gift will determine whether the female will mate with you or not well so much of what we do in marketing context is exactly that right it's the exact same phenomenon repeating itself in the human context right engagement rings right the fact that you supposed to spend a quarter of your yearly salary on this rock really what it is yeah that's what I'm I don't know if everybody meets it but that's right it is that right three months is that god when you say a quarter of the yearly salary it makes you just go what in the fuck is wrong with people but there's so much money but here's the but here's the reason here's the reason you ready it's what's called a Zahavi and signal I don't know if I've ever discussed this in this podcast AHA vien signal is basically the idea that for a signal to be honest it has to be costly otherwise everybody could imitate it right so something so think about for example rites of passage in different cultures right if you want to demonstrate that you're a top warrior the rite of passage has to be brutal otherwise if it's only we all have to do five situps then every male could do it and then the females can't determine the the pretenders from the real guys right so so you have for example bullet ant you know this one you right you put your hands through right I mean that takes a lot of courage and explain it to people don't over target so this is a tribe in the Amazon whereby you take the bullet ant is supposedly the the biggest purveyor of pain that is humanly possible that you could experience my friend Steve got stung by one did he and what did he was in Bolivia I believe and he got stung and in his heel got him in the heel and he said it was just he was delirious he said it last for a few hours then it goes away right so what they do in this tribe is they take a bunch of these hands in the order of a couple of hundred one is enough to cause you agonizing impossible delirious pain and they sedate them through this compound and then they interweave them in these gloves these leaf gloves so that when they're coming to they come out of their stupor and you have your hands in there they start viciously biting you stinging you and you're supposed to withstand that pain without screaming you have to take it and so you sort of almost go into this religious fervor this kind of incantation and you have to do that ritual 20 separate occasions 20 different times down different days 20 20 before you are admitted into the tribe of warriors whatever well now let's think it back to the engagement ring right if all it takes for me to convince you of my honest intentions is to buy you flowers and now let's go back behind the shed and yes have sex well then a lot of cheaters are going to convince you of doing this one they really didn't have good intentions but if it takes for me to spend a quarter of my salary to convince you that I have honest so therefore this is a form of what's called as a hobby and signaling because Harvey was a Israeli ornithologist that studied this type of behavior this costly signaling behavior using Arabian babblers which is a type of bird so here's another example of as a hobby signal you probably have seen this when you have a predator that's looking at who to attack you often will have gazelles starting to actually make themselves conspicuously visible to the predator they come close to him and they start jumping from have you ever seen this do you know I mean it's called strutting not strutting and can you think why that would be No why are they not hiding why are they not making themselves inconspicuous why why are they drawing attention to themselves when there are 50 different gazelles that the predator could be pointing to why well because what it's what what that animal is saying is the fact that I could stand here in front of you and jump up and down and make myself this visible suggest that it's probably a lost cause for you to try to go after me I'm super fit right it's a costly signal of my fitness it's an honest signal right the one who is not doing this behavior is the one that you should be paying attention to right so this is called and so I used this principle of Zahavi and signaling to explain things like conspicuous consumption right the reason why you buy the fancy car that the other males can't hope to purchase it's precisely because they can't afford to match your signal therefore it's an honest signal the reason why I buy a hundred million dollar painting that a monkey could have drawn shows how wealthy I am that I could waste a hundred million dollars ah that makes sense that makes sense it's all just mating stuff it's mating and food yeah you don't want to become somebody's dinner you want to find dinner and you want to have sex good night everybody yeah those signals are so fascinating when we see them in our culture and people get angry at them like you see some guy pull up in a Ferrari and you go look at this fucking loser with his little Duke right you like maybe or maybe guy with a shitload of money wants to let the world know cuz he likes to fuck you right I've shared actually on this show I think the stories about Mike one of my brothers who was a big car collector three Ferraris Aston Martin Lagonda and I've even shared a story which I'm happy to repeat of we would go to night clubs where he's just this is Olympian this is the five foot three guy who and we would go to night clubs and he would pick the most beautiful woman and approach her even though she's accompanied by six four four you know tough fucking guy and and he had that confidence I think because he had that wealth got a built in him he certainly helps it certainly helps yeah it's um it is a weird ever prevalent aspect in the communication between men and females is how much money does the man have right I mean and this is one thing that a lot of women hate because they don't want to feel like they could be purchased and they can't they can't they can't some can write a lot can it's a factor it's a big fan and a lot of women are very just rapidly ruthlessly independent they don't want that ever in their life and good for them but but the reality is it's a very effective strategy you pull up in that Ferrari or that Rolls Royce or whatever the fuck you're driving and it has a big impact and you get to that nightclub and those studies have been done endlessly and there's I called you so here's one example and you don't need to have a signal as big as a Ferrari just how you dress in terms of the status that is exhibited there's a study that was done I think in the early 90s where they manipulated the status via the sartorial the attire of men and women into one of three different types you know high status medium and you know some t-shirt or McDonald's uniform whatever and then they asked men and women one of six possible you know would you go out for a coffee with this guy would you go out on dinner would you have sex with him would you marry him and across all six levels of relationships the status of the attire of a man had a profound effect on the likelihood of the woman saying yes higher the status the more likely she said yes that same manipulation on women had zero effect on men yeah in other words no man has ever uttered the following word words my god you've got a juicy butt and I'd love to have sex with you but you're not exhibiting cues of ambition therefore no sex for you Linda yeah that's that's a reality that's a reality that people are very uncomfortable with and I don't think women necessarily are craving this same reaction from men because of their ambition I don't think women are ever saying through my ambition I'm gonna get a good man right you know that just it's not a factor but they do say through my I ambition I am never going to need a man true that's because that's just look the reality is there's a lot of shitty human beings out there and some of them have penises right and if you're a woman and you run into too many of those or four bye for whatever reason because of your environment because of your behavior because the circles you travel in you're around too many of them there's a large dating pool of shitheads out there you know you just say I don't want this in my life I don't want to be like my mom I don't want to be like my sister I want to be independent but what you're not saying is I am gonna get a baller house and a baller car and I'm gonna get me a man and the only woman that I know of that I've ever heard say that is disgusting and the only woman that I ever she's like you know talking about her success and our success allows her to get man she's a foul beast Wow yeah it's not healthy but incidentally and a lot of women it's not so much of their interest I mean resources are good only to the extent that they allow you to ascend the social hierarchy right this doesn't explain why some women are attracted to the starving artists right because what why are so many women romanticizing over the guy with the guitar but that's because they are choosing him based on his future trajectory right I am banking right I am banking on the fact that you exhibit enough talent that I suspect that by investing in you by choosing you it's gonna take me to that trajectory no woman has ever uttered the following words you have no talent you exhibit no ambition you're never going to step out of the basement let's have sex right so so it's not that women are only interested in money they're interested in a panoply of cues all of which relate to the potential of ascending the social hierarchy yeah that makes sense you know it makes sense that these things are biologically inter woven into our psyche no kidding makes sense I mean just it's unavoidable well that's that's why I'm always and I think the first time that I came on the show we discussed this I'm always amazed that so many people have such antipathy towards evolutionary psychology because there is really no other game in town I mean it what else could explain the evolution of the most important organ that defines our person had called the human mind right I mean you're comfortable accepting that the liver and the kidneys and the heart has involved revolution but you can't accept that your mind and your brain has evolved through evolution so it's really it's an insane form insane form of science denialism that I've spent 25 years fighting and I'm not sure if I'm any closer to winning the battle it's the only form of science denialism that's closely acceptable it's culturally acceptable because it it defines people in a way that makes them feel like animals or makes them feel cheap or makes them feel like they're prostitutes you know it makes it makes people feel like they're prostitutes and interestingly it comes a lot more for this particular form of science denialism from the left this is why a lot of a lot of people will write to me and say well why do you seem to be critiquing a lot more people on the left and the right that's not that's not showing my political colors it's simply because the ecosystem that I navigate in which is called academia it just so happens that most of the BS comes from the left because the academia is laden with leftists yeah so it's not so much that I give a free pass to the right when you have a right-wing senator who denies evolution I'm the first to also critique him but the reality is when it comes to human nature it's really the leftists who are denying the biological basis of our human nature why do you think that this science denialism is so prevalent on the list on the left when it comes to gender because gender seems to be the battleground it seems to be the battleground even in terms of transgender right but the the battleground of gender whether it's the gender pay gap or whether it's traditional gender roles this seems to be where science denialism lives on the left in the more you know like what I always grew up thinking about the left the left was always more open-minded they were supposed to be the more educated and they were supposed to be the more compassionate people so something happened and I don't know when it happened but somewhere along the line this science denialism and in this for whatever reason this idea that if it shows any differences if there's any statistics or any data that shows differences between the men and the women that this is somehow this is somehow an example of sexism or patriarchal tyranny or there's a reason for this that's negative so I think the reason is actually quite quite simple at the right-wing folks who deny science it's typically for religious ideological reasons or for industry right so there is some pet ideology that is threatening me and therefore I'm going to deny science right this exact same thing is happening with the left they also have been parasitized by a quasi religion it's called progressivism okay and I say progressivism in quotes right you know equality of outcomes and all the rest of the garbage right and therefore to the extent that evolutionary theory in general but evolutionary psychology in particular is a threat to my quasi religion then I will reject it this is why evolution deniers tend to be on the right and evolution psychology deniers tend to be on the left they've both been parasitized by religions they're just different religions but so that's a fast any way to look at it that progressivism is in fact some sort of religion and it makes sense if you're looking at the science and nihilism aspect of it because you're not looking at it in terms of an objective analysis of all the facts and the data that's in front of you you're saying what fits this construct what fits this pattern of behavior that I've chosen to adopt and then I have to show all the people that are around me except like you accuse Sean Carroll of doing it was not adopting this instead of looking at the actual facts of this case exactly post-modernism I think did you have you had the grievance studies photo shoot right fantastic I mean Peter Bogosian yeah I mean James lensing could you could you believe that this is stuff that is repeatedly wonderful right the podcast if you haven't heard it folks please listen to it these guys and a gal with the woman from Helen Blanc Rose James Lindsay and Pete Bogosian yeah Pete Bogosian and James Lindsay with the one were here the woman Helen lives in England yes and they came on the podcast and they talked about all these different false studies and false papers that they published that were peer-reviewed and published in academic journals that like things like what was the one heteronormative in dog parks so so that the humping and but I thought you quick funny story phobia and dog barks I die so I'll say this some a few folks knew about this project before it came out one of them has a name that sounds like glad slant oh is this glad father this is the glad father now it turns out that I didn't know though which which particular studies they were sending out I knew about the general project but I didn't know the details and so I wanted this project go on for I think it was maybe 18 months if I'm not mistaken something in that order well at at one point I was flipping through something whatever and I saw the the dog grape culture stuff so eye contact feet I go I just there was no even salutation there wasn't hi how are you I go dog park rape you like within a few seconds he's just cracking up laughing that's the background to some of these stories he was up for some sort of disciplinary review right after he left the podcast with me I don't know how that went or what a lot of people are gunning for him yeah I know he was is explaining that but I think what he's doing is very valuable and I think that it needs to be known and especially in terms of like people listening to this they're gonna send their kids these fucking schools and spend fifty thousand dollars a year well this is it this is why by the way people often times people write to me even even my wife will sometimes tell me why do you care so much about this is it because imagine all of these people they're spending their parents hard earned money they could have been studying tons of really interesting true things and I don't mean true it has to be signed you could study art and you could study literature you could study philosophy so I'm not I'm not creating a hierarchy of knowledge it's all good but as long as you are committed to reason to logic and so on these fields are what I call intellectual terrorism they're nihilist and it pisses me off as a professor that they've been allowed to promulgate for 4050 years untouched yeah and so those who argue that these guys were frauds because they you know they they submitted these papers under a pseudonym well what did you expect them to do I mean if if you're a whistleblower do you not submit your complaint or using the name Jane Doe yeah so the fact that they use the pseudonym that's hardly fraudulent if you're going to demonstrate how fraudulent that whole enterprise is so what if you use the false name on what do you don't you agree Oh a hundred percent yeah it's it's important it's important to expose this idiocy because it's it's so prevalent and it's so ridiculous and there's a bunch of fake intellectuals out there that are repeating all this nonsense and so when they see this in what should be almost like onion level satire obvious exactly and they don't think so and they reward it and they talk about it's one of the best papers they've read this year exactly I mean these people are preposterous and this is just one of those things where you let people get away with things and then they keep pushing it they keep pushing it it goes further they keep getting further with it and eventually they just get away they're too far gone you can't bring them back I actually told Pete and I hope I don't think he'll mind that I'm sharing this but when when he was telling me about the project one of the things that I try to temper or his expectations of how much of a fatal blow the project would be he I had the feeling that he was thinking that if we are successful it's the end of the bullshit the the bullshit edifice is and I kept saying look I think it's really important what you're doing and of course I support it in any way that I can help and advise you and so on I'm I'm there for you but I don't think you should think that it's going to end and I think I've been proven to be right no you're 100% right because I think post-modernism by its very definition is almost like a snake that can't be right who are you to judge what is bullshit exactly I mean what percentage of an impact do you think it had do you think it killed one percent of the bullshit maybe a bit more maybe two I can't put a number but I should say five let's be generous alright let's go with five by the way I've spoken to you know Alan SoCal the original hope do you know the the history of this type of hoaxing No so the original hoax was done by Alan SoCal Sok al who is a physicist who in 1996 submitted a paper he's oh he's a physicist so he's you know hardcore scientists and he wanted he was so pissed off at all these post modernist that he submitted a paper on the hermeneutics of gravity all this kind of BS and they of course lapped it up because here is a physicist who's now joining the pantheon of our bullshit therefore let's accept it and then of course at that point he said oh oh I have something to admit to you guys now him and I had communicated at one point I had written an article about his Hoch and he he corrected me was very very cute because I I said you know this guy created some pseudo random bullshit and he said well you know professor sad I actually spent quite a bit of effort coming up with all these words so it wasn't random PS it was very well thought out BS so this is a guy that you might want to have on I don't know if he doesn't read these pockets but he's the he's the the Godfather of hoaxing this stuff it's just gotta be so frustrating to be in academia and to see all this around you and see all these false thinkers these these fake people absolutely putting this con game in the middle of a real learning institution and not only that but this being celebrated by other true academics because they don't want to get called out as being racist or homophobic or transphobic or whatever the fuck it is these morons are celebrating right this this is a weird trickery it to me it's almost like being a comedian and being around joke thieves right it's like almost the same thing like I know you're not the same thing as me you're a faker you're faking this thing we're in this artist colony everybody else struggling to come up with material and you're just stealing it right and this is what is going on with these gender studies people that you're pretending you're an intellectual so this is craziness well you're you're ignoring the science so I have a theory so the original post modernists were all French post modernists I don't feel their name but for your viewers it's Michel Foucault Jacques Lacan and Jacques Derrida the three grand bullshitters okay and so I have a fear is this is 70s this is it started about the 60s and 70s really went into full throttle right now I I'm gonna link this back to mating remember we said everything okay now I genuinely think that in the deep recesses of their minds these three fraudsters did not believe a single thing and what they were doing but they quickly learned that if they stood in front of a crowd authored some folk profundity gibberish and you had all the hot beautiful young ladies sitting and looking at you as if you were deep poet they quickly learned that there's evolutionary rewards that come with their folk profundity and so the train was off and they weren't going to yes I went off the station and yeah that's it the trajectory said I truly believe that if we could ever find some you know diary or something of these around there they probably have written my god that I get a lot of women I guess Michel Foucault was gay maybe a lot of young men through my trickery in other words I you think they admitted that openly no I don't even in a diary I doubt they admitted it to themselves that openly but so do you think that in the deep recesses of their mind when they went to bed do you think that they've convinced themselves that they are saying something profound or they know it I know they're locked into I think this is what I think when most people are engaging in that sort of deceptive behavior they're locked into a pattern that they know is effective that pattern has some sort of an effect a beneficial effect on them whether it's sexually whether it's in terms of the social dynamics that they exist in there's this pattern they've found this pattern that they can pursue that's what I believe so therefore they are being self deceptive yeah to the point where they believe they're bullshit well maybe maybe not even being self deceptive but certainly not being self analytic they've they've hit this hot spot where they you know they lock in and then they they just follow what's effective and what's working yeah perhaps you're right that's what I think's do you think though that eventually all of these guys will die out no so you think the BS will just find a new way to metamorphosize into some new instantiation but it's always there's always going to be a critical mass of BS in the university I think there's always going to be a bunch of people that want to believe in things that are not true because that makes them seem better than what they really are there's a bun there's always going to be a bunch of people that want to avoid the reality of essentially the lives unfair a ladder system of competition there's there's just it's just unfair it's just a lot of it it's just like it's the natural the natural world nature itself is unfair just in general you know that the the salmon never gets to eat the eagle it's just it's not fair and I think there's a lot of people that find these inequalities and find this unfairness very disconcerting it disturbs them to no end and they set out on a quest to try to morph the world into some weird utopian fantasy land where everything has an equal outcome it doesn't exist but in people that are fucked you know you get people that look like Lena Dunham and they want to like sort of like balance out the playing field it's like it's not fair right it's like how come scarlet johansson is a woman and how come Lena Dunham is a woman like what the fuck like that's not fair right it's not it's there's a lot of things that aren't fair there's a lot of things that aren't fair intellectually I know the way people's minds function they're not this there's people that are Elon Musk and then there's other folks right we're just not that bright all right this is just the way the world so do you think as as fighters for reason our objective is to simply make sure that the number of bullshitters stays below certain thresholds since we can't eradicate them fully according to your view at least what we could do is sort of study the tides so that they're always below a certain number in other words 10% of people are going to be bullshitters in the university and as long as they don't get passed out we're doing a good job whereas I'd like to be more optimistic I'd like to eradicate all of the bullshitters I don't think that's possible but I think that bullshit as a whole is very attractive to people and it's very attractive to people to pursue it's very attractive to people to engage in they don't like reality and they didn't want to change things like there's a lot of bullshit that just exists in our culture and has forever why the fucker chiropractors still around why are psychics still around like there's a lot of nonsense out there and then when you look into what those what what real evidence there is that psychics are real it's almost zero when I could link it by the way to marketing so the Dove the Dove company mm-hmm they're probably their most successful campaign of all time has been one where they argued that beauty is a social construct you're all beautiful in your own way now that again is a beautiful message right because if I am someone if I'm a woman who doesn't score well on the typical evolutionary ques then what do I want to hear I want to hear that there is no such thing as evolutionary ques it's all socially constructed right if I have sagging breasts if I have poor skin and so on if I have wrinkly skin I'd like to believe that there is no such thing as an Universal Beauty standard yes and in that sense dove has been incredibly successful because by peddling false hope they've actually been able to tap into women's insecurities and incense that's good marketing did you see the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine that was widely criticized because they had a morbidly obese woman on who was a you know a bikini plus-size model yeah yeah and they were challenging beauty norms like this is a person that's eating themselves to death you fucking assholes and so your lack of discipline and your desire to shame people who exercise that's what you're doing right to make them feel bad because you feel bad you can't put the fucking cook cookies and cupcakes down as a led you to try to push this ridiculous standard and one of the things my point of view was could you imagine if the cover of men's health had an enormous fat guy with his gut hanging over his belt and and people were saying the new standards of attractiveness for men have been changed by Mike who just drinks beer and eats cake if you like get the fuck out of here that's never gonna fly it's not gonna fly with men but it does fly with women and by the way they the fat acceptance movement doesn't just argue that you know not being 500 pounds is unattractive because of the patriarchy they actually argue that the medical evidence suggesting that there's a link between obesity and downstream bad effects is all bullshit they're not done not just that they there they also point to one incredibly flawed study that has been widely disproven that says that there's some sort of vigor or vitality involved in being overweight because they get sick less there's no no truth to that whatsoever they only they only analyze people who were healthy at the time like it's it's theirs you can go in google the study and find out the this criticism of that study but it's a hundred percent horseshit folks being fats not good for you it's really bad for you when you're as big as that woman on the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine she's literally morbidly obese she's fucking dying she's addicted to food in a horrible way and to promote that and pretend that somehow or another this is okay and it's we're gonna we're gonna show new standards of beauty you go you giant gelatinous bag of meat and tissue no that's a dying person who's addicted to food she doesn't want to look like that I feel as though given that on one of the shows she spent about 45 minutes fat shaming me did change me that they talked to you about your diet there hasn't been a recognition of your slimness much-much Slim you are slim I felt a bit of drool coming when I first came in there was a bit of drool on the side of your thing when you saw me there's no drool I'm happy for you thank you there's no drill how much wave you lost about 30 that's nice another very good and I have to register as a dangerous weapon Wow Thor any more yeah you're on the door what are you doing different great question being accountable to the scale being accountable to how many things go in my mouth so meaning every Friday no matter what I get on the scale you see what I'm saying yeah so I've put on three pounds therefore I intercept that trajectory at three pounds rather than in four years when I get on the scale I'm all 32 pounds overweight so number one being you know privy to that information secondly my wife whom you've met many times enters all my stuff and My Fitness Pal calm so at the end of the day at the end of the day she tells me you've eaten seventeen hundred and ninety two calories and you've exercised four hundred calories you had 1300 calories good now you might say that's not sustainable to be so sort of nazi-like in terms of your accountability for your whole life but for me that really works because I'm very you know objective oriented if I let it slide then I can wake up one day and I'm thirty pounds overweight I don't think I fetchin you don't know think about I was trying to show you anything about your back and you couldn't get on my machine that's what it well I don't think we even talked about your weight did with it we spent about 40 minutes forty met you as a matter of fact I remembered that I know that you don't read your comments I had gone to check some of the comments and some people were quite upset at you fat people for no for you just they were fat oh maybe get off your ass you fat fucks lazy bitch I knew it was coming from that was coming from concern and love so I didn't take it violet have you looked at what Jordan Peterson is doing a lot of the meat stuff right yeah the carnivore diet so very fascinating he's lost 50 pounds oh he looks amazing he said he's at his intellectual peak you seize over running with energy she doesn't take any supplements doesn't take anything just eats meat Wow to sounding do you is there I know that is that sort of the keto thing right is it no it's not it's different because of Google Genesis when you have keto is more fat than anything it's more fat even than protein he's eating mostly protein and fat but much more protein that you would get an Akita genic diet I see so he's not necessarily in a state of ketosis I mean be probably as some of the time when your body has a large quantity of protein your body converts that protein into glucose into glucose Ennis's it's a very interesting process but it's one of the reasons why if you eat too much protein knocks you out of ketosis because your body changes it turns it into glucose what he's doing is essentially an elimination diet he's only eating meat and when I've talked to like actual real nutrition experts who really understand the process they do not recommend what he's doing it's great but I think maybe that's because it hasn't been done and studied on a wide scale before there have been a few anecdotal reports about people who have eaten just meat for you know 20 years and they're real healthy it seems to really be effective with people that have autoimmune issues people that have psoriasis people that have various autoimmune conditions it seems that cutting out all inflammation causing foods meaning dairy sugar all the pasta and bread all those things seem to have a profound effect on certain people his daughter is one of them he's one of them and I know some other people as well I know some really smart people that have gotten into that and they've experienced profound changes in their body composition they've lost a tremendous amount of weight even people that are eating a large amount of meat it's not something that's attractive to me first of all I think fibers important phytonutrients our report and there's a lot of stuff you get from vegetables and also I don't have a negative reaction to vegetables doesn't seem to be affecting me but some people I think it's entirely possible do right and I think if you do have some really profound autoimmune issues particularly it seems to be effective with certain types of arthritis it's not the worst thing to give a shot I would definitely recommend that if you did do something like that that you would supplement and I don't think Jordans doing that at all I don't think there's any harm whatsoever in supplementing with multivitamins getting your essential nutrients essential fatty acids from fish oil the vitamin b-complex D complex make sure you've got all your bases covered nutritionally and then if your body just responds really well to only eating meat like Jordan looks fantastic every time I talk to me looks better I would be curious to know though what some of his metrics are the LDL HGS well here's the thing about that you know that is very poorly understood and almost always misinterpreted the LDL HDL correspondence and what it means in terms of like whether or not you're healthy arterial plaque is important and then there's there's all sorts of markers that can show inflammation inflammation in your body what your blood pressure is how some people react much differently to the various foods right we obviously know that some people urge to certain nuts sure this this thing the people very biologically so much that one of the things it needs to do nutrition experts have said are saying that if you just have your body consume just one thing in this elimination diet it eliminates so many different processes that your body has to engage in in order to break down all the other different things and in it eliminates all the different reactions that you get from all these various foods your body is only concentrating on one food all the time and it seems to alleviate a lot of these conditions there's also the fact that when you're eating just meat you're not going to be as hungry you're not going to you're not going to overeat as much it's it's much less likely that you overeat with protein yes and it is that you overeat with pasta breads and sugars and things along those lines in terms of caloric intake just you heat you reach your satiety point very quickly yes and that is probably a factor as well because Jordan has lost a tremendous amount of weight and I think in losing that weight his body's less inflamed he has less fat that's inhibiting his motion and you know his arteries and his body is his is his limbs aren't as fat its faces on his fat he's not snoring anymore which indicates that he was he probably had some fatness face and it was kind of blocking and and constricting his breathing it's all really interesting there's a gentleman I not sure if I'm gonna get his name right he's a nutritional psychiatrist at the Columbia University I just discovered him recently while working out on the elliptical through the big Fink series and he's got a couple of short clips where he talks about how incorporates nutrition within his psychiatric practice I think his name is Drew Ramsay he seems like a guy that would be unplugging so many people you're probably a few too many buddy I'm such a booking agent right no but I mean he seems like a really interesting guy and shows you here's a psychiatrist who thinks ultimately that a lot of our you know mood related issues relate to what we put in our bodies well there's no question that inflammation has a direct result or a direct action on how you think and feel inflammation makes people irritate it makes people with our Jick does a lot of terrible things to just your body in general which affects your brain which is a part of your body you know the idea that there's somehow or another or not interchangeable is pretty preposterous and people that don't take care of their body but want their brain to be healthy that is like you want your cake and you want to eat it too it's like you don't you don't make any sense you start looking at it holistic so someone who is as passionate as you are about these issues if someone in your family whether it be your wife or your children we're not doing the right choices does that cause you to be that much more irate because they're sort of within the purview of your influence or rebelling I would think that maybe I'm being an overbearing asshole I would look at it internally first and then I would look at them and try to figure out like what what is what is what's wrong here is this a simply a dietary thing or is it a psychological thing it would become a big project for sure I mean when there's a loved one that's it's essentially eating themselves into poor health which is really common I mean it's more common than it's not in fact I think the most recent estimate googled this if you will young Jamie I think the most recent estimate is it the United States is above 50% obesity rate right it's incredible which is stunning I actually when I was at the Canadian Senate hearings I actually argued that if we wish to get rid of bigotry then we get a lot more bang for our buck if we went after fat bigotry rather than transgender bigotry because there are so few people who are transgendered and even though we should condemn any bigotry they face they make a very small portion that and I was being facetious right but I was basically arguing that look if you really want to have these bills to try to stamp out bigotry you should be going after fatphobia because most Canadians are also obese now they didn't get I said it's a sizeable problem and even better obesity United States here goes 2018 course we have your risk factors adult obesity rates now exceed 35% in seven states yeah but what about children as well I think they were talking about overall I think overall I think children are more fat now than they've ever been ever well I had you might I mentioned earlier that I had read all that let's get the actual numbers again so chill adult obesity exceeds 35% 30% in 29 States 25% in 48 states West Virginia as the highest adult obesity rate 38% Colorado lowest at 22 shout out to Colorado adult obesity rate increased in Iowa Massachusetts Oklahoma Rhode Island South Carolina what is it by four not just adult obesity but overall obesity what is the obesity rate in America 160 million people there it is 160 million people in America are either obese or overweight nearly three-quarters of American men and more than 60% of women more than 60% of women are overweight 30% of boys and girls under the age of 20 are obese or overweight so remember I was mentioning earlier talk I was mentioning the Health Summit that I held at my university mm-hmm one of the guys his name is Robert Lustig he's a pediatric endocrinologist he was our he was saying that many instances of diabetes and other really high blood pressure that you would never ever see in young children is now very very common very common 2530 years ago he would never have a single patient who was under certain age and now it's every everyday basically it's a stunning statistic it's it's disgusting it's sad to see and it's it's a you know people are a prisoner of their diet and that's that's it most of it and you know exercise plays a factor for sure it speeds up your metabolism but the bottom line is you got to stop eating shit you got to stop eating so much but it's so satisfying to people especially people that feel this feel like unsatisfied and unfulfilled and unhappy and they're medicating themselves with food because they get this little charge every time they stuff a cake down their mouth or they eat a sandwich or they eat a giant bowl of unhealthy stuff I feel like you're gonna break out into being Kevin Spacey in the movie se7en where he goes out killing people who knows lava governing the way you're speaking with such disdain because it's not it's not necessary crying this is a disease that you're giving yourself right this is what's sad this is like and I understand if you don't have an education on this and some people don't but that's not the case with most people most people understand that what they're eating is bad for them they do it anyway well which shows you that it's not only about you you don't do bad things simply because you didn't know anybody right yeah sure example psychology is very encyc ology is so unbelievably complicated and that's why I love my life that's why I love my profession every day I wake up and I'm in a playground what's the next problem that I'm going to tackle and have fun studying that's why I love my life and I hope everybody I often get people who write to me and say what's the secret why are you always smiling I'm always smiling well number one I'm healthy I have a great family but I wake up every day excited about the prospects for the day if you could find that half the bottles one well your your position your life your your your study is so it's so rich with information and it's so illuminating in terms of like why certain things occur in our culture why people do certain things like what's the motivation and and and your perspective on it like knowing all these motivations and knowing what's causing all these different actions and reactions and it's got to be just constantly interesting because it is so much and I get to meet guys like you and hang out with guys like you well is your a great thing about my jobs I get to meet guys like you and learn all this Chris shit thank you buddy listen tell everybody about your show it's on YouTube the sad truth Sacher with sa AD truth you could follow me on twitter at GA
