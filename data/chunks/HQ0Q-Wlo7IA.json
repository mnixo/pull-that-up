yeah he looked like either that or for someone who would lie about being Puerto Rican because they're really from like somewhere that no one's ever heard of when they're tired of people saying where the fuck is that they go it's yeah I'm just Porter Rican how's it look it looks very Spanish like but New York City fly you might stick with it right Oh for real he's a goddamn artist imagine if it
