the gyro gun experience I think William James was one of the one of the guys who really did a good job of that saying basically you know if I may be right about this way of thinking but even if I'm not thinking this way allows me to lead a better life and I think he was talking about freewill and he was basically saying look I don't know if we have free will or I don't know if everything we do is based on a causal chain of events that we really can't control but thinking about freewill in a way that it does exist allows me to live a better life and so guess what I am a proponent of freewill because that allows me to live a better life that way because I feel like I have more flexibility more choice I'm a happier person and I think sometimes people forget some of that too you know I mean there's something to be said for thinking about things even if you don't know you know think about things in in a way that's gonna allow you to lead the best life and you know way better than if you don't know anyways you think about something in a way that fucking sucks like I'm gonna go to hell for sure well if you're wrong in that you've lived a life being afraid and being worried about shit and you were wrong might as well think in a positive way and still you still may turn out to be wrong but hey along the way you lived in a better way yeah sounds like someone's starting a cult that's what I just heard I heard obvious yeah no no doubt man I mean there's uh III think it's couldn't it might not be either/or as well it might be another one of those situations yeah you know it uh it there's I think there's a lot of things going on there's a lot of things going on this life and I think we should acknowledge all of them you know we should acknowledge the most importantly the mystery of it all that's one of the big things that drives me crazy about someone when they say you know that this is this and that is that and the you know the way you should live is this and the way the government should do is that and the way we're gonna solve this is by that like maybe not maybe not like are you are you really so sure that you're paying attention to what the fuck is going on we're flying through space like we're on a spaceship if the spaceship was a hundred feet wide you'd be freaking the fuck out right now the only reason why you're not freaking out is because it's like thousands of miles but it's still a spaceship you're on a spinning fuckin thing and at nighttime you could see the space you're flying through and you're spending a thousand miles an hour in a circle and you're floating around this giant nuclear explosion and that's around other bigger rocks that are flying behind you and gas giants and then other galaxies and other universes and on and on and you're just hurtling through it while you're worried about what's on TV and why the Walking Dead has so many commercials and why gas is for two hours and if you imagine if this was let's say put yourself in a position where this really was a dream and you had a lucid dream where you're aware you know is that what you would want to do with your dream if you were going to sleep at night and you were saying you would worry about all of these inane things never actually be in the present moment never take an adventure never go on a risk never love because you could get hurt no if you if this if you really did treat this like a dream you would do as much cool shit as possible you know and put is put as many good things into that dream as you possibly could and not not be so fucking stressed out about all this nonsense you know and and I think we've been talking a lot it's kind of been the theme of this podcast but if you actually did if this was a lucid dream you know you would live it in a different way you would live it to have some fun and enjoy you're like what can I fly so my lucid dreams I want to fly or breathe underwater breathe underwater is cool - that's a good one yeah it would be very strange if one day as it was proven that we are really living in some sort of self created reality it would be like really traumatizing for a lot of people that have fucked it up like this is what I made but it's like remember when you were in school and like there was a project and you had to use your hand to make a turkey and you put your hand down and you drew around and then you know everybody did their own little turkey painted it and then the teacher would put them up and they would all look at him some people's turkeys look like dogshit it looked I didn't know what the fuck a turkey looked like they didn't even know how to draw around their hand like everything was a disaster and other people had beautiful turkeys well your life is a work of art you your life is like a hand turkey that you make and great school it's you could do whatever you want with that thing you can make it super dope ya know you can you can make it so it looks really cool if you put the effort and time into it if you really focus on it or you could just have fast that motherfucker and draw a bunch of squiggly things don't look anything like fingers some eyeballs that are floating above a stupid fake turkey head yeah and everybody's like what the fuck's wrong with Bob I think one of the one of the coolest pieces that I've seen and I have to go to the bathroom so I don't know if you want to know but it's Alan it's called Alan Watts inception is the name of the video on Google oh yeah that's a great video
