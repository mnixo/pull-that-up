the Joe Rogan experience that's an interesting way of doing it are you completely opposed to legalization no no no I mean I am not completely opposed to legalization my concern here is that the country we're too ignorant right now for legalization not that people will go out and do some dangerous things related to drugs but if you legalize drugs now what will happen is that you will have the detractors say things like any ills in the society is going to be blamed on a drug you're so ignorant we're susceptible to believing that so before legalization I'm arguing that we have this increase in education about what drugs do and don't do so people cannot be susceptible to being hoodwinked like that I'm arguing that the education provides an inoculation if you will so you're saying we can't handle the truth essentially what are you saying is that we need this decriminalization step before we get to a legalization that it's the it's we couldn't just jump right into legalization it would be too much change pandemonium people go crazy fear people would use propaganda to set people against the you know to go against it yeah so I'm thinking about well I'm not saying that it'll be pandemonium we have Washington and Colorado right now mark my words there will be studies coming out of Washington and Colorado showing that young people in those states do more poorly on whatever measure you want to have as a result of marijuana the studies the data won't support that conclusion but that's what people are going to be drawing from those data and so I am this is my prediction right now as a result of people's ignorance about marijuana and that's that's marijuana a drug that we have a lot more experience than with heroin and but mark my words you'll see those studies come up and they religions have a way of prosecuting psychedelic losers losers losers losers but they would call it the work of the devil and that's what I ran into with the Mazda text who I was working with up in Oaxaca is that they had to when the Spaniards came they had to flee into the hills to continue the mushroom and now you'll actually see I went to San Jose del Pacifico one town where the mushrooms are readily accessible in this other town what la de Jimenez and you'll see on the churches they have Jesus and Mary and then on the other side they have a mushroom so they actually worship the mushrooms it kind of mixed I guess to survive they mixed Catholicism in with their worship of these mushrooms and it's it's pretty trippy appreciate to see it painted on these churches that's actually a big part of really ancient religious artwork period you know a lot of if you look in look up do some research on the connection between mushrooms and even the Catholic Church there's mushroom iconography all over the place and really ancient descriptions of one of the earliest depictions of Adam and Eve on some ancient fresco is Adam and Eve with a mushroom tree in between them have you ever seen that image no see they pull that up Jamie Adam and Eve mushroom picture and we'll find the description of it and Eve mushrooms yeah we just lost track of all this stuff it's also one of the reasons yeah this is it's it's right away you could pull up that image it's pretty intense that's that's an image of Adam and Eve I mean look at that that's fucking crazy it was really strange for me when I was in Mexico to see them blessing the mushrooms on the altar instead of the communion holy water they give you mushrooms and that's your sacrament that's what you eat there's another one Jamie pull up those are the other another one that's a different image but a very very similar image see that one on the far left far left yeah right there click up that one look at that isn't that trippy that's from 1147 they call it seee now they don't call it ad anymore for whatever reason but that's from 1147 so they knew even back then about psychedelic plants having some sort of a connection to christianity and these were you know these are from churches so it's um it's really fascinating that that's just something that went away even before I ever went into the jiu jitsu philosophy I I fought a tough man contest when I was 18 years old mr. t was the referee I swear to god it was at the video that I have video was on Entertainment Tonight the show clip of me with a mohawk that's three guys I for all heavyweight stadium 175 and up I know I had my clothes on and I was also I was like I was round that weight by 175 at all so uh I fought three guys I I knocked out two guys man the second guy to constitute how about that tough man experience was the worst head trauma then all my fights combined how about that one yeah yeah for sure Wow I had a concussion like you wouldn't believe I never fight sure to this day you want to get grossed down in case you ain't hearing at home kids that's nothing with my tongue that's my jaw goes from the top I was brick by I fought one guy and he was a dance funny because they had it they put it the two smallest guys together so they put me versus this guy he's fucking scarred for life man it was me versus uh they announced me as a weightlifting pizza boy from Long Island up you guys deliver pizzas and my buddy at the time Jim McCluskey he was a professional boxer me and him Easter we got into a ton of street fights together but uh he's the items parted in my life but I used to fight a lot he sky looks stand like this you less of a target that's it that's my so I I went in there I don't know what the fuck to expect no headgear just these big gloves on that guy who runs it whatever is a mouse bears yeah delete I don't know I guess so but uh they put me in verse this platoon leader from Desert Storm and this guy is from Long Island zoo I didn't know and I end up fucking drill them so I fucking hammer them and be they stopped it right away that clip I can get ideas on I got it on tape I can uh I got to get it to you I think you don't want to see it it's funny because I showed it on it to Taemin tonight oh my god that's great Mary Hart whoever it is making a face but mr. t was the referee yeah you're a smart dude because I was just at this tech conference and and we resolved CEOs and the thing and we were talking about it and I would got into a fight with one of these big dudes they're an old dude big powerful guy and he said you know who wouldn't jail so Snowden I said me I wouldn't tell what's the difference between Snowden and Woodward and Bernstein Woodward and Bernstein and the presidential papers like they were the punks of their generation like but now they're heroes because it's the baby boomers and Snowden's fuck you it's what's good for the goose is good for the gander anyway we got into this fight what's he what's his argument you know why didn't he it was just he's bad and then has whatever the same argument no no not he's weakened yeah country traitor kill myself for the house in front of them and so and so you know so we got into this fight but but you know the interesting thing about that is a the fact that a lot of people you know whistleblowing is seen as on their I see it as as that's what's gonna keep democracy safe but this sort of overreaching and I said look you know I didn't come to America for it to be able to live in a police state and this is the definition of a police state is that they can watch everything that we do and that it was all these tech guys and the tech guys just sort of rolled their eyes and said it's already happened yeah the tech is already there the government has already made the deals it's a de facto thing you can't change it and then then I got kind of worried cuz you're exactly right you're 100% right the tech is so pervasive that you can't fuck with it
