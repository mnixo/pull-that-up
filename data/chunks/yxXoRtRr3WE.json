the gyro can experience why wouldn't we assume that the reason why we're so conflicted and weird is because that's the proper mechanism that needs to be in place for people to move forward in the direction that we're moving forward to be the be constantly chasing technology without any real clear sort of a rational approach to using our resources and looking at the problems that we have because we're like a bunch of little kids that have liked shit all over their house but instead we're outside working on the garden you know we're planting trees we're not cleaning up the shit that we piled up in the middle of the living room and it keeps piling up every day to the point where we can't even live in our house anymore we're concentrating on some shit that's not even ours do you think you could ever live you probably couldn't but maybe in your maybe say like if you didn't have kids in the faming families do you think you could ever live in like one of those Airstream trailers but myself fuck yeah because I was recently I recently went to you know Joshua Tree in one of those and I was thinking like really this is all I really need and I could take my whole fucking house anywhere I want in the new ones I have like nice wood floors and I have some of them expand out you know there's there's been you know a lot of people that are moving towards minimalist house is really small houses but there's a bunch of online that show like how certain people live it's kind of interesting you know like one guy figured out a way to have like this little tiny cooking area and he pulls the bed out and the bed comes out of the wall he lives by himself and he has like some storage up in top like toilet paper and things along those lines but it's a tiny tiny little house in a little kitchen dinette area and you know the idea is that like really why do we have to have this giant fucking footprint of a house that we live in because you're getting paid bitch if I want to live in a fucking cell I'll live in a fucking sound like a monkey I'm gonna live with a fold-up bed like I'm James Bond like some fucking boy Rican that gets a check on the fifth go fuck your mother if you get paid you live in a fucking house I'm gonna live in a micro fucking house with a little kitchen so cook like I got a black guy bagging me in the fuckin ass I don't leave that you spread out even me I'm no millionaire I got a big fucking kitchen a micro house what are you fucking people talking about I just snapped out of this dog you can't take me into those deep waters like you read the fucking kills a brother right now a fucking house with a bed upside down fuck that shit to say better you fuck you you get paid you fucking live like a normal purse go to Trump and say hey wig move into a fucking thing to say but if you don't if you don't have a Russian bitch slapping in the fucking fire the fuck these people micro houses in the fucking desert you play it out to the world ends like a doctor like a doctor you live your fucking life you're right doomsday I'm gonna put a can of tomato soup under my stairs don't wait for the Martians to come when it's over it's over you go out when they were your dick on you take your fucking chances like a man I'm gonna live like a fuckin old twenty dollars to a bookmaker downstairs in my house get the fuck out of my face Brian's down Joey's not and you have a real clear line feel like you're in one when you're in there it's so somebody farts and you're in for fucking speed FISA and you're like I paid $10,000 so I can smell your asshole get the fuck out of here because everything's great in a small space till somebody blows the fucking fart you will walk into a bathroom after somebody else shit it fuckin bothers you even pay your mother you look at them like you dirty fucking bitch light a candle something you know I don't wanna sell you don't want to live nothing small fuck that shit I'm never home though you know like I work so much I'm never hired you're always fuckin I'm on the sleep [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
