by the time this actually wake up he's gonna be I don't think they do that slow they do they start so or they want I think that's different than anyway I'm very confused by the time they get to Trump he's already so nerve-racked you know I'm saying because he like chips away at his borders like slowly but surely takes away all the people around him yeah he gets closer and you know you know you know he's concentrating on the family in knowing well of course of course that's what he does and even does that with people like stone he'll go after your family and stuff you notice you never hear a word out of Ivanka anymore you know exactly yeah yeah I guarantee you yeah guarantee you they scared the fuck out her but if you want to know about mullah like you said it how fuckin creepy he is he was the head of the FBI during the 80s of the whitey Bulger's shit went down oh yeah and he put four guys in her he listened to this joke and this you can look this up this isn't me four guys he put in prison and wrongly it turns out two of them died in prison whoa yeah you can go cuz of Bulger it had to do with that cuz yes they would do things in the FBI would let them get away with it because they were providing information right that was the whole bunch exactly right and he fought two guys died in prison wrongly by the way this guy's not a fuckin good guy no he's a Marine and decorated Marine and shit they make those sacrifices they make those decisions where they're just gonna like help a person who's a criminal because that criminals providing information that can allow them to get more criminal well yeah large whitey was providing all kinds of shit about the guineas and he spotted him that was a great mojito by the way you know the guy was one of Whitey's hit men Dana White no no it was he like a threatened he had to move out of town it was a ball Joanna balls are related yes it was belated when I was teaching Taekwondo I had one of the guys that was in my class that was whacking people for whitey bulger he was asking me if you want to kill somebody with your bare hands where would you hit him like the neck was like 18 I was like he goes correct you look good yeah like that what was it Kevin nah no no no but you know Kevin you know he went away - yes um now the tough kid yeah all related all of them together you know um this guy was a different guy this guy was he went away - but I mean he went away forever he was one of those guys like they caught him with blood under his fingernails Andy was working with whitey yeah yeah well there's a lot of guys that were I mean it was a big organization when when we were kids I mean everybody knew it was a big organ it wasn't it wasn't a fucking secret no I know how did Hannity's attempt to link mower to Whitey Bulger hold up this article in The Boston Globe no that's not true whatever it's the FBI he was you're gonna wasn't there wasn't there then oh he wasn't at the FBI yeah Muller served the US Attorney's Office in Boston from 82 to 88 his chief of the Criminal Division first assistant US attorney and acting US Attorney for more than a year during that time bulge around a sprawling criminal enterprise and got away with murders because he was a longtime FBI informant who corrupted his handlers the FBI he corrupted his handlers I loved it and the FBI and the new horse crime strike force a prosecute prosecutorial unit that worked independently in the US Attorney's Office reportedly reported directly to the Justice Department used Bulger to build cases against the Mafia and give him a pass on his own crimes the FBI's corrupt relationship with Bulger was exposed after he was indicted on federal racketeering charges in 1995 became a fugitive he was captured 16 years later yeah out here you know so yeah I was captured in Santa Monica and so when did Mueller says did Mueller know the four men have been wrongly convicted and looked the other way there's nothing linking Mueller to that case according to several attorneys for four the men volumous court records and a former federal judge who presided over their wrongful imprisonment trial in 2007 the US District Judge nancy gertner found the FBI deliberately withheld evidence that the four men were innocent the bureau helped cover up the injustice for dec Jesus cries I fucking hate Reid and shit like that she ordered the government to create a man and their families a hundred and 1.7 million okay maybe worth it you were never gonna make a hundred million chicken-scratch and they've all got a hundred million if every one of them we got a hundred million I mean I'm in I mean how much time you have to do how many times you get fucked while you're in jail how about per load fuck man so maybe it was just a rumor that he was a part of that well like you said though that's the FBI yeah as a story broke him sure they called the paper and said listen get your facts straight well how crazy is that the FBI covered up the information and knew those guys were innocent that is dark yeah who went to jail for that did the guys who covered it up go to jail I'm not sure but all of them died you can't they died in jail two of them died in jail oh well you know they caught him because his wife was yelling and shit all times yeah she was cocoa he had fucking cash on the walls and she did he I used to sell don't meet door to door when I before I start a comedy and I used to go to fuck and went to hell not knowing where I was you know I would I would wonder why people look at my I take out my shit and they go that's light that breaks sound like 40 bucks a pound get the fuck out and then somebody explained to me you know what the hell is like whitey Bulger's Wow so your son meeting his neighbors oh yeah fuckin same in East Boston I knocked a door a couple of guys in Revere that would like fuck it connected my buddy l know who they were and shit later on well they probably knew people from meatpacking they probably got no it off of course of course and I'm I'm doing my little spiel there for a boy look you know a fucking boiler room operation no you break it down pour a meal it comes out there three bucks of and they're doing the math in the head you could tell they were like bookies you know I feel like that's like 40 bucks a pound get the fuck up my steps that much but it was ridiculous you know but and I was in Rhode Island banging doors and I and I got the same response and I looked on I see in the streets the lines on the street too red white and green I was in federal help in Providence where the Mafia stopped look at that sign that article look at this Whitey Bulger Santa Monica hideout was full of money it still brims with mystery he was living in like a normal apartment I know so weird he had eight hundred twenty-two thousand dollars in cash and valuables Wow Jesus Christ I like that movie I thought Johnny Depp was great night yeah he was he was great in it yeah that's a creepy toad yeah he was as creepy as they get it's just amazing how much corruption was involved in that case yes and that what a federal government was a part of it and they let that monster they let him thrive yeah yeah so makes you wonder about the FBI today well it should make you much it shows you what they're capable of yeah what it that way whenever you're doing that whenever you're allowing someone to commit murder and deal drugs to get other people that are committing murder and dealing drugs what yeah because they would just want it they did look what happens with cops in this is very unfortunate but this is just just what happens when you have a game and the game is arrest people the game is win right certain amount of collars you have to make and if you can make more collars because you're in bed with a bad guy especially if maybe you grew up in that neighborhood yeah it's always been kind of accepted part of that neighborhood a guy Connelly grew up with whoa yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah it makes a sneaky little deal yeah it was Sam it lawyers it's all about you you have to ever it's like sports you have to have a winning record oh you're not gonna succeed so they yeah you know they play outside the rules I mean that's one of the reasons why cops and people have such a weird relationship because they're always looking to rest people and you cops talking you're like don't put me on your record come on yeah and they just wanna leave I can get you for something yeah I gotta get somebody no I know but they have quotas like when you have quote like what would the police force do if nobody broke crimes anymore did make shit up if they what would they do like legit God really do that what never happened it would never happen but what if everybody got on mushrooms and the world the world Alicia yeah the world got cleaned up I was wondering how long would it take to get that not much how much time can we get couple years ago I mean the conversation all the mushrooms I got some right here if you want some dude I can't even handle regular mushrooms fucking Jam shiitake make me crazy I don't know how you do that shit we have a discussion DMT and flutter bell oh yeah it just it the whole I mean the Muir thing is very it's very interesting it's very interesting because you're watching a professional like cast a web-like nice and slow yeah nice and slow this is the full force of the FBI against you and if they would against our I just don't like I said they'll do you know yeah it's creepy well Jamie said they opened up the government today to distract from the fact that Rodgers don't gotta rustling cleanest most likely I think you're right I think that's a good assessment I guess I mean Trump's the final target so but yeah he's gonna he's gonna threaten stone wood you know he's like 66 yeah threatens him with ten years he's probably gonna yeah he's got enough to fuckin sing but he's such a singer song like Dershowitz says they don't just sing they they they actually how did Dershowitz put it they actually you know come up with the lyrics they create you don't just sing yeah you know what do you think is gonna happen to trump if you have yes as far as this investigation nothing really pass Senate coffee thank you yeah why do you think nothing's gonna happen you know that well that's not true I shouldn't say that because only because I think Mull is pretty fucking evil and will come up with something well you know what impeachment at the at the worst but was the high crimes and misdemeanors what what well if there's obstruction of justice if there was collusion if there was any sort of if they can prove that there was some sort of concerted effort to undermine democracy yeah well sure I don't think III don't think they'll get to get them even Raja's stone they're not charging him with collusion of conspiracy just lying and covering up they don't they don't happen for collusion conspiracy they're lying and covering up the interactions with Russians right so what it is I I guess that will be Mullis angle you know Jamie was talking about something yesterday and I started listening to this recent Sam Harris podcast and it is fucking fascinating how much Russian troll farms and all these fake accounts and what they're trying to do and one of the things they're trying to do is what Jamie was saying was that that kid with the maca hat with a Native American beat the drum in front of him yeah the image of that was posted by this website that turned out in control farm but it was in Brazil it was a blogger in Brazil yeah yeah when they did CNN looked into it they just kind of asked Twitter what's going on with this account and by the time they'd asked them they just suspended the account so it's gone but but you said they suspended the account because the account was a fake account yet they had they thought it was posing as like a California teacher yeah her name's Talia yeah but it was it was an actual blogger in Brazil oh so was Brazil wasn't Russian no I'd fast I wasn't sure no I'm saying like it was sewn into a fake account of some but yes they seized of yeah well they're trying to get people against which course they're doing that in a minute like people need to understand that this is actually really happening and do we need their help early will we do it against each other the Russians help well if you stop and think about it has there ever been a time with the left and the right were more you chose throats and CNN's enough you don't need Russia hey but but art is CNN enough to really get people turned against each other like this no fucking way you need angry discourse online and the way that yeah I'm from there's there's an amazing radio lab podcast about this will where they talked to people that actually worked in these troll farms and that these people were they would both be left-wing and right-wing and is one of the things that they're talking about on the Sam Harris podcast it's I think it's called war of information but they'll pose as like pro-choice people and say ridiculous yes like over the ridiculous and then they'll pose as pro-life American flag and you know Magga in the in the you know the hashtag more and they're they're heading but they have nothing to do with that they're just Russians and they're just trying to get people riled up and you see people jump on board oh it's chiming in but I was talking to a comic that we were talking about that I won't bring his name up but he referred me to this this Russian guy I can't a mycommerce name but this is a clip of this Russian guy who worked for the KGB defected over here and he was explaining how Russia does that yeah and this was back in the 80s will we do it too everybody does it they all do it everybody doesn't they fuck with the system in any way shape or form in order to achieve a desired result I think the Russians are the best well I just think they're way more dedicated to it and yeah I mean it's a sneaky way to go about doing things too because Russia doesn't have the the kind of money that the United States has they got nothing they have you know their economies the size of Texas yeah well they have is nuclear weapons they've almost like a third world and a brutal dictator and a dictator yeah that's all it takes but as if our is the economy and everything you're like a third-world shit yeah it's well they're like a small European country but it's really interesting when you you listen to these podcasts about how much effort they put into sewing discourse or discord to getting people upset with each other to starting arguments and to saying things that are gonna upset people in order to get the right versus the left yeah - like sure to undermine democracy from the inside yeah it's really interesting it's weird that it works but it makes sense that it works sure it's a sneaky-ass strategy yeah you think CNN does just as good a job you really do then horrible but you're so you're so right wing you can I'm not so right wing Joe right wing all right middle middle right I'd say you Center right if so not right of center right or so yeah yeah yeah what's wrong with Siena do you like it first of all I don't need to hear it in every fucking airport before I'm doing a gig last fucking words I want here with Wolf Blitzer before my plane crashes um somebody told me wolf blitzer got on Jeopardy and they exposed him yes I remember reading that because you know people get on television they read off a teleprompter you think they're Bryant they seemed brilliant you know they say early is alone about low egos on Jeopardy and wins but louis c.k yeah did he yeah remember they have celebrities on one smile when did you do that a couple years ago did he go on with regular people and when I forget who he's against I think was other famous people remember Jonathan dropped yeah oh he's very smart well do you remember he went on Jeopardy against regular people 181 at one time yeah he won the whole tournament a comic yeah so folks don't take us like this he's still right for there is Wolf Blitzer - $4,000 dumbass yeah it didn't work out so well ah fuck good funny it is hilarious oh you know people can pretend to be smart you know teleprompter they give you the script you know but John it was Jonathan Groff does he still write for Conan it's a good question I don't know the last time I saw him but he was fucking really really bright funny guy - and really funny yeah yeah I don't think he just stand up anymore though he just writes that's how smart he is yeah he's like enough for this nonsense his jokey joke nuts enough is enough he's not gonna feel that way um but what why do you hate CNN oh come on all the fucking shit they put out there and you know just an example how about before the when when Donna Brazile had the notes for Hillary before the fucking Bernie yes remember that with this man's discredit you see it was she was upon bit right and they still had her on that's what I make ulis that they had her on after that yeah total questions were going to be yeah yeah well her book was amazing know that that's what's interesting is they fucked her over and then she came out look ripped them that bridge they are I haven't I haven't read it yet so my glasses of it but what I read about how they rigged the DNC that's how they how they fuck Bernie out of the primary yeah yeah woo yeah Bernie gets screwed it's a dark business and it's all the same they're all in Kochi but you don't think like the mainstream media this little like a propaganda arm for the Democratic Party well they die ninety-three percent negative coverage they definitely think they're working for the good but it's ninety-three percent negative coverage with Trump right Trump isn't you know he's an unusually polarizing figure sure I mean was it that way with my guess I was probably pretty negative with Bush all with this world back then no was but they always since I've been a kid I mean Reagan was a dummy and just fucking be actor and an idiot and a racist you can look at the ship year after year mister of George Bush Senior George W Bush Dick Cheney warmonger but it's the same shit racist bigot race and it works and for it works Lord was morning and Ford was remember how he was portrayed on SNL he was always falling he couldn't walk three feet which was kinda true actually he was an athlete but it's always been that way so the mainstream media has always sort of been more liberal and alright but then you have Fox News which goes far the other way well what their opinion shows but at least when you watch Fox knows which everybody who hates Fox who's never watches it number one but but they at least have liberals on you know and Shepard Smith and hates yes yes because he looks like every guy that bullied him as a kid do you think that's why it's yeah I do that's it yeah do you like do nothing reason most of them hate him he's he here's what's not here's what they don't bring up even Hannity and all these guys you get your head going like a pound for chrissake let's change the subject he's getting irritated with me already I gotta get you out of LA I'm afraid you're gonna get disease tell me about it but what we just talking about why they might Trump because they never bring up this though they never well does he say alpha male blond hair blue eye right fucking billionaire that is the that's the embodiment of the devil for the left they never bring that up on the show do you think that's really what it is there's no I'll do with him on lying all the time and what's he lie about the number of people at his inauguration as opposed to Obama going oh you can keep your health care I mean the fucking you know he doesn't lie any more than any other person you don't think so if he does it's trivial shit he's the salesman he's a is a fine line well he's definitely a Salesman but always a bullshitter but that's what we need we're a corporation we're corporate the countries don't you think so that's what I always heard it's kind of like that a little bit I mean what it's some some sort of an organization you really Taylor II claim Lionel oh yeah for sure well why didn't you get called on it how was that fat twat not in cups oh how dare you it is a good question you know yeah it's a great question I was talking to Mike Baker who used to work for the CIA Paulie I met my fuckin web guy no deceit bargain he wanted to come out here with me and Mike Baker from the CIA is if he if he did anything remotely like what Hillary did he'd be in jail for 30 years of course yeah remember the kid in the submarine that worked for the Navy they took just a summary I mean he left took a selfie and it had bad shit in the background they were supposed to take photos of and how long was he in jail I don't know yeah so I would just like to see some equity as far as people being held accountable on both sides well maybe it would have been different if Hillary made it through maybe it would have been different in terms of like media coverage if she actually became president now they would have sucked her ass yeah I think so I don't know man once Donna Brazil's book came out and people have an understanding about the inner workings of the party I mean I think look it politics are it's a dirty dirty business filthy dirty it's worse than podcast but it's podcast a pretty clean I know like relatively but that's why people come to it yeah I can't get the tro from mainstream media while I was trying to explain to a friend who was talking about doing a podcast deal with a network I was like stop you can't this is the one thing that you can have what you it can be mainstream and it's free of everything how free of any influence and you're gonna let a bunch of pencil pushers and and button pressors they're gonna tell you what you can and can't say which direction you can and can't go you know they're gonna try to influence you but isn't Google doing that now what do you mean with conservatives like shutting down Dennis Prager it's like a fuckin what do you mean as far as well I'm sure opens oh my go about a company right okay what I'm talking about a company you going into business with them yeah and you can't where you're a podcast you're free and independent right it's probably the only thing in the world where you can be completely free and independent and still reach millions of people it really is the only thing in the world but but but his bungled what I'm saying Google owns YouTube right right and people like Dennis Prager a religious right guy uh-huh his well his show gets shut down on YouTube you mean it's shut down he's suing he's suing fucking gold oh I didn't know about this yeah I know he does those shows with Corolla right so listening to him and I lived in LA he's a conservative religious Jewish guy I've listened to him honey yes well they they consider it hate speech I mean that's that's when we get into a dangerous territory wait a minute I pull up what would happen to him cuz I'm completely ignorant about this this is the first time I'm hearing about that this is gonna go to the Supreme Court really I think so they pulled this so they took his page down they said you can't have a page on YouTube anymore yeah they shot his show Dom do you remember what it was about know what specifically but I know it was labeled hate and if you listen to this guy for 10 minutes he's the most congenial fair-minded you know but he's he's a you know a religious guy do you know and flying you know Douglas mario's he's actually her who is he's a he's a an intellectual from England who wrote about wrote the book about immigrants in Europe called the strange death I think it's called Islam and a strange death of Europe and he's basically talking about how people from these countries that have emigrated into Europe are changing the culture changing the culture and North Africa there's all sorts of you know crimes and things that are happening that didn't exist before and people are developing these communities of like-minded people that didn't exist but I know goes on and and he's saying that this is you know this is fundamentally dangerous but he's saying it from a point of perspective of understanding the actual facts involved and talking about the situation you're talking about how these are people that don't respect homosexuals they want to throw them off rooms and they have these write up a new genre they have these opinions about people that are extremely antiquated not aligned with European values in a modern Western world right he and sam harris had a conversation and that conversation got flagged on youtube it got flat cuz someone put it up in there there you know you make a look a little watchlist what is it called what it was a call of the list you could when you put it on youtube on your channel where you could the playlist yeah so he puts it on his playlist and he gets a computer a Community Guidelines strike against him for putting up this conversation between two intellectuals so I have this conversation with this lady at YouTube and I said well why why would you do that why why does that get she goes well it's hate speech I go it's hate speech are you talking about to intellectuals having a discussion about a real thing that's happening right now in Europe and you're saying hate speech if you listen to the podcast there's no slurs used just facts they're just saying with a Praeger but this is this was the way she said it cuz it's hate speech like you had you said that so easily yes you'd never see that's a lot of power but it's also a lot of irresponsible power responsible use of power but but but but my point is they're cracking down of people who lean right whether it's Twitter yes you know I'm at 100% RIA and that's a big fucking problem hate speech I'm we're gonna let Google decide oh what's the name of that come to the help a bit they're going to decide what what I brought that up on I brought that up on a tough crowd years ago about when you disagree with a liberal or whatever your argument they always well you're a hater they would keep saying that and that's what it turned into if you just disagreed you're a hater mmm-hmm now it's you're a bigot or a racist if you didn't agree with Obama's policies your bigot or a racist and and that shit works that that's been working for the left years but now that the social media Google controls almost all the information you are you and I hear every day I mean that's why it's so dangerous so look up Prague is a is the first example that comes to mind that guy yeah because he's he's you know Christian or whatever he's not he yeah he's Jewish but but you'd hang it up it unless unless I'm what I just read was wrong they weren't done from YouTube at least they weren't deleted they were restricted put it like meaning like they show that uh the adult thing like you have to have an account that says you're 18 or older or something like that and they were fighting and having a lawsuit against that saying that what they have in their videos are not shouldn't be behind that like that wall whatever that is they also then but this is my point you have to go to youtube to get the story hold on alright their website went to a couple different websites to see it but they were also like yesterday they had ads blacklisted from Spotify so they had ads that were I guess Aliyah proved and now they have been disappearing really explained to the Dennis Prager says yeah well he's so in soaps but his page is still up you know Corolla night yeah I believe ask him about it yeah well but the YouTube page is still up his shows not yet his Oh his show I shut down they might have taken it down by now this is like this is kind of from a couple months yeah yeah they shot him down so if you go to the Dennis Prager YouTube channel it doesn't exist hmm so the idea that they would make that 18 plus because it's conservative that's all errors well it's up this is it right this is channel bro Prager you yeah but it's got a million subscribers million nine hundred and forty shut his shell down I thought I brought it back up is over you sure maybe so they have a video up from an hour ago Spotify Bands Prager from advertising ok Google Prague a lawsuit that's what it was about it's about the be angry restrict yeah I am angry cuz when I get in a full story here well let me know that it's up right now it's he's uh he's so on them yeah no I believe you so my point being is these big big tech companies a crushing conservative well when's the most part right yes and here's a good way to look at it if you're going after a guy like Dennis prey yeah who again it's most congenial guy never swears very very mild-mannered very cool and calm and whether you agree with them or disagree with them right it's not the the way to go about something like this if you disagree with someone it's not to shut him down have a debate exactly yeah and that's not happening well you know what you saw the Google memo you saw what happened with that guy when he provided all this information about one of the reasons why women don't get into tech and they labeled him as a massage woman-hater right define like no he's giving you scientific studies that show that women have different interests is that Lawrence Summers you're talking about there's been a few since Lawrence Summers was actually the president of Harvard and he was given a speech and and that's all he said he was he brought up the numbers as far as males going into science and math he didn't say women aren't good at it right and he get fucking canned from our bird yeah yeah you can't have anything as fascism yeah if it disagrees with the orthodoxy they'll come down on you even if it's factual like James two more and you could clearly back it up you could look at the actual numbers not only that that James to Morgan I put a page and a half in there on strategies for encouraging women to get an attack I mean if you was a real massage working for Hoda more google goggle yes he's the google memo right that was what started off yes all these intellectuals came to his side they go look why are we doing all this research if you guys completely ignore it every time it comes up right like you're pretending that this research is not valid its research is it's it's scientific information that shows that certain types of people are more interested in different things we've known that forever that's why boy toys and girl toys are different because boys and girls like different shit I mean it's basically a more complex version of that he's essentially saying women like different things it doesn't job that it can't what to say the only difference between the sexes is the sulci constructed obstacles you will gender you know has dropped gender itself it is they should come here and take a look at your place that would shut up shut the argument that's old male male gender I've got some female stuff here from when my kids come over tefik tell tell them what you said to me when I say what a fucking great place oh this is what happens when women don't get to tell you what to do place you have a warehouse of mail but this looks that's not a nice guy that's not bad and the problem is in this society male energy male thinking melanin is vilified and you're taught to think there's something wrong with being masculine being masculine is the reason why we don't speak German okay stop exactly talk about toxic masculine you could you'll be the poster boy for that shit well the whole reason why you need male people is because there's male people other places that will take away your shit and kill your people and exactly this is not a bad thing male does not equal evil just because there are evil men they are evil men doesn't mean all men are evil there's evil women too it doesn't mean all women are evil I dated three of them why don't you baby any more than three let's be honest yeah no you're absolutely right yeah and but this toxic masculine is is fossil air like you said for Ellie World War two however that turned out well there's just so many dumb phrases like that you know yeah well they made up do you know about heteronormative I'm sure I have you know cisgender cisgender yes zero normative yeah yeah like you're imposing the norms like as if heterosexuality is nor all well did you see what was the story couple days ago it was in California here a beautiful state of California they're trying to the heat you can't say he or she it's they now but yeah we're everywhere I'm saying Hannah something Jax and he yeah now you have to say they know and they were passing it they had her in the the meeting the actual town hall of City wherever they passing the ordinance and at the end she goes Mike my grandma my grammar teacher wouldn't approve of this she's rolling around her but we won't hear from her she said her and somebody called her out on it nonsense you shouldn't let your grandmother she's not here we corrected for identification of course she looked like Newt Gingrich's California state senator bans the use of he and she during committee hearings oh look at her with her perfect fuckin haircut no Gingrich is haircut like somehow its facing some people are just hilarious but they called her out she's trying to do a good thing though honey and they call her yeah they had a laugh about it but that is so funny who the fuck does she look like oh my god we won't be hearing from her well you made a she was interrupted by listeners who corrected her usage and de mail stop stop go back corrected her usage and go demand that she used the word they or them they demanded see this is the problem with all this shit yes it's demanding they're trying to control people they're telling people what to do and what not to do and it's about power a lot of this stuff is about power they're imposing their worldview on on you but it's not even their worldview it's not real what it is is they're just deciding that this is a thing that they're gonna agree to and they're gonna force other people to comply it's half the game half the game is just getting people to comply well you do that by and you start with language you control people's behavior through language yeah just the definition of political press well that's what Carlin always said that fascism is just political correctness with good manners our protocol correctness is fascism with good manners yeah how about we saw the clip of LOI at governor's when he was talking about this how the you know the Millennials are whoever demanding what we call them yes they are them I okay I'm Malou egos okay I'm a location yeah he's your mother's country then he goes I gotta come up with something more clever not as harsh what yeah I'm a location your mother's car keys yeah what did you think about all that stuff getting leaked well Louis you know Stanhope at a really good point about that but it would dougie say dougie was saying like look if this was a movie and if you took that movie and filmed it in the movie theater and then put it online you would be you go to jail that's right you're a criminal gross stealing right you're exposing your ruining his work yes but they think they can ruin his work because he jerked off in front of some people I don't even know if it's that I don't even know if the person that leaked it like was a Louie hater sometimes fan they were laughing hard yes yes Abel I was at it wasn't governor's it was the brokerage which is the same owners a few years ago and I'm up there doing my shit and working on a new hour I looked on and the kid about fifty sixth row I see him I see the red light yeah and he's got his head down so I can down off the stage he doesn't even hear me and I grab the phone out of his hand deleted I go dude you came out of cuz you're a fan of mine right I go the problem I explained it to him in the whole crowd the problem with this is if you put this shit online I'm working on new that's the old material right you're burning my shit do you get it yeah to all the other fans that listen to it for sure and also it's not fair because these bits are never done like if you want to release it half-baked like when when you first start working on a bit you have a premise you got kind of an idea where it's going horse yeah and then it eventually becomes a bit that you would put on a special right yeah and they get it halfway or a quarter yeah yeah and it looks shitty and and and and it's or if it's done if you're doing a bit that's complete yeah they it becomes old well that was some of the things that people were saying about Louie that the material is sloppy it's not like his old stuff yeah he's working shit on old stuff you saw when it was done like if you came to the store and saw him working on a set like a few years back you would see the same kind of stuff I got a couple of comets like that when I put my last special out there like well he's doing the same stuff well you came out to see me eight ten months ago when I was working on it yeah it's it's it's something process they don't understand though cuz it seems like when you're on stage and your top to top you're buggin it and it seems like you're doing something that they can do you're just talking oh I know you're just talking I could talk I think there's no other art form like that where it's just talking that's exactly right nobody yells at a concert nobody know that fucking you know I could play bass bet on that jerk-off yeah you know me but it stands out so people have you know because people have made their friends laugh well I think Seinfeld saw them pork yours ago because you know you make your friends laugh be everybody's made their friends left with your comic and you're like oh I can do this I call people out when they look bored with me or they have their arms folded I go do it you got that smug look in your face I know you could do this too but you'd rather work at the fucking Mattress Factory 80 hours a week in making fucking $400 there's people out there working in the Mattress Factory right now listening this going man fuck you nuke yeah well fuck them whoa hey how about you just ignore the guy that's $3,000 from Christie okay my weird well I know it's like a mattress how much would I pay you to make a mattress tonight in San Diego Mike I have to pay you a lot of money to build me a mattress you have to pay for the fall they'll be shit all together I'll fuck out of here you think I get a mattress be easy lays I get farm laying all over the house start with my wife's boobs right oh come on Joe where do you get this coffee it's fucking delicious good right I think this is black rifle black rifle half that name it's racist oh it's not gunmetal it's a company of veterans it makes you got coffee rings yeah veteran-owned you but you so black right fuck you Matt flags veteran-owned to Confederate your own company I got a flag they sent me when I did the Afghanistan USO thank guy sent me a flag that they used in battle nice you ever folded up and I had it hanging but then I made a gym out of my fucking whatever so I don't know where it is well I should probably find it I should probably put it back up shouldn't I yeah sorry I brought that up don't worry about it the louis c.k set you know it was very similar in my opinion to all the shit that he did before he got in trouble absolutely very similar salutely same kind of material the way he does things I mean people forget that this is a guy who went on Saturday Night Live and did a joke about pedophiles and about you know maybe we should let him get away with it so they don't kill your kids I mean there's guy who's fucked up it's a fucked up bit but he was the darling of the left back then and yeah as allowed to get away with that yes if he tried to do that same material had inton that then and instead did that now people would be fucking horrified what is it Joe about offending women or today's feminists what they are at the in my opinion all this political correctness that we hate so much shutting down they are at the Corbett well people maybe the I say this the the zeitgeist of the times is like a fat chicks emotion well very sensitive you can't you can't cross them well it's also because people are realizing now that they can make an impact one of the things that I read because he's doing this thing in Pittsburgh he was doing the improv in Pittsburgh and this lady who wrote the article wrote that he's making people put their cell phones in bags much like comedians Dave Chapelle and Joe Rogan do she used my name too he did I've done it before but I only did it when I was filming my Netflix special so I didn't want people putting the material out right before I was releasing the special and then afterwards I decided it was too much of a pain in the ass but the only reason why I was doing it well it had nothing to do with she said because they know words can offend yeah they don't want the con surprises well I'm gonna put it on Netflix anyways it's gotta be out to the public it's offensive it's good if you're looking to get offended go watch me I feel special there's plenty in there for you but I need to be able to do it correctly like I'm want to work it out so that it has the maximum amount of laughs with the minimum amount of people getting it the wrong way right so this it's all about wording and setting it up right and listening to it and going maybe there's a better way and you can't do that if somebody releases your shit sorry these people that don't know comedy and they're saying this like you have no idea what the process is like you just don't and if you if you do you would respect it and appreciate it right and the people that are comics that don't respect and appreciate the process like that's where we are now yeah but it's just because people can make an impact they can have a reaction just like the people yelling at her you know that that she said she said oh my grandma would be rolling over in her grave they're just trying to get a reaction from you they're just trying to push buttons they're just knowing that they can say something and they can have some sort of an impact we're gonna get louis c.k banned from here you know we're gonna get Nick DiPaolo kicked out of this club you can't come to this club you talk negatively about women and women's empowerment and that's dangerous to girls I only get kicked out of one place and of course one of the best clubs in the country what club then for Comedy Works you got kicked out of Comedy Works like 20-something years ago for what well it was a bachelor party ruining the middle guys set the the MC set and that I went up my second time there I think that's a great club cause and they started yelling shit fuck take off your shirt yet Dec that and I said can

idiot I can't let him sit i-i've got stem cells before and it felt good and then I run you know miles in the hills every day a week later yeah yeah yes I have liked a brightest in both knees yeah well stem cells help that definitely does there's this a bunch of different things you could do to help that before it gets real bad but one of the things they're doing in Panama I sent my mom down there to dr. Neil Riordan it is very good yeah do you know he is no no he I had him on the show with uh with Mel Gibson and Mel Gibson's dad was 92 when he went down there was in a wheelchair was all fucked up eight years and he walks a hundred years old he's fine but he's a hundred just 108 years old that's what happens we 92 and you live eight more years thanks for doing the math that's what happens you yell shit out you can you can say racist shit you get it off your chest you look to you hundred well it's only the boos that make some racist and now so what fucking guy's my hero fucking love Mel Gibson has he ever made a bad movie I mean made it himself well I didn't in a few shit shit movies pets anoxic masculinity right I liked Apocalypto I thought that was great a lot of people shit on them it was right up your alley yeah I loved it yeah exactly yeah I'm fascinated with that culprit though still I watch I wish I wish I was part now I love that movie I you know I think he's a very intense very unusual eccentric guy like just being around him you get this sense of his energies like riggs mouth yeah yeah from lethal I don't have that like a lot of that I think probably came like that that character probably came from like the dark inner workings of Mel Gibson's mind you got it really is you would like you like that to the right I don't have that energy but Trump kept calling Jeb Bush low energy yeah I was laying on the couch bone that's fucking me he's talking about I'm laying on the couch and I hear about somebody dying in an avalanche you know I watch it on T and I laugh because I would never fucking be dropped off in a helicopter at the top of a mountain to go snowboarder yeah and then they die I'm laughing my balls off I'm eating a bag of chips well the one person he's never called anybody anything is Nancy Pelosi and people like why hasn't he come up with a nickname for her yet yeah you know because you can't say content that's done the election that'll cost him in 2020 a joke about that he's like it's countdown until that sick ankle dogface that's what I call Hillary McCullar what what kind of a nickname if you were gonna help him like if he hired you like Nick hello see I need a solid Republican comic to help me with my one-liners what do you think well I call her on my show I heard of the the leathery nippled hmm two words I think she was pretty good luck to me trusting her day like a lion Ted okay yeah fucking naughty Nancy what did he call Hillary crooked Hillary crooked Hillary lyin Ted how about energy Jeb how about I yeast infection in heels how about lying liberal mmm fuck stick do you know that she's worth a hundred million dollars yes I do but she represents the little people job she represents the working class you know she has fucking walls around her mansion meanwhile people laying their own feces in San Francisco well that Laura Laura chick the chick that handcuffed herself to Twitter she hopped Nancy's fence and started setting up a like oh hi grant camp what was the result illegal she's doing something illegal she's trespassing I would say to Nancy I'll be outside how's it going this fence is immoral hmm right build that wall or don't I almost like at the wall still but when we have machine guns and tanks well Lane throws like I took them you don't have to kill I'm serious about this you're gonna laugh okay tonight because you don't have to but seriously I love how we rule out lethal force as far as protecting our board that's not even on the plate so I okay it's to medieval to pick somebody off as they're climbing the fence but okay use something less lethal a super soaker filled with cat piss a woman and her baby it's not fucking Maltese I'm one of your old males no leave the women and children whatever just push them on the wall would he do them send them back to where the fuck that came from you have no sympathy for those folks that are trying to come over here the ones that uh we're immigrant yeah children absolutely I mean when did your parents come over my grandpa grabs mine as well at the turn of the century like 1902 1903 yep fun they should have stayed in Italy you think people should have stayed in Poland the Irish should have stayed in Ireland should have no news Paolo it would be great does this experiment that's not working job he's gotta admit oh fuck is wrong with you watch these viral videos it's not oh you're joking around but it kinda seemed like she seemed a little bit more dour oh you know he's our previous conversations we've had I was faking each other I was faking it came along I can save it let's get this off my chest a light and cheeriness remember my bid I had a great bit about immigration how it was like having a big party but you had to contribute to the party remember the bitter that's one of my albums the Irish brought the booze the Italians brought the food oh okay now you know I do remember the remember yeah yeah and the Mexican said fucker will clean up after which you know yep people loved it and no I look I defend Latinos all the time on my show they like Italians were at the turn of the century yes hard-working and when you watch the news and you see a lot of people dying you know fighting for us a lot of Latino names in it so first I'm a big fan that's not the problem you know so but I don't think he should be labeled a bigot if you believe in you know securing the borders and it's not immoral how about all the heroin coming over is that a lie too I mean you know how they're finding that over there did you pay attention to the chapo trial they're bringing a little agro ships most of its coming over in cars is it yeah so Fitness Sopranos they said that eight out of ten cargo ships never get charged yes yes apparently that's true I was talking to a guy was a longshoreman about that he's like you don't know what the fuck's in those things I know and that creepy when I was gonna blow up that's the fucking shit don't give him any ideas these ideas they call me up and said that's not a bad idea how did she get punched who why did that lady punch you it was a 20 year old bipolar girl I was at levity live I did a show came offstage went into the green room for a few minutes and then came back out and I was standing to the left of the stage and I I don't always shake hands and do all that shit after the show I just don't feel it's in the job description sometimes I'll do it sometimes I want but some people started coming up to me and shaking hands and taking pictures and this guy approaches me so look like you a little bit stands to my right and he goes can I get a picture that goes sure I stand on my right I'm looking at him talking to him he's like yeah I enjoyed the show but my daughter wanted to punch you in the face he didn't even finish the word face and I get suckered from this I didn't even know she was in the fucking room all sudden BAM whoa and I mean BAM I mean fucking you know I was I don't feel if I get fucking suckered I could feel the eye closed and immediately you know and I looked right at him this is how good my instincts were even when I was in shock I go did you just fucking set me up no it's nothing like that man he didn't jump in and he didn't jump in and and go to his daughter what are you doing you know it was kinda like to this day believe it was complicit he was complicit in it but doing it what did she do she finally looked at her I go why why'd you fucking why'd you do that because you're mean she thought I was racist and sexist meanwhile there was a table of black people Dominika it was a very diverse crowd absolutely loved it coming to my defense after that happened nobody got offended even a friend that might have seen me a million times because you won't even be in that political that night that's she had Birkenstocks on and you know bipolar and and and I'm still pursuing it and the guy didn't apologize nothing he was he didn't apology I said you just fucking said no I didn't man and it's nothing like that you know I she said I shouldn't have brought here brought her here but you did you weaponized you bipolar daughter is what you did I believe they sat down at the table before they left the house he knows for what I did for comedy and he P he hated he didn't have the balls to do it himself you think yeah that's what I think look at you you would oh I'm gonna work for those kettlebells before I leave here and I'm gonna find this motherfucker get you on a bike and get you to burn off some energy Jesus across my business my rifle coffee I love dish veteran-owned coffee it's very potent I want to contribute veterans I got some bags for you I'll get you some it's great stuff but yeah so the fucking hike you had the funniest this is what's funny about it for years people tell me you know keep your temper in check at bah-bah-bah you know you'll fuck up the career you don't but I'm in here on that for years after this happened they're all gone why didn't you hit her back what are you high tech stood me like the next day or that and I can't remember and you said you go this made me laugh for five minutes you go Joe goes I thought Joe was gonna good thing you didn't hit her but Joe goes I would a fucking leg whipped her which made me laugh so hard because she's his frail thing and if you leg whip - you would've taken her legs Claire off like a helicopter blade I was belly laughing for five you a leg whip and this leg kicker yeah well I don't think it was a okay excuse me well you got a can't let someone punch you the real problem is like someone even a yeah I saw you in the party hurt your that clip you in the pot well I have a permanent dent in my face yeah you can say it I have a permanent dent I don't she had a ring up really there's a little dent there yeah she probably had a ring on yeah someone can hate you in that no good for you that would have been embarrassing you you could lose your vision I mean that's 100% possible happens be bald I had a slight concussion she really fucking caught me flush I'm not shocked especially if you didn't know what would you have done I don't know I hope I wouldn't have done what I think I would I know cuz you could lose a lot I know you get insurance for that that my real problem is when you're not thinking when you get hit and then you immediately respond that's a real problem cuz look you've seen that video that giant six foot five guy who punched that 11 year old girl in the face yes she had a compass she well she definitely shouldn't walk tup to when it was whether it was and she definitely shouldn't have pushed him first but he definitely shouldn't have punched her in the face his big giant fucking guy I know yeah with a nice shot you don't want you don't want to punch a girl you don't want to hit her and I didn't don't you don't want to go into that reptilian part of your brain either that just responds to being assaulted no that was killed that's very dangerous I saw you that remember that clip years ago you in the parking lot that the comedy still arguing some broad follow that feminist lady I just mean I thought you were gonna fall they're all I was trying to be nice to the meanest people on the air I was nice to that lady for a long time until she's coming to town when she's gonna she's gonna hit me with her cigarette and like listen you're not doing anything no I always watched it go what's gonna happen next it's just so stupid that people think they can get away with things like that well my hand won't lay if you were in alone in a parking lot with that girl and she punched you in the face like that what if I even fucking cracked her there I said this and I've been making this point you want true gender equality yeah if we had it I could have fucking knocked her the fuck No and everybody wouldn't you know what she had it coming yeah we all went home well that's not the world what you showed amazing restraint and not hitting her back because I wasn't drinking and what no what if you were trying yeah yeah I would have probably wrestled her at least cuffed her yeah fair slap yeah yeah I would have gave her from behind though and dirty one oh yeah I would it came from here yeah but see that every that video there's a there's a kid a black kid walking down the street and some black neighbor and he's rapping a some shit and this black kid walks up behind like in a wife-beater and winds up from his asshole with an open hand it would blow your eyes out if you had the headphones yeah but I I was proud of myself and that's why I was laughing after the incident of people I know who been telling me you know you know cool little webber you should keep you they were all like yeah shut up fucking body's like my aunt's like I was so proud of myself for once that I was you know I was the adult in the room and I you know I know and the times were limiting and it wouldn't matter the circumstance if the toxic masculinity if if I croaked her well I don't know man if somebody punches you and you punch him back I don't know what the fucking rules are oh I do I mean she's obviously very small a little bit of real problem because she's small but you shouldn't be fucking hitting people now what you said you were working on it like me you're still in the middle of it like what's going on with it yes I I'm pursuing it and they it's just so you can tell they don't give a fuck the the DA was a woman in that County and now she's off the case for some reason they shuffled uh but they went they you know it should be assault aggravated assault but of course you can't go because if you don't get I can't sue her civilly if I lost that it would hurt my case so at least that's the logic they were telling me so they're trying to get her with like second-degree harassment and now they're there's a new woman on the case and she said they they're making her go to you know anger management and because she has mental issues and I'm not looking for money I just want to make an example of her so but why why not pursue it as a salt it's clearly a salt I know well you tell me so is your lawyer's decision to not pursue it it's not know nobody who first of all nobody wanted to take the case because I'm fine really yeah they're like you sites not fucked up you're not in a wheelchair you know but yeah did I give the lawyer's credit for that much they're honest it's all about the money but that's crazy but I found the guy this guy Andrew funk was a lawyer who was a Marine and I said he contacted me and he put me in touch first with a Russian woman who took about three of my calls and she got tired because there was no money involved and they hooked me up with another guy another lawyer who right now I'm dealing with but yeah they were all right up front that the the if there's no money involved and you know permanently you're not gonna you know but I just well I don't want money and this guy sort of agreement it's Andrew font guy is a Marine he just wants to make an example she said I was racist and sexist you know so I just want to make an exam not looking for money but her it's her father that really pisses me off she's nuts how old is broads nuts like 20 21 goes to a school in upstate New York so she's not that not she lives on her own but it's the fucking old man that was complicit in it I think he actually used her as like a weapon that night it seems like it would be way harder to prove yes she was that he was complicit yeah and it would be too I agree that she punched you no I agree did she apologize ever never she she she ran up into the lobby which is way normally where you take pictures with fans and she put her head on the table I was crying after she realized what she'd done or whatever you know they took her like a psychiatric hospital so they're saying well you know you know so I just want to make an example of her that's all I I don't I'm not looking for but but you know that's ridiculous and the next time I will hit back you think yeah don't don't no wait a minute you mean oh it's too little well give me a kick that would just like hurt our ovaries what three oh go for me pussy I just would say don't either but even in the future if somebody does know I'm not I would I would never well you've been proved a being or guy who proved it cuz you haven't done it you didn't do it you had the ultimate opportunity somebody actually hit you you didn't hit him it's one of my proudest moments yeah you should should be proud of that I didn't ever get into it with a fan I was somebody in the audience no I've been in twice one time the comedy store got threw a drink at me holy shit yeah and how did you restrain yourself um remember I essentially invited him to get killed come on up here come on up here I'll show you what's up and drink you from with drinking some asshole there's him and his dad they were heckling everybody before the show before I got on stage rather through heckling everybody is a long time ago it's probably 2003 2004 and he knows who you are and he's you're just a pussy you just just threw it my way you know who wanted to get famous well he didn't even want to get famous there was no social media back then not because people weren't getting famous and things like that put in the paper he's just a drunk asshole who's interrupting comedy and the Comedy Store back then had zero protection nobody please in the cloud crowd room right no no crowd crowd control at all but yeah it's fucking it's an issue with people they're drinking right and especially if you get crazy people that are drinking no weird stuff can happen it's unfortunate yeah it's just you know people that don't have respect for performers - they don't have respect for what you're doing that it's difficult and if they disagree with you they think they're disagreeing even if it's just a joke you didn't even know where the joke is going they'll interrupt and they'll yell stuff out and they've just know no regard for the warm that you're in the fact there's hundreds of other people that are there to see you it's about their mind and their selfish notion that they want to get out right away they and they have no idea how little it takes to throw off the balance of the room oh yeah just a slight confrontation just see just telling somebody to shut up and all sudden like you're the bad guy and a lot of times it's somebody right up front so they can't hear ya you know and then it looks like you're just scolding somebody for no reason yeah I've had that though and I'm super sensitive somebody farts in the 52nd row I can hear it or whatever I am I just have that you know yeah well you know I've learned I've faked no exactly yeah exactly I mean because you do you study what's going on you read their faces and whatnot and I'm really good at it and fuck and if I see one person laughing out of 600 or not last yeah you've always been like no but I fixed it I fixed it years ago well after about 12 club said listen you gotta stop doing that I did but you know what I am so much better and not hitting her approved it alright now I I I had a bra breakup that had nothing to do with me it got them a couple years ago what was it about two tables were fightin amongst each other oh I heard about it was hilarious talk about hitting a girl I just stood on the stage I loved it I felt like Lenny Bruce oh you get comics have a lot of punk in us you know I did but I didn't start this fucking brawl breaks out I'm watching it two tables girls and guys Impa there's a girl in the middle with her fists up like she took three fucking taibo class all classes she's and she takes a swing and hits one of the bounces i watch this other bout to come across the room and drop her like a fucking use rubber I mean hit her like I got she was a guy really oh my god I don't know how this guy you didn't do jail but these broads this is what this feminist movement is taken I'm now they jump in every time you see a fight at a football game the stands is women involvement yet they really fucking think I'm sorry but legislation you can't fucking legislate the the DNA out of us and they were always in the middle of it you notice that a lot of fuckin broads think they can do get out our bunch right have a dilemma but yeah yeah they seem too many Wonder Woman movies well exactly they've been brainwashed well there's a lot of people in general that think they could go around punching people like how about did all these auntie fat dorks that are yeah make sure you face well then not only that they're starting fights with people and they have zero idea how to fight Hey they're swinging at people did you see the one guy a guy swings at this guy with a bat yeah or with a baton the guy catches the baton he touches him in the face and chaos him and his head snaps back and his head bounces off the concrete when he falls down it's awful to watch like what the fuck made you think you could just hit a man with a stick because you guys disagree with each other yeah and and you're right when they interview them after a lot of times they not even after a fight but they need to be somebody's in TV they sound like almost swishy yeah some of them swishy look homosexual sort of saying weak effeminate well they're they want to become a look look the antifa is just like any other group of people they give you a community whether it's a gang or whether it's what a criminal organization or what you know what whatever it is people fall in line with the sensibilities of that organization and then you do what you can to support that organization to show that you're a valued member and then you know you start wearing their fucking ski masks and hitting people with sticks and everybody's practicing karate in the park because you think they're gonna be able to defend themselves the whole thing is ridiculous but because their life has no value outside of them well isn't it weird I know that look my parents were hippies and when I grew up I always thought that people on the Left were peace-loving though that was what the the the the knock was they were peace-loving well-educated but you're seeing now people on the left like these certain factions of them not all of them but are people that are calling for violence they have violent pacifists ironically yes well they don't want to do it themselves but they're calling for other people to do right Yeah right they're calling for people Unicom words like that kid with the manga hat like Raisa Aslan Barone have you ever seen a more punchable face yeah what a fuck are you saying yeah you know it's like this extreme lack of empathy for young people to like young people that that don't fall in line with their ideas they don't give a fuck there fuck that kid punch him throw him in jail lock him up it's just like it's there's a lack of empathy and a lack of thought behind it it's it's very unsocial media has only thrown gas on that yes and then you got these Russian accounts that are firing this up on both sides that are attacking from the left and the right I think that's a way bigger issue than people think I think these these troll farms and these people that are setting up these fake accounts and just getting people riled up I think there's a lot of fucking lemmings out there and a lot of colleges right yeah they fall into these arguments like how many people do you know that getting involved in Twitter arguments and then they they stew with those arguments all day they keep checking their mentions to get it oh yeah heavily involved that if someone can get you involved in that like if the Russians can get a group of dummies involved in that kind of dispute they could literally change the way people are interacting with you with each other they're making the interactions more aggressive more violent so you think it's the Russian I think it has something to do with it I think there's a polarization between the left and the right period but I think they are definitely Ehsan yeah this this thing that I was reading or that listening to rather this Sam Harris podcast very fucking interesting because they're talking about the what we actually know about the data and where it's coming from and how these people are doing this and how they're setting these things up yeah that guy the comic that you and I talked about again that clip of this Russian who is a former KGB guy who defected to this country explaining how it works looking back at the eggs yeah explaining exactly how it works and what he was saying this is 30 something years ago 35 Jesus is going down exactly the exact and Putin is a king you know oh god oh Christ yeah yeah I mean that's this idea that Trump's working with him is fucking silly well I don't know about that I don't think he's working with him to undermine democracy but I definitely think they've got some business dealings I mean they were offering Trump that's not illegal the penthouse and Trump that's a little legal none of that is illegal don't take that from me take that from Alan Dershowitz don't smarter than both of us I'm not saying it's illegal but I don't think that he was honest about that he said I don't do any dealings with Russia I don't have any business with Russia and he definitely did does not true won't we'll see well say that's what the targeting they're not gonna get him for anything you know things I know you think he's gonna just well maybe impeachment but I'd even on what K I don't even know what they get him high crimes and misdemeanors I don't I don't know what what he's done to talk about building a tower in Moscow is not illegal what to have business and what do you what did he lie about specifically well there's a lot like what we could pull it up let's let's find out all the things salon.com or you can go to a million different websites well I know we just establish that the the fucking social media tilt slap so yes social media does we're not talking about pulling up social media page what are you pulling up I don't know why should you know I'm like I'm not a trump scholar I haven't have at my disposal all the different times that he lied but it's a lot so what do you thinks gonna happen to him you think they'll impeach him II mean no or we go resign or what I don't know look I'm not I'm not claiming to be any sort of an expert in legal proceedings I have no idea either that's why I quoted Dershowitz yeah I think Durst was working with Trump no Giuliani is oh that's right Darren I always go to Darsh woods because he's drunk and lip Trump averaged 15 and a half so he's on his truce a day in 2018 almost triple the rate from a year of hell okay but hold on a second what's the indoor season myths truths it's a European paper yeah but isn't that a little odd 15 a day no because I don't know is making that claim I don't know the exact 15 inaccuracies you doubt that it's true you think that's all a lie that is made up the fact that he lies a lot lies about what first of all it's a definition of a lie all right let's see it says Washington Post who they hate those yeah the president made one point 99 such claims in 2018 by the last day of mm yeah you don't know the watching good dog okay point but what but let's see what it says I mean they can't lie the total figure is into 7600 so you think they just made up all these lives not all of them I'm sure but you could you could go back with Hillary in fucking town you could go to go to Fox knows and then put out what pull up an article how many times Hillary was in you're right do you know what a what about ism is a what about is yeah when someone talks about something and instead of refuting it with facts they go yeah well what about Hillary what about Bill bill did it - what about this what about you gotta tell what about ISM and that's what I just committed it was because you were saying a Hillary lied but you don't agree but you're making my point you go ahead Washington Post okay well that's just Jamie pulled up the in the pen no we could go anywhere but hold on a second yeah look I'm with you I think Hillary's a liar I think she deleted 30,000 emails all right it's criminal I think they're right the Clinton Foundation's a fucking fully illegal organization I think they rigged the DNC I think they they rigged the primaries against right I'm with you I'm not a supporter no I'm not saying you have but when's the last time somebody made a statement like that and and said this many inaccuracies when Bill Clinton was in office well I don't think he lies or or Hillary I'm sure ever I'm sure there was some inaccuracies but first of all when Bill Clinton was in office they weren't they count Obama's I don't know but that's what what about ISM yeah I'm saying we're just talking about Trump you were saying that Trump doesn't lie and they're saying these lies I thought she doesn't know first of all you said what does he live know first of all you know I like to know the definition of a lie if he misstates something do you think he doesn't write only I'm sure sometimes when you're talking them okay so if he lies 1,000 yeah that's Washington Post it's horseshit I don't know I do know he's a bullshitter for sure yes Joe would you argue that they haven't been trying to take him down since he came down that fucking escalator how about the deep state how about the how about the fucking dossier what why is it always I mean the dossier what dossier the fake thoughts yet Christopher Steele that they used to get the the Flies explain what the what you're talking about I just did they know what I'm talking about no no don't they don't cuz I don't know what do you mean the dossier the fake das remember they said they know what he's talking about they had yes they had you have all this so you're being willfully ignorant no I don't know the Nick I don't know hey I'm explaining hold on a second would you you know I've heard these are terms I've heard yes and stuff but you don't know the full extent yeah well this is what I'm talking about this is as big a story as anything Trump has done what is the story distilled dossier that Hillary used they went to you had to get a appliqué from the FISA courts and they went they used DNC opposition Christopher Steele who's a British guy had connections in Russia remember when they said Trump was at a hotel and watching girls peeing on each other yes that was all in the steel dossier Christmas Steel isn't it they use that in their application to get a FISA warrant to spy on Trump during his campaign that's fact that's not me being a right winger that is fact okay so but the fact that that like that you don't know that no I remember that now oh that's what I'm talking about you met the story as Trump you know lying about the number paper does inauguration I want to know the I want to know alive from Trump that's equal equal in power as like when Obama said you know lied about health care that you could keep your health care and all that give me an example of Trump with that big of a lie well listen I told you that's lie I'm not president slide all politicians lie I'm just saying they start to count it when Trump took over they started keeping you know because it exists like what give me an example look look we just showed you all the numbers of the Washington Post so if I give you another example you're gonna say oh if you go to Solano salon carré all right well go to I don't know what you've gotten more done than any other administration okay this is a lie so true blah blah blah see now so let's see what it's that Jamie go back to it what are you doing but who's saying that's a lie let's see let's see okay see what it is Jesus Christ you're so defensive it's like do you work for the organization no I don't but you're putting I'm saying you know this isn't the Washington what is it and since and it oh the NBC okay NBC okay so where is that look man I'm just reading what it's in front of me I know and I'm just you're so emotional about what cups of coffee Emmys you had to huh please know I'm right I don't know you're talking to me you don't know that the mainstream media hates Trump are you gonna I do why would you put your fucking because I want to know you whether or not they are saying what what is stop stop doing that Jaime go back to what it was you can't cause his Trump later said that he intended the UN moment to garner a laugh that is repeated this claim seriously since okay so he says the administration has accomplished more than almost any Administration in the history of the country so this is just that's an exaggeration hyperbole right and people were laughing when he said that and so he was saying that he meant to say it as a laugh okay there are hiring measures of success but it's not true that his administration has been more successful than any other administration in history when it comes to legislation Trump aside plenty of bills since first two uses President Barack Obama in his first two years has significantly more signed significantly more okay this is just one thing I mean I'm sure there's many many other things absolutely going over and over then I'm with you I'm not a bullshitter but I'm just saying all of a sudden they keep score when it when try to keep score because he lies so much well who is keeping score and fucking Hillary with Secretary of State well it's a Senator in Washington Secretary of State and I don't know how much she lied as opposed to how much he lies are a lot bigger there's a butter fucking server and about the steel dossier that that is huge that is getting under covered like nobody's been that that Dwarfs Watergate when they unmask general Flynn that that Dwarfs Watergate mmm that's an interesting conversation I don't know if that's the truth I don't know enough about Watergate alright but you know about that either okay is it the coffee going on here well yeah this is drawing on crime it's just I'm just your act as if I'm against you I'm not against me even if you were that will be fine but yet I'm not you're not against me but I'm just saying to call Trump a big ally than the fucking every other politician is an exaggeration I don't know why the mainstream media who hates his guts I think most politicians are liars I think that is a lowly to doing that but I think the way he lies is unusual I think it's the nerd than usual it's just an unusual you don't think so he he exaggerates like statements like that is an exaggeration although he did do a lot in his first couple years would never get credit for it you know unless you watch Fox knows you're not gonna but would you would you agree that as you get older you become more like more conservative no I was always a bit of a dick I got a tattoo of Nixon on my ass I thought it was yes no I would say that was that's a what do they say about if you young you know you're young and conservative you have no soul no heart no old and liberal brilliant mind yeah I don't like that yeah I would say yeah that's true but I could always detect the bullshit you know i mean i mean i remember watching CNN in an airport when I first started comedy that's like 1988 night you know and getting excited at some of the shit well it's interesting because I don't disagree with you on everything and I love you as a person you're a great guy I like you a lot always happy to see you but yet you and I here get a little heated talking about this stuff but this is politics this is how divisive politics are if even a person like but I would never I would never fucking I would never leave here going I don't do that show again right we've known each other for 30 years yeah you know it's not that's not the problem what I'm saying is I'm just using this example of how divisive politics so lonely when people talking about afraid of it no you know I mean a lot of people aren't right yes yeah I'm not afraid of it a lot of people are afraid of bad vibes and bad feelings then this is one things but this is one of the things that makes people toe the line is the fear of this kind of altercation the fear of this kind of like you don't want that from inside your party so you right you start using they in them you start thinking that everyone should be able to use any bathroom that they feel like they identify with you start but you start going along the line it's one of the more interesting things about politics is that if you tell me that you are Republican I can kind of guess your stance on God I can kind of guess your stance on being pro-life or pro-choice Second Amendment rights it's like all those things sort of fall in line and it's very interesting it's very interesting how you you sort of adopt not you but people sort of adopt a whole group of things when you decide you're a Republican you decide you're a Democrat right I don't but yeah I don't think I fall into that how do you feel about guns John iam well got any guns yeah how many got one just one yeah I I'm not a big gun guy as far as abortion that I want mom I don't want to say pro-choice but I'm not I'm not pro-life one of the big reasons is if you like I got a dad who's dying of Alzheimer's watching them it's the saddest thing if I could kill him tomorrow put him out of his misery I would I think he could take him to Oregon the states that allow that there states that allow people to I think I go over state lines that like for all of us Dale know there was a girl who's dying of cancer who went to Oregon for that very reason yeah there Oregon is one of those I want to I might be saying it wrong but I think the idea is a right to a dignified death no you're right just read about yeah look man the idea that you're supposed to just keep staying alive until your fucking heart stops beating silly horrible pain Billy it's it's it's evil you don't do it - I had to put my dog down okay I love this dog I've had him for 13 years now had to put him down because good and walking him would you chuck him up I brought him to a place you know he actually came to my house Ashley and they they put him down sad shit but but you can't do that for a 98 year old man and I was falling apart you have to let him eventually stop breathing right you know it's what you said all the right should go out the window that should be you first right it's your goddamn life yeah that's why I couldn't be like pro-choice a pro you know pro-life or whatever and that and I got girls pregnant when I was younger and I was glad there was a Planned Parenthood whatever it was yeah the guy in the alley with a stick because name was Dave so I don't but in showbiz Joe Mannino it is in showbiz because this is a pretty liberal business if you're like if you're right on two of ten issues like you're like a fucking Nazi right you know I mean I just called all right adjacent it's my favorite oh my god they keep coming up with that well you can't call me all right because I'm pretty left-wing I'm most yeah yeah they call so they call me all right a Jason probably cuz I have people like you want now I'm gonna be more alt right adjacent because you cuz you in that silly you have me on too you know your listeners probably you know like you like listen to this guy I don't agree with anything that should be a feather in your cap and they're gonna hold that against you yeah silly well you know it's not rational but again it's people trying to have an effect on you they're trying to have an effect they're trying to make some ways try and do something the writing blogs or creating videos what they're doing it to try to put pressure on you it's interesting though it's we it's weird from a psychological perspective you're looking at it from the outside you know it's it's just it's disconcerting when it's happening to you but when you you can step back and look at it like it's interesting it's like these systems are opposing each other and they're they're trying to figure out or where the weaknesses are and how to how to push to affect the other side yeah and it's not and it's not just left right you know it's bigger than that inside you know what was the book I read what's the place where they go to meet every year Bohemian Grove burger Bilderberg Group that was one of my favorite books the truth about the Bilderberg Group and what goes on there and the powerful people that meet and people always saying there's probably ten guys in a room that friend the whole fucking well okay but you show me them until then I'll stay on the left-right fighting have fun right the idea is if there's ten guys that control everything and they don't give a fuck of its left or right they're just about money it's yeah fellows were involved and and they but it's weird that was really creepy they planned shit out decades ahead there they planned out of education yeah decades ahead though and and it comes true like they write a sitcom script that lasts for 15 years with plot points it was that book was incredible I camera up the author's name but yeah but I don't I don't mind I used to sit at that table at the Comedy Cellar that's how tough crowd came about I mean Patrice yelling at each other about Rachel's yeah tough crowd was a great fucking show but I really am worried that you couldn't have a show like that I know you should be no no I'm let me ask you and I'm not taking left right but who would be to blame for that that that's why I lean right and I think and you do in some areas you're in a I mean you're an artist you're stand-up I cannot be I cannot vote with a party that is for census shit right and and for groupthink did we ever find out what's going on with Dennis Prager did we get a line on that does that still bother me no no I just um it does bother me because I like the guy he's great he's I don't agree with him on a lot of things yeah seems like a very nice guy and I like Adam I do toe both those guys it there's a lawsuit he's bringing a lawsuit that they think it's gonna go a long way there's because they were labeling his show as hate speech maybe it's backup or whatever but I know that story you can find that anywhere there's a real concern that the ideologies behind these tech companies all go in one direction and they have the overwhelming control of the narrative because of the fact yes they're all what we're we're getting all of our information most people are getting it on their phones most people are getting a lot of their media on their phones so the Netflix said something like 50 percent of the people that watch my special watch it on a phone that's amazing I mean that's crazy that people are so that all this stuff is coming from these tech companies doesn't have then that kind of bother you that it's the phone because when I hear that not that matters with my specials but when I picture somebody watching sampling I found you don't have the full attention they're doing other things mmm-hmm yummy as opposed to sitting in front of their computer really TV yeah the kind of bug yeah you put all that work into it and they're on the subway watching it and I I don't pay attention to when I can't control I don't let to make me nut yeah get over there that's what the moms like I'm in I love it I'm gonna have to try the little one I'll give you a little one just so once not today I got a drive to San Diego I was perfect me and trav yeah well you know the time is your show I know I'm fuckin gonna be

probably Texas really yeah somewhere my brother lived outside of Dallas and he loved it that's great i'ma fight you all money you could have seven castles oh seven I don't want seven too many to look after folks you should see the place for a needling Josh oh yeah yeah the gym outsides nice Jim I like Texas I'm a big fan of Texas I'd live in Texas I think I'd live in Colorado first oh yeah yeah we'd not just weed mountains you like them huh I love the way what it does for you there's something about being around mountains that uh that it I was actually reading something about this that there's a an actual thing that happens to people when you're faced with immense natural beauty that it diminishes your ego and yourself and it puts people in you know put you in an angle and then you set an aerial perspective be being around mountains it's humbling sure you around them it's beautiful it's like the best looking art you could ever see is like a gorgeous mountain with some green hills and the Sun coming out of the clouds like it's well that's good good to look at is anything that's ever existed like I'm I'm not very religious I don't know I haven't made up my mind but when I see stuff like that is when I get kind of you want to make up your mind I got something right here for you what is that mushrooms I know that's exactly what they're for how about Joe if I come and if I tuck these in did you show before just take a little do not fuck that nobody's got to get hurt just a little watch a mere do you do that I don't know I don't to be giggling in the car on the way they'll be throwing up by myself you'll be fine what's it do what's gonna happen well I want to get out of here before it takes effect it's gonna get me in a fucking some type of scissors law it should be legal it would make people mellow the fuck out would open that third eye man he would do something really good for people the problem is you forget you take it sometimes you know like an hour and a half later like why am I so weak oh okay yeah I don't want to be that far on my own head mmm that's scary have you ever done the float tank no you wanna do that why can't you think can't I could have float the fuck in San Diego I should go down there on the raft like everybody else does last time I ran into you I am so nervous that you get nervous about me making my show Candice yeah I think we're gonna get you out of here in about 15 minutes that's what I think all right moves that all right yeah I think that's the right move maybe 10 you guys got me really fucking nervous now III wish I was but at least you have ways ways we'll put you on some weird fucking funky backcountry routes that'll cut 20 minutes out of it only end up in Mexico you'll be fine very close to Mexico but super conservative that's what's interesting about San Diego I used to dye my first album it--the in La Jolla military yes it's all minutes right on there yeah safest fuck yeah see maybe I'll have one of those guys at my show tonight the people have said to be like where where would you would you live in a military town like he asks that's nice to live you gotta have gyms for sure you definitely have gun ranges when you say that is that when they throw you into the alright adjacent category yeah I mean that the American flag behind me probably contributes that oh my god how horrible I know you're fuckin extremist young ones the Constitution decolonizing that's one of my favorite things decolonizing you've been paying attention to that expression people want to decolonize their certain things like what Olek hairstyles and shit decolonize yeah yeah you're not yeah there was a guy who got kicked off of a show he's talking I ran out no there's a guy who got kicked off of a show he was he was on a show I think was in Montreal and he had he had dreadlocks on and it was this he's apparently gender-fluid which I guess my tabal done that yeah you can go back and forth between being a man and a woman but he does have dreadlocks and they kicked him off the show because he's a white guy with dreadlocks and he defended their position and one of the phrases they used was about decolonizing specific hairstyles and taking them away from white people and giving them back to the people oh that's sort of appropriation is what their acute appropriation yeah hairstyles I'd like to go with dreads has a 57 year old hunt Angus you'd be weird you'd be wear with dreads I get famous just from that there that no white goatee colic Quinn says I should wear a black he says I'm gonna turtle angry Steve Jobs a black turtleneck with yellow lightning bolts and call myself Don Corrado does he's just bein funny I heard he has an amazing new show that guy watch him work it out man it's it's all about politics it's about what we're talking about red versus blood so timely and shit and you know he's a he's a craftsman I watch him at a fat black pussycat I'd go on sometimes I have a show up to his what is the fat black pussy gets you'd fucking love it just right around the corner from the Comedy Cellar he's got a real bohemian feel to it people sitting in couches there's lamps it holds about 75 people Carla was of course quick enough and smart enough to say I'm using us every night to work shit out and people know you can say like I'm only charging you five dollars because I'm gonna be working new stuff out but you would love it Keeney and feel to it and it's and they give you the door not that that effect has anything to do with you but but it's great it's it's you know you do an hour have you I smoke Wow time it's so fun it's so again it's like 75 seats a little happy power it's very attractive so New York has some weird little clubs man it's really interesting how New York has it because the guys are just hopping around like that I never when I lived in New York I could never afford to live in the city so I lived in New Rochelle and when I did gigs I was like well I could work in town and do ten minutes of 15 minutes or I could just go on the road and do a gig in Connecticut or do a gig in Jersey and make actual money and so I always did that so when I lived in New York I hardly ever worked in New York yeah I don't as much anymore I used to you know I used to go to the comedy cell every night but Louis made that place world famous yeah and it's not it used to be a room where you could work shit out and take your time but now it's you know it's a fucking tourist it's packed it's still a great club and I yeah but I feel like y'all grow that I don't want to do I don't want to go on stage unless I'm doing at least 40 minutes right right you know I mean I gotta get something done yeah 15 minutes sets don't that's why I still do the fat black pussycat which is such a great thing so look at that nice yeah that's it and it's that looks big you know it always looks bigger hunt from a picture it's tiny that's it like from a bet that's from the balcony up there so this is like the the belly room at the store it's small smaller than that really oh yeah waste water that way some ways smaller than that the stores 70 people upstairs so it's basically the same although one way a belly yeah not the original room I was like the original about yeah yeah I would say like that yeah yeah it's you'd fucking love it and people sitting in couches and shit Wow it's it's really cool and and Gnome who runs that he couldn't be nicer you know and that's the only one I really do in the sea really yeah I'm like you I'd rather go to governor's or somewhere else and do some real time governor has a great club yeah the other thing about doing like clubs are there's a lot of people on where you only do in 15 minutes the good thing about it is that it's not your crowd so you have to make people laugh they're there just to see comedy they're not gonna see Nick DiPaolo right like if you go to you know that happens to some guys they developed their crowd and then they kind of lose their edge yes fucking it's scary right yes yes last time I saw you on stage I walked into Caroline's I was just I was just in town for something and you were on stage it was a Late Show and you were doing some fucking show about Katrina a joke about Katrina that they spelled help wrong on the roof yeah how many people died because they couldn't spell help looking down from a helicopter it says app yeah I said if you want help just step in that water you're standing no I was fucking crying laughs and I'm like Nick is just still swinging from the hip yes anyway that's my favorite joke that that stage is still one of my favorites in the country I don't do Caroline's kind of the problem with Caroline's those when they reduce the stage down to the size of a fucking shoebox yes but but on you're absolutely just a ball yeah but I don't like on a Tuesday Wednesday night with like 60 70 people and yeah it's amazing it is my fav I was so comfortable because I played it so much when I first moved to New York I could stay up there for three hours I got so much done I wrote half specials on that stage by doing like Tuesday nights for a year oh yeah yeah yeah yeah but you get it son yeah right yeah you're right I like 60 60 people in the crowd fucking around isn't that not fucking but I did something to place up in Canada Niagara Falls the corner comedy club I'm in a real hole in the wall shitty tables and Chino fucking on just cheesy had the best time in my life well when a place is big then it becomes a show and you have to do your ads huh yeah yeah you have to work tight yeah yeah which stifles creativity yeah that's what one of the one of the reasons why Ari when he does the store he'll sign up for like late night and he'll get on like a 12:45 or some shit like that when there's 20 people there and I always say that that's like truth serum because if you do your act in front of 20 people you know what sucks like there's no no confusing what sucks it's right in front that's right that's right you feel the terribleness of the material you don't need 250 people tell you suck it takes four couples yeah hanging attention and you just but you feel it like you can kind of song and dance your way through a couple of hundred P but right see but yeah you're exactly right yeah a barometer always said that give me just double figures give me 15 to 20 yes that is enough right great to work out material of course great so is to cut out all the horseshit in your act you know yeah because if there's only 15 people in the room and some of them don't like the joke oh you feel it yeah the 15 cross arms staring you down like that's where the work gets done yeah yeah I hate I used to hate playing Caroline's and this is ironic but this is when I was you know had Comedy Central specials and I was kind of hot and I would sell out Caroline's I would hate it though like two shows on a Saturday night because it's packed and I know I have something called the asshole quotient for every 20 people in club this one asshole so if there was like 250 you know somebody do the math so you got more asshole yeah I always Road so you have to work fast and tight to keep their attention right as opposed to taking your time on a Tuesday night in front of 60 people and the real funny comes up yeah you say shit in between your proven bits yes is the gold Yeah right yeah it comes out of nowhere it's like it opens up when you and you put yourself in that frame of mind to when there's only 30 people and uh you know midnight or something like that you're putting yourself at a different frame like there's no pressure what kidnap let me ask you that that's a can you do that in front of a full room I can't put myself in that mentality it's hard because you has to work definitely I feel like I'm being a pussy and giving in but I know damn well if I work as slow as I do in front of 4050 people in front of 250 or 300 somebody's gonna get anxious in the are at least that's my like I that meant Alec you said when you show him in 50 people it's almost like fucking around in somebody's living room yeah yeah yeah and I want that failing in front of 300 people at 400 feet it's always different you know we were talking about that last night that like when you do a large theater it's so much different than doing a club even if you do a pack club of 500 people then you move to a place that it's got 5,000 people it's not a different feeling it's a totally different feeling you have to do the air quotes act you got to do your act you know yeah it gets weird large numbers are weird yeah timings different you have to you can't hammer the punch line so you kind of Club like in a club you go punch remember Gavin would have to punch a tag tag tag and those tags would just have everybody roll oh yeah well if he was doing ten thousand people that those tags would get drowned out in the last lot with all the people around you I tried tagging when I did like my first Tonight Show I tried tagging you know and like like you said got lost you don't tag like you're in a club you know yeah number learning that lesson TV yeah but you're absolutely right Gavin was rapid-fire and oh I'm ever watching him at Nick's I came in when I first started coming and I step in the door he's on stage and I'm like is he dying everybody all that everybody was doubled over in the audience I thought he was fucking done all sudden you know you couldn't hear any laughed at all so in a huge roar I mean because he would tag like I said good joke 11 times yeah and people are still dying from the lat they were literally bent over nothing was coming out of them Allah I mean he was shaking the radness breathe yeah I think we got a chance to see some guys that are probably some of the best comics of all time and people don't know you know I think between Sweeney and Gavin and Lenny and and those guys that we saw when they were in their prime and that Iran just yeah Kenny when we were coming up those guys were in their prime and when we were young we got a chance to see I think some of the greatest of all time out a bud but they got stuck well the guys at Knicks put them on a contract for a while Robert gave them good money and coke they were making I remember telling me they were making three grand a weekend and not having to leave your city yeah making road money and like you said a little some perks on the side free booze all that yeah but I'll live great what did they ever but day yeah and in the long run you know well in the long run it was a problem but we got to see some crazy fucking car I remember those some of those nights at Nick's comedy Saab when you watch those guys get I remember Sweeney killing so hard yeah almost wanted to quit comic I know there's no way I could do that well I had to follow the fucking guy Gavin wood in Boston back then if you know Don Gavin show he would be the host ceremony no Gavi the whole yeah start off the show yeah that's a different thing about Boston - right that's right like if you did the Nick DiPaolo show at Nick's comedy stuff you would usually heart off this right and and what was crazy it was great for young comic but I had to follow Kevin you on a tight 15 so it made me you know fucking me you had to be able to hold your own yeah and they talked 100 miles an hour plus they're coked up and they're really and they're really funny they're really funny and they got heavy Boston accents and they're big men they're like big imposing people oh yeah and they would destroy some guy who came in I remember guys something gold Ronnie gold from New York had just done his first Tonight Show and shit and he was coming to Nick's for the weekend and everybody was dropping in Gavin would do 10 chance Lang doing all this guitar and literally get like a standing ovation his Ronny goal five minutes into it cricket peak Ricky record creek bank real kids with a blonde eyebrows fucking suck yeah I remember that that was the tough room if you were having a bad set well they would do it to people on us they would do it to anybody from out of town that had a big attitude in a Hollywood resume they did it to Billy Crystal they let Billy Crystal up in that room well that I understand yeah well do what you do they did it to everybody though yes it was crazy to watch well yeah they're like these guys we're as funny as them we're gonna punish them and know what you know who they didn't do it to Dom era exactly da Marrero went up there like a fucking champ and just rode the wave yes you just kept that waves going funny yeah I went on comics come home a couple years ago no not the last of the one before that and Dom had to close the show and it was a murderer's row Bobby Kelly fucking me Billy bar taking the roof off the dump and I'm like Dom has to close this and I he's as funny as anybody but I'm just saying how's he gonna he goes up there and he did something self-deprecating it gets a nice life within a minute and a half he had them and there was no drop-off there was no drop-off in response I went home I didn't realize he was that fucking good oh he's still that good Dom our era has not lost a step brilliant I see you at the store all the time yeah quit drinking told me quit drinking for two months very before him you
