three two I gotta get a picture of that Matt Farah ladies and gentlemen Joe Rogan we're going live are we do the interior of your car it's fucking disgusting I can't believe you like it why would you do that one you can get any interior you could make it any color you decided to do what is it bus if city bus fabric city legitimately it's actual city bus fabric yeah if we got it from the city bus supply I think it's like puke resistant or something have its everything resistant UV dirts name yeah yeah yeah hi how does it feel good all right hi everybody hi I have an old 911 it's called the Safari build this guy named Lee Keane built it and I showed it to Joe I brought it here there it is these people on the video we're looking at the smoking tire on Instagram thank you and that's my everyday car in LA you drive that everywhere yeah it's got big fog lights and bash bars and it's got slick dog - right oh yeah yeah in traffic yeah but I don't I also have a little scooter so it's what I need to go fight traffic either yeah drive a scooter yeah well Yamaha 125 Oh bro you were a fanny pack I can ride a scooter I mean for your own health no it's the best bet I mean look riding motorcycles is dangerous we all know that but I think it's a calculated risk yeah you know and like the other day my wife and I left the house at the same time we live in Venice and she left in a car and I left on the scooter and like exactly like 40 minutes later she I got off the bike and texted her that I was at my destination in Koreatown and she was at her destination in Culver City so I was literally like double triple the distance that she had gone so but anyway the city bus fabric is amazing and I fully anticipated that 90 percent of the people would like it and ten percent of the people would find it deeply offensive I'm surprised that you fell into the offense disgusting it's cool man it's gross I mean yes it's not it's gross but it's funny that you not offended its it is fun yeah and I you know here in LA a car is kind of like you know your outfit a little bit you know okay yeah showing jazz a little bit and I like I like to if I'm gonna put a message out there of myself in a car right I don't want to be like some douchey shitbag in a Porsche like I want to be the guy who's in like a pink Porsche with big tires on it and it's gonna bus interior you know that's the reason it says a little more about me than it does about Porsche is a weird car right Ferraris 100% douchebag they take themselves very seriously really hard to not be a douchebag in the Ferrari well although I did see a really interesting one that this guy built in England where he took a dino oh yeah and he put a 400 plus horsepower and modern Ferrari engine in it and put like a clear glass over the engine bay and and everything you could take off and bring the car back to stock it was almost the sort of singer is a shunova Dino so the Dino is one of the prettiest Ferraris ever but if you've ever driven one they sound great but they're just slowest dogs yeah and there's the v6 is it's for the smallest engine Ferrari ever made what did you know the the website for the guy that did it or the YouTube channel I think the guy I think his name was David Lee and he built it and I think he claimed it was an f40 engine which I don't think was entirely accurate I think I think he exaggerated a little bit I think I think it's a it's an engine from like a 360 that has been modified in certain ways his authority has more than 400 horsepower well it also had turbos and it's not like you just wouldn't use an f40 engine for that it would just be it would be like using something that's very valuable and not really replaceable force for for purposes of modification doesn't make much sense when other options are available that could deliver you the same result like a 360 what did a 360 have when it came with the Modena like foreign horsepower yeah look around 480 knows gotta be like was other Tino was lighter pounds yeah maybe it may be very tiny they're tiny and they're made enough that I mean they're 2,500 maybe a good number yeah and if you I've heard that car that car lives here really yeah that car lives in Los Angeles the black it lives here I've seen more shows yeah that's got sounds the darker is mass it's weird because you actually have to yes it probably is a half a million dollars with very low estimate for 705 maybe a really good original Dino is there it is so it's actually that's not the car because the car is a hardtop or is it a target oh look how pretty is that off if that picture with the back end of it right there yeah yeah so what's so interesting about that it's actually hard to tell it apart from a regular Dino if you don't know what you're looking for the things to look for obviously that badge on the left that says like Evo something and then the clear engine cover with the big bubble in the middle of the of the engine bonnet is changed yeah by the way that badge can go fuck itself the badge doesn't need to be yeah the exhaust is a little bigger I like the exhaust I like the exact that's fine just add some grip to the tires those are some skinny ass bitch ass time well look how narrow I mean you know you're talking about a car that without widening the body there's only so much you can do I imagine a modern rubber compound what they did was they reproduced the Dinos I think they're Campagnolo wheels which were probably like 15s on the Dino and I think they're of 17s he's so pretty that you want to talk expense yeah David Lee the Monza 3.6 Evo Dino so three point six that's what tells me it's a mode 360 engine yeah it was if it was a f40 engine to be a 2.8 liter engine yeah with turbo with turbos yeah god that's a pretty car let me just by the way if it had an f40 engine it would be a fucking death trap you would sail that thing with 400 horsepower it's got to be crazy yeah but you know what it's it's gonna be linear right without the turbo spool yeah you know you have that natural build of power and you really kind of can just use less throttle it won't just jump out at you yeah but I mean you are a man of taste Joe that's awesome it's a beautiful ride look at that thing they're selling them yeah they're trying to build a run of them oh I think they're like a singer yeah yeah yeah but here's the problem with with with doing this with Ferraris though Ferrari people even if you did something to the level of singer Ferrari people aren't really like that Ferrari people are originality over everything that's so weird yeah I don't understand all like they don't like modifying the cars they don't like about car that's previously been modified it's all about that numbers-matching shit no it's not it's not for you no no it's not really for me either I love driving the Ferraris but like I don't align with like that the Ferrari fan really values so much but I'd like to own one soon I made an 80s one silly like a Testarossa driven testarossa's are fun yeah Dana White has a Testarossa completely redone he's like fuck you we put a new interior and a modern stereo everything it's probably nice they need a lot of maintenance though they have testarossa's have timing belts see timing belts are something that Italians we're doing for a long time and the people they should just never be done again sounds terrif they wear out and they need to be changed and in the case of the Testarossa you're talking about a giant flat 12 engine there in the front so they're up against the firewall behind the seats so you have to take off the whole back of the car take the whole engine out of the car to do these timing belt oh yeah starting with the modern stuff they use chains the 21st century and they don't have to fucking fuck with belts that he wants yes but even like Lamborghini at the time like I have a Countach which is the best car ever made and you don't have to do that bullshit cuz even Lamborghini use chains so you don't need to do the engine now why did ferrari go with belts I think they thought it was smoother for our Enzo Ferrari also had utter contempt for the people who bought his street cars and I wouldn't be surprised if he did it just so the dealers would make more money on the services even if he knew it was worse why did he have so much contempt for the people about his cars Enzo Ferrari just wanted to go racing all he he was an egomaniac and all he ever wanted to do was see his cars win races and he came to a point where he couldn't make money doing that and he had to sell street cars to customers but throughout his entire life he openly treated those people with disdain that's how you when that's the story of Lamborghini the story of Lamborghini is Ferruccio Lamborghini had a Ferrari it was not working for one reason other he went to Ferrari to complain about it Enzo basically told me to fuck himself and somebody said I'll build the better come and that's the story of Lamborghini and their what are they known by now is almost like an Audi Group yeah via V AG so they're more reliable now yes but so are Ferraris around 2010 yes when the the four or five eight came out Ferraris took a massive jump in reliability how they do that first off the big one is the dual clutch gearbox which you know stick shifts for one thing right and then these early single clutch paddle shift gearbox they'd fry clutches like crazy people didn't really know how to use them right and they dried the clutches out and they would just go through clutches like crazy the dual clutch cars have much more like failsafe type stuff built into them and they actually work properly Ferraris to have the gated shift the coolest things up Yankee clink it's the best sliding into gear yes there's nothing more rewarding than like banging a Ferrari off the reveler and they stop that people stops the problem with with Ferrari is that they're new you know with the problem all new exotic the first owners of exotic cars is they want that new technology that's that's from racing and also it's like it's improved the drivability you know if you want to buy a Ferrari or a Lamborghini and drive it around in the city and use it as a car you can buy a Ferrari right now and it could just be your car like that was there that wasn't a thing you could do really in the 70s or 80s or even 90s like you could literally use a modern exotic car be it Ferrari Lamborghini McLaren howdy all right whatever that could be your only car now and that the gearbox technology is a lot of what's made that possible and computer-controlled like engine management systems this is a little disappointing one thing I'm really happy the Porsche hasn't done that but they have with the gt3 RS a gt3 RS just this last year and now the new ones what do you mean all the automatic all automatically RS though the RS is in in Porsche speak is the fastest version of what they can build they have the GTV touring with a stick that's the one you want you want the touring because it's a fucking stick because the four liter engine with a stat 6-speed gearbox is the best engine transmission combination available in cars today period yeah but the wide-body GT TRS with the vented fenders and you can modify you can modify later you just complained about people who don't want to modify by modifying but all that extra effort why don't they just fucking sell to you with a stick shift I don't know bro talk to the Germans I can't fucking win there mate look they make a gt3 with a stick they maybe Cayman gt4 with a stick they make the Boxster Spyder with a stick you could buy a 911 any level of 911 with a stick you can buy the turbo not the turbo there are the only ones you can count on though it seems like it's all going to even Corvette the new quarter that's double clutch yeah they said the new gt500 they haven't ruled out the possibility yeah of having a stick shift but well so look with the gt500 they just announced this thing it's it's like 750 horsepower no I've driven a lot of really powerful manual transmission cars for me once the car goes over about five hundred I don't want to shift anymore really I don't when I'm driving it on like a racetrack as fast as it will go okay like when I went to test the the the Corvette zr1 the last front engine one when it went just completely fucking bananas right 750 horsepower I went to Road Atlanta to drive it and they had a manual and they had an automatic me to drive and I drove the manual and it was so fucking fast that I did not feel comfortable taking my hand off the wheel to do the shifts that make sense and and I was like at this level of performance I really need to have both my hands on the wheel and I'm a pretty decent driver I'm not like shit I'm not the best but I'm not shit right and then when I drove the automatic car I went okay I feel way more comfortable at this pace with my hands on the wheel right but this 8-speed automatic would they have is the biggest hunk of flamin shit ever put into a sports car and so with the c8 with the new one they got rid of the manual and decided to substantially improve the auto with a new dual clutch 8-speed which you know for you and for me is sad that there's no stick it's not kind to get it because it's just sort of what progress looks I get it if you're gonna take it to a race track yeah I do get it but how many people are taking their goddamn Corvette to race no it's not even really about that it's sadder it's sadder than that it's really about how do we get the 0 to 60 time under three seconds because when they had the zo6 which was 650 horsepower and then they had the zr1 which was 750 horsepower they couldn't get it to 60 any faster Detroit is still so suck in fucking zero to 60 that that that is important for some reason and adding a hundred horsepower didn't change the 0 to 60 because of the front-engine rear-drive your distraction limited at that point just burnouts yeah so by putting the engine in the back you change the weight distribution now you've got a dual clutch 8-speed instead of a manual 7-speed now you can get in that two-second range 260 which doesn't improve the experience but it doesn't prove the number on that magazine cover with in number but everybody know I mean how do you not know it's a it's a fucking fast car ya know it's fast the GT 500s a real bummer though because that's a such a muscle car you know it's a sex your muscle car it's a it's a it's a toot same version of the Tremec dual clutch from the corvette is it as in the Mustang yeah it has a different number of gears incidentally it has a set it's a 7-speed in the Mustang and an 8-speed in the Corvette but it's same family of brand-new Tremec dual clutch gearboxes what has a wider contact with the tires I don't know what the Mustangs got if I had to guess you see a narrower right if I had to guess the Mustang had water see eight Corvettes 305 rears that I yeah yeah it's not you know with a mid-engine car what is interesting about a mid-engine car as you find this a lot I bet if you went out and looked at a Ferrari like a four five eight or something you'd be shocked at how narrow the tires are really yeah when you do a mid-engine car you can give up a lot of that huge fat rear rubber because the weight distribution doesn't necessitate it wait.you a tire tire sizes are typically chosen by the weight distribution of the car so like your 911 euro air cooled car your old one right so you got fat rears and you've got relatively skinny fronts that's because that engine is over the rears so in a mid-engined like I just looked this up for an unrelated thing in the four five eight the front tires are only two 45s on that and the rear tires are 305 so where is a Corvette your front tires are like 275 the old Corvette front tires are 275 rears like a 335 that that difference in weight distribution is how big of a difference you need in tires really sense the that's you know have you driven the gt500 - no I didn't get to do it yet unfortunately it looks fun someone posted a video it ran a 10-6 quarter-mile out of the box it's crazy fuck it's a very very fast I cannot believe some of the cars that people can just buy well speaking of which that Porsche that you sent me the video yeah hi Ken it's tyke I gotta say I can't I can't I con yeah I'm gonna fuck that one up for years that thing looks preposterous okay look I know how preposterous my Tesla is I tell everybody when they say oh you know you have really fast cars might see that one right there yeah the one that looks like a dad yes that one blows all yeah and you can drive like a companion piece of shit cuz it's silent do it no one notices here so quiet you just pass people like you just whiz by them yeah nothing happened yeah a Tesla is the new BMW in terms of people who are driving like shit bags on the way to work because when it's silent people don't like call the cops or sneer you're just kind of gone dude I was at a red light with some kid in a model 3 and I was in my gt3 RS and he blew behind me Liuba I was even trying to race him cuz I know better ya have a Tesla but it was the humiliation factor he passed me and got in front of me and then got on the highway like yeah like it was nothing sure and he an Eevee a fast Eevee if you live in Los Angeles is the correct tool for for this job you know if you have a home or in your case fucking sick warehouse to keep it charged you know supercharger networks pretty good yeah but it's not I wouldn't say you can use it exclusively you need some some kind of home used to charge yeah or your office but um people in apartment complexes that have Tesla's I don't know how you do it yeah if you don't live in a building where you can get them to install one or you work in a building yeah something yeah you really Eevee's are amazing and they're super super fun and like I totally get why people like like I get your Evie evangelism transformation you haven't gone from the butt up at the top apartment that thought you know analog school of you know manual gearboxes and fucking loud to to experience that level of silent performance and you must have felt like you're in a fucking spaceship it's seen it still seems like a spaceship yeah drive that thing yeah quiet yeah it makes me feel good though well if you finally yeah you get a little more relaxed right yeah like it when I take it to the airport too because I put on auto and I get on the 405 and I just chill in traffic it's nice oh no it's nice it is I totally get it be careful with it oh I have my hand on the wheel no no it does be careful what's saying it drives itself it doesn't it doesn't drive it so does it do here the rabbit hole begins it has it has an advanced driver's aid system mmm okay so it has follow you know Falls the car in front of you and it has a pretty good lane keep assist right so now we go into the Joe Rogan rabbit hole of what does driving me so driving involves decision-making and driving involves a lot of mental processes that cars can't do and so that's when I when people talk about terms like self-driving cars or full self-driving or whatever they're not usually using those terms correctly so a bunch of cars not just Tesla right now although Tesla's system is very good have a very good lane keep assist in a very good radar cruise system and they have different methods of trying to ensure the drivers paying attention but I think the marketing is a little bit disingenuous and they really want people who don't know better to think and feel like this is a car that drops it's kind of putting it on beta it's all just beta and that's fucking dangerous bro I'm riding my scooter I know I just had a model three for a week like couple weeks ago and I liked it so much and I gave it back and I went God maybe I should lease one of these this is cool but the auto steering feature I use it for about 20 minutes and it scared the piss out of me twice man I've seen that company called axis that takes a Model S and they put a carbon body of wide body kit onto now that sounds like fun that's pretty dope the axis Model S P hundred and 100 D is they replace the entire body with carbon they take the hood they take the fenders off they put wide body fenders on they they do a bunch of different shit to it you know I don't think so I wouldn't I wouldn't fuck with that yeah they fuck with the suspension they tighten up the suspension they changed the wheels and they completely redo the interior they stripped the interior that's where I would start yeah custom interior put put in whatever you want need for the the you know Tesla's are there there's such cool cars and they're such you know there's such like you said serene you know what I mean and all not I don't want to give that credit exclusively to Tesla because other V's provide a similar experience to but the one place they're lacking for the amount of money they charge their interiors are a little poems ask me if I'm getting one of those trucks bro good luck ask me if I don't want the truck you get to touch that why you askin cause I'm getting on them trucks yeah look at that thing you don't like it no you don't like it no I don't I don't like it and I out dare you I'm not entirely sure it's it's real I mean I think I've seen I think my initial reaction to that was that's not a real thing me George Jetson and my second reaction is I'm pretty sure they couldn't build and sell that in America why that because I I just I just don't think that that will pass the test that it needs to pass and I and furthermore I kind of like crash test pedestrian safety stuff like that furthermore it's it's it's because how do I say this without it's really hard to talk about Tesla because their fans are fucking crazy they get really mad and they don't leave me alone in the beginning I thought that it's complete bullshit and fake and a fraud I've talked to sin a few people since in the design space who design cars professionally for living and I have been convinced that it could be possible to build and sell a shape a vehicle shaped sort of like that although not exactly like that okay having said that I think that the way that it has been marketed is not entirely honest also people company show concept cars all the time right there's nothing wrong with showing a concept car there's nothing wrong with going here's a here's a prototype we built and this is going to show the direction of our industry right and if you build electric cars as your business it's pretty easy to build a concept car that runs and drives because you've got your skateboard and you can just gonna put any body on it right so odds are there's like a Model X chassis underneath that prototype truck right but there's a one I don't think that accepting reservations is an honest thing to do when you don't know how you're gonna build the truck don't know there's no way that trucks on the road next year no way now that's not even supposed I don't know in the road he did he said 20 he said next year twenty twenty one twenty one twenty three full three motor five hundred range badass one is like a three year down the line thing here's the problem building cars and warrant iam repairing them selling them is like a logistics business they're operating this company like a tech company where it runs on hype like where's the Roadster that's supposed to come out this year no I haven't seen anything about it since I guess I don't know that's the point I don't like they've had these product launches and they build up the hype it juices the stock they take the reservations but then it's like but you have to deliver the product guys you're you're actually a car company or not you're not exclusively driven on hype but they have made some cars of course no of course they made your there's one here yeah yes no I'm not saying they don't build and sell cars they build and sell cars but what I am saying is their business model is not like the regular car companies in that it is so dependent on this hype machine bringing in new investors bringing in new reservation cash when they go here's this crazy Total Recall space truck and all it's gonna cost you people to buy into my space truck vision is $100 refundable and you're not gonna find out if that hundred dollars gets you a truck for like two and a half years are you gonna go after your $100 if he's late or it's your but I'm not saying you shouldn't buy whatever he sells isn't the roaster thing a different deal though don't you have to pay all the money or something there is a reservation process is all I'm saying like the roaster thing was different though low key that requires a substantial sum of money right but we don't we haven't seen any roadsters either we saw the prototype yeah but it's easy to build a prototype when your Tesla heads looking build a prototype very easily they've got an electric skateboard they can put any body on it it'll look and feel like a mostly running driving car let's say here forty five thousand five thousand dollar credit card payment plus forty five thousand dollar wire transfer do in ten days yeah so you gotta put up $50,000 so here's giving him a zero interest loan of $50,000 until he delivers this product which is like a good income for a lot of people free yeah give it up correct and so I'm not saying that they don't build and sell real cars I'm not saying you shouldn't buy one or lease one I am saying and this goes for it let's let's expand this I mean this isn't a dig at Elon or Tesla specifically let's talk about all cars don't pay for something that isn't then handed to you there's no real ons a billionaire why do you need to give him a zero interest loan of $50,000 for a roadster why do you need to give him a zero and she's a lot of $100 for a truck that he hasn't demonstrated he could build yet why do you think they made the roaster 50 grand and the down payment for the truck only a hundred bucks because I will tell you why because at Weibull I believe I believe I'm gonna I'm gonna put this and I believe okay okay I believe it's so they could go to a bank or a VC because if it's only hundred dollars you get you get so many of the fuck right what five hundred thousand orders go I've got two hundred and fifty thousand orders I need a billion dollars that's why you would do that please look here's the problem is if if it's legitimate okay if it's all on the up-and-up if everything is on the up-and-up there's a lot of individual pieces that don't freely add up right and on a house that's not made of you know it's like imagine them them the mortgage crisis Inouye you took all these bad mortgages and you put him together and all of a sudden it's considered a good investment right so he smashed the fucking window onstage he quoted a bunch of power and torque figures that are basically made up he did that dumb video with tug of war the f-150 that was completely fake that has a fake the f-150 was in two-wheel drive and he was towing it uphill that's not like if you're gonna make it easier for the car to drive downhill and uphill it no towing uphill well it would be the weight transfer is is if you have a two-wheel drive pickup truck going downhill my friend Jason Fenske to engineering explained did a whole video explaining debunking this but if you have an all-wheel drive extremely heavy vehicle because let's be honest if they build that truck that's a sixty five hundred pound vehicle steel and batteries all-wheel drive versus a pickup truck that's put into two-wheel drive with no weight in the bed right that's just so it's like all automakers make up silly games to show up their product right their tow the space shuttle or whatever bullshit they do right but they make up a game they know they can win they don't make up a game and then cheat at it like why are you gonna do a tug of war video if you then have to cheat at the video on video to do it like pick a different game you know you can win what kind of a person makes up a game and then cheats at it well here Ford wanted to get one of their own they're like well why don't you give us one of your Tesla's yes dude and then somebody up it up at the top said don't engage that idiot what are you doing I'm not doing this yeah so look again well they probably can't live realistically it can't really compete with it I I think I think it's not a test of anything it's a test of weight and tire grip that's it but when you truck I realize it's a thing they do truck let's bring them let's bring that cyber truck over to a gravel pit and dump two tons of dread did you see any like of the renderings of people like camping in the cyber truck what's absurd well yeah I just like dude like he won him fucking you know you want to buy one wait till he says this is the one you can buy yeah I just I don't think wood box congratulations you just bought into the scam that's that's that's you know what I mean I seem like I don't think it's like a full-on fraud I just think he's figured out creative ways to to get the public to bankroll shit yeah that he already said was done bro a million Robo taxis by 2020 whereas the Robo taxis bro Zoe said yeah this cyber truck thing came out of seemingly nowhere but right kind of at the same time that they figured out that full self-driving is not right around the corner as they said it was it's a lot of backtracking going on in the full self-driving level-5 is not coming anytime soon you're not going to be able to send your Tesla out to do errands for you without a driver in it anytime soon what was the parking with Tesla promises 1 million robo taxis yeah that was from 2019 for yeah I mean technically they have a year in a month left but they have delivered zero Robo taxis he did he said that shit man yeah but problem with Tesla's Elon says some shit that then is impossible and then they have to figure out how to do it later and sometimes doesn't work do you know how Kyle Dunnigan is no who's that one of the funniest guys alive but he's got the best Instagram on the and he does face swaps husband uuugh now that you know you didn't do the deep fat guy know he does a lot will doctor fakin Stein oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's the one that's newest one give me some volume on this give me some volume on this and go to fullscreen yeah oh my god how creepy yeah fucking shit ha ha ha oh great idea on do it again same window same ball you should go differently fucking shit now I Mark Zuckerberg is officially cooler than you know I'm cooler I make Rockets that's cool well I connect the world to Facebook I'm cute I'm double cooler double oh my god a plus-one that's one more cooler you can't add anything to infinity you Fillion nerd who's uncool would know that very uncool this is too many all the data and I found this invention you unveiled in high school so so its senses you feel getting a boner class and then two pros this over you so letting everyone know you don't have a boner so it's pretty cool pretty cool I know I could use this at miss Tinsley's ha ha ha ha she's got great boobs dread boobs man Tinsley crappy fucking weird that smashing glass is one of the was one of the greatest moments in automotive history I was laying in bed and my wife was next to me asleep and I have nowhere why did they think that they could do that I don't know I know the same idea was that when they hit the wall or hit the door with the hammer that it broke the glass or no that first he was gonna hit the door with a sledgehammer they did that but except he was using an orange hammer which is a dead blow hammer not a sledge hammer so that's a little disingenuous deadblow yeah it's designed to not dent things it's assigned to hit things without stretching rubber yes but still who said two windows were a regular Tesla door probably because they're aluminum but not a stainless steel panel right I wouldn't dentist English steel panel and then he goes the windows are bulletproof its steel ball right thread and he puts up a video the next day that's like oh here was us testing it right before the reveal word actually did show that it worked before why did it work how do you know the video was made before and not after after they fixed it there's a shop-vac on the floor and a towel over the door as if you had just cleaned up a bunch of broken glass that's true yeah go look at the video there's a shop-vac on the floor with a hose laid out like right underneath the door howls over a door kind of maybe if you would just smashed a bunch of glass out of it anybody thinks I don't I'm glad you don't carry things and if they make that I will be extend can I just bring up what is the word cyber like cool now yes like cyber was exclusively cool for like the last 15 years again very cool very cool only nerds only a real nerd wouldn't know the cyber is cool cool plus one it's so silly well you saw I'm sure you've seen that res vani oh my god Terry bulletproof car that releases tax electrifies the door so you know I was in a real bad res money I was at the gas station once pumping gas and this fucking reservoir pulls up I'm like who is driving that fucking thing to Jamie Foxx jumps out he goes what's up Jamie Jamie who is he a spokesman he's got to be a spokesman or something um I think he's friends with the guy who belongs in the guy gayweed or something that's hysterical how he's a spokesman just I uh I met his Oscars and making Grammys he's got no time to be a spokesman for a tank that's hilarious I drove this company's other car they have a car called the beast the res vani beast to that I drove it it wasn't good with a beat the tank is the based is based on an Ariel Atom Wow you know what that is yeah yeah three-wheeled thing yeah so good good no so Jamie the red one we know roof oh my god so that's the one it's not good it's not in muscular possible so what they've done there is they took an Ariel Atom which is a car that has no body all right right it's driving a fucking sled basically they're crazy they're batshit yeah and they made bodywork that goes over it that's pretty much what they've done okay but in order to make it look kind of badass like a supercar they've made they put these really wide wheels and tires on the car yes which when you have an Ariel Atom that has no power steering and a very dialed in and and even sort of twitchy steering rack this thing had one of the sketchiest I mean the sketchiest handling of top five sketchiest handling cars I've ever driven look at doors yeah it's a real interesting kind of door design I've never seen one that had those doors a slide that looks cgi issue for a noise like the reverse minivan door it does look pretty cool it's a it's a badass looking thing but it's it's um it just didn't drive good and the guy got kind of mad at me when I made a video saying that it didn't drive mad at you he got a little mad he was you were gonna only promote his thing for free I think sometimes they expect that yes that's really sillier you got to do a better job of it I think now I send him to the tie can review yo Hey look at this kit we should talk about because we talked about two seconds and got away from your videos insane it looks like you're about to fly off the road and into space it is might be a problem so it actually is I think I think we're at a point really where cars are actually too fast just to sell to regular people well I think that all time and I made that argument about the zr1 yes it's so sketchy to drive with the rear-wheel drive yeah like you're selling a 750 horsepower car to someone like me who at least I know how to drive you are probably in the top 20% of people in terms of driving a billion that I can drive a little yeah there's a lot of people to get those they don't know what happens when you stomp on the gas and go sideways it like that fucking poor guy and Kevin Hart you know when I saw that and I saw the fucking lines on the street yeah I'm like this guy doesn't know how to drive whether that's so gnarly let someone do that yeah Hellcat engine a rear-wheel drive car there's a CUDA right yeah double the horsepower of stock I bought my 70 CUDA if I heard you did congratulations there mom you're gonna make it handle sending it to roadster shop oh yeah perfect they'll do they'll do a good job yeah yeah but but with that with Kevin's crash he was not driving right friend was driving and his friend stomped on the gas and the car went fucking sideways and he didn't know what to do yeah you just can't do that with regular folks you got if you're gonna have a car like that yeah you got to say hey Manny you were driven a real monster before yeah how about one with 750 fuckin horsepower you can't do that man you got I think I do does probably 5 or 600 pounds lighter than a Hellcat too probably really light and really gnarly and you know with those with those custom builds like that and you know it's it's it's hard I think someone's suing that the shop that built it there's really unfortunate because yeah it's like they're suing because of the waist belts no roll cage all that shit I think that I hope I you know I hope they don't win because if they do it's a really bad scene for custom cars all over but even brand-new cars you know I just had a McLaren 720 which is my favourite supercar on the moment at the market right now and this thing is 800 horsepower the demon of a car have you driven one know what I've seen the fucking crazy dude I was at Auto Club Speedway the the NASCAR track 180 miles an hour on the front straight I mean yeah and and if you tarses it way 3,100 pounds look that's me that's me get about to get black-flagged for drifting and tracked yeah yeah they don't like when you're drifting and tractors he said it was a mistake I didn't know how much horsepower I got black flag only four tenths lied once you can be like managing me when the smoke is wafting across but with that car oh my god it's so fucking good Joe Joe that car is in my opinion the pinnacle of gasoline-powered streetcar performances we're here it's a strong state I think yeah I've never driven cuz you know why it's not just that it's batch it fast cuz a lot of their cars are batshit fast too although very few were this fast it has this magic suspension technology it doesn't have sway bars you know sway bars were yeah so you can put a stiffer sway bar in your car and it makes it roll less in corners so typically you have to trade off you know roll and compliance for stiffness and performance right the 720 does not use sway bars instead it uses an electronically actuated independent valve system that allows you to mimic an infinite number of sway bar combinations in between you know full stiff and non-existent so when you put the car in the comfort mode I shit you not it rides like a Rolls Royce like a Rolls Royce not even like a 5 Series BMW or your Tesla like a rolls-royce and then you crank it to track and you go full drift oh and it's just bonsai time how much some one of those that one is a spider so it's four hundred and fifty thousand you can buy them used the problem with MacLaren's and buying them new is they depreciate like she could buy almost exactly the same car like two years old for like 250 really yeah that much oh my god didn't style bender buy one of those he bought him a clam but did he buy that model do you know style blender no who's that name sounds familiar UFC middleweight champ oh cool I try to I've tried to listen to so much you're fighting shows I can't I'm just not that into it I get it it's okay it's alright it's okay but you're in the lot of shit oh yeah he's got a 720 there it is that's a car yeah that's a 720 and if that's his garage he's got a 675lt in the background as well that's where he bought it okay cool yeah I know he's got that's that's the right car for sure that's it's a spider - so the roof comes up and 11 eleven seconds while you're driving well 11 seconds up and asks can you go I think it's up to up to 40 or something you can go pretty you can be going pretty good yeah I'd put it up just while driving around and yeah and I drove through the rain and I learned that if you go 74 miles an hour you stay dry keep it over 74 with the top down you're staying there so just whistles past you right over your head but whatever you stopped at a red light and you found how you're done it's gotta happen on the highway but you make Ziggy's rooster tails this car makes tails if you hammer down in the rain because it's pulls up the water out the the like the diffuser and it gets hit with the exhaust and it does like a Top Gun swirl no fucking tissue of this anyway I don't know if I got video of it sometimes it's a missed opportunity of god that sounds so crazy it's so much money $450,000 so much money for a car I know there's so many of these custom cars that people are making now like like singer with that 1.8 million dollar LS yeah yeah yeah dynamic and light weighting yeah Chris Harris was just so much so talking about it I have a real problem with you calling a car study I didn't call that anybody anybody do now like settle the fuck down I'll tell you what if Ilan called that truck a study I might be a little less worried about it it's so cool super cool point eight million dollar car that's not nearly as fast as that McLaren no but it's got one of the gnarliest engines that money could buy at any price yeah that engine in specifically in that is a four liter to the co-developed by a guy named Hans Metzger who developed the engineer gt3 RS legend the met the legendary Metzger engine yet which people talk about it Porsche co-developed by Metzger and Williams the Formula One team Jamie pull up the video that's we can see the sound of this I think it revs to like ten five what yeah it revs it's because this is the first ever air-cooled 911 engine that has a four valve head 9,000 rpm yeah I thought it Reds to above nine but it's it's BA Nana's oh this is Chris Harris driving up the hill at Goodwood I believe Wow look at exhaust carbon fibre do if this car is ba nano Freddy I don't know who's driving it that's a wrench to even consider this well you know how they ended up doing this they literally had a customer who came to them and said you know half a million for the normal car that's great and all but what if I give you a full-on blank cheque full blank cheque this is what they end up with 20 volume dues that turn this shit up bro see that's what you need in your life listen this fly by [Music] but let me be honest with you that's not $1,000 engine it's dot as cool as a shark works 911 gt3rs it's not because the shark works is just as fast you could drive it anywhere you park it anywhere it handles probably better maybe I don't know it sounds just as good bro there's no rhyme or reason or math that leads you to buy your cool things of weird world's without getting into that world's weird like if you had a 500-horsepower engine anywhere else that cost you 400 grand people would kill you yeah hate you to death to be charged me 400 thousand dollars for a fucking engine let's not kill you yeah did we talk about this on the last show um no we talked about this in text okay you're talking about values yeah air-cooled horsepower yeah is like the worst value in motoring yeah so if you want like let's say you're starting with an engine that works you buy a regular car like my career is an 87 it's micropore started you're starting with an 87 Carrera okay and and you go in and you have an engine that works and you go to a performance shop and you say this engine makes about 200 horsepower as it is I want it to make 300 horsepower you have to give him your engine and probably $50,000 or $60,000 if you want that engine to make 350 horsepower you probably have to give them $100,000 and if you want that engine to make 400 horsepower you have to give them a quarter of a million dollars that's what it costs to get that type of so when you see cars like a singer where you go okay here's a singer 911 and and it's 600 grand a quarter of a million dollars as that is the engine a singers got 50 grand in leather in it 50 grand in raw leather materials just the material just the materials yeah this shit adds up like real fast well the interiors of those things have specialties no really spot really really special but I mean I guess like that's what that rob guy wanted to do right like he's no object yeah he's really into bespoke everything and their whole thing everything is important and there's a market for it too I mean John Ward with your Bronco over there is maybe a half a bump down from that yeah quite as obsessed but but on that same yeah cheap no the icon stuff is great and they've got great taste I think it's he's a great style what I love yeah Jonathan Ward is his style like what he's into yeah like I love that he makes those derelicts yeah and the way that got tossed his purse is gonna mazing taste his ideas and design taste but I just had a thought earlier you were kind of lamenting how these modern supercars aren't analog and you don't you stick that right there is where companies like singer and icon come in they will deliver you that analog not just an analogue product they'll deliver you the like in 1999 Porsche stop making air-cooled engines they started making water-cooled engines but like singer and and some other people are like well what if you continue developing the air-cooled engine from where Porsche left off and so that is how you end up with you know half a million dollars because people that have this kind of money are willing to pay for that analog experience but without any sacrifice at all but more the 1.8 million dollars I think they made I don't have any 20 or 30 of those but that's funny or 30 Oh these fucking Saudis and these Chinese guys it's not there's no evil or there's no either/or anymore you know what I mean with these million dollar-plus cars it's all the same 300 people really yes they all the average Bugatti owner has like 50 cars 50 not really in five or ten yeah it's the same 300 Malone has long just hoovering up shit so it's Tracy Morgan I know she's on the first day the first day Tracy Morgan I I love I love seeing Tracy Morgan in a Bugatti fans in me is just fucking spend that Walmart money you fuckers spend all of much did they give him from the crash I don't think anyone's ever said but it's I mean it was tens of millions of dollars if not hundreds of millions it's a lot of money it's whatever his lifetime earning potential was as Tracy fucking Gordon he's barely that's a Bugatti Grand Sport Vitesse the the roof comes off and he's good fucking Honda Element not element a CRV just crunch just turned right in then bro that see RVs insurance is but that's the kind of car that's gonna hit you a minivans doesn't give a fuck about life I mean that's you know you can you can worry about that kind of shit or you can yesterday you know I was I was in mind in my off road 9/11 here and there was a double right turn lane right and I was on the outside one someone's on the inside one and they were on their phone not fucking pay then Jimmy we both make the turn and they they don't stay in theirs they just drift into mine chorus so I go into the dirt shoulder and fucking hammer down sideways out the dirt shoulder pads out of the dirt I don't like you want to offer 911 yeah I guess for those rare moments we'd driven off by an asshole in a minivan yeah oh we took a left but Tyco it I can it's it's like 700 horsepower I suit I think it's I think they're calling it 610 horsepower and 750 torque but just like the Tesla the torque is instituted zero to zero so you saw the video I sent you the fucking launch yeah it's you know you were really splitting hairs here with the Tesla in the portion of what you know what it does to for feel different from two five like no I don't know my eyes hurt yeah same shit and the Porsche has this really interesting thermal management system so Tesla although they do a beautiful road car for the city you know they've never gone racing they don't they don't know about endurance racing or real real high-performance driving you mean you've seen them kind of struggle with the Nurburgring a little bit it's a little harder than it looks over there what did happen with the Tesla I think they went over there with a prototype they took the interior a dad proto yeah yeah - means the wide bot it's a wide-body version with three engines I believe yeah they wouldn't they weren't talking about what it was but I think it's a three motor car with a widened body and a different aero package and it resides there were some and they went back with one with a giant liked gt3 wing on it - it seemed like they the number they originally put out and you guys talked about a show Jamie looked it up was a con um compilation of best sector times so they released this sort of theoretical best time but they never actually ran that complete lab the big difference between a Tesla and the Porsche right now is thermal management managing heat and cool sort of where it needs to go yeah there's the prototype and I believe the Tesla can build they're exactly the kind of company that can build a one-off prototype the Ghidorah the Nurburgring very fast like they could do that you could see how it's wider it looks cool but the oh they didn't put out the apex you show me a photo of the apex so Tesla so the Taikan has this really interesting thermal management system that integrates the brakes the battery the motors and the cabin heat and he a cabin climate control all-in-one system and so it's very common that one system will need heat while the other needs to be cooled and one will need so they if the brakes are hot but and they need to be cooled but the cabin is cold and needs to be hot they use the brake heat too they can send heat or cold anywhere in the car it needs to go you know go to stay up there go back looks okay it's not that bad oh it doesn't let you change it I've seen one swap everything out with carbon fibre but they put dope wheels on it but the interiors were the management I would like to see the interior I don't really see a point to doing body kits on TVs but yeah there's no quilted leather little armrest some carbon I think the idea is there go go back up see the on the left there with the body at the wheels are nice yeah they put larger wheels wire breaks what does that say on it let's say unplugged on the brakes oh god I think that's their company oh oh it's called unplugged performance yeah Apex unplugged hey thanks s I mean it's not for me they put carbon fiber brakes on it how those carbon ceramic brake carbon ceramic brakes I think a lot of money for that I'm sure it's not cheap I don't know maybe the interior but I wouldn't carbon ceramic brakes how about yeah maybe they could do it 90 so with Porsche like so you're Tesla for instance if you want max performance like the hardest launch you can do right you got to have like eighty percent battery or and it'll let you do a couple of them in a row before it starts to get noticeably slower you know I mean it'll melt you let you launch but you want that to five or whatever it is it's only gonna be your first couple launches where you get it right the tie con will give you full performance until the battery's dead well so I get a full-bore launch control start with like 40 miles of range on the battery now how many miles can it get from fully charged in theory 300 in theory yeah that's me driving like an old lady so I was able to drive around normally and I found that the range estimate was pretty accurate I only got the car for one day so it's pretty accurate and then I went to the canyons and in that video I burned off 40% of the battery just making that video really yeah it would be the same in a Tesla it's not it's when you start driving real fast and v's bro you're just you're just smoking through battery with the demand technology will improve to the point where they can get like real range out of these things like the theoretical range of the Tesla Roadster was like 600 miles but yeah and that's never been done I think so I'm not an expert on TVs and there's like electrical engineers that'll be screaming fucking at their iPods right now I believe I know right I believe that the 300 mile range is because that's a good amount of range the key that we will see that will really be a game-changer his battery charge times how can we get a charge in five minutes or ten minutes and not thirty minutes or an hour right and the number of stations the opportunity to charge and that's an issue with the Porsche over the Tesla's they don't have the super charging Network correct although they are using the Electrify America network which is actually it's another one of the networks that stands for like normal V's it's actually bigger really but they don't have as many super high-speed chargers so the Tesla and all V's on the market right now except the Taikan all the rest are 400 volt systems okay and the Tesla's probably the best most efficient use of 400 volt architecture eight hundred volt architecture if is to be believed is more efficient the it's a lighter setup if it flows in and out faster than the four hundred volt system there's a couple other advantages to it but it can charge really really fast through the correct chargers there just aren't that many of the superfast ones around there's only three in LA right now one is in Burbank at the Best Buy in Burbank is the transponder here and you I judged one from almost dead to almost full in about 18 minutes Wow that one yeah but there just aren't very many so so you can go stop grab a cup of coffee yeah go to Best Buy stroll around yeah you come out you got 80% of your juice yeah it was pretty good it went fast enough that I could watch it go six seven really yeah yeah I yeah it was pretty good like yeah if they get the number of stations right I think the real problem with Evie adoption especially in place of LA is an infrastructure man I don't think this city generates enough electricity through its grid for all of us to be charging cars at home good point right because it would if we got all the millions of cars that are now charging it would radically change everything yeah unless everybody switches over to solar even with solar I don't think is efficient enough rats the other problem is now it's a homeowners thing and so like v's are awesome like if you like how an Eevee drives and you like the experience of owning one and it works for your life like a thousand percent get an Eevee but is is a 90 percent Eevee adoption rate in LA something that's really realistic like not anytime soon I just don't think so I'm building a building right now and so I know I'm learning about how much power the city will give me in my building and I don't have another this I'm building a brand new building and the city won't give me enough power to put more than two level two charges in my building I was like yo let me get a bank of five my building would be an Eevee charging spot and they're like no can do bro you won't know power so yeah and can you enhance the amount of power that you have I mean solar it like solar will reduce your bill but it doesn't add it doesn't give you more amps in the building unless you're completely off grid correct now we're in the weeds now you're doing the opposite you like burning fucking dinosaur fuel keep your shit go and I don't you know with a new building I'm no expert but all the people who are experts are telling me that I should wait a year or two and see what my utilities are before I'd even attempt solar cuz I might you know you put it in now how do you know if you've saved any money right right yeah I'm obligated by law to make my building solar ready so I had to reinforce the roof yeah yeah there's a bunch of shit when you're building a building that you got to do to in 2019 yeah my building is the only collector this is our Westside collector car storage my new business is nice open for reservations currently yes we'll be open in January we're a little bit behind but constructions hard as it turns out it's the it's the first time that we've ever put in dorkwad stackers in Southern California we have four high vehicle stackers we've eighteen of them what are you doing about earthquakes the bill 20 19 code dude yeah dude we have we have more concrete and rebar I mean this we're up to it we're good for a 1200 earthquake that's already that's the 2020 standard I want a house like that it's bro we tore a house I poured a hundred and ten cement trucks that'd be great if the world's on fire and just sitting there sipping tea do it well so you want speaking of that so the wall do the dividing wall in between the car storage area and the members lounge my office of my studio is legally required to be a two hour firewall so you can sit there and have a tea and watch a fire on the other side for two hours and then just walk out the front door really yeah that's a law for twofer Cal for LA for 2019 Wow we had to have the fire code written for us it's that seems pretty cool though that they're doing that but they're making these standards extremely high I believe that it's good to have high standards and that you can get it you know you end up with a higher quality product and you can then charge more for it you know and that's sort of how it works but that's a big leap for you to just jump in and build some crazy car storage yeah never done shit like that's what I think about that like the amount of money that must cost is fucking extraordinary I'll tell you off-mike yeah yeah yes you know you could probably guess but it's prey it's rising it's scary and it started small yeah and then it and it was like well the model doesn't work small what about medium well the model doesn't work medium either what about big well it only works big if you build the building you know because you the the bland is so expensive that you have to go vertical and you can't go vertical in an existing structure because it just doesn't meet earthquake codes so you have no choice but to build and then there's a law in LA that if you build for every thousand square feet of commercial real estate you have you need to have two Street accessible parking spaces so I had to take a basement so I dug a 7,000 square foot baseball so I have 30 underground parking spaces that counts so the half the cost of the building was digging the basement Jesus Christ dude yeah and where is this it's implied Vista it's across the street from Google and Yahoo and the Clippers all those dirty rich people dirty dirty rich people filthy rich yes wow that's cool you gotta come see a man it's then coolest where does Playa Vista what is that near it's right off the 405 in Jefferson mmm on the way between Marina del Rey and Elliot oh yeah yeah yeah yeah perfect for people who's in out of town hit me up Westside collector cars Corazon that's the end of my plug I'm done come visit but I'm learning so much about concrete and steel and you know all this crazy shit concrete's a weird weird science man oh I'd imagine it's crazy the pressure testing and there's different mixtures and they shake all the rebar to get it to settle it's fuckin Jesus yeah you gotta wait for the perfect day to do your poor man building this for years for years that's right when we first started talking about is at least two years ago we broke ground two years ago I broke ground in August of seventeen dude you must be shitting your pants with all that money I'm so exhausted just know how to handle that my friends that have built houses before I'm like fuck man we remodeled our kitchen once for eight months we were cooking on a hot plate in the living room and I was like this is ridiculous yeah it's it's sex you know it's like a project car you know we're at the point where the car looks done right it lay basically looks done except there's just so much left to do and dealing with the city is so so hard this is why I'm I'm a little less optimistic about others in terms of the adoption rates of Vivi's and stuff like that and and solar and something that is because it's working with the city for this stuff is so hard it's taken me so long to do one stupid fucking building right like we're looking at a whole city like I don't know anything crazy do you think about moving pan Sunshine's free and weeds legal so nice good I know that's corny as fuck but makes me go let's do it it goes a long way yo what about that Kevin Smith shit Kevin Smith was up and you're talking about his snooty boo cheese bro just weed I know it isn't I know it is but I had to thought when I was listening to your show and it was like you're telling me the fictional drug dealer from that movie I loved when I was 13 is now a real drug dealer but legally and as that movie character that is some crazy-ass shit yeah that's basically what is it like Tyson weed this is Mike Tyson wait yeah how about that do I go get a face tattoo afterwards is that you don't these sell this like this yeah it's a full Godfather blunt yeah giant fat blunt that looks like poison crazy that is awesome all right it's pretty fucking good dude what do we need to talk about with cars is there anything else shouting in the industry that you want to know about well I mean the tie can I don't think we've like completely covered it no my question with all these cars is what is next right it's like right we're seeing these incredible 0 to 60 under 3 second times yeah see we're going to eventually see the range increase but if you had asked me 10 years ago are we gonna see a 2.4 zero to 60 sedan that feels like it's violating physics when you stomp on the gas I mean that's what I Drive and yeah laptop for a screen yeah we've gotten to a about I don't know right right maybe 10 years ago or so the the the trajectory of increased performance got very steep yeah where you know the new version of every car has a hundred more horsepower and now we've got these high-performance V's and with a high-performance Eevee you know you built a dragster that that's a fuckin dragster I mean the the the Tyco on does your does the quarter-mile on the low tens I mean so you can you know I don't want to be flippant and say all it takes is money but all it takes is money you walk into a dealer and you buy in a dragster that you know you you're sitting in an arch NHRA license to run that fast now you could do it on the way to Whole Foods that's great you know and so with Taikan the real difference for me but sweet I get in Tesla is the steering and handling because Tesla's have very videogame be steering it's accurate and it's sharp but it's not I don't feel it know this the Taikan has the steering system from the Porsche 919 and so it feels like a Porsche and so when I drove it I texted you I go Joe this is for you well Tesla figured out how to make it go fast and they figured out how to make it handle pretty good and make it cool they figured how to make it an Eevee cool because v's remember the rav4 eveything ed begley was driving in the 90s like what is this Jamie video that I was one of the things that makes Porsche Taikan different is they have a two speed transmission your Tesla is one gear so your Tesla from zero to 120 is bananas but it pretty much dies off because it runs out of gear because most people don't really need to go faster than that but Porsche with their auto bond stuff they need more at the top end so the tie can actually switches into second gear and keeps pulling like crazy you know above 80 to 100 miles an hour and the biggest difference though dynamically is like you know how in your Tesla you can drive with one foot like one pedal when you lift off the pedal it breaks the car yeah and so you can pretty much drive around one foot Taikan doesn't do that so Porsche believes that the kinetic energy built up by motion is better used by allowing the car to just coast as far as possible than by hitting the region and capturing it in the four of breaking the way that Tesla does now you can turn that function off in the Tesla does that have an impact on what but if it's doing that does it does it have an impact on the way it feels well it feels I mean yes because you have to use the brakes more in every time a car quicker to use the brakes more to do it mean to do have regenerative do we know it doesn't necessarily slow the car down faster just means easy to zero time no in fact if I I believe that Porsche is ultimately better at that it's did that the only real difference is that when you lift off the gas and a Tesla it slows down as if someone is applying the brakes yeah in the Porsche you just pure coast it's a pure coast and it and it's a really it's it's an even more of a coast that feeling than a gasoline car it's like you're freed of all restraint like because after I'm fuckin mobbed up the mountain in that video that I sent you yeah I was like oh shit dude I've only got like 40 miles of range left I gotta get off this bloody Hill yeah and so I was at the high point in the hill and I go let's coast and so I just coasted and I was like let's see how far I can go without touching the brakes and I got this motherfucker coasting up to like a hundred miles an hour taking corners and not using the brace because the handling and the grip are so good I coached in like 12 miles down the hill - what about a deer what about a boy groaning boy awareness Oh about that alertness shit while I'm filming and I've never been able to not stop the car no I believe me I know you can drive but I saw the guys a little log down the road just unfree on a chain oh my god there was a guy in a Ford Explorer driving in a windy Canyon like this make a video this yeah I got caught it on camera and with a log like the size of like a car engine just free on a chain swinging swinging yes take it outside Jesus Christ craziness sometimes I almost threw that video in the garbage - it's amazing how little of that there really oh yeah here it is I think it right there back it up 20 seconds Jaime 20 more yeah so come around this corner look long just free dragging that is so crazy if he thinks that so and if you back the video up like 30 more seconds Jamie you can actually see not in the very beginning a little forward you can see see the trail that the log has made on the road it's it made like a like a line of kind of dirt on the road and it goes back and forth across the road and you go well what the hell was that that's so crazy you know what's really crazy about that that could start a fire oh my god that isn't it probably but it could also swing into an oncoming car that's like a 500 swing into an oncoming car that guy definitely doesn't have control of it it's definitely a terrible terrible idea but I managed on a supercharged Lamborghini doing that that's by the way that's not my YouTube video someone has stolen my youtube video motherfuckers yeah motherfuckers these motherfuckers know I hit that fraud protection Jamie that's incredible that's like a crazy thing to see yeah this is knuckleheads out there man there's a lot of them I go quick but I go up there at times that I I know almost almost for certain that the road is empty mmm I that the roads that I use are not commuter roads and I go there at times where there's it's highly unlikely to see people that's the same amount of time in the day where that guy drags logs seems out hey when I drag my logs no one's on that fucking Mountain damn it what are you doing up there speaking that's true that's my boys logs man points too heavy to pick up I've seen other we should I've seen people doing push-ups in the street I've seen Christ I've seen people on horseback in the street some guy just died who is a world-class climber do you hear that when I fell he found a thousand feet not the not the not Alex Honnold nose did you think that did you have had him on twice he's fascinating that movie is crazy dude he's on another level he's like a Zen master yeah cuz he kind of he is that like smoke show of a girlfriend he pretty much tells like you know you just do your thing I'm gonna be on this wall dude he freaks me I mean freaks me out to the point where like talking about him my hands start sweating I get super nervous oh my god I got real sweaty watching that movie freaked out thinking about him what he does is like off-the-charts nuts man he's he's a thousand feet in the air and he's just no hand I mean no rope it's holding on with one hand straight t-shirt fuck I can't that's something in in that movie what's the name of the fucking movie free solo thank you for Issa when he goes you have to put your thumb and it's like on this postage stamp side up yep and that's how he's staying alive fuck this that's crap out of stay calm do you I don't have that thing yeah I got none of that can't it's I can't do that shit no I'm not interested I'm amazed that he can and I'm fascinated to watch him it's like I just don't want him never get hurt he's a really nice guy I mean he's you feel like he just needs to be on that edge right some of those people just they need that my hands are sweaty talking like a tell me to fuck or maybe that's maybe that's Mike Tyson's weed it's Mike Tyson's we connect Tyson's weed and that Oh picture what about taking that picture that guy get it down Jamie fucking hell tell me how you like your grande Seiko watches they're very nice the last time I came on the show I talked to you about my grande Seiko watch and your show is so good for business that I got a handwritten letter from the CEO of grits wow that's very nice they make beautiful stuff they do I love mechanical shit yeah I love things where someone's making it and there's gears and there's innovation and I'm just fat I don't know what what part of our monkey brain is so fascinated by innovation and craftsmanship and shit like what cooling me about watches is like they're these crazy math machines in and I had a watch called an IWC perpetual calendar then was think it's a company was like a big fuck tank of a watch and it would do time the day date the month the year four digits year that the moon phase and had a powers and it basically would it knew all the leap years it knew how many days that's it how many days there are in a month and you if you kept this fucking thing wound and I'll either wearing it or on a winder you didn't have to adjust it for four hundred years like you don't have to adjust it until the year two thousand four hundred that's fuckin crazy that just Springs and wheels dude in that nuts that really is nuts and when you put it that way it's it's astonishing because it's it's an interesting combination of engineering and art yeah right and there's this really pretty yeah but it also it's it's phenomenal engineering like who are the wizards behind that there's a new there's a watch called a Vacheron Constantin they that is its it looks like a clock it's like as big as this clock it has the most complications of any watch ever made has fifty seven complications so one mainspring drives 57 different spring and gear sets that do 57 different things and that will and it will continue like that that's some funky weird ice about that is I don't know about is that's a weird shit but uh yeah that's bonkers I don't but I don't mean it's someone's doing that that that's what they're doing and making the and the here's a really bonkers thing when you find out that they started making them in like the 40s and like wow oh you mean a guy who's worked on one watch for like a decade number like if you think about like automatic watches like like Rolex or something like that when did they start making those well mechanical watches they've been making since like the 1700s if you want to talk about strictly like the automatic winding rotor just a Jamie it's Vacheron Constantin seven convocation is when was the first automatic winding why it was like in the early like probably World War two time yeah yeah the winding rotor may be a little early maybe like the 20s it might have actually so that what you're looking at that's one side there's there's there's shit on both sides of that thing what isn't that crazy what is all that nonsense it's so much shit I don't even know I honestly don't even know read that I don't know and there's a list there's a Wikipedia page for that watch that has the list of all the complications but but something like that you're literally talking like it's probably six or seven million dollars to buy some of that some someone just paid thirty thirty million dollars for a watch y-yeah the most I think it was might have been the most expensive as a Patek it's a weird thing right because it is the gentleman's jewelry right yeah it's the gentleman's jewelry where it's like literally 90% for other guys like yeah look at that movement though yeah specific subset of other guys yeah and it's it's um you know we don't get to like we don't we don't really get to wear diamonds and shit around no but we got to have a trophy so it's okay check this out you'll like this my friend Cameron Weiss made this this is a Weiss watch company watch designed and manufactured exclusively in Los Angeles every bit of that watch made in Los Angeles Wow he got me that for when I first met him and he makes them by hand every one of them pretty super murca like oh fuck yeah oh my god can I tell you yes that I just saw there is a Fast and the Furious musical parody that these dudes came up with and they're doing it in this little theater here the dynasty typewriter theater and it is like the team America of fast and furious and it's the fucking funniest thing I've ever seen I went twice Wow and let's go it's just called The Fast and the Furious musical parody but it's they have like women play a bunch like Tyrese like Ludacris are played by women it's fuck and great it was written by these guys Brad SIL nut sir and Joey Orton they came my podcast and this is one of the funniest things I've ever seen and I don't know you got me on a team America tangent dude I went there what a great idea it's fucking hilarious dude and so great anyway are you still alive your second show of the day damn fine the solution is either less drugs or more drugs well marijuana takes everything to that weird hard left it's like no matter what you were doing during your day before you smoked weed now you're doing this what should we talk about like some conspiracy theories or something kill himself I don't think he did nope I think you might not have maybe maybe this what are the odds that he did if you had a bet if I was in Vegas I want to give you odds like hey the odds he did come on Matt 10% 10% is where I've got it I don't I don't want to say it's like zero but I think it's like 10% I think it's low so would you plunk down a hundred bucks on a ten to one is that that he did kill himself no yeah probably yeah you'd want ten do you want more than ten to one that he did kill himself no I'd think there's only a 10% chance he killed right okay yeah fucking with these numbers here making it I don't know how you're however you're converting it to odds it's falling apart I get it sorry I get it it doesn't seem going no way though do not seem likely no he's crazy you could still do that did you see the Ford electric car absolute suicide guard say there's boots for a broken system well that's a defense the defense is just we were incompetent not we killed him hmm dude who knows that's Jurassic weird shit going on behind the scenes man what's going on behind the scene that somebody could sneak somebody in to kill somebody if that's what happened what's going oh this gets an inside person they don't have another sneak somebody in that person's already inside the cameras are off bro that's crazy fuck cameras were cameras were off whoops sorry yeah the cameras come on bro I have cameras at my house they're never fucking off come on when the cameras are off - I've heard repeated a few times but not more recent that there there was screaming heard from his cell that someone heard screaming yeah that's not stopped being repeated now so bro we live in a fucking crazy world yeah that's dark um I don't know hi Hey it's just that's probably the biggest public conspiracy theory that most people believe in do you think most people believe it was a it was a hit I would say most people I just read about one last night is there a pole is there a Pew poll on though should they tried to overthrow FDR 1935 in this general was like The Whistleblower Fork because the people that were supposedly trying to do it we're trying to get him to be like the face to talk people into doing it and so he wouldn't talk to Congress about it his name's like Smedley Butler I think Smedley Butler was a Medal of Honor winner and they called him out and everyone said oh no that's just a lot as a joke there might have been some stuff being talked about in this meeting but we were never gonna do anything they said they had 500,000 soldiers that were gonna march on DC to take over and they had some general they're gonna put a place as addictive as a book written about a couple years ago and this guy Smedley Butler wrote a book in 1935 called like wars around Wars Iraqi yeah Wow Wow so he knew about all that yeah yeah I just read about this last night Jesus how do you know it was a source the book that it's called um like the time the conspiracy to overthrow the government and then it's all it's all about him it's a really long book that just came out about like overthrowing FDR Wow hmm I guess none of this shit is like new I feel like I haven't been I'm like I just turned 38 and I feel like I didn't really start paying attention to anything until you know isn't like my mid-20s or whatever yeah and it's been you know yeah Bush was a piece of shit and then it kind of seemed on the surface like Obama was kind of normal but like it and now obviously we live in crazy town but but it I think it I think I feel like it's new and it's not new and this kind of shit has just happened over and over and over again well it's the remnants of an ancient society I mean we're dealing with this ancient system that was created long before we had anything resembling our way of communicating that we have now it's all set up you know we have a government like ours it's set up in this way it's like is this the ideal way to do it or is it just the way we've been doing it forever you know what I mean yeah I don't think I don't think our bureaucracy can move fast enough to keep up with the technology I think there are a hundred some real problems I don't think culture can keep up I don't think I design to handle the kind of communication that I feel like I have to handle in terms of like I have an Instagram page with like 225,000 people and it's a lot less than you but I think you do a better job of like detaching from it than I do yeah maybe you just keep yourself busy er than I do I've been busy is important that it is but it's I just feel like I'm not designed to handle interpersonal communication with that volume of people yeah who just feel that they can say what the fuck ever yeah and they're trying to push your button yeah fuck with you yeah that's kind of frustrating we're all learning to communicate with each other like this and we're all learning to you know interact in real time with this new technology that no one saw coming you know this new ability to communicate this didn't exist before yeah it's weird for all of us it's weird for the dummies like me and it's weird for the really smart people that create all this technology yeah we're opening up this new realm of human communication I think by just by making every byte you know by breaking it into two e's you know it's gotta be the short thoughts and all that's an angry man yeah but just in terms of like if you watch like look it our access to the news like our access to like these stories that are going on in Hong Kong you could like specifically focus on and try to follow and you can follow it pretty much all day long all these protests and stuff like that it's like it doesn't matter if the networks are sanctioning it people are paying attention to things like that yeah when things like that happen they become these worldwide things that everybody is following along with that was never the case before man you had to wait for the news you to wait for them to tell you what's going on in Germany that's true yeah no I think so weird now so do you think that that we actually live in what is probably generally a much better place we just hear so much more bad shit that we think it's worse well I think we're just aware of way more information than we're supposed to be overlooked all the load and I think that's one of the reasons why so many people are anxious I think just our sheer numbers are wearing on like the way we feel I actually have developed like real anxiety just about fucking life which I think it's directly related probably to like my internet consumption you know what I mean oh for sure I think use like social media of doing that accentuated your interests you know this is the reason why so many people getting fights on Facebook oh yes when you is it amplifies the angry the more you get upset at things the more you interact so because of that they send you things that make you upset but isn't it that that's what you gravitate towards so Ari Shaffir actually did a test yeah you did with puppies or Sierra and he just got all puppies yeah just start searching puppies and guess what how long did it take for him to get all puppies I wasn't that long it was pretty quick so it's not that it's malicious on its own it's that we are cunts yeah we're cunts yeah it just it's like it's like a mushroom trip right where it's just if you feel good it spirals up and if you feel bad it spirals down yeah it's the same kind of thing and it so it's but we can manage it I think we can manage it I think we just have to be nicer to each other I really do I think people can manage it it's so easy to be nice in person but it's so hard to be nice to some fucking you know to someone who opens with what a piece of shit you are and is like you know it's a your way of communicating is terrible it's not you can get great stuff from it but it also opens up the door to great continously the greatest cousin it's because it's like free shots and people and it's just weird to do it's like weird to just someone you don't even know just insult right but it but they can do that to you and they feel free to do that to you and they don't think of you as another person they think of you as some person who's in some public position so it's it's a free shot yeah yeah yeah they think you should have thicker skin they think that they don't realize that you get into a job like this because you're insecure sure but it's also listen nobody saw this coming like we should all be nice yeah about there are this new level of communication that we all have you know we see things on your phone that are coming to you from the air and they're streaming in real-time I can't imagine what it's like to be a child who can grow up with the amount of porn oh my god like I don't want to go into this kind of a tangent too far but like Jesus Christ what does go like you know when I was a kid go to work for it right you know it's always someone's stepdad or at a big collection or I had to do floppies I mean I was I was on some I was on little the hard the hard floppy disks you know yeah that's that was that was the 90s kid it was still a challenge now way too easy it's weird right yeah like there's there's definitely there's definitely a concern there's a there's a there's also there's not just a concern that you have access to porn how about the fact that porn is completely shaped the way people do their pubic hair porn one Dysport do you think porn reflects society or society reflects porn I don't know but if there was a let go a culture contest to see how you trim your pubes completely won out definitely right you can't be a girl and just be chaos anymore right can you do that is that a is that a move you can't it's a specific fetish for that you have to use cheese yeah Ari Shaffir is gonna have to use different keywords together that find Ari they'll find them what's what really weirds me out about porn is they've really transitioned to in all step-siblings kind of when I don't know what happened fucking this is gross I said when did everything get dirty everything is a result of divorce culture something it's something all the divorce the kids of divorces is grown up to watch step-brother born and whatever stepbrother and stepsister giant right now fucking gross it's 90 percent of titles you're supposed to be my sister fucker we watching boys are more depressing job than writing that dialogue but why do people here's a question why do people want to be so naughty like what is it because that's not well that's not new people wanting to write naughty that's not not new no but why do pop why do they always want to push it pushing it they want people gag image that says shit dude the risk becomes the thing a friend of mine is like in the music business and like you know he's like a recovering you know super junky and had a theory that a lot of the celebrities who have died of auto-erotic asphyxiation were former heroin users and once they get sober the only way to get close is by jacking off with a fucking belt around you Hey and that that seems to be a common thread and that maybe those deaths weren't exactly suicides so that there's there's maybe a conspiracy theory there well if you were gonna kill somebody that would be a good way to do it well I don't think they were murdered I think they were she was they were labeled as suicides and we're talking about like Chris Cornell ordained and you know it's a theory I guess I mean I don't think that was the case of Bourdain but it's Syria the argument is that people who have had the high of heroin the only way they can get close to that without drugs is by doing that that's a crazy suggestion if there's a crazy suggestion I don't think that's the case but maybe and I don't know I don't know I don't think maybe Epstein was trying to jerk off I don't oh Jesus Christ Jamie's like I'm letting it go I'm not even gonna jump today open up a hole yeah I don't know how we got down the porn tangent it's probably my fault but little she got buddy ending your rides a weird weird idea you know deciding to end your ride and it's probably something where people like feel like they don't have control over their life and they want to take it maybe oh man something I think some people just feel bad they're sad all the time and you just wanted to stop it just makes sense that if if some people like or frail in certain ways we just accept that but if they're frail in their happiness we don't you know like if someone's born with some sort of disease and this disease affects them we feel bad for them oh shit but if we're born something this is a mem like if you're bored sad yeah yes it makes sense I mean that you could be born with like a shitty level of dopamine yeah your brains not producing enough don't like something I wiring is not totally oh yeah I've known my share of depressed and more bipolar and or borderline people it's scary and sad it is but we have a we-we're diversion it goes back to our like primate days you know we wanna like I want to get those people away from us I have a where I had already think for a long time I wanted to fix them it was a real fixer for a while and it's not a healthy place to be in that's a bad spot ya know you and it's it that there there's a if you want to be fix up guy that comes from a whole list he wrote fucking me yeah no no yeah don't do that no I got married to it the most amazing woman ever I'm very lucky and a rules I'm sorry thank you socially it was my birthday though today like two nights ago she got me Benihana lessons at Benihana and then I went back later that day and I cooked at Benihana for like all my friends it was like life goals achieved so they let you cook there yeah they teach you how to cuss and then they let you cook onion volcano the whole shit no dude it's on my Instagram great gift how many how long is the lessons like an hour and a half it's not hard oh so you must be a cooker right I'm already a cook yeah yeah and not only am i cook I'm a huge hibachi so you've made when the money in volcanoes before I practiced at my house cuz I was so excited you're hilarious behind because it look cuz I popped into flame but she thought I was gonna lay my face on fire and she was right I almost did oh that's hilarious yeah fucking onion volcanoes dude it's a great boomerang right there I know but it's one of the rare truly great boomerangs I think like one of the top comments on that post is this is the only good boomerang in the history look at this lighter the lighter fails so I almost light my face on fire when I get it to work you know look whoa son you almost lost some eyelashes oh fuck that but yo it's a really good birthday present life rules she got me axe throwing lessons one year she got me blacksmithing lessons one year she likes to get me fun lessons for things who's the expert out there throwing axes so fuck what's the guy's a Michael Jordan of axe yes no there is oh shit oh they're gonna kill me for not here's a hilarious name a DVD series and shit oh really yeah it's I want to say it's like Lester diamond but that's the guy from casino it's something like that if you google knife-throwing lessons la you might come up with it buddy but that's yes now they have like they've opened like knife and axe throwing bars now really this was two years ago but now you can like go like it's like a bowling alley but you throw axes oh my god right axe throws in the world I don't want to be around a lot of dudes who want to throw axes No are you going to the axe throwing spot that's like some Viking shit darts right with axes yeah yo there's a hilarious video from yesterday of like keen on the judge on the campaign trail trying to do a axe throw but like out door and he straight over throws the axe misses the target entirely and hits the dudes drum in the marching band somebody brain somebody like a Stephen King book first you imagine first presidential candidates a birder somebody with a hit the dude in the head with an axe and the dude just yeah if Trump did it his supporters would probably like him or you can really test that shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue theory I don't know video of the axe missing and hitting the guy's drum is crazy fucking fun I've been on this audiobook Native American kick uh-huh I listen to two different ones and the one I'm listening to now is like history son of the morning star and my friend Steve Rinella recommended it to me holy shit dude just like I get nervous when I watch Alex Connell oh wait here's the happiness no it's not no oh I'm sorry I apologize apologize mayor Pete oh shit Fox News Cosby Hesketh I apologize people judge my bad but a Fox News hope through a fucking axe and hit somebody oh my god so first of all why the fuck is there a band playing behind whose idea was that oh my god I'm sorry judge that was Pete oh sorry the different Pete but that's fucking horrible you do some famous Pete I I'm sorry I wash on my man this morning so so Fox News guy matches just a just a news guy who killed somebody accidentally with an axe and not a presidential candidate oh just a news guy poor guy just right he just sucks it thrown in axe bro set this up put a band behind the fucking target how trusting are you how many practice shots you think he took none zero you're too like how many people who could throw an accident downtown you kill the guy with an axe in New York you think the DP was like ah can you bring the band around they're not in the shot let's get that band man Jesus Christ that's fucking bad I'm sorry I'm sorry mayor Pete I thought it was you this the reason why I brought this table see this book is horrific it's all these accounts of what happened between the settlers and the Native Americans Oh oh my god it wasn't good I listened to that podcast the dollop which is like a history podcast fucking the people in this that came to this country who were so horrible to the people that were here it's so depressing yes yeah for sure there it was horrible with disease it was horrible with there's the amount of people that just came across the land they killed all the Buffalo they they wiped literally every Native American tribe out of power and they put them on reservations in the reservations Kansas right it just kept getting smaller and smaller and smaller dude there's a lot to it there's a lot to it it's amazing the stories that like the stories of the different tribes are just amazing that just the differences between the ones who lived in the east versus like the Comanches who were mostly just traveling and living in teepees and following the Buffalo the ones in the East Room were like permanently settled in kind of one place right yeah a lot of them you know we're into agriculture they were growing they didn't even really have use for horses they weren't into horses to move white people steal their farming techniques to I think probably for sure you stole everything I'm reading a book called I think it's called the history of the greater United States it's by I think that's correct but it's about all of like the US territories that are like outside of our the continental United States and just like ways we fucked over Native people and we you know they're part of America but they're not States so they don't have to they don't get to vote they don't either do anything just like we've used these islands and countries and stuff strategically all over the world and it's a slog through it but it's it's kind of the kind of stuff you kind of got a read right we got it you should probably know yeah like what are we doing we're doing what I feel like I I went to a very good schools I went to looking good college and a good high school and like I did not learn a lot of really important things I learned a very winner-take-all version of history that I'm not pleased about I missed out on everything I wasn't paying attention to shit until I was like 28 yeah but now you now you pay attention to everything yeah but before then I mean all throughout high school the time that I did spend going to college was only so that no one would think I was a loser I was I was just was it that binary if you're not in college you're a loser and if you're in college you're not it was a huge insecurity with me because I knew I didn't want to do it and I knew like whatever that led to like I don't I just I'm not interested I don't have the discipline yeah sit in class listen I was too spastic I wasn't interested so crazy that you can't sit in class and listen and yet you can do the double header three-hour podcast that's not hard we're talking about cool shit you're a cool guy you're fun to talk to it's it's it's the way the material is delivered huh and the last one was you know what you'll see but it's way more these two guys talking than me no I'm mostly moderated and mostly wound up agreeing with the guy who made the game changers documentary mostly with what he was saying in terms of science in terms of whether or not it's healthy to eat a hundred percent vegan diet according to everything he's showing me it is yeah according to everything he was showing me and he had as much science as you could no no it's just a matter of doing it properly absolutely Kevin Smith on your show I've considered trying to do like a vegan month or a vegan week or something I haven't gone through with it yet but I'm probably gonna I think it's different for different people too I really do I think some people have real issues with it some people have gotten off the vegan diet and they've they've quit and they like a seat a little less me really well I mean it's really I think it's different for everybody to men I think some people could do it with no problems and I think other people struggle more and I don't know why I'm not a nutritionist but I know that a lot of people that wind up trying it out eventually give up it's like 84% I know a couple story ins yeah but I don't have like a moral judgment for it or anything just feel like maybe it's something worth trying because I eat a lot of meat yeah I'm trying to get I have you know if I wrote a business plan for my new place as you do when you have a new business and the first thing on the business plan is by my 40th birthday I want to be the healthiest I've ever been well I don't think cutting meat out is the move see this is what I think about all this like I think you could definitely be healthy and be a vegan according to everything this guy was showing me everything James Wilkes was showing I don't really want to be a vegan but I like me have no moral qualms with it and I like how it tastes I don't wanna be good but I thought maybe if I did a little bit I can at least try wise it makes a difference no I think the real thing to do is omnivorous diets and I think this is one of the things that we proved today in this conversation between Chris crusher and James Wilkes is that the omnivorous diet is like a natural healthy thing you can do a vegan diet though you can do it right according to everything he was showing me today and I believe this too if you're just doing it correctly if you monitor your nutrient levels you take you know vitamin b12 supplements just something he advocates I was like that makes sense to me but I don't believe that means bad for you I think that sedentary lifestyle shitty foods yeah you've been eating meat since the beginning of time yeah yeah this is how we became people literally one of the primary theories for why the human brain got so big so quick you had more access to protein because we're cooking things with fire and we learned how to hunt better because we our brains kept growing as we're just figuring out the throwing arm they think is a possible factor like somehow another the ability to throw something at something and tell it like made us my doctor some farther away that's a gates caves yeah bro we're so weak all compared to like animals yeah yeah an animal fuck us up so any any even a small ish animal focus I've seen will kick your fucking here just kicking it yeah yeah yeah I get it we need we need we need to leave some help these and weapons I wouldn't we were like though let me imagine going back and seeing what a person was like when we started becoming people fucking freaky with that baby like ciarán everything oh my god just real scared but like what would it be like to just hang out a tribe of Neanderthals and see what they were likely a different kind of person yeah I wonder if it would be I mean like mentally freeing your singularly focused on food and shelter and not you know I don't know if you have the your you know you know a lot of like the fucking worries that we have but it could be awful simple but at the same time the constant fear of starving and freezing to death that would be shit all that's bad we're gonna get there dude gonna end up in Waterworld pretty fuckin witch alright what future movie from the last 30 years do you think our current reality is the closest to matrix really the matrix because you were living in a simulation you think it's gotten so weird that it doesn't matter whether or not we're living in a simulation cuz life itself in reality itself is almost all augmented with some new factors like technology like that whenever the technology is that we're using to communicate with all these people stop check in here to say something cool what's new who's got a fucking new video I could watch to distract me for 15 seconds Oh who Bert and Tom are in a dance-off yeah look at this and you're just constantly looking at the goddamn thing yeah I am trying to I'm not doing well at it but I got a I've got a fucking get my phone out of my fucking hand that you know it's a good guilt shame er is that little status thing that's like oh you've been on your phone for five hours and change you know what they're like those who like the cigarette warnings to tell you're gonna get cancer you like somebody else not me yeah I'm not addicted to my phone I know I am I I feel like I am IH and I justified to myself sometimes by saying well I have a virtual job and I have to be doing this for work but like I think that's not true a lot of the time I think it's not true a lot of time I think it's good to definitely give yourself some distance and some time away from it but I also think it's fascinating because we I don't we don't know where this is going yeah we don't know what this is gonna be like in X amount of years from now it's really dangerous that these companies have so much control over the information that you see and that your news feed and someone's news feed on the other side of the country or whatever could be just so much different just you're literally looking at different facts it's fuckin crazy it is crazy this is very crazy I don't even know how you like how do you reconcile that unless like people voluntarily take responsibility is it fuck is it possible to decide that Facebook and Twitter and whatever are like public utilities well that's what people have proposed that we treat it like anything that you know that everybody kind of should have access to and we protected under the First Amendment yeah that's the idea I think that what's the net neutrality status right now today I know it was like getting fought back and forth did it end did it end up anywhere I don't know I remember when they used to have a terrorist like a caller yeah Orange yeah like Code Orange yeah we'd be all walking around like what are we are we encode orange or yellow to get to yellow yeah somebody had a bit about that was you I'm sure I did I remember bit someone I did about the code I don't think I ever put it on anything I don't know we had one I think there was a few comics that had a bit on that too that might have been part of the issue it was one of those things where everybody was like recognizing how ridiculous it was yeah it was we had codes we have the fire the fire code now here you know the abyss the code fuck can you give me a code of terrorist attack or no terrorist attack do about it actually you're getting me closer to a possible terrorist attack okay and you don't even have to tell me what's going on that's that's where it gets crazy when it when it goes from orange to red what do I do yeah what do you do they don't even come to Westside collect all our storage it's like a bunker oh they did design is it 312 yeah that's a good place to hide out in case it all goes down first sure I could see us bolting that store down and fuck fighting off zombies do you ever watch those zombie shows I am familiar I have stop look you know this is just violent porn right it's weird and then you start shopping for zombie apocalypse via is that even love with that Land Cruiser out there yeah it's all beautiful this article start thinking how would I fuck this zombie up what would I do if I was Rick I'll you know what I live I live down by the beach and so for me I get I'm like what am I gonna do when the tsunami comes oh that's I'm just waiting for what are you doing don't you know better the water I don't I'm actually waiting for like waves to just come straight there beachfront pasadena sun high-rise front row just wait yeah that's what the fuck happens then if your address doesn't exist anymore right right look we all know that they find these ancient civilizations but we do find I mean you don't find that you know they've never found it lay on us but they've found some pretty cool shit yeah in the ocean yeah do you ever see those things they found I think in the Bahamas it's like these stones that look like it looks like a passageway like cut stone cut into the ground yeah yeah yeah these gigantic stones looks like some sort of an underground passage or an underwater passageway it seems like I remember that I think at one point they were like probably entrances made of wood or something that you know have rotted away yeah underground stones yeah I don't know no did they identify that those did they think those man-made they think that they're man-made order or they're scientists that think that that's an answer isn't there there's a portion of that that is absolute that's it's called the mini wrote he wrote yeah so is that for sure man-made I could swear portions of it are same fuck though this I don't know I just reminded me of something I just heard recently that I did never it's never come up on here's from what I remember that there's like a Stonehenge type structure on the bottom of Lake Michigan that people found recently really what the fuck Joe some spirity radar just went off the mark I know ones I like - I don't like conspiracies about emptiness maybe Michigan's stone it look people are still alive that's pretty there's a lot of weird pictures I've seen of this try and look up to think that there's like a mastodon Carver I don't think that's the actual one whoa take someone to add it to this but that looks like it was done in spray paint in 2008 it's that but it I don't I just stumbled across this online while we were on bacon break last night and I was like what I've never heard of this I need to start using some of your guys keywords just start searching for shit I feel like my keywords are are narrow what I'm doing my my internet disliking time wasting and I'm I'm not getting the kind of results you guys are getting this book that I've been listening to it was so intense man the Indian what all makes me think about is like how all this shit must have been when it went down just a bloodiness of it oh my god horrific on both sides Oh horrific just terrifying stories of classic who recorded the stories people that survived people that wrote letters to their loved ones that you know they piece things together find out when it happened get their best story the best story they can get about like Custer's last stand and what he was like whoa dude that's 150 160 years ago yeah that's nothing my own but just happened oh it's real recent those fucking people were just like us we have iPhones exactly yeah those crazy people I think I might have told you this last time I was here I don't remember that I met Dick Van Dyke Show which was surreal and weird I think he's 92 but this the most surreal and weird thing he told me was that his grandmother shook Abraham Lincoln's hand oh my god so like that's you know what I mean the grandmother somebody alive right now I did tell you that I think they fucking amazed because I think it's just like possible and I think there's a president like the 8th or 10th President or something right that now that had like has like a living grandchild fuck yeah like had kids at 75 had kids at 75 it's it's fucking crazy that's not that long ago that's people just like us with none of the information that we have it's so recent yeah you know I've already O's lit lion gardener Tyler's senior two of his own children still alive so president Tyler has living grandchildren John Tyler 175 years ago I had a bid on my special my last special where I was talking about that the United States is founded in 1776 and people lived to be 100 they out three people of yeah yeah like we don't want to think of that yeah but that's really what it is yeah fuck all this generations talk that's confusing yeah how many people ago birth today it's not a lot they say a hundred years no tech yeah if you're gonna gauge it like a car what's your zero to 60 and 100 years from a hundred years ago yeah it's like people go it's fucking crazy with a foot that's like a full Elon Musk tank right cuz like if you burn it out you're not gonna live to be a hundred yeah but some people do get to be a hundred so still central miles on that fucking charge there's cars around now years ago yes and they work you can drive them yeah a friend of mine has many that you have fun actually dude it's um it's that's Oh a weird concept right yeah with you going from the horse to where we're at now in no 100 years is bananas in no time yeah yeah which is why I like you know I I believe like that like electric cars are awesome and they're cool and and I think that in places like really dense urban areas where where you have a significant number of them you get cleaner air and all that kind of stuff but I I just don't know if that's necessarily what our future requires because I think that like the big the big the big industries have have sort of done this well if everybody does our little part and we all buy an electric car and recycle we can solve this when it's really sort of like maybe a few less cargo ships would be a big difference maybe like guaranteeing stuff gets from China to you in 12 hours is not really what we need at the expense of our environment and if that's the I don't think you need to like you know have everybody needs to go buy an electric car I don't think that's really necessary well there's a lot of shit that needs to be done yeah like we got it whatever the fuck is going on in the ocean yeah we got to get people to feel about the whole ocean the way we feel about turtles and straw get that sentiment and apply it to all apply it to our neighbors applied to everyone you meet it's weird I think Americans have a really tough time taking care of communal shit yeah but I can't find a fucking plastic straw anymore I know it's amazing I know how quickly that happened the dude with the pliers I mean it's pulling out of the turtles nose and eventually comes out with all this blood and everything like that you need an ugly photograph of a cute animal to really make things happen but I walked I literally walked to the gym this morning and took from my house the gym I walk across the Venice canals yeah and I saw two birds scooters just in the canals just so it's like you know people just can't take care of their shit that's why you can't have like shared stuff no like the idea of these like shared kind of like pods I don't really think is gonna happen I think people shared pods socially yeah like like you know a lot it's not literal I mean with low on resource my lord e-report you know we're going to work in a pod Oh flying through the engine that I can makes the Jetsons noise know when you drive it it makes the boot really yeah it does make does it do it for you like it's a joke or does it make real noise no it does it out of the speakers as a way as a fun thing oh yeah yeah I feel like you can let it slide you know why because it's not pretending to be an engine no no not it makes it it makes an appropriate noise for the thing that it's doing it's kind of offensive if it made an engine noise you'd be like hey hey yeah stop although I think did anyone ever come out with Tesla come out what's the thing that would fate that would fake engine sound tracks while you're driving really I someone knows somebody came up with something that you can put in your car and it will play different engine sound tracks I think while you're driving Tiffany Haddish made her fucking car dance in what way the the Tesla has a feature oh where it opens the doors and she's the one with the Goldwing yeah yeah she plays music in the back of the comedy store and and and hits the the dances and steps out and she's danced in front of a card we're all dancing dancing from ativy how did you see that you know dancing for us that's the difference between Porsche and Tesla is like Tesla's it's like a meme machine it's like a phone that you're driving you know it's it's it's it's fun and it's silly and especially the Model X is a very optimistic representation of the future it was a pedestrian noisemakers yeah so that that's a different thing I think the take the Taikan doesn't really make any noise on the outside then it makes the noises on the inside if we're gonna have noise that makes on the outside it better be we better regulate that immediately because some dudes just gonna have screams just decide what noise their silent thing makes how the fuck should you say I sound like a Corvette hit a Chevy Volt that had two horns it had the on the steering wheel that are angry horn and then at the end of the blinker stalk it had this really polite like trill for like pedestrian for that with a bow like like a like a cat purring almost it was very polite it's just weird that we let people drive it's weird that we just we trust each other well here's you're on a highway and everybody's keeping it together it's your that we just all know to keep it together there's a there's a really interesting fallacy that that gets passed around a lot which is that humans are bad drivers and that's combined with another fallacy that driving is easy both of those are untrue humans are actually very good drivers and driving is very hard yeah and the problem is that humans are so easily distracted and we now have this device that is designed to distract us that's with us all the time - how often you look up on when you drive and you see someone on their phone on my shooter I'm when I'm riding my motorcycle around town that's all I do is I'm looking in mirrors and seeing who's not paying attention but Norton still rides a motorcycle about looking down watching people how crazy is that guy the key to riding a motorcycle in LA is to understand that is your job to be more prepared than everyone in a car I think I'm also a more attention mostly he rides in New York City yeah he he was a little more uh he wasn't as kind to riding in LA as I am I think riding in LA is not that scary and I think that because you can Lane split here it makes a big difference it's safe way safer to lane split yeah yeah way safer because most a car on motorcycle collisions are actually rear endings at lights people can't tell the difference between the bike in the car and they crunch them and so if your lane splitting you move to the front of the line in traffic and so you don't get those rear endings the problem with lane splitting is it's sometimes people look like they're gonna go and change lanes and look behind them and then when they look the motor side not so fast they're already there well you shouldn't be going that fast I'll be going that fast I've seen some guys that are doing some crazy shit I don't like splits like come on the law says 15 differential 15 between cars between your speed on the bike and cars oh well that's not real I mean that's law says yeah people accept them yeah yeah there's I saw some dudes the other day on the 4 or 5 that made me so nervous yeah crazy sport might be fun yeah crazy sport by people will be crazy sport by people but that thing if you can manage that thing one of those fucking your reality is so different than anybody else Yeah right if you really like 7 know that were very little very very very little I took some lessons but uh two people I know crashed and got hurt pretty bad and one of them was a dude who's fighting for the UFC his name is Frank Mir he was a UFC heavyweight champion dude who's got one of the best guards in the history of the sport arguably one of the best submission fighters of all time in the heavyweight division you know world champion still fighting or after the accident now his but he got hit by a car and got launched into the air man and he almost lost his leg he's a serious break yeah well if his car his leg got crunched in between car and motorcycle engine yachts that's really bad dude he's a gorilla he's a giant dude no it's a freak him it's gnarly man III motorcycling is a very is risky it's it's for me it's a pretty calculated risk I'm riding a little scooter when you write scooter versus a motorcycle you don't get that leg crunch thing actually and I you know it is what it is you just gotta you gotta have eyes up you got to be ready and you gotta be you know you can't like have a beer and then ride home you just you could feel it you can't do it I mean you shouldn't but even if you you know legally or what you still shouldn't do it and so it and also like I love love that I can't pick up the fucking phone mmm on that bite that half hour on my little scooter getting my way through traffic to wherever I'm going that's a nice break from the fucking phone and being able to just be in motion in LA and you know and you're just going even if you're going slow 10 miles an hour everyone around you stopped and you're moving that's the fucking luxury man that's what I'm about how about being moving when other people are stopped mmm that's for me that's what's up might be time to move my feet I'm like have to hire a crew your machine with all its giant building with all the cars in it and just get out of here before it blows up it's hard it's a hard dichotomy Ella if you wanna do the job I have LA is kind of where you need to be it's the spot right bro I you know I can get a press car I can get an 800 horsepower supercar press car in January if I want you can't do that and impact ends more cars in you I've reviewed over a thousand cars that is so crazy lot well that's why you developed all these oddball tastes that's why you have that wacky Porsche anterior I mean that's what all that comes from the kind of thing here this cars dude like I only have strange stuff I have my I did a fox I just got a Mustang I sold that I did I got a lot of money for it I gave half the money to charity oh that's we paid it we paid in animal shelters rent for a year oh that's a shout-out to Peters Impe fund if you want a kitten in the South Bay I just got me my wife just got a 1991 mitsubishi delica which is a Japanese import van and it's a turbo diesel it's a 4x4 and it's a six passenger it has like swiveling captains chairs and it's just the coolest thing ever there it is oh look at that and it is it's a it's like a space fan dude back in the day that was the shit yeah my twenty thousand kilometers on it it's like 22,000 miles and I'm using it as the airport shuttle for my for my job that's very like that's what we thought of as a car from the future in the ass space fan like if you were living in the 80s number one what I want to know what the fuck happened to custom vans brands are a new thing so now custom vans have gone two directions on the one direction you've got your the private jet vans right the Lexon II like you see fucking Tyrese rolling and rolling around right where they make it kind of look like a private jet interior with the sprinters and then you've got your Overland vans like your sports mobiles and your camping type rigs your off-roading rigs so they split they don't do the cool shag carpet let's fuck anymore was that there's a magazine called rolling heavy magazine that is a enthusiast magazine for that kind of man that's yeah vans are still they're cool with a certain subculture those Volkswagen synchros the 4x4 Volkswagen vans from the 80s yeah worth a ton of money like 50 grand yeah they're worth all money dude it's hilarious when they take those bugs those be those those this what is the station wagon the vote VW Bus yeah and they put Porsche engines and I ever seen them guys racing now yeah they put they take the old vans from the 60s and 70s that classic Volkswagen micro bus yeah and then you they basically graft on a Porsche floorplan do it with a Porsche engine which will fit Porsche suspension and they go fast as fuck do they race some things in Germany can you pull up anything of there you gonna see one of those at Hockenheim look the Stooges straighten look this guy's following a Ferrari down the front straight oh my god this guy's mobbing and he chopped the roof right he's he's lowered it if you can get some in-car video of one of these guys driving it's like bananas what a crazy little vehicle yeah there's other ones that are even even nuttier and oh there he goes close-ups they're just crazy the some of these Volkswagen guys oh wow he's really using the whole course they're good for him so that's a 900 530 horsepower Porsche 993 race taxi oh how cool he's got Gabriel glacis is what the fucking van enthusiast Jesus Christ Oh what are you doing fluffy well Fluffy's garage is fucking sick dude is Long Beach this is here how have we never heard of this bro this is a real thing this is a real thing wow he must have really loved these things growing up that's hysterical that is crazy how many does he have a lot all that orange and red it's probably that's cute if that's really nice I had no idea fluffy was a VW bus enthusiast oh we've got to get him in one of these strands that people that are into those are really really into those Seinfeld's got a few of them to come any has three million dollar boss collection well that is bananas yeah and you know they sell dogs like if you want like a the twenty one window they call it or the 23 window that's where it's got the extra windows on the roof they the total number of windows that normally is like 17 or whatever but the 21 windows the 23 windows are like a hundred to a hundred and fifty thousand dollars what yeah Wow just cuz they're rare and beautiful he has these things restore yeah you're a dr1 know worst fucking garbage so do you think he has everything stock or do you think office was used up I don't know I mean an enthusiast I didn't realize he was such see he was so serious about those but yeah she's got a nice variety of him he's got Jay driving JJ knows his shit man I had a real fun day hanging out with Jay doing his show he knows his shit yeah I did his show with my 1965 Corvette how does that thing work and I saw that sign I like the wheels you've got on right yeah yeah what are you driving the most these days just the Tesla yeah the Tesla does kind of eliminate a lot of other driving does another nonsense like why am i fucking around I know because it's just it's so easy I know it chills you out I know it makes you I mean there's something exciting about the roar of an engine right there's something about engines there's something really like something about it but there's also something about this sort of Zen yeah travel absolute was on absolutely your car doesn't make any noise yeah there's a Zen thing yeah I think he calms you down a little bit it does you get you're a little more relaxed when you get to where you're going and then inside and also a part of that is well a lot of that is just you don't really realize how harsh the vibration of an engine is until it's gone right you know and even of even a very smooth engine with a very smooth gearbox sends a lot of vibrations and jerkiness through the car and when it's gone especially with the Tesla we're driving with the one foot we're driving with one pedal so now it's like you go from wow I need to use three pedals and two feet and an arm to a finger and one foot you know you're physically doing a lot less but you used to say that you likes your Porsche to go to the comedy store because it like juiced you up yes they'll feel like that you know like I like something loud something that's just stupid yeah so I'm trying to get the zone yeah but it just gives you like a little bit of a just like a kickstart yeah you have to drive fast it's not about that it's about what it can do it's like you're taking it out for this like it just moves better moves around corners better its grips the road better it feels more more mechanic yeah my 911 is kind of like that but in it's actually got the the elements of like a baja truck also so you could just fucking smash speed bumps and like you know those weird transitions into driveways here that everybody hates in sports cars you're gonna take one an angle and all that yeah boom straight in on the power just kind of bounce it a little bit you could drive off a curbs and shit it is so fun it's all those things you love about your car but also the things you want in like a trophy truck Jesus Christ rules so great you should be a Salesman I am no I don't get kickbacks but but you should everybody should buy an off-road Porsche it's flat right larious yeah of all the recommendations a lot of people out there consumers you stay in school and get your shit together Jordan peterson says to clean your room dude you don't want to come at me for good consumer sorry Porsche you buy some stupid shit I only have stupid cars I love the fact you dump so much money to that Mustang because like that's the no no disrespect that's okay it's true is the second ugliest version it's it was kind of unique at the time yeah wasn't ugly in the UN Rutledge spent mad time talking shit about my muscle and it's just an odd choice cuz you you're a connoisseur of automobiles right like mum in my mind I'm like why wouldn't he get like a 68 Mustang I don't have a connection to those cars you know yeah I was I was I was born in 81 so I so to me the Mustangs of my youth were that was my car Larry Chen shot that photo doesn't um oh the car was beautiful man that was a beautiful car and I did dump a lot of money into it but I turned I got on the cover of Car Craft magazine I had a speech feature and speed hunters and I and I got all my money back out of it even after I gave half the money to charity no I got out of it pretty good it's fantastic and you deserve very Pedro it drove really nice to look at this the suspension like the way it sits rather the right of the fat wide tires the right stance those are awesome yes - what are those wheels the wheels are hree RS 105's which is a really popular wheel for the Ford GT they use this so that's probably the cheapest car they've ever been well zero side picture the wheels the retail for like 12 K they're really expensive yeah pretty yeah I mean I'm sure if Jenna Rogan wanted a deal we could probably get something worked out with HRT but so that car was so cool but you know after it was done like that picture you just saw is it done basically and once it was done I was like oh fuck man you know this thing handles so good and it looks so cool I could really use like 300 more horsepower like it was like it was like 300 horsepower 350 horsepower and it really needed to be like 600 and so I was at the point where I either was gonna spend two more years and 20 more thousand dollars and maybe I'd be happy with what I got at the end or it was just time to move on and at about the same time I drove Lee Keane is the name of the dude who built my Porsche and he builds and sells those mine is number fourteen of the cars he builds I drove his for a video and I just was so in love with it and I just said oh this is exactly the thing that I need in my life right now and so when I sold the Mustang I gave the money Elite even got a lifted 911 so I took that as your daily driver yeah why don't I love game combination with the scooter and the test cars I have but that's hilarious yeah you're number one squeeze yes Safari 911 from 1987 I didn't spend all that money to look at it you know yeah yeah yeah right if you if I spent all that money it has no collector value right it's just the value is what I get out of driving isn't it shocking when you open one of those old Porsches the heft to it the the surprising of solidness yes yes I mean those lows galvanized Porsche bodies from the 60s to the mid 90s are some of the finest built vehicles in terms of quality and engineering they're not expensive to maintain they can be annoying but as far as pure quality of engineering there's there's nothing better yeah that's probably the finest car in the world from a quality perspective through most of its life yeah the 964 is a really unusual one for me because that year was like they still kept the Frog eyes yeah but this is tension became more more lively a little bit more controllable but yet it still maintained a lot of the old feel yeah well at the time those cars if you go back to 92 when those cars came out or 91 and you read sort of the contemporary reviews of the car they were calling it old slow and heavy you know they said it was a solid feeling car but the Corvette zr1 was way faster and lighter you know what I mean and yeah and the Ferrari let's see that well the 348 was a piece of shit but the fuck hell's 92 some of the Japanese stuff the Supra the 300zx twin-turbo these were modern cars with with turbochargers and you know all this new cool shit and here was this sort of almost 911s really still sort of the same since the 60s you know and so that kind of dragged on but to revisit those cars now the fact that they were unchanged from the 60s to the mid 90s isn't it is a positive it's an endearing quality it's it's it's such a um they developed that body and chassis so thoroughly over those 30 years that it's such a finely engineered thing that you can take it and build something like a singer out of it a singer 911 it is as like I remember of their regular car right is as fast around Laguna Seca as a Ferrari four or five eight with no traction control and manually shifting yeah yeah I mean they've done wonders with those chassis z-- and they've really lightened them with carbon bodies and and so it is possible to take that chassis further it just would have cost Porsche Porsche lost so much money in the 90 student Porsche was really hanging on by a thread and they were losing money like crazy until Volkswagen have a group came in and that's where you ended up with the water-cooled cars the Boxster and then the Cayenne but in the 90s when they were doing the 99 3s from my night they were losing crazy amount of money on those cars Whelan yeah yeah it's a weird car right it's like they stuck with that crazy design for so long yeah it feels it feels old it feels like 25 years old than it really is and yes it is so finely made yeah so interesting right so with strange combination as opposed to something like that's our that's a 993 gt2 RS beautiful that's very nice that's a beautiful car so you know if you look at the passenger compartment the roofline the windshield the side windows of those car you know that's basically unchanged from the 70s to the to late nineties it's such a pretty shape mm-hmm it's just like some shape that people just gravitate towards and it's usually the really old ones there's something about an old one when you see him in person like if you see I've really nicely done like 71 long nose yeah there's something about the me like so much so light you know they they have the kind of airy about them I just I think you know of all the classic cars they are the most usable you know to just run around the city and drive you know you can drive a car from the 70s you know Magnus fucking drive that car oh you know yeah cars in the 70s like no problem you could do that dude Magnus had this car that he sold some rock and roll star Oh in England he had this silver with blue stripes and it was like a 69 I think I remember that car yup oh my god that car was a magic yang he's got he's got cool taste there's a video of him like driving it going around this corner you know that he had that video than they made about him yes a little short doctor but outlaw yeah and he comes around in this old-school silver Porsche and you look at he like yeah that's a whole different thing he's doing than everybody else and he's not even driving fast like you don't even have to drive fast that thing it weighs what is it weigh I mean 2500 pounds it's so like 80 and it doesn't have a lot of power yeah well one of the things I love about my car is with the lift on it and the tires you've got like less grip than a normal 911 so if nobody's around like I can slide entrance ramps like I can be a silly bastard in in that car and it's it's just extra fun look at this oh yeah that is the silver car with the blue yeah that's actually cool yeah even when you hear the engine it doesn't sound like anything else it's a weird little mechanical creature yeah because of a small displacement that's a 2 or a 2 or a 2 - you know it's not like this big bore 3/8 like you've got you know I've got a 3/2 which is a bit more of a Basie kind of tone yeah the older it's like really those ones are so 60s wonder little yeah damn but they're still pretty big inside like it's the same size inside as your car like you could get in it and drive it and it's like even those 356 is the really old Porsches in the 50s like those are actually kind of roomy like when you put that engine in the back get your feet can go pretty far forward yeah and the Germans are pretty big people - yeah one of the things with Porsche specifically is about tall people fit now they got barbarian DNA man right and the CEO Porsche for a very long time was six four and so that he demanded that's why Panamera looks like it does so that a six foot four person can fit in the back it's exactly that reason oh wow yeah what they do with the backseat of 911 so those are ridiculous are for kids yeah I don't I think that's an insurance thing I think by being a four-seater yeah I just don't have rear seats no I mean you could have a friend get in the back of your 911 for a couple of blocks yeah yeah it's possible but it's more like you just you know you throw your duffel bag back there or whatever it's just too tight it's too tight but the ones you buy don't have rear seats so what do you care you buy the RS is they don't have the rear seats Wow when if I Drive like one of those cars especially the older ones like um you know like nine six fold huh I'd like the most stripped down yeah that's what I like yeah yeah it makes sense the malt like I don't want a radio I don't want I like a radio I don't want air conditioning nothing I use my car every day and so I have a radio conditioning but yeah I know you mean but a car like that yeah like a little ride yeah it's like you're taking a ride more than it is like you're driving no driving is the thing yeah that's what you're doing you're driving yeah that's my Lamborghini I treat like that when I when I I don't take that to do bullshit when I go out and drive that car like that is my activity yeah so like you got like Magnus he's experiencing you know what a normal person experience is when they're enjoying the pleasure of driving but he's getting they way more analogue way more superlight car if it's all ancient fucking tech looks like cars are real easy to drive though and you've got a little engine you could give a light clutch you can have a light shifter you don't need you know the more power you've got the heavier duty everything needs to be and so when you dial that stuff back in the cars 2,000 pounds and the engine is only 200 horsepower you can just fingertip the whole thing it's very easy yeah my friend Todd said this to me is a very wise thing said it doesn't matter how fast you're going just matter how fast it feels totally who's talking about like old nine eleven thousand percent a thousand percent it's wise wise like it's a wise perspective because you go yeah have you just enjoying the car like you're supposed to get maximum enjoyment like it doesn't have to be attached to a number correct like if you didn't know how fast we're going you weren't looking at your car other than for the purposes of safety yeah yeah you weren't like it wasn't a dick contest there'd be a certain level you wouldn't want to drive at I believe in knowing the speeds like for me personally yeah like my my cars have fairly low low power like they're not crazy huge power cars like and I think beyond a certain point I just can't use it anymore and so I think there's an argument for having something like a Tesla for every day and then having an engaging machine for the weekend one of my favorite videos that you ever did was that and is it was a BB I that did Oh Joey C Lee's car yeah no that cars for sale is it really hope you want it that's a lovely car it is for sale was called project nasty I think he got it down to maybe twenty two hundred pounds it was though it's the lightest 964 I ever drove but it was so light you know a headliner yeah no not my medal inside of it and everything I remember watching it go and look at that thing yeah but that's we said that was really interesting was that this is the kind of car you build when you you know you make cars for other people yeah yeah you want to build something for yourself you build something that most folks kind of is that companies known for like these really high-end like custom yells of poor and they make crazy fast things dude you can buy I mean you get you can write a check right now you could just write a check walk away come back in two months and have like a 1500 horsepower Nidal that's because these guys you know these guys race runways out here now that's like the thing now is run runway racing so they go out and they go side by side half mile and they're doing like 220 230 and a half mile you ever see that video I'm sure you have of the guy in the GTR and the Nurburgring and just catches air oh yeah that's fucking terrifying you should go Drive at Nurburgring would you a guy fly yeah but you wouldn't fly through the air you wouldn't fly you would drive the Nurburgring a more normal car that doesn't fly yeah I would drive something and by the way after that they'd they read sculpted that section of track really yes they they for a period of time they imposed a speed limit even during races yeah through that section to prevent that from happening again they changed I believe the rules of the racing series to slow the cars down and then I believe they Reese Culp did the track there as well after that incident so you couldn't catch hair like that or at least to make it substantially less likely yeah that fucking cars catching here is a you gooseneck in your next internet dive goof go Google racecar racecar sketch no attempt to look for that but end up with people are going so fast and people lose it all the time dude it's it's such a fun scary crazy place it's every every reputation that it every bit of reputation it's earned it deserves and it's but you got to doing it is like one of the more unique experience of your life and you don't have to like you know like you said you don't have to go for time you can just go and drive it as a fast fun Road which is what I've done as Americans we should be ashamed that the Germans have the Nurburgring I mean Hitler built it if we want to really be really I mean he didn't physically lay the asphalt but it was a Hitler it was a Fourth Reich superiority thing right alongside the Autobahn sus racetracks best race cars best highways as part of their deal Wow that makes sense there's so much engineering that came out of that group of fucking psychos yeah which I read a book love called blitzed drugs in the Third Reich that was basically just about how much meth they were all on and it is nuts of course yeah of course yeah dude even on speed forever soon as he figured out speed people were on speed oh and they're giving it to the pilots and his soldiers antler had a speed probably was doing speed balls like fuckin John Belushi I mean it was it was crazy yeah there was there was theorized that they had given the Japanese and feta means to get him to crash into the plane yeah crashed their planes into the boats rather yeah kamikazes yeah that was a thought like totally believable met them up in VA Larkin said about the war there's a story in this book about there at the very end of the war where they invented these single-person submarines basically just a floating coffin and they sent these people out with like ten tablets of meth and nothing else and this little submarine that had a little gun and like none of them came back to I just can't not that I have sympathy for Nazis but messed up soldiers and death submarines maybe a little bit is that what it was that little thing I don't think it worked I think of this they tried a bunch of times and it fucking sketchy oh my god yeah it's it doesn't how much sketchier than that there's the little German one man thing yes that's it it the picture I saw had the bubble somewhere in Colombia there's a dude with a thousand pounds of coke just got a great video where they had the Coast Guard knocked on the submarine they had a cartel sub maybe something I just knocked it said open up was it the Coast Guard they've got guys yeah they're like open the literally knocking I literally did they open up yeah they jumped on top of a goddamn submarine and made the guys open the pulse open the sides that's right out of a goddamn Steven Seagal money it's crazy that's it's so duds they jump on top of the roof of this fucking submarine holy shit look at this yeah see so they're chasing them they're screaming oh my god yo this is the great shit ever toad dude how crazy is this 25 foot long sub yeah so these guys are following behind it he jumps off we this bad motherfucker so which I think all I think this sub is capable of full submerging or this is this closest to sub that it gets rightful but I can't go down like a hundred feet but maybe I wholly fucking shit this dude straight up nozzle azure they that's so crazy I think I need your search terms you are finding way better things than me on the internet well who who is you know look who has taken subs and filling them up with coke they're built built dudes are doing that they had that whole big ship in Philadelphia that cargo ship that was supposedly owned by Chase but like had 200 or 400 million dollars worth of cocaine really there was what the dad car the paris - dakar rally is it's a car race like cars like my safari or like built for that right and it's a there's these you know there's race cars and there's race motorcycles and quads and stuff off-road vehicles that is very long off-road race and then there's these support trucks right and they race the trucks - so it's like these like commas and like man trucks big off-road tires huge engines and they're the trucks are in the race and so these coke smugglers the trucks the bet in the back of the truck is enough parts to like rebuild the whole car and the truck has a racing driver and a five mechanic screw and they chase the car if the car breaks they fucking pulled over and set up a shop and rebuild the car right but they're in the race too and so these coke smugglers bought one of these DAC car race trucks did it up like the livery and just like a couple miles after the start just like entered the race with his truck full blow oh and they got stopped like I don't know somewhere in the race they got arrested with this race truck what is this Jamie's no Chapo's that's al Johnson 13,000 tons of cooking 13,000 pounds I'm sorry that's like seven and a half ton but wow that is crazy my god 30,000 pounds Jesus this one was in Europe it had a hundred million pounds worth oh my god these guys lose not building in there yeah reminds me that was that movie with Ray Liotta no escape they built the sub Ray Liotta and Kevin Dillon and then shit no yeah what was that movie no I think was no escape when they're on the prison island and they get this thing fill the sub can they still make movies like that I just saw I've seen some good movies you see Ford versus Ferrari fortress Ferraris good I bet it's good it's good it's mostly factual it's not it's not entirely perfect but it's like more accurate than like Bohemian Rhapsody do you remember LeMans Steve McQueen yes remember when he was driving in the beginning and that's old ass Porsche yes that was exactly what we're talking about yeah I was a race car driver who's the car drives around is that old 911 that car sold for a lot of money oh the movie it did that much do you like limo the movie um I don't remember it enough there's like no speaking for like the first night engineer yeah I think it's beautiful because it's like it really puts you in the mood of what it's like to be these people without without saying too much then we do that in movies back that man you know yeah they're really slow pacing kind of quiet sort of pensive thing you know you should go and watch if you haven't seen it before watch again The Hustler never seen it Jackie Gleason and Paul Newman I said it's amazing it's amazing for what reason it's just it's a fuck first of all it's it's in the 1960s like early 1960s and you're seeing like this part of America because this is filmed representing the time in which it took place it's not like they were doing a period movie mm-hmm so this is like 1960s like early 1960s cars and the way they talk and the way they drink and it's about this guy as a professional pool hustler who's been traveling from California to New York City to meet this guy the Minnesota Fats and playing because this guy's the best pool player in the world and so they play all through the night it's a sauna it was at Robert Rosen is that the said Robert you said Robert Rosa's yeah it's based on a very you say Paula new rain is in this yes that's Paul Newman fuck it is look at that and Paul Newman plays Fast Eddie Felson he plays the baddest motherfucker in pool it wants to come and play Minnesota Fats Minnesota Fats is Jackie this guy and he's amazing he's so amazing he's got two flowers on his jacket bro that's a hankie rather had multiple pool movies well this was the original and so with the color of money with Tom Cruise was was Fast Eddie who was again Paul Newman getting back into the world of pool was the end of this movie spoiler alerts from the 1960s attires movie he retires he comes back it's the same character okay I've seen yeah i've seen color money but you know you're picking him up again now when he's 60 that's hilarious yeah this young kid is talking shit and he doesn't understand that because he's a really hot pool player today but he doesn't understand that this guy in front of him is a legend yeah the name of his bully was known was the Balabushka yeah well thank you that he had and those because of this movie this movie in particular that because they didn't mention in the first movie but it was pretty clear they're playing with a Balabushka this movie that fucking queue is worth a shitload of money yeah like there's a lot of like great pool cue manufacturers from that era like I know you like like crafts I do totally in the world of pool it's all about cues it's all about like the the type of hit you want the type of we're waiting and the yeah and bowel bushes have a very specific kind of hits a very it's like there's an old-school feel to it that a lot of the players that when playing like most of life love companies so around know if you're buying one now you're playing it's gonna be a shitload of money man so at this point it's an art piece would you play with it if you have some people do some people do it's like a badge of honor you know you show up at a pool hall with a pal but it's not necessarily the best playing it's like that's like got like shotguns you know what I mean it's been the art pieces and the vintage II stuff there's one right there for 20 2002 but moving on that let me see what that looks like yeah that looks is that it oh it's got the string on it as the original Courtland rap and all that those inlays that's my pearl yeah that was all done by I Rea down at the bottom right no I don't think so I think that's this there's a type of that might be ivory actually as if it's old enough that's probably might be ivory it might be ivory you might be right 22 Jade's they would use a plastic down there cuz he wanted something to be durable yeah sit on the ground or whatever and they all used um ivory that came from the the pre-banned days cuz back then when they were making these things people could go over there and shoot elephants just for their tusks that's a many points mmm what's it saying Deba nice gold bands racetrack mop what is that a nameplate okay racetrack mop nameplate that's blank between I don't know you lost me but that's pretty cool between the mop dots and the diamonds original Cortland Matt mostly fallen off to original George Balabushka shafts unusual for the person dancing oh yeah well they've had a bunch of those like that where people would buy them they would order them and heating grave their name in it yeah yeah sounds like a very shotgun like thing shotguns are like Eric tur from the would you have no you go over there and you choose your wood and scrollwork and the barrel work and all that crazy she's a good friend of mine makes pool cubes is they're called sugar tree uh-huh and his name's Eric crisp but he makes them all by hand I'll show to you afterwards I'll let you sure you've got like a dozen of them out here right it's his his the way he makes things is like super specific like he's like ah he's an art connoisseur if wood was an art huh so like when he looks at like a piece of wood he he doesn't think it's like a combination of knowing it'll make a good pool cue but also wanted it to look a specific but they have all these gnarly knots in a weird kind of colors of the woods and just finds which interesting green check out it's the just like gums yeah thing was a sex school Balabushka pool cues were reintroduced in the 1980s with their permission yeah but that's not real yeah once the movie came out someone asked if the correlation said yeah yeah it's it's what happened was there was a company this it's a it's a decent queue but it's not like you know the of reels like a Shelby Cobra right you can buy a raffle bra but the real one even like the way that one plays better I mean there's people that like the way all kinds of different things play might play better than there but it's not you call it a Balabushka Babu she's got to make him he's got people uh same thing Cobras you know that you could I'm brand new replica Shelby Cobra will probably drive a lot better than the ones they were racing at long sixties but one is 50 grand and one is a million yeah as one is real and to be honest that wouldn't mean I wouldn't buy a one of those newer Balabushka either if I wanted a cue to play with no they all please you know what you're getting it's real yeah yeah the thing with cues is like with a lot of things it's like you if you see a pool cue like it doesn't even necessarily have to be anything fancy it's just you see like the with if it's got nice wood and nice balance to it and you kinda look at this like oh yeah you look at you know somebody's made that by hand most likely something like crafted that on a lathe and with notches to you know that the difference between a $500 watch and a $5,000 watch and a $50,000 watch and a 500,000 dollar watch it's just further and further into the details that one watch that was good for 400 years that's it man yes there's and there's other ones like that I have a hard time with that yeah I'm having a crazy math machines I love I love the crazy math machines there's watches at play chimes there's watches that where you you you hit a button and like a thing like dances like a cuckoo clock there's like all kinds of crazy people do kilos yeah there's a genre of porno watches to be seen the porno watches where it's literally you hit a button and people like start banging you like on the yeah no I mean yeah no no it's a mechanical animatronic couple starts fucking on the dial Oh it's kind of hilarious thank you but it's an entire genre of watching their very very expensive very hard to Google that what's that one I saw this one guy had one that was like a dome and inside his own a planet yeah yeah that's called a Jacob astronomy ax and so any member who wears that like you got the they're a million dollars it's gonna be some kind of pimp a planetarium one yeah remember Jacob the jeweler that's him this is us this is the universe you can't wear one of those and have people look at you without you be you're being a little crazy so the astronomy it's it's like a fishbowl you put on your fucking wrist it's the weirdest thing ever and it's designed so that's the mechanism that rotates around the fishbowl and it's got something called the thing that's flipping about is called at or beyond and that is the time regulating mechanism and the mainspring which keeps it wound and then as you can see that the actual clock itself rotates and stays vertical and then you've got this earth thing and then you've got this this big diamond that spin around and it's it's a huge thing you wearing your wrist it's probably 48 or 49 millimeters and it's it's like putting a fishbowl on your wrist because it's got a big glass like case over it that is so cool so that's yeah that's what one looks like in person that is so crazy look at this a million dollars so this one is showing is the roulette wheel one no it's got a roulette wheel in it that actually works oh my you wind it up and it sends a ball and you actually can play roulette on the watch dance it's called the astronomy a casino yeah batshit right imagine you lose your house now look this one's an animated one it's an oil derrick that pumps home so when they spin it like I'm sure he'll show it but look yeah the oil do so did somebody design this because they owned an oil company certain that that is what had it made yeah oh my god that's amazing yeah how much you think it cost me it's probably a million dollars yeah it's gross - it wouldn't want touch no it's not cause you don't want to wear something like that no it's like why are you getting it that's crazy I don't know why wouldn't get it but like if you I don't know why you'd get it you have to really appreciate the art of it look I'm just going down there there oh it's a hoot man floating it's cool I mean that you know there's another company called MB and F which is not as kind of dumb for lack of a better word it's less just a little less flashy and it looks like a fucking Rocketeer Trekkie space communicator but it's all mechanical it's called MB and ampersand F and they come out like people are doing some real creative shit Joe oh they really are like that's the kind of shit that made 10 Kaczynski move to the woods we've done the Unabomber I knew where all this is going these people can't leave anything alone they have to innovate on everything what's really okay is that it's look it makes our life way more interesting but there's worse things than innovating in a mechanical timepiece oh no it's amazing so that's this is MV n F this is where these those two domes sort of spin around they make of a couple different like crazy one but god that's beautiful yeah so they have these sort of real spacy kind of alien device type watches there I mean they're very expensive but they're very nice 40 G's just let me see that again that's so pretty the one with the four is really crazy - what is that yeah just that so you can see on the left is the hour and the right is the minute that's like a scale the old timey scale at grandpa's house that one this is my jam that's this that's the Space Jam right there is that it's just crazy fucking watchmaking dude here's that yeah it's back that up the one what is that what's of that one the that you see the bottom left I have a phone if you want another time yeah this shit ain't for tell at the time bro this is for telling everybody that you run shit that is the craziest thing to have on your body right a house on your body so in this one this one the entire clock moves around the diamond course it does you know why wouldn't it why wouldn't it of course it does spin bitch I mean you know it's it's all real crazy the round one is very queen that was that the concentric one yeah the clocks that looks like a UFO that one of the right-hand side that you just had that you just had Jamie what is it this no no the one the blue ones are blue one that you just had yeah that's concentric rings is that it's the rings are concentric so you see the line on the bottom so it's 552 is the time there or 452 excuse me for the center's no squirrel in the center is the tour beyond that's the mechanism that powers it there's other watches have you ever heard of an hyt watch no hyt watches are fucking nuts because they are lik they're powered by bellows and liquid so they tell the time yeah give me one where you can see some of the liquids so much I don't study this shit wait no that's not a good picture James I want to show the liquid specifically so that one right there that yeah we did so yeah yeah so the liquid fills up and moves around the face as the time goes and these bellows move so you see the bellows in the middle there it's pumping the liquid around the fucking clock like you've shown that maybe before enough that wasn't seem familiar with us yeah yeah the liquid one so those are like 40 50 60 thousand dollars that's true that's getting real crazy solution that's such crazy ballin that's call 72 G's that's call ones pretty goddamn dope house actual rose is sponsored by this company I was an angry rock and roll guy perfect not saying that Axl is but you know got angry style that's a perfect thing yeah all right yep Axl Rose hailer like you know saying some people couldn't like takes a certain type yeah but if you wanted to get into some really next-level weirdness that's a good that's a good way to do what is that what's that be a ps2 wrist drive scubapro that's a that's a dive computer oh fuck you would have a give you oh yeah that's that that one right there is another DNF legacy machine perpetual so this round one right on to one to the right Jamie that I think makes me feel the same as reverse Alex Honnold that's what diving I feel to say I'm like yeah up yeah this one does the the same shit as the first one I showed you it counts the date and stuff for like four hundred years but it just does it in a prettier crazier way oh my god that's so beautiful yeah that's see this is what I'm fascinated by that somebody and some group of people obviously saw like one wizard and they're doing it at multiple companies all around the world yeah and they're innovating and they're competing with each other to make cooler and weirder shit yeah and all this stuff is like I guess it's a watch but it's way more than just a watch like that thing up sorry Jamie go back to that one that was that weird spaceship one that was yeah the one right there right yeah right there that one let space communicator wow that is so crazy yeah that thing yeah that's not really a watch this one's cool it's mechanical but it's it's but you read it from the side like that it's very very space communicator yeah it's cool it's something different it's I mean what it's like it's like the night it's like that singer DLS right they take this old the old way and they evolved the old way as far as they can so these guys have do this amazing materials like really interesting alloys they make for stuff they a lot of these companies make their own alloys which is really interesting look at this thing what is that it's like a looks like what we thought a spaceship was gonna look like in the 1950s yeah and it's a watch yeah doesn't that that kind of looks at its power yeah it's like movie The Rocketeer it reminds me of the rocketeers rocket yes yes yes it's totally like that's yeah oh my like you know how Ellen's only seen space balls like this dudes only seen The Rocketeer that's so beautiful yeah so this it's incredible dude I knew if you most people will think you're a weirdo for wearing it but if you wore something like this to like a watch nerds gathering Oh Mike don't think you're the king of the universe you walk in some like this going to a watch nerd gather pass there's a grand Seiko party they announced the new watch ah this is the Godzilla watch it Godzilla watch so I don't really like car watch Co brands I think the connection is obvious enough you don't need to shove it in my face but I'm still gonna go to the party it's a car watch Cobra Godzilla is the Nissan GTR not the movie monster so it's across branding with the Nissan GTR and I got confused I thought it was like an anniversary thing for Godzilla I think it's the Nissan GTR oh so that Godzilla that Godzilla oh well it looks dope it does look - oh wait it might actually be the movie Godzilla at the anniversary maybe it is this fucking 64th anniversary they came out with a GTR watch like months ago so maybe I just know news you you did I remember the GTR watch was like a chronograph yeah yeah it's like a bunch of different well yeah that's what I get for not this is doing my homework I guess it is the movie monster anniversary my bad it looks like it's uh like a dinosaur skin yeah the leather skin yeah there's see that one that you'd see our 50th that was like a couple months ago so sorry they're manufacturing they're finished quality's amazing let me see that Godzilla thing again did you do the thing I told you about the reflections on the back of the hands not yet so grand Seiko leave it there finishing on the back of the hands as good as the finishing on the front of the hands and if you reflect the light certainly certain ways you can get it to reflect on the dial it's really cool the thing looks work it yeah they make it nice watch well they have really pretty design and whoever is designing their stuff it's very that's a weird thing about like watches or anything that someone makes it's like what what appeals to the I like that that TGT Studios clocks see that thing right aside like that's awesome yeah it's something it appeals to the eye it's an piece of art that also tells you the time but there's something about it like the way it's shaped the way it's formed yeah it makes you want to look at it it's answers well the really the very best watches yeah just stare you just stare at them sometimes like your watch I love is your Spring Drive yes yes so the Spring Drive with the super standing I mean you don't know where it'd be diving to we're not a dive you know no shit hits the fan I wanna prove watch no you just get you get your shit wet all the time probably right between the tanks and the sweating and the washing your hands and whatever it's definitely gonna get wet occasional yeah I mean it's a dive watch isn't for people who dive it's for people who just get their hands wet tell it to a diver they want to piss in your mouth right now fuck you bro I'm a diver I'm a scuba diving instructor are you really yeah you teach people like I can I did in my early 20s well then you get how I do this what's uh it's they gave me a diver pass yeah all right I'm good Shazam i absolve you dude I'm terrified of the ocean why getting in that water with all those things better than you yeah but most of them don't care about you all most of them you're just talking Adam keyword and yeah yeah most yeah I did I went to the Galapagos over this year and I did saw hammerhead sharks while snorkeling was nothing cuter than a baby hammerhead like this big really amazing like a footlong it was a cutest thing ever but like yeah I can see how the ocean is big and dark and scary dude it's terrifying yeah I know I guess I still get a little nervous when I go in the ocean you should be in there though you know I know this is what I always say about sharks if there was a werewolf and the werewolf came out every full moon yeah every full moon if you were outside your house you got murdered you just got ripped apart it happened to one person every full moon all across the land yeah people would be like fuck man I'm not going out on a full moon okay sharks are like werewolves but they're werewolves every day of the year I don't think shark attacks are that comment because they don't they don't see you and you're not supposed to be there so they're not accustomed to you if they were accustomed to you like if we lived in the water with sharks do you think the moral duty that sharks have to be good neighbors who keep them from eating us if we were like just everywhere in the water all the time as sharks figured it out you'll be like oh we could just eat them eat them they just they're just dumb they don't know they're supposed to eat us they have a look an arrow thing in their eye of what they're supposed to be yeah they don't I don't think they like us I don't think they want to eat us they're just not accustomed to it you know their their focus is slipped when they bite people don't they spit them out a lot they rarely finish a human you see them they take a limb they don't finish a human I saw jaws dude in Johnson finish people and I was also like fucking license plates and shit remember oh yeah buddy trash you know yeah you're assholes they eat everything yeah but they probably wouldn't eat to license plates in a row I don't think they think I think it is eating machines there's no I don't cattle it already better but I don't think there's any evidence that sharks it like Wizards they're more clever like dolphins are clever as fuck or cuz they're glad we know sharks just cease murders just with a continual roll of teeth yeah the teeth fall out new one pops in bang like a rotor but I don't go diving where there's fucking date [Applause] neighborhood they can just decide to go to your neighborhood it's like if you were camping fuck up a few days anyway and out there in that campground wolves were tearing open fucking tents and pulling people out eating them alive would you feel like well they never come up here stay there literally shoving that shark there feeding that shark to ravage it's a real thing dude they brought in a werewolf this is what I'm saying doesn't matter look if you had a fucking cage and he could put you in the middle of the woods and your friend ties a lamb to the outside of the cage so you could see the werewolf in real life and it looks like American well in London that's I know that's no fucking shark-diving what do you want from me stay on the ocean please do me a favor I like the ocean look at those teeth I know I'm so scared for you you know I go what about Joe don't you go walk what about mountain lions you can walk I'm trying to pretend that I'd be able to stab some mountain lion and get it off I mean I die for the knife my dog tried to make friends at the mountain lion he's so nice you know what he barks at Claire it's the only thing you barks at is what bark said when people have a Santa Claus on their driveway what the fuck is that normal thing for him to say glowing we're walking and I take him to the trail and I open up the back to let him out he jumps out onto the sidewalk and looks at this guys fucking this guy's fake snowman it starts barking just some fucking thing yeah it's not really a person and then he just runs up the hill I got kittens a couple months ago and one of them didn't just learned that he was fighting himself in the mirror it's really fun 20 minutes all make your that out and they chase their own tail is they doing genuinely hilarious yeah there's something about watching a kitten just spin around their own tail they're dumb as fuck but they're so fun it's such a little drug it's so enjoying getting to watch a kitten just spin around oh dude I don't watch TV I have four cats in my house and all I do is like what are the cats doing and just watch what other cats are doing it's it's constantly entertaining do you know this the video with the cat and the two crows or the cat these two cats excuse me the crow and the two cats where this crow instigates a fight between these two cats no awesome lands on the roof like real close to a cat he's like what and the cat like moves out and he flies away real quick and he comes back and then he flies over to the other roof goes to a no this is a different one where they're doing and he starts and he causes the two cats to fight each other that's amazing they fuck with the cats and they get him close advice and fight I say you're done king of bird yes they do it all the time they like doing it sad instigator funny so there's this one they literally pick on them and get them worked up so they'll fuck up the other cat bro that's so funny and with these cats were on the roof they were on this just probably a hundred of these videos they're really clever you've seen like the videos over if you're talking about this is not coming up you've seen the videos of crows it's a crows or Ravens that can use tools they can use tools wait can I even question yeah I know this is a really interesting topic but what is the legal thing with playing a clip from YouTube's podcast we can't nobody's looking at that they're seeing us we can't use those that's why I got it cuz it's alright though you can't use other people's shit they'll take you down I completely understand but in in my show I sometimes show images in the feed and so I was wondering if you were doing I don't know we'll try to claim you images I go I'll give websites crazy I want to promote the website yeah but if you have like someone else's stuff on your feed crows using compound tools what is a compound tool like took two things and made it a better tool oh shit dude they don't were fucked they figured out at one point in time how to take one tool and use it to get a second tool it was bigger and use that second tool to get food so they figured out using a tool to get a tool yeah yeah who's a tool but now they figure I had a make tools bitch connecting things together son that's bonkers there's a solution and we do something we started that two monkeys back in the day we you know we figured out a compound tool as much as I love cats cats are those little fuckers are sneaky to pick fights I had a cat that could open doors which was a witch resistant yeah you ever get the cat jumped in this is the one this is the one so they get it off go right to the beginning because in the beginning you see that no the beginning the crows on the roof with them fucking with them see the very beginning of it's okay no that's how he just played from there so the crows let's see how the crow takes off yeah he was fucking with them and then he flies over to the other one let's see he's like what's up bitch what do you know with this fucking pussy hang out over here on this roof right next yeah fun and he starts like getting close to him and rile him up and flying away when the cat gets close and then he goes back again to the other cat it fucks with him he gets him riled up and then he flies away and he goes back to the other cat and he flies away and he keeps doing it until they just they're on edge because he's a little cut yeah yeah sweetheart and then the cats are looking at each other so he starts fucking with the cats and other cats get more and more angry like he's starting the show which while he's actually pushing the cat towards other holy shit that's crazy dude he made that honking bird is just over here like in the snow bro this bird is having a good time oh that bird is evil so evil that bird is having his own kitty cat fights to the death oh my God look at these guys going down a hole oh shit bro you should just be commentating this shit this is a fucking crazy is awesome my cat Conrad my 15 year old boy chased a fucking stray out of our yard yesterday like a boss cats are sneaky man they're smart little fuckers and they carry some creepy diseases maybe they're paying him back for killing all their friends could be right 8 million Birds a year oh yeah billion oh dude my cats got some heads up yeah well they said that they didn't have any idea I remember what the number was I don't excuse me I don't remember what the number was but it's in the billions and they were stunned they had no idea they ran some sort of a scientific study and using the study they examined all of them good dude oh good a tweet turns out I fucked this up you didn't this was taken in Northridge a week ago what is this about inline on someone's roll fucking hell dude like there's two of them why Northridge two on the roof at the same time oh my god it's so hard kids hide your wife yeah well they're looking for dogs and cats one of the things they found out when they killed them in San Francisco and the Bay Area they have they have real problems up there sometimes go especially some of those homes that like like sort of like like we have Malibu with the mountain lions live real yeah close proximity with the people so they do these stomach examinations they find it's like half dogs and cats well the cat that I said that could open doors and shit he wanted nothing more to than to kill montemagno my other cats he was a Russian blue had three legs and he was really really smart we adopted him and um we tried for like six months to make it work we tried everything everything you could think of to make brought a criminal into your home exactly and I didn't know and we had to we rehomed him with my brother-in-law and his wife and he like got along with the dog and was having the best time and showed me he thought he fucking ran shit he thought he owned the neighborhood and he ended up getting eaten by a mountain lion yeah yeah three legs versus a mountain lion Morgan smartest fastest three legged animal you've ever seen but fucking yeah and mountain lion one maybe he's a little cocky for his own good a thousand percent he thought he ran shit that's hilarious imagine the moment when you realize that that's a giant you jack most animals and then you realize oh my god this is a hundred and forty on me yeah fuck hey it was never seen again bro we're so weird that we let those things that's wander around us we're so weird I always think it's really strange that I live with another species in my house I think about that very often I mean mountain lion oh yeah it's supposed to watch like externa Holocaust and killing them all genocide I don't I don't have a key I don't think they'll get me wrong without advocate that I don't think we should kill them all I'm saying is it's really interesting that we have this thing that we sort of agree rarely rarely kills people but it does sometimes and we want to keep it around it sounds an awful lot like the Sharks bro and that they're running out of shit to eat you know if we're gonna have a yeah thing listen well the last time you saw a deer I mean fairly recently but but but not often it's here it's pretty rare yeah even if you live where deer are like I used to growing up in the suburbs of New York I used to see deer like daily do you think deer on the pill thanks going I've lived in a city and I haven't paid attention to the deer in the suburb but I'll tell you what's what's happened man cats Oh they've moved in and start jacking deer and coyotes we didn't start jacking deer and the hats are fucking up deer big cats Bobcats are fucking up deer oh everybody's fucking up the Fonz everybody's fucking right babies yeah yeah when the babies are born they have zero chance these big fucking sons big wild dogs the Coyotes everywhere just California side of LA mostly around us if you go to like Iowa they they have too many deer like you'll be driving why water hunting deer not mountain lion well you can't hunt mountain lion in California they don't have is there a pretty predatory cat that you can't bet you should hunt I mean I don't know you can give that well see the thing is like the the people think that you need to control their population that's where the argument is it gets real interesting because it branches off between people that are very much animal advocates animal rights first they want animals to rule and to be able to have their own freedom on their land yeah and just whatever happens happens like mountain lions killing deer and all that kind of stuff and let it all take place and we shouldn't interfere with that and we shouldn't hunt there's people that really think like that and you know they have their arguments and they have their the reasons but the reality of animals is if you have large predators and the large predators runs out of things to eat it's either going to go further and enter into new areas looking for food and it might get hit by cars or it's gonna branch out sorry expand it's gonna expand its range and in expanding its range it's gonna find a farm or it's gonna find a dog in the backyard it's gonna find something because it's just trying to get food and like how many of those are we willing to have around us yeah like I'm not saying that we should kill mountain lions I think it's wonderful if dangered now not really so why can't we tell them in my children okay well California doesn't it yeah well count the only time California kills them really is when they get what's called a depredation order like um if someone has something happened like if you run a farm and a mountain lion starts killing your livestock which does happen yeah a lady in Malibu a few years back had a I think it was in our pocket form and this fucking mountain lion killed like a ton of them it was just killing them they seemed easy to kill though I think it killed a goat too I think it was just getting a kick out of killing things you know it was just fun and but they said it wasn't even eating him which is really nuts that's strange I think he couldn't get it out you know a really big animal he couldn't get it out he probably didn't feel comfortable enough to eat it while he's in there so he's probably wrong he killed them all at once oh well I think it was over a couple of days but it was a kind of a killing spree man it's like we just killed for fun first of all when you think about mal but do you really think about an alpaca farm no well no I think of that in Topanga by the way over Topanga yes someone it seems is building a house that's like a dome that they're gonna put dirt over did you see this it's up at the top of the hill and Topanga facing the beach and yeah like okay so picture a facade a flat facade with a bunch of windows brick and then it just kind of ends and then there's this concrete kind of three-quarter dome that comes out from behind it and they're covering when I drove by they were covering the dome with this sort of tarp II waterproofing layer and it looked like they were going to then move earth and and build a mountain over the dome so you have a your home would be sort of inside this man-made Mountain to fucking hobbit house it seemed kind of awesome actually what if somebody off roads on your roof and it crushes your house I don't even know now that could be a problem suck in seven Suseo i live underground what are you a rat I don't know it seemed weird but it was very interesting it seems like fire resistant if the whole neighborhood catches on are you a gopher bro well he'll if you had to live in the air underground or underwater Oh underground from the ground he's right he's right is that it no so that's a geodesic dome this is sort of it's a flat whoever lives it's not built yet it's like half built but that's pretty fucking cool go back to that picture whoever lives in there for sure believes in chanting yeah souls they call the corners regular I mean but the idea of living in a fun shape like that yeah would make your life more interesting for sure if only I lived in a dome everybody would like me but do you how long do you think you could live like that at some weirdo fucking art house before you like let me just have a house house oh you don't need uh huh you want to sit in a house house there's an art house right near me that's a very famous architects I think it's Frank Gehry's art house and it's a terrible use of space but it literally has like a tree house like a box on a post just floating above the house and there's like a little stairs to go up there and there's just a dining room table for two in the air on a post that's bonkers it doesn't seem particularly it's a little ice but sometimes you're into those you know you gotta have that designer house yeah what if it got hit by an asteroid like that one little so I got a direct shot the lot I'd the luck would be unbelievable God telling you get the fuck outta here shoulda bought an art house shit the fuck out of here with your art house bro I'm approaching my IP limit okay three and a
