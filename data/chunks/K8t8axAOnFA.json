hello three pitches one of the main things I think that my advice would be it's a lot easier to focus on what you should eat then on what you shouldn't and I think that an more inclusionary diet is is key so focusing on what your body needs you know not only for short term but what it needs for long-term focus on that more than focus on what you're eliminating from your diet because it's just first of all if you focus on what you're limiting from your diet then you're not going to be getting all the good stuff that you need that's also thinking a lot about loss you're all certainly can't even eat that it's just like it's so there's too many little it's easy to become caught up in a lot of minutiae and I know this because I've been there and so you know getting caught up in all this little minutia you know it can take you forever to try to figure out what's going on and then in the meantime you're getting distracted from the important thing is not as what you need you know your body your body is very resilient and if you feed it what it needs you can fight off stuff you're going to you're going to age better you know all these little chemical reactions and enzymatic reactions going on in all your cells and your liver and your kidney your brain all these things are going to keep happening because you're feeding it and when you have a little bit of toxic stuff guess what all of these pathways are ready because they're so they're getting nourished or getting what they need that they activate and the your body has protective mechanisms to make sure it doesn't get cancer do you know I explained that when you make reactive oxygen species you can repair it or you can do cell will die but all those all those repair of stress response mechanisms they require that you know you're you're giving yourselves what they need to do that so if you are so focused on what not to eat that you're not getting enough of what you need then your body is you know capacity to do that isn't going to be as optimal so i really like i really think it's easier especially for people that don't have a scientific background that don't have time i mean because it takes a lot of time to sit there and read through all the scientific stays and figure out what's going on all the complex interactions you know I barely have time to do that and it's like I do this every day like I do research every day and on top of that in my spare time I do it it's still overwhelming and I still can only get so much done didn't you have like plans on being some sort of a marine biologist or something at some point yeah I tell the people the story cuz is funny on Twitter i found this rock my daughter found this rock on the beach in santa barbara and how all these holes in it we're trying to figure out what the fuck it was was an asteroid or something i put on twitter i go what's this rock Joe fucking Perry is the first guy to answer me on Twitter and tells me it's a sea stone like these animals had like burrowed into this stone and create a little homes really well Toby well anyway uh yeah listen I I love the ocean a lot and it captured me from the very beginning I mean I loved I loved djoko style and watching those those specials and and I got to see him speak a couple times embossed it and I just was that's what I wanted to be I wanted to be I went and I went to woods hole and you know visited there and and and I thought that's what I wanted to do was be a marine biologist and you know and the whole learning disability thing which they didn't know what to call it back then except a discipline thing you know and I managed I wasn't studying hard enough well I wanted to wanted to get good grades they studied as hard as I could I mean it looked at the page read it nothing stuck and dyslexia couldn't get grades no it's like ADHD I guess they call it them and and that's where they have different ways to teach kids now and it doesn't involve you know like taking some pills I mean there's just different ways of teaching that work and they just didn't have it back then what would you say to one though like say if someone came along like some 15 year old kid says hey I'm a huge UFC Fan I want to fight in MMA how should I get started I would have them pick one discipline to start if you're 15 years old go wrestle if you are more drawn to boxing or kickboxing then go do that along the way play and experiment a little bit mm-hmm but athlete development is changing now there's this this trend for when kids are as young as five six years old that there's these intensive training programs you have larger cities where there's good resource good coaching good facilities they take these kids from an early age maybe they train them on football or basketball or hockey something like this with the intent of developing professional athletes this approach is almost producing zero professional athletes the ones who are successful are the ones who played three on four sports growing up and then they get to a certain age and then they start narrowing in and kind of finding the best way be said what were they going to do the Australians did it before the Olympics in two thousand they started to take it a whole bunch of metrics on their athletes finding okay you're not good enough to win a medal here have you thought about this try this as there's all theologies they have one national governing body for for their Olympic sports development as a result they did 10 times per capita the amount of medals at the US did one in 2012 in in the UK they did the same thing they took it a little bit further as an example of one woman who was good I think she was some type of distance runner or something that all sorts of measurements like that the wrist to elbow measurement this is more technical than that I know but they found she had this certain measurement in here and said okay you're not going to win a medal on this have you ever considered rowing she goes I've never done wrong three years later she was Olympic champion what yeah you could be an Olympic rowing champion in three years well think about if you are already a well trained athlete for something else it involved that type of cardiovascular stuff then you have the specific biomechanics that fits it so if you know what those biomechanics are you know what to look for in an athlete you can steer them in this direction that you kid did great with metal counts that's amazing you
