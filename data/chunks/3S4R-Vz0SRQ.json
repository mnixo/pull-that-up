you go into Atlanta right to give a show link every day you've transcended geography with this show because keep from all across the probably more people isn't the best daily than any editorial right but it was for the best way it costs these ideas like when you you bring such a diverse range of opinions is able to so it's so good that shirt from the pharmacy dude this is where the crimes I best believe that this hazard is writing for big thing calm now what is big thing it's just like this new-age technician interview you yeah we could even hit it with Michael a good dude they have a sick

like Optimus me boy I think we're gonna incorporate that we should make it Twitter I gotta go the dollar somebody else does so we're fucked now somebody else is gonna try and sell out to me if you like yeah there's benefit and then there's a problem with which was doing everything live I think it ups the ante though a lot of these guys they edit their shit you know they edit their podcast am like musical cues and all this stuff and they make it all professional only insert commercials in it but you lose something you lose that the live element is part of what makes it fun you know I agree yeah I agree even when you're listening to afterwards you know that it was broadcast live this is the there's a certain energy to that right just this one was go I lost track of time the only thing that was keeping pace with time as I was getting thirstier than I should have been dude I thought you gonna knock your ayahuasca story I'm like there's no way about ayahuasca story ayahuasca story was Glen Jin dairy but you topped it your ibogaine story is better than your IRA wants my story okay that's a crazy goddamn story and made me I don't want to do it I don't wanna do that all i want so down

want to get his guns yeah that's not good he had a very the way his mind works what it worked was very strange you know it's interesting because that guy was like there in the 60s he was there the the hippie generation of the San Francisco movement you know the the Summer of Love and all that he was there and watch like literally like that like what everybody at the time thought was the changing of an age you know and he's got this brilliant thing in that documentary where he sort of watched that happen and then watched the tide roll back you know and then watch like the Nixon administration afterwards watch Vietnam after and like watch it all fall away and it's really a fascinating stuff man it was he went through some shit man that generation went through some crazy shit anyway it's amazing that yes it was legal mazing so many of them are still come see yeah cool well it all wears off you know a lot of it works everything does that's that's the biggest challenge with all this work is taking it and applying it to your life yeah after you're done it's very easy to get slippery and just kind of forget yeah but it's always it moves the bass line a little bit ya know so where you retreat to is never quite the same as the way you were yeah what was that um that quote though inspiration works but it's like bathing it only lasts for so long so we recommend it daily yeah you

second thought yes oh good not great as I pursue that's there with me the first hit of the day this was close in the car and then here so then it was later common went for a long-ass stretch with no weed whatsoever right how long did you go 13 days how long Muslims you remember ah I've done recently and I just went five or six yeah but this is I become became a heavy everyday smoker right so to do that was really withdrawal symptoms were weird with the drill your dreams were way way bigger but when drawl symptoms physically like you needed PI zero zero of those no withdrawal if I don't get to it in a day like if I'm like busy and I'm running around and no but I don't see any it I don't just have a chance like do some because I'm not gonna do it right for a few some important you know this doesn't count the only thing I've ever felt physically was I felt caffeine I felt coffee oh yeah oh that definitely out that but like like I take a day off and I get a headache that's really never felt physic yeah but with with pot it was always Anna that was I just have to be top 1% users of pop users yeah there was nothing it was just like I didn't nothing gets was just shut it off yeah do you believe people may say that they have physical withdrawal symptoms or you think it was some peace rep man I had aspartame withdrawal symptoms aspartame yeah so huge my head play to pull over and might stop cuz I couldn't see any more debilitating I didn't know that aspartame was it was addictive your her that uh I don't know if it's addictive but it when I got off it it was in my system oh but that's but isn't that also coke you focus in it so yeah I switch from coke I switch from coke - um - sprite once and I was drinking tons of it because it was get free the Comedy Store when I worked there and so because I drop the caffeine then I got Hugh bribe migraines - but I wasn't aspartame and I saw what was aspartame when you got the headaches because I was dating this girl and she looked it up because I was having migraines and she said you'd bring a bunch of Crystal Light because I was at the time just shaking up making things you know even the kitchen okay my dad cut it out migraines went away didn't know what it was that's what she said might've I mean that might be psychosomatic but there's all this stuff online so that's where taking calls anything what is sometimes not on everybody didn't Donald Rumsfeld wasn't he the guy who pushed aspartame through I think I can see that it's like not fully tested the negatives but it's good and you'll get thinner well when you think about it matters many people drink diet cokes it's pretty goddamn safe because everybody should be dropping like flies I mean it's not good for you but Jesus Christ a lot of people drinking diet coke where's all the brain tumors you know I mean people like really are exaggerating certainly not good for you but how the odds of you getting it sure yeah if you live a clean life and eat healthy food you're definitely better off but you know how many people are getting cancer for diet coke no come on right Jesus Ari Shaffir okay hey shroom fest July 21st the 23rd everybody wherever

that's it with this one see you guys soon you know hi everybody I'm here with brownies Steven yes we are here Joe Rogan and Brody Stephens yes very positive today Brody's feeling good he's ready to begin his exercise sir I am eating better cutting out soda and girls he's ready for pussy yes I am back in the game you've got it it's been a year and I'm gonna be back in doing what I can do yes one whole game like one he'll year brother out of the game do you feel any ring rust yes any pressure to perform no do you have any teams you're scouting out right now well if you like team blonde I like to be blye team blond team and at me team in two yields three hot hot pasture you act one gotta be cute real hair are you give a fuck real hair oh you're so you push me on the black girl black girl with a wig would he say I float my boat but I'd be willing to try it mmm lettuce test no no no I'm into like really white girls like a Gernot sea sky yeah is that weird nose I would not see fantasy yes give me a chicken glorious bastard I'll scalp you you got it that's what I want how dare you keep me down I'm a good guy stop telling me to get laser hair removal I won't do it except me yes yes I I think that was about as good as we could have ever done it thank you very much yeah thanks for being on the show buddy thank Ojo see you pal David Holub of grip to tell he throws a mean flat ball and if you want to see Brody throw a fastball in a tennis court go see that on YouTube it's on YouTube how fast we throw that's probably now one only in the mid-80s maybe but it's pretty fast it was at night it was on a tennis court ultimate sound what's the fastest you've ever thrown baseball I got clocked at 91 day College Arizona State I pitched with passion and I was a good picture I just like that's like pro speed right is it yes close yeah what's like a top of the line what's the fastest thing I can like what like Roger Clemens in his prime was probably throwing mid to upper-90s I'll probably knees yeah right but mostly I would say mid-90s for close gone over 100 uh I mean Nolan Ryan back in the day you got John uh Verlander now the Tiger stones over 100 consistently stress right with the Nationals 100 miles an hour for starting pitchers there's a lot of relievers who do it how hard is it to me as I entered my like Sylvanus a ball I mean you got a gear they can hit it I mean fuck Justin Verlander I said Jonathan but I mean how much how fast you have to be I mean like Babe Ruth was alive today would he be shitting his pants would they be throwing Heat right past him you know a lot of people think that the guys I think more guys throw harder now yeah then way back one bit way back then right he probably would have adjusted but um it's a timing thing yeah but the guys do time at these hitters they figure out they'll hit a hundred miles an hour what's the worst thing that ever happened to baseball when they started testing for steroids you know I'd like to see because when you're not doing steroids or HGH and ends careers I mean who didn't like watching Barry Bonds hit all those home runs and he's had two who didn't like watching Roger Clemens pitch at 42 Nolan Ryan pitching he's 46 even on steroids but be great to see guys continue to play like after 40 you can take a supplement you can play have an MMA do you allow - yeah there's a lot of guys Dan Henderson is on testosterone replacement the rampage just any better news on testosterone replacement yeah I was at the door what no but for what hi this isn't the ice house you gotta get around the alley all the angles be behind ya your shoulder a wonderful interview yeah what just happened bro what that guy look like a natural now that I look like Don Johnson's dad oh he's got a nice pyramid I think they should have let the guys when you over 40 you're allowed to take if they sponsor do they look at it some kind of a thing that they treated like these guys are stealing babies you know they're make it all they're doing is taking something to make them perform better and things that make your body perform better that shouldn't that just be researched more I mean it seems to me that as long as these people aren't dying and I get this isn't some some crazy stuff great they're going to reputable doctors and they're doing this release Clemens was and yeah Barry Bonds was involved in that ball girl thing - yeah yeah but you know I guess they say because it makes for an uneven playing field but as more research comes out everybody hopefully would know like you know what HGH it's not bad for you it's actually good for you I want to take it like a vitamin almost yeah yeah I think there's a lot of ignorance when it comes to it but it's fascinating to me they would spend so much time like in front of Congress they were like you know they have this trial the Barry Bonds trial and yeah as far as um Roger Clemens - I think it goes down to it becomes a perjury trial because they caught them saying in the past under oath it weren't under some stuff right as they can't just like if it's not illegal to take human growth hormone it's not illegal to take testosterone but it's illegal as to lie when they ask you are you taking things yeah and they did that and McGwire up there yeah man yeah when McGwire took that new job then he had to come out and sort of explain everything oh yeah he didn't get in trouble though battery's dying oh well so is this conversation it's fucking boring anyway let those joes talk baseball for let me take whatever the fuck they want that's what I say don't you say buddy it's for the game and makes it better the game yes she only good part about that fucking games when they hit that ball only after 40 though not before stay black
