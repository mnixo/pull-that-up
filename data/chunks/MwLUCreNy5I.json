eighteen year old and shit like that right his daughter here we go here we go yeah three two one damn it's been a minute since we did one of these hot minute how long has it been I carry six months longer than that the cows just not part of the fight this the fight campaign in these now you're kicking him out I can't believe it I knew I was gonna have to do what are we gonna do we got to fall and kind of gotta put him out to sea man he's getting old he just can't make it as for the Beatles that they kicked out the original drummer something like that right he was a drummer right well fuck Peter if you bring in Ringo he was uh it was so sad Pete best I was listening to this Malcolm Gladwell book on tape it's called outliers and they got into a part about the Beatles The Beatles man when this Pete Pete passed he was there in the beginning man he did these crazy gigs with them could you imagine like you're being a part of a band and then you get kicked out of that band it turns into the beat Cosby he told me that's never happened before I mean no one's ever Beatles before right so no one has ever been is that him right there oh he doesn't look like you fits in does he how many one has ever been that guy I bet he went home was ice creamy when they first oh my god there was nothing like that before that that's a people say that that was all staged Bieber's are faking - I'll send you a link the Biebs has the same effect on this a man girls lose nobody mine nobody a certain dudes Brenda never liked that footage look at those chicks dude that's pretty much they didn't have the Internet they didn't know they're being dorks that was natural that's how every girl naturally feels there's no Instagram under personal Instagram there's nothing so first time you see them in person we it was set up as their possible I put the conspiracy now we have a we have an idea of what based on how women behave around us when they're worried about the way we think about them the same way we behave differently when it's all us when there's no women around there's just a ways that people behave and if you leave all these women together hold on a second if you leave all these women together and it's 19 what what year was that what's that the 62 but late sixties dude they didn't even barely have books back then happy to get out the kitchen there's a Beatles watch them girls screaming of course they had books I'm joking but when I'm not joking around about is that they no one had ever experienced anything like that point if you get all these girls together and they're seeing these guys who they're seeing on television and they're seeing on The Ed Sullivan Show and there's they're seeing him everywhere and they sit there in the newspapers in the magazines and they see these guys and the sounds they make are so good the way they sing and play music together is so magical and it's so unprecedented and it's a new kind of sound and they're just special you know these girls just can't help it like me you know when you see a taping of a TV show yeah you did you ever see the big applause like yeah applause they make is that a real plaza a fake applause that's fake those lights they're not a conspiracy they're not a conspiracy but they are kind of cheesy dude you look at Justin Bieber's concert I mean listen I've worked he's hot as fuck he's hot but I worked I worked security for like some of these bands and I worked for the when Hilary Duff was in her a day I'm talking bitches passing out from excitement at the grab their big asses out of the crowd yeah that's not fake that is real dude I'm talking bitches crying I have to understand girls have a completely different reaction not all girls but some some dudes to you bro you remember the reactions there's a there's a lot of Beatles footage of the audience but there's girls just fucking flipping out school and crying like just going nuts remember those two shots a hundred percent look do do I think that girls would act up to get on camera to make it a bigger deal yes do I think that's what they were all doing no look at this mayhem dude I think they couldn't believe that the Beatles were actually there there had never been anybody like the Beatles before Rock Thursday dude I think they were just hypnotized there's something singing out in their DNA about that music cuz look we can listen to the Beals today and it's still great I listened to the White Album just the other day it was amazing how was it from beginning to end it was sexy but they weren't like hard Rob's their dickhead haircut don't have to basic did don't not know it's the music it's the music they're so good and this this movie or this book rather the Malcolm was all about extraordinary performances like what people have done that's been completely extraordinary and one of them was talking about how the Beatles got so good because they played I think it was Berlin was where they put her Hamburg one of those books so they played somewhere where they played all night they played like multiple hours a night and they played every day they played a insane number run a lot of ants in front of audiences they just played constantly and he talked about the importance of that the by the time we got to see them by the time they were on television they had played together so many more times than the average band were will do in their entire career like the sheer numbers they're always playing always doing these live performances I forget where it was with the cavern club where was it he was at the cavern club is what it's called I think now where is the place that they performed early in their career I want to say it's Hamburg this is the first of a long series of resident nights during a traditional jazz evening they performed an interval as the only rock group during an all-night session including jazz maybe it might be one of the many things they've done I would know I think this was before they made it this was like as they were like young guys coming up just so many repetitions yeah and he talked about out and they think about that Pete best dude it's going fuck I was in the mix what did he end up doing anything he start his own band how do you recover from that but biggest sell here's the thing there's never been a Beatles before so we're looking at the Beatles like we already know they're awesome they're already a part of pop culture history I miss them I'm younger but if we lived back then man if it was like 1963 and the Beatles burst in the scene you would be like wow is there anything close that now it were too we have too much stimulus we see it too much we Instagram we get inside their lives it's hard there's a huge banner there's that Korean band that's fucking a Korean band yes that really freaked out kpop and I forget their name but they're starting to you'll see the to put them in like at the Grammys and stuff in the the entire crowd is these young teenage Korean girls going fucking apeshit whoa they're huge but there's like the Backstreet Boys and new kids what about babymetal have you heard of them why babymetal no you haven't heard a babymetal never bro you've heard a babymetal is on the ball babymetal is super technical power metal but they have little Japanese girl singing insane it's gigantic it's gigantic you know it's funny you can't put this on YouTube right will you Dan it's super hardcore metal this is like it's like what we talked about repetitions they do you know in Korea there you can watch a documentary on the kpop stuff and they they don't like it's not chemistry where they give them together they force them together and then they it's you're talking in 14 hours a day they make them rehearse practice practice can't they can't have girlfriends boyfriends to tell me when to eat where to sleep it's Abby's five to that noise that's like one of the biggest Korean pop singers all-time commit suicide just didn't want to deal with the with the restrictions and the control and sounds like oh my god cheesiest so they're like the old-school studio model yeah you know remember that you ever hear that what do you do no no with them that didn't they used to do that with these do that with bands they do that with even with movies it's signed in the old-school studio days they'd sign up to these long-term contracts and they would produce all the stuff for them and force them to do things the contracts right that's them by the way Jim yes BTS behind the scenes that were things were it's crazy we haven't said anything about the fights yeah no I don't know anything about what young kids are doing today every I have to go to Jamie and Jamie's an intermediary because he's a grown man he's not he's not a boy who's a blue belt son - well how do you 35 have to try to wear the same Easter Jamie's struggling to pay attention the young girls you know as at the mall today is my son young girls with the cutoff jean shorts in the ass cheeks hanging out the back that's I know that's in dude that is crazy let me just ass out the back go back people are just trying so hard just to get recognition man it's a fascinating time to be a person it really is so interesting right now it's a good time oh yeah it's a great time also a rough time mass shooters and that stuff that's fun he's out part especially encourage the earn a Thousand Oaks house a safe ass place yeah how is the number rain a former Marine I'm not a dude it was in the Las Vegas shooting as a survivor was a survivor in the Thousand Oaks shooting you know there was fucking out that same here men seyn think about the odds of that that's why I think about the up well I think there was so who's in the Vegas shooting who survived that who's that this one that died right I think so either way it's dark shit they don't have no idea what his motive or anything right the cops had investigated him they investigated him fairly recently because they thought he was unstable or something I think his mom called the cops like some somebody called the cops and they they investigated him talk to him that's always tough if your f guys like what you want to do arrest them for being fucking weird like you know it's like what can we do for everyone that does this get trail the guy not thousand that don't you know I mean you got to figure out what the fuck is it that allows people to decide hit that switch like I don't know if they understand that like what's the psychological motivation in that but it's got to be a sign that there's something wrong with our culture if it's popping up so often it's gotta be a sign that something's there's something wrong in the OP CD they always chalk it up to mental health and alright yeah do you know many people have mental health issues and ya know we're gonna blow people up or should be different kinds of mental health issues but there's also just bad people yeah but sometimes you got chalk it up to that - that's true - but you know a lot of bad people like a giant number I've had horrible things happen yeah that's where it gets weird because it's like okay what made this guy become who he is and it's you definitely should you definitely should arrest someone who does evil shit right but what makes a person get to a point where they can do evil shit there's a whole series of events probably take place including abuse physical abuse maybe sexual abuse and sometimes there's not sometimes you should get a bad apple like with Jeffrey Dahmer it's like his pants like yeah I mean you definitely get hit some weird shit with his mom but still you know how some people are born they have problems with their liver yeah some people are going to have problems with their brain that's just a fact we know that there's problems with the eyesight there's problems with you know people are going deaf yep there's errors in the human body sometimes you don't think that someone could be born just completely squirrelly wired wrong of course they can socio that makes sense I'm not a doctor obviously a fucking moron but I bet a doctor would agree that when you're dealing with mental health issues you're probably dealing with this giant spectrum of them what if there's something we could check so that like when their baby could check in a son ID and that's called eugenics but in there like this he's gonna be a bad kid do we just call you awful he's gonna be about why how many people has done the symmetry of your face but how many people want to be a better person and they don't ever get it together and how many people are lacking like some sort of coaching or lacking some inspiration inspiration positive people in their life and then their life spirals further and further downhill how many people are on the border a majority writing yes cuz I think people change and I think people improve as they grow older and as they become wiser and they have more experiences but also if you if you look at the mass shooters a lot of them are quote unquote losers they live in the parents basement that only thing going on you look like shit use them they're always white and they toys white low-energy always white low-energy something low energy this guy didn't seem low energy you know the Nazis made propaganda films basically they made people believe that mentally deranged people were out on the streets attacking and killing people and then a propaganda film so that they would okay killing someone who was you know mentally deranged yeah you always have to be careful of people trying to label someone as someone that you don't have to consider a regular human someone who you could disregard that's what they do with the Jews right it's like the rats or stealing from us they're monsters that's what they do it people have done that throughout history to other people there's like a scientific term for it I don't remember what it is like genic Stalin what it's a scientific term for people that demonize other groups of people and they're the way they look at propagandists no no the way you look at people like this is a person and you looked at the enemy you would look at them like a subhuman there's it's like there's a psychological it is definitely racist yeah there's like a trait that people like there's like a pattern that people commonly fall into with that common eyes and the enemy we're all stupid in it we are stupid but dehumanizing the enemy Cal it's a natural thing that people do it's fucking everyone does it it's so weird and it's how people can do gang warfare it's how people can do tribal warfare it's how people can do into continental what were you had your boy what's the English cat the Hypnotizer Damon Aaron Brown Karen Brown have you seen his thing on Netflix no it's fucking sick and so I'm not it's no spoiler but so he took a guy like he took a ton of people took a guy who lives in Florida who's in construction and it was super kind of racist towards immigrants like Mexicans and Hispanics and he sat him down to the thought he's the perfect one damn bro AG oh I'm on bike companion right now with Joe Rogan say hey hey yeah yeah I was watching it as I watched your fight with Rosenthal yeah points dude that's the point system yeah so that's what it was they called you for they called stalling for you being in top half is that why you lost oh my god I thought it was a judge's decision and they gave it to him based on that almost okay this is super technical and he's won we referenced many times in the podcast him and his brother Richie boogey man because both those guys started out as b-boys they started out as really dancers break dancers and they have incredible control of their body and I remember when they first started training at Eddie's place Eddie was like like like you had a new formula he's like dude fuck Ferguson and wrestle so he's got both but what's up with what's going on with Tony I feel bad for a man feel like they're leaving him in the fucking dust no no no no no no no no they're not no no you got some no they know they they're very serious about doing something with Tony Ferguson Wow Danny even said that he is most likely next and next in line for Kebede 20 Ferguson look after you preserves it man fuck yeah he does and after that performance against Pettis like come on man this is this is the time it's the time to set him out he's so fucking tough he wants it to them I think he said hemorrhage is the right man Tony hasn't lost in what is it 12 fights now how many fights is it 11 it's a little bit strange I'll fight win streak against guys like Edson Barboza Darcy's heavenly heavenly triangles him Pettis Pettis gets an injury but Josh Thompson Josh Thompson beat some tough fucking guys man Lando came at him he had no training camp for that one do you think that's an ex fight they make though Lando is a talented guy man yeah he cushion I mean he clipped him he clipped him with that he does this head kick out of the break um but he survived that in one I mean dude Tony Ferguson is a fucking beast look at it was three ho those are no plans man Josh Thompson monster Barbosa Vanara just look at San Jose those of ándara Hafele dos Anjos and Kevin Lee and then Anthony Pettis in a row those guys does not nearly get nearly get the attention he deserves Ahad man he's got a million followers now he's more he should he should be first of all I don't think he should have been stripped cuz he one time doing USC press he's doing something he tripped over some wires it's a freak accident it's just something that happened you know to strip him because of that like I don't know I think he'd be Anthony Pettis 60% no more at he but he D she i've she's looked better before the injury obviously but him come back that fast doing what he did isn't it's like even dump crews like i don't know how the fuck he's doing this so i thought even as good as he looked that's naming him at his you know he's gonna be even better in this next fight well i think more rest fattest look really good too you got to give credit to paris for sure clip titus clipped him and he had him hurt but tony figured out a way to hold on and survive but he didn't look like he was missing a beat to me he looked he looked very in tune did I I hurt something that he didn't spar for this is that true I'm not too sure what he does with the striking I'm never there when he trains with the striking I have no idea to tell you the truth you don't stay off cam you just do about the ground no we do I'm gonna do when we do knows shit told me I've heard that too but when he spars when we do jujitsu we we definitely spar situation we do situation right know like straight up striking no 16-ounce gloves Mandana is such a debate what a crazy debate that is the tree own does the same thing does he know sparring he has a Spartan six years might not it might not be a bad idea Robbie Lawler took six years of sparring to he did but then he became better when he went to 1880 when you went to ATC and started you know training with some serious talent down there and dropped down to 170 I would like know that that the period of no sparring I think that was the 85 period when he was at Strikeforce well Chad Mendes took a while off to kids offs he got busted but then he took time off and then he's looking freakin pretty gnarly yeah dude um and having Dale Earnhardt jr. on the other day and and talking to him about the the brain injuries that he sustained from driving his car I haven't heard it yeah horrible dude he got so couldn't walk across the room he had to hold on the tables and shit I was as he was walking he did he say he's had concussion does he know what said something insane like 12 over a period of four years holy shit that's a lot I want to say it was something like 12 concussions over a period of four how is he now he's great super nice guy very very genuine guy the first he said that the links popping up at least 20 it's more than some fighters god damnit that's crazy that is so crazy but you know he's a lot of a lot of like serious problems and he to work through but he found a good doctor that has this good cognitive therapy Paul really so he's had some kind of side effects from it he had a bunch of side effects but they cleared him up through these exercises really interesting stuff like and he was basically I made the analogy that it's like is it like exercising your mind like it's just like exercising your body like there's things you can do that make things grow and make the neurons firing yeah and make things strong Hertz CBD oil and fish oil yeah experts that I know who are in that field and with the brain they always tell me tons of fish Elan CBD krill oil - that stuff's real good yeah yeah yeah stuff anything that reduces inflammation but that damn dealer does these guys decide that's that some of them decide you know cowboy was doing that for a while I'm probably still is I don't know what he was doing what he's doing now I didn't talk to him about this can not sparring heavy wasn't sparring at all you're just hitting pad yeah just hitting pads it's not bad idea ain't the horse idea man boxers break to differ you talked into those boxers and they're like no I think it was a low mischenko and wild ago we like to get 12 rounds in hard right before the fight like two weeks three weeks out and we cut it off like three weeks out just make sure see where we're at thinking about boxing though is your hands are wrapped up you know your your gloves are on they've got you've got 16-ounce training gloves or maybe even 20 if you're a beast right you got big ass pop usually 16 yeah big ass puffy gloves and there's no kicking the thing about like kicking it's like to see is I feel like balls back yet I'd feel like boxing's more dangerous it is and because all they're doing is head on thing all these all head and it's just head right but especially that level well you're not getting kicked I know but in in like high level gyms like black house or a ttak people they're not really gonna throw those kicks as far as they can't man I don't know about all this yeah Oh such an old-school chute box there's a lot of guys they're still going after it that there's a lot of guys it'll still talk to you about the benefits of going after it like that or do ya Faraz a hobby was saying he gets guys who try to kill George st. Pierre he'd give him extra money if they could knock him out just because he's so good no it's doing shit he's so good they're not doing it to America he wants up in danger for us wants George in danger in legitimate danger so his in his mind is you put George and legitimate danger all the time in the gym and he figures out a way to get through that and he gets comfortable with that so the when it comes to the fight it's the same thing that's easy they say if George st. yeah and I love for us but when you have George st. Pierre who's the smartest dude to ever Ronald Marsh guys their fight and he's so technical you whoever you gonna bring in that you're not gonna hit Joe let me ask you this he's so maybe maybe there's benefit not when you're early going when you're learning technique more and you're really learning timing and pacing maybe then is when you should spar like way more technical breath then when you get older and you're better like maybe you need the fear yes of an actual fight and then then you can just slide right into the fight smart cuz you're also not because your head movements better your move yeah you're smarter check yourself more but the dangers still 100% real so then you're aware of all the day yes yep so that way when you're in a fight it feels exactly like your training it's not bad ideal use somebody already there you're ready at a higher than proficiency you know you have the tools did I really think that there's a real issue with fighters and this is impossible to tell after it's over right after the careers over like what why'd they do it this way what if they had done it that way maybe it would have worked better well you know you know Chuck Liddell is he's not with Hackman for this T or T's fight he he just shot that like was an old-school type of training so he decided to go somewhere else train with Einstein dizzy well listen I'm a big fan of Einstein as I don't know I don't know and a strength and conditioning about yeah he knows a lot about slow movement slow movement lifting you know slow like he's what does he call it was I don't know what the style it's it's all super slow that's what it is right this is working with Antonia Mickey Mickey yeah yeah yeah but I've known that dude forever how long we known that dudes he was in king of the cage when I used to commentate back in 2000 he's a damn good fighter for a long time right his son is awesome oh but no you know but both of them Chuck is training with what's their gym called power garage or some shit like that sure I forget but that's where Chuck's at because because what I heard the on the street and I'll say I fucking love John acumen shout at John Hackerman but it was such an old-school way of training he's like dude it's the game's advanced so fast I need to go somewhere which I saw that he goes down to je Glaser's plays to write the unbreakable yeah I don't know if they're in business together he's been there forever he's been when the starters what how would a dope place Jay Glazer put together yes a son says that it's amazing have you been there Chuck no man I never been but I've seen all these videos of real oh come on Mike this place is crazy Snoop Dogg's in there Wiz Khalifa's bar and somebody P Diddy was in there you know um Wiz Khalifa nope no Snoop Dogg rather sparred with legit spar with Daniel Sarafian Snoop Dogg was supposed Sarafian wasn't hit nobody was around but look at this look at this Snoop is in there and sarafina's just kind of using head movement is kind of touching them a little bit but you know how fuckin goddamn terrifying that must be you just have gloves on in front of Sarafian do you think Snoopy knows is he aware I don't think so he's got it so I'm probably told unless I came in you know what that guy's done that guy might not be you know the best in the world he might not be the best world but he's a fuckin monster home patoot competitive smokey is built like its leg he's so strong to block twizzler and he cuts a shitload of weight to that's that guy's a gigantic but wood weight is Sarathi in fight I want to say he fights at 85 but he's super jacked he's a thick steak dog just the real dangerous dude so to see him in their sparring with Snoop Dogg I wonder if Snoop Dogg understands that this is like it's like pawn at a giant pit bull or something you know I wonder I don't think you know to what level I don't know I mean you ever seek you ever seen one that has got balls noop dogs got real balls did not just do that but to do that and put it up make a video of it and look through and dude and did it look like an asshole ya know didn't look like an ass for a god it's not a like a long time combat sport and notable athletes yeah you know I mean he's not like some guy we've known about like like if you saw there's there's some guys like Mario Lopez if you saw Mario Lopez boxing with something you go yeah that guy can box he's in people everybody knows it yeah everybody has smokers like everybody knows Mario let's get smokers yeah yeah yeah smoker against a friend of mine I think Franco would fuck him up but oh how dare you I know he'd punch AC Slater no I do I've seen four I've trained with Frank man he's feisty one yeah I believe you I mean he looks tough but Lopez can fight I would I think you know you think yeah I think he really knows big wild card West for Harry's himself this is one of the reasons why I think he really knows how to box when I'm around really arrogant not really arrogant but it's he's he knows how to fight he's a nice guy nice they come you remember our our buddy he was a porn star he was the one who which one fought Mario Lopez Wan Drive damn it Derek my out in his real name oh dude there's the point oh oh oh oh Black Diamond Derek that it's not dirt oh yeah dirt diamond down Tyler night Tyler night yeah yeah oh that's his porno name on it what a great was it and he's also also an author and um he runs like crazy marathons and shit now too doesn't it is he still dicking girls down as just older I'm not sure he so anyway he had an amateur fight he used to go to 10th planet yeah really nice guy yeah super and he had an amateur fight with Mario Lopez he had won them smokers but how ego day mario dropped him I think AC Slater for most my remarks either stopped him or he won a decision but Tyler dropped him Tyler drop Mario so it was a real fight so it that tameka's Tyler was jacked he was like super powerful back then and I think that if he can come back from getting dropped and still win you know he's March it comes in a box and I've done a podcast one just about box I'm sure he knows this shit what he seems a guy really is a fair one you know I mean I'd like to see him do something I've never seen him actually box somebody no me neither isn't he like 45 yes right everybody in here yeah it looks beautiful I don't know what he's doing but it's working how old are you 35 he looks younger than you do Mario Lopez and I have a wrinkle on his pretty face dude AC Slater as an age whatever moisturizer he's got I want bring it do you haven't watched one second of this fight I haven't either several fights there well not theirs he looks like you steals quote let's say you get stung by all the bees and the chance they're super nice guy too really really nice Joe professionally to like hosting he's upbeat yeah who's like blowing up faster than Leo or Theo von field field wants killer it's a funny guy man

gun oh and no disrespect the only time I ever listen to the show was when is about the because I think they had one of the dudes on the show when Amy Schumer like robbed the stage yeah I listen to

all he's wanted to do since he was a kid is make people laugh this is literally what he's meant to do yeah like it's just the hilarious silly dude remember he got a huge on vine before it went away I mean you're talking he's on the main stars on vine man for doing this type of stuff makes sense all day his instagrams great oh if I could post the text that he sends me I mean you get millions they're so funny man the Greek comes off Turin has all this money he goes dude something wrong with my microwave and then hits the button just all this cash my check brother reason just talking shit that's hilarious he's a funny dude how fun is it having friends at a comedians the best most fun to hang with man the best everybody's always being silly everybody's always putting you in your place always I love Christie she dresses like a fuck-boy too so if I wear this jacket the Comedy Store everyone makes fun of me but Chris at least be like come on people stick up for the rash yeah yeah you guys could talk about different clothing manufacturers do you know any Eddie do you know any clothing designers and Georgie Bonjour lower those jeans no one for Saatchi means you remember Bonjour jeans now what about Sergio Valente listen this is all old stuff it's old school but what I'm saying is this motherfucker could probably rattle off a gang of languages is that still good yeah Gucci Gucci stopping right now off White's the biggest brand in the world off-white off-white right now a materialist woman don't you come on dude materialist woman's dream think about this your big old gorilla of a guy you got big dick energy fat dick you're right about that you're a manly man but yet you're into fashion and don't suck dick with this jacket you don't even with skin jacking or nothing but the point is that you really do enjoy it and you're not shy about it now no this is what I like I like give me a name of an obscure designer that you really love his work follows like women's dresses and shit too yeah like you know man like I'll tell my I'll tell my girl with to wear or like shoes or like I saw Audrey and Whitney out on it and I'll Bree had this I'm sorry at box and burn and Whitney had this Gucci purse I knew what it was I was like that purse is sick and Tony is like what the fuck mate I'm like dude you just don't know what it is well listen I don't know why why did style and aesthetics why did that become a homosexual activity only or female yeah I don't know too weird this is why because sometimes people want a staple a regular shirt on the outside of a t-shirt pretending she's not retard you that's not passion how many times have you seen myself back a bunch more than 10 No Zoolander Zoolander I never saw it but I've seen clips never seen heard the second one is a bomber now you gotta see Zoolander with Brendan yeah totally I was watching a clip the other day from Tropic Thunder oh it's up there there's two things you can't do ever again after Tropic Thunder you can't be a white guy wearing blackface pretty tan you you can't say retard well yeah like you couldn't do simple jacket yeah yeah but remember you never go full retard I mean that was one of the big lines in the movie you literally cannot do that today you can't play having fun of playing a read no person like Authority police since this I mean do from Saturday Night Live there's a list of them no just a major motion picture not a major motion picture but Saturday night look listen even if I'm wrong like exactly maybe someone did it afterwards and culturally like that is the last big moment you might be right that other people have done since then did you know what repel does white face and Mexican all that was years ago doesn't let you talk about in the Chappelle's Show ten years ago it also doesn't count white face is not the same as blackface blackface existed back in the Al Jolson days you ever see that shit you ever see like when the minstrel guys on yeah black dudes yeah you ever watch it no it's crazy you're like what is this like what it's weird it is fuck look at that god this is so racist and he white lips is that does that make it official it's just like a regular black just made it lips look bigger I mean that's that's what the white does five hundred percent yeah they're trying to make him have exaggerated looking lips cuz in contrast to the black it looks like lips just like my girl puts lipstick and she outlines it outside of her lips makes her lips look bigger that's exactly what these people are doing so this is what they did and they wouldn't let black people in the movies black people couldn't be like the star of a movie there had to be a white guy playing a black guy in blackface did you see Shawn white dress up a simple Jack and got yellow stick for it yeah really come on John White is a big snowboarder monster gold medalist yeah just a flying tomato you know it's crazy isn't like these days you can't talk about shit no more but the gender thing isn't there like 60 some genders they're supposed to be a bunch of different gender combo now like yeah but they don't they're not saying is 60 genders but what they are saying is they should have the right to dictate what pronoun that you use instead of him or her they want like zur or ZZ they make up a bunch of these wacky but but how many are there really there's man man dude born as man but it woman inside woman born woman but man inside right and then the fifth one might be man who feels like he's man and woman and maybe they're six or seven how many how many associated that though some of them say they don't associated and then there's a sexual that's seven like one hand sexual guy who doesn't think he's a guy or a girl what isn't pan you just love to fuck pants whatever going it's all open sexual Monday through Friday a I'm a fucking dude Saturday Friday Saturday night I'm a fucking chick yes gender fluid yeah they go back and forth I don't know dude there was a whole radio on that what's the fuck you want there's a whole radio lab podcast about it and I was laughing my ass off when I was listening to these there's parts of it that were so preposterous because it was a guy who would just decide while he's talking that he's a girl and because this is like a super progressive show cuz radio lab is this like really well-made really high yes it's great fucking super well edited they connect they could literally can't say this guy might have some problems with his perceptions of reality yeah this might not just be a gender thing or maybe it is a gender thing split personalities right but you have to have both options on the table like this guy might be fuckin crazy and he the guy was a man then you just go oh I just flipped I just flipped I'm the woman now he's this is sighs medication probably goes back he's the man again like that but don't do that but you can't when it comes to gender here's the thing cuz yeah man you can't have these thoughts you can't question you can't cuz I don't know I'm not him right maybe that's a thing maybe you do just flip back and forth from feeling like you're a guy I feel like you're or maybe that's crazy that's possible too but optionally fuckin crazy there might be some kind of delusion that's involved mental sickness again maybe or but the thing is if you want to do that I don't give a flying shit but don't get mad at me if I don't call you the right prone and final call you can't be porn right the right now I don't know if he did get mad or she got mad depending on who she was he was asked what percentage is there a high rate of suicide for people for dudes that chop their dicks off young transgender right a person think whether or not they go through the operation there's still a very high rate of suicide but transgenders 50% you cut off your dick there you should be on suicide watch right I mean that's huge well it's huge but it and I don't think it's a fact of them that they regret come their dicks off but the no the hormones I think that's what fun all of their brain stuff like because then you mess with the biological system of your body right now I can be straight all that I think hormones right now if you're a man but you feel like a woman inside I'd say it just keep your dick you know what I mean cuz it's gonna fit you chop it off you're gonna lose all those orgasms might as well have something do you can't have orgasms if you chop your dick something do you on youporn see some chicks with tits with fat dick I don't think so you're gonna get rid of your gas unless you're born with I could deform dick oh my god I mean we're missing the craziest girl TKO of all time this girl is getting smashed barber doing some karmic bombs down oh my god these girls are oh my god big elbow this reference damn rapper kid damn she got blasted some shots it's a fight game yep she's getting paid for it ha Dan that was wild she got blood and powerful on it shirt powerful on it the Iceman shout out in the audience I see Birdman back there to what we just said man we just saying we're talking about chicks with dicks and the fun yeah I mix it up there's plenty of dudes it'll suck it you know what I mean probably yeah good job probably big number go to Germany go to Germany West Hollywood up street but the question is like do they get suicidal because they're not accepted early in life I think the real question because this is what a lot of the thought is is that they develop their self-esteem when they're very young and what they're you very and there a boy and they wish they were a girl and then they get picked on together or they get fucked with for that that becomes like this very very awful connection with this terrible memory and this terrible feeling that you feel around people who who hate you just because you're different and then you are as an adult and then who knows what else comes into play there right but also hate crimes on transgenders through her fucking lose man yeah yeah like even Kristin back who's a former Navy SEAL and now she um she's a woman she takes hormones out but I don't think chopper takeoff we talk about a Navy SEAL killed ton of fucking people she was saying she was walking on streams some guys came up behind her and hit her over the head with a bottle just for being transgender knocked her out on the street Jesus Christ fucking terrible man yeah yeah man there's just there's just a lot of people that are developed in a really fucked-up way you know they've just seen too many awful things you bad childhood and think about all these all the people in this country right now that are growing up in horrible neighborhoods and what's gonna happen out of them what's gonna what's gonna what's gonna happen these people you read these stories about Chicago and parts of the Southside Chicago or they just shootings like 100 in a weekend that kind of crazy shit you know if you lived in a place like that like something was so there was a comic who's said something I apologize to forgot who it was who said something like this on Twitter about how you get he's a black comic too he was saying that PTSD is not just for soldiers like you get it when you grow up in the hood that makes sense you see a lot of shit that you shouldn't you shouldn't see you're around a lot of violence around a lot you're gonna grow up with a different perspective when you were little shocked and um I mean that's that's a crazy way to develop you know super crazy well thank God for all these pills that you could take I don't know if those are the answer are they all right thing but I think the answer for some people sometimes I think yeah yes yes some people are on hanging on by a thread they're hanging out on by a thread and someone comes along and they offer them a chemical escape from the just a fucking sheer misery of being alive and then it puts them in a place where they can think about things does it where they can think about cuz when you hear like Neal Brennan or about Neal Brennan well fucking most brilliant comedian Minds out there writing wrote for Chappelle's Show brilliant comic has special on Netflix three mics brilliant and he talks about how you know when he takes those those pills the prescriptions everything like you don't get high doesn't get low it's just he's going through it like you talked about his accomplishments he's like yeah does nothing like I don't feel anything Oh like they don't feel anything man that's Tara we're way to go well don't you know depression again like like what we're talking about earlier it's it's on a spectrum just like mental illness just like all kinds of other different things that current people because everyone deals with depression we've all been depressed in but some people sticks like you can't get out of it how about an anti conspiracy theory pill or you could take a blue pill unique on the weekends false flags go out and just have fun and dude Ari Shaffir oi the norms of fear used this is why I have its opinion on this Ari Shaffir used antidepressants correctly and he had tried a couple different kinds and figure out which one really worked for him but once he did it helped him I saw it helped and he's a happy guy he turned his life around he see he got on the antidepressants and he talks about this openly or yes successful too though right he got success which helps as well he's still on him but who knows what came first the chicken or the egg no he weaned himself off of them but he got on them and they helped him why did he have to wean himself off if they helped because he didn't think that he needed him anymore he thought that he was leaning on them as a crutch and he would kind of reset his mind and change your way of thinking yeah yeah and he you know he and I talked about it I'm a mom trying to remember exactly but essentially was what are you saying I'm gonna be at Olympia the other tastiest Olympia it's delicious there's something about beer in a can I don't know what it is my mouth was watering like a crackhead yeah yeah but with art it's like success to make you happy like fuck I'm chilling it man he's killing it he's killing it and I'm sure that had something to do with it so maybe I think Donna discounted but I think there's a lot of things going on the depression a lot of the thing you can't it's hard to narrow things down plus or minus and and thinking that it's one thing that's causing you to be happy or one thing that's caused you to be sad it's very likely there's a bunch of different shit going on yeah you got you got a reminder yeah every day of how lucky you are yes tough it's tough it's not realistic really not really you could do it it's just like working out you know what I mean it's the same thing you could put yourself an hour hour and a half thinking one way I'm gonna work out I'm gonna I'm gonna fucking focus on on getting stronger today focus on the reps and all the sets and my routine you apply that to you know just for 15 minutes just think about all the shit you've accomplished think about the money you have think about how lucky you are that you don't live in fucking Liberia or Guatemala or some shit you could be in that Caravan right now with the backpack throwing rocks you know what I mean it's tough if you if you really and this is that's the real shit though that's right that's not an illusion the real shit is that you should be thankful the fake shit is not being thankful that's the fake shit that's that's the lucious not because because you show you're so caught up in like your daily life stuff like that but do you know what I mean you know how quickly you would appreciate your life if you got framed for murder right now just right now all of a sudden your life would be a little bit scared with my son and it was like nothing else mattered yes exactly what's that happen all right away take my career take this perfect and Porsche whatever you want man just make him break it I was like a portrait for real yeah I'm like please make sure he's okay I don't give a shit yeah damn that's course like if you found out you had five minutes to leave to live all you would think about is your kid that's all you would think about well I just got evacuated I got evacuated from a house because the fires there everywhere especially you're a brother they're everywhere they're there in they evacuated like Thousand Oaks and they evacuated places in Westlake massacres now apparently this fire that we have here is nothing in comparison to the fire that's in upstate West further up northern the the Northern California fire is supposed to be even more severe they were saying that Northern California fire was moving at what was the number of something insane like 80 football fields a minute wasn't that whole label that the biggest fire in California ever the biggest fire going on right now Northern California it's in Northern California you know it's craziest as how damaged cars are getting they're like melted cars are melt if it was a bus this bus that looked like it was bombed like I was how were fired we know how it's learning that I don't know choice the worst when it's like some fucking asshole started it I don't know I don't know if they know yeah Rick I don't know if they know direct energy weapons right outside of Rocketdyne that's where it happened which is uh it's like a rocket have you seen those pictures of the cars with their the rims are melting yeah how hot do four spires get they get hot spot that would still know me a lot of aluminum a lot of aluminum wheels the frame doesn't so really regular fire melts aluminum just a regular fire will melt your tires a couple factors here that I would just take into account not being a fire expert but one of them want to think would be tires tires are super flammable once your tires catch fire they're all made out of rubber and all kinds of their plastics and shit they hold the fire just fucking flammable they go black smoke it's a crazy smoke that's why the cartel use them when they kill people that put me on that I can keep I don't like don't think douse them with like lighter fluid I gotta say is gasoline cars are fueled by gasoline gasoline there you got fire you got insane heat the whole car gets engulfed the gas tank erupts you got fuckin temperatures that are like it's like basically having an inferno right there it's not like it's not a fire like Oh a fucking phone book caught on fire and it melted a wheel no it's like a giant combustion engine that works on gasoline and has these rubbers from or flammable tires and it's covered by a plastic paint that's probably flammable and flammable and this shit all gets hit insides of leather with fire that's coming from 50 mile-an-hour winter fire machines that I know what about it like the the registration what did you serious look at these cars these cars got murked this is like what happened when she met locally on the Avengers they fucking destroyed Eddie the heat makes them shatter they fall apart if you ever get a glass too hot you ever have a glass get too hot fuck no if you pour tea in a regular glass they crack so that's not even that hot because it tea makes them expand the the heat from the tea you're not buying it already I don't know man well these fires are where the headline says anything I don't believe it anything okay anything that's true Eddie that's Trudy but here's the beautiful thing about this fire you can fucking see it you don't have to one on fire I'm just saying like the how it started this is what we're talking about we're talking about this fire okay no there's a liar for sure giant I see the smoke so we're not saying I don't know there's some crazy people out there saying that they're being started by some fucking direct energy weapons I don't know that's what the crazy people were saying fires happen all the time though it's kind of a networker what what's more likely that fires are happening like they always fucking happen from electric boxes going out or wires going down Kampai be an asshole cigarettes that's how firefight before there was Illuminati before there was anything there was forest fires they've been around forever this is not like a new occurrence it's not like they're using this secret energy weapon to do some shit that's never been done before how dumb would their super energy weapon if they use it to start fire there's just a lot of weird shit out there like houses like you can see house house house completely leveled and all the trees around them nothing wrong with the trees at all weird because weird shit like that well it's I don't know what that's for the fire to make fucking houses go up in flames because it's all dry old shit so dry right wood you got dry old shit on the tile your Styles a lot of times these people have these these roofing tiles and the embers get in between there goes right into the tar it burns it it goes right through your my next door neighbor is his roof was on fire no they they they got to it in time the firefighters caught it actually my friend bud caught it told the firefighters to pump blood Brett's been yeah his house no no no it wasn't his house but it was my neighbor's house so when when this was all going down this is happening all throughout not just here but all throughout Topanga now and Malibu and these embers fall from the sky and then they boof they light everything up in flames because everywhere you look everything is dry it's trash shit we haven't had any rain in a long-ass time if you go running in the trails it's just dust you're kicking up dust there's it you start calling then you got the winds that's spreads all of it everything's brown the dry sian today and when these embers fall from the sky and hit this shit it just starts up we're just lucky it doesn't happen more often in fact though it happened this time last year around here because we had we had ash out in the the gym area we had to sweep the ash out because it had actually come in through cracks like little tiny cracks I've asked although my house from from this fire all the way where Hama I'm sure I'm sure it's no joke dunno it's excessive so I don't think it's an energy wave but I do think it's fucking super dangerous to live in a climate where there's this much vegetation and not enough moisture like how come we can't figure out how to get that fucking water out of the ocean and start spraying but although so much water and you know it's just so much you know what there salt in it we can't fuck with it we can't fuck with that song fuck with the salt no no they have desalination plants are just too expensive yeah it's too expensive we can't afford they say though this is the almond the home in fact if we only had more money we'd be able to do that but it's too expensive the ocean water no they use all our water if you get rid of almonds in California would be straight yeah but the almonds bro vegans consumed more almonds and then they were there the reason imagine how ironic that would be is there's almonds that were doing us in the whole time it's not cattle raising is fucking almonds is there a country rich enough to filter the salt out of water and use the water for their country or is it was just too expensive I bet Dubai could do that shit they would roll out a carpet made of gold to do it slide a gold surface like for the Navy there's like a survivor filter that you could drink the the seawater and you could like suck and it's like this filter the survival thing you drink piss so they have those things for ponds they have these things they're called SteriPEN they just can't figure at sea water and this what's the high salt content you can expensive you can't have that much salt content your watch we have a water tax you know to me we're running out of water we got to figure out how to take the salt out of the sea water I don't think this is a to have plenty of fresh water though I don't think this is a conspiracy no you just know you just take the fucking ocean water and I was just being funny I'll tell you why they can it's fucking super expensive money to change the water and to do it all the time for all the people just pull that water out then who owns maybe if we bring some from Central America and we generate incoming that way imagine if we started sucking all the stuff out of the ocean the ocean started pushing back and then people started building houses in front of the people's houses in Malibu and at first they would propose to go fuck you we have the beach yeah yeah yeah but it's not the beach anymore so basically just got an acre like a mile to the beach now and you know all these Malibu people they show up at the fucking County Board meetings he'd turn around behind him it's a goddamn tropical jungle we got monkeys in LA we turned it into the tropics we make it moist and delicious that would happen dishwashers Abby's I'm gonna go fight real quick dari she's a monster yeah he's just felt falling on hard times a little bit he was ranked fucking high for a while he's a very good fighter yeah so good at everything just very good magic he had a tough loss right his last fight yeah he followed us tomorrow stopped him yes Michael Johnson recently but I forget who's Amy can you pull up in neil darish is um he had a talk about on the ground amazing fucking striking I do not know much about this yeah he's fighting I mean he's a you say his name Moises Oh Thiago Moises he's from ATT he fought in EBI combat jujitsu oh no shit how good is he it was hard to tell from one match but he's a black belt he's from American Top Team so he's got to be a fucking beast that's a deep one no it's Amit Wow that was tight though he got a owed by Edson Barboza that's what we're thinking about by a flying knee and then Alexander Hernandez in his last fight killed him with punches but he's beat some good guys like James shake he not oh look at that Thiago Moises he's gone for us going for us fucking tough to submit him it's going to be but man he I think yes it took his back and strangled him yeah do I love chess at 70 yeah he did he did right yeah she said seven I can be trouble I think he just was killing himself made 255 yeah he's a wide fellas sturdy fella big dude big friend he's meat really good at 70 he's he get four guys problems you know where I was doing commentary with Paul Felder you know and I'm standing next to Paul felted I'm thinking how about fuck are you a hundred fifty five he gets mad too people say you know this guy over here he's 200 pounds okay I was 192 last to my bad he'll get upset the toys you try to gain an extra 10 pounds on him he's just a big lightweight he's a big boy he's a powerhouse dude he and think about that Mike Perry's last fight last win Mike Geary can outclassed him well what happened was he bounced his forearm off a Mike Perry's head early on in the fight he's spinning backfist to them and hit him with this part of the forearm right in the forehead and snapped his arm and his arm so he's fighting with one I thought like that for three races but he couldn't wrestle okay so he couldn't shoot takedowns to do anything with his right arm he punched him with it a bunch of times even though it's still broken and he was trying to punch with his leg was in fucking agony this it's not just about power right it's about knowing that this shit doesn't work anymore and you're gonna check grant and yeah you got a guy trying to rip your head off and Mike pairs a monster super strong 170 he's a beast he's super aggressive he comes at you real hard he takes a tremendous shot he's got a fuckin iron chin and horrifying knockout it's a tough matchup for the Jake Ellenberger elbow that hello Jesus he's got real power but any you know the guillotine but Paul felt it was kind of Mike Perry's first win where he's technical and stays on the outside hanging on that neck yeah and then before that though like Alan Joe bayen beat'em was super technical I think the move to Jackson's has had a giant impact on him because what I saw in his last fight I saw him managed distance much better and pace he wasn't just like a marauding psycho going after throwing feint he's mixing it up we can go set it up it was like very good footwork well it was very technical so I think he's adding a lot more technique and strategy to what he already had which is our serious power and a serious aggression can he had skills already so now you couldn't punch it's not like you couldn't you know but he's kind of one-dimensional a little bit but just so wild yeah so reckless and so so hungry to fuck you would you beat a lot of guys to get to a certain level right and they can deal with but kudos to him for recognizing Oh brilliant yeah making some adjustments and I think he definitely did make an adjustment in that felder fight he looked amazing so it was on him he made the adjustment and he obviously put in the work and looked great and it was also on Felder breaking his arm pretty early on the fine arm but even before he broke his arm Perry was getting the better of the exchanges he was more dangerous it's like there was more consequences he's a he's a fucking scary knockout artist stylistic wise for cowboy it's a tough fight it's well we both think that Cowboys at his best when he doesn't have to he doesn't have to fight guys that are that much bigger than him you know I would rather real aggressive guys tougher yeah boy I would rather see him at 155 than see him fight Darin till again there was something about seeing him with Darin till we see how big Darin is at 170 he's fucking big man he's big he even talked about going to 85 and I think he's going to 85 now and you look at he went back away he changed his mind yeah he's like a thing would go back to 70 cuz he was gonna fight Askren at 70 I've done they gave asking Robbie Lawler but both fights are love but you know that guy's just he was so much bigger than cowboy he was so much bigger way but when you looked at him in there I mean he looked like he was two weight classes bigger at least one weight class Barry's lease on the upper end of the next weight class Lawler makes sense what are you talking about fuck yeah the reason that make sense you make sense notice he's gonna be hard to take down and he's fuckin vicious with this so it's a perfect night so the night of the fight I dig it but the thing that makes Ben Askren special too is his you know his mouth his mind came so Robbie's not gonna play that game he doesn't have a dance partner that's what makes it great is that he can't be can't what what is he gonna do this is the fashion lover and get broken no no hold up no this this is the Dana White me talking this the moneymaker me the your boys the exact same way let me here because if you give Ben a stirring who can talk fucking right up there with the best we got man if you give him a guy you know you name anybody you get with anyone in the fight game and he goes back and forth he's gonna be great you can kobe commenting who's a shit talker yeah the fans are gonna be able to gravitate towards that see the story there's our first fight that's the first this is only one fight it's a basically the shit talking aside you're right with the shit talking for sure X's and O's amazing fight night love the fight the the physicality of the fight is that a word probably what I'll tell you it's probably Jamie's right physicality that's a word oh yeah it seems right come on man that's the easy for Ben that's hard no there's no every fight is easy for him he just grabs everybody well man I'm saying for the Russian got same to take full advantage of what Ben Askren brings to the table Robbie Lawler is not the match about give them off the bat I already gave them a dare until or Colby Cummington something like that who will verbally go back up to the night of the fight amazing fight I don't think I think you just want to see the fight I don't think we should ever make decisions based on shit talking and encouraging shit talking I think what's interesting about Ben Askren is Ben Askren I want to see what the fuck he can do to real former world champion we're hardcore who's fought at the highest level that's a great great match I'm with you guys I love Robbie LAN sense I think Robbie loves the legend whether he talks back no one's gonna give a shit look Ben Askren when he was that's not the way we live in Joe Ben Askren when he was at the UFC they put a camera on him and the crowd went nuts he hasn't even fought in the UFC yet everybody knows about him from the internet a lot of people know about him from you and me yeah a lot of people know about him from Bellator fans and one Fc fans I think people didn't realize how fucking popular he is and now people wanna see what an undefeated undefeated wrestler who dominated guys like Lima and chorus carve in Bellator still hasn't dominated I want don't you want to see what the fuck that guy can do and if you don't want to see what that guy can do against the fucking ruthless one Robbie Lawler Robbie Lawler is not done man right no he's not done he's loved Jason he's a legendary he's always scary man he's had multiple like periods in his career he had the Strikeforce period in the UFC period here the championship period you know he had his younger wild daisies why he's fallen on some hard times lately he's not the greatest Robbie Lawler is not the greatest wrestler of all time he's fucking to wrestle growing up and what the equalizer are his fucking hands dude everything you could say he's you know he's like right in there you know a decent wrestler but it's fucking hands denouncement takes down and it's anybody near see he may be but maybe but he might finding out he's gonna be entertaining his fuck dude again you I think you guys coming at me like I don't think it's a great fight I'd love the fight no ice I just went ah man I'll get him Kobe come ten I would again that's coming that's coming this is after the first two-time world champ but or or Robbie Lawler gets cubby kobe covington if he wins no that's a great way to for Robbie to get back into the mix and Plus you don't want to make it easy on Ben Askren cuz you know everyone's go yeah this two out of the UFC organization champ let's see what he's made of Robbie lodged a tough fucking test good takedown defense but it gives rotation - reset - if Robbie can beat him no Robbie didn't have a good fight with ha failed dos Anjos but he did have a good fight with cowboy right those were the last two fights he had I believe am I right about that he lost dos Anjos and cowboy he lost at dos Anjos right as Askren fought anybody at Lawler's level no no right no Lima Douglas Lima but I was a young girl EEMA younger Lima same horse cops a fuckin monster but he's but both those guys he dominated themselves they were young wala brings in wrestling and ferocious striking also I mean he fought warriors he fought some of the best the best I mean he's one of the best the best I'm interested Danny can add is there something about Lawler that asking can talk shit about so what can you say nothing and everyone let there's a few guys you can't talk shit about it's freaking Robbie Lawler Dan Henderson Matt Hughes like you just can't remember people starting there before tyron woodley beat him people thought he was the boogeyman who Robbie Lawler a huge get his shit out of people I'll never forget Dana White at the Comedy Store in like 2002 or three and he's like in these we're back were at the parking lon Dana White went to see you and he's the graving about this new kid oh my god I got this new kid Robbie Lawler he's ferocious he's a wrestler was just knocking everybody out on the local level you're gonna hear a lot about Robbie Lawler I'll never forget that it might be long enough like 2001 2002 suddenly talk about a Hall of Famer legit Hall of Famer yeah so for sure it's the toughest opponent of Ben Askren square or yeah I would say it's the toughest but for sure no I have to validate to reach them I have to be totally honest I never watched his fights in 1 FC I'd never figured out that with the Russian wrestler yeah there's one guy it's the best way I mean I just saw I just saw highlights I saw I didn't watch one of see either one as soon as he puts his hands on his something's up but he has Bionic hands or something because as soon as he's able to get his hands on he just doesn't let go and I'm not gonna say names you down I'm not gonna say names but he's a giant Kebede he does that to everybody guys we know that our dude grabbed I mean everybody yeah that's exactly what I hear he's a big why you and I both we went on like a goddamn campaign to get that motherfucker on the podcast was great too cuz people get to see who he actually is you know because you want a guy like number lock and these little shit talking blurbs that's not really this guy an asshole who is this guy but then you sit with him for an hour and he's fun he's fucking smarter ticular really well-educated looks like a Greek statue right doesn't yeah how about take a shot like no one man he takes fucking knees when he shoots and gets clipped with knees not good enough we're the greatest fighters there's there's a couple others that used to used to campaign for the greatest fighters that never fought in the UFC Ben Askren is one black guy a black guy black guy who's never fought in the UFC not Sam campaign for for 10 fucking years in it was the oh yeah but now wasn't really fighting that much MMA outside of pride rules right like he did he fought anywhere else he fucking knock you into another dimension or he's gonna get choked out yeah but either way it's you bring him in why didn't you just fight with Robbie Lawler how come we never got Melvin interview because you wanted him in that's how it was no once you suggest the fire that's their never coming out ah yes got it bro that's the way it's different Dana fucking over no Ben Dana hated been better after them they hated the induction online yeah they went back and forth each other's brilliant Dana blocked him on Twitter yes but now he's in I got ahold of Dana and I said he's a nice guy I said he's a fun guy what if he shared at the end of part special fan becomes she's going to listen they're gonna be happy they made this house is Ben he's not that old he's 35 thirties early thirties 34 he's still he's been doing for a hot minute but he's still fuck people yes zero damage he didn't take a punch in his last two fights hasn't taken a punch in for at like you look at the month it's been has everything cracked solid yeah he's been hit pretty hard decision and he I remember some up who's telling me about I don't want to speak out of school so I want him to say what he's I don't remember what he said but there was an issue in his camp but this he was also striking a lot and he's like what the fuck am i doing I'm not gonna go in there and do this and then change his whole demeanor just like I'm thinking everybody down I'm not gonna get hit Koine whether she's out here on you know he's he's got real talent I mean Jay here on lost to some really good guys like George st. Pierre and tyron woodley but Jay herons a tough fighter and he's got a good mix of wrestling and grappling and it was a wrestling and striking rather and it was enough wrestling to get back up when he was stuck on the bottom or to prevent takedowns or fight him off and they were looking at this man here this nice little skin reversal yeah so he can actually wrestle a bit too and he hit him with a nice punch there so Jay here on the spinning back kick yeah so Jay Heron is a tough guy man yeah he's a real wrestler and he's also got a lot of experience and had a lot of experience striking that was after he fought Georges st. Pierre right yes yes believe so for sure I can see if that's correct that's correct cuz I know Jay that's after he they fought after he got released from the UFC yes so anyway that was like the toughest test of his UFC career but apparently there was another fight that he had in one Fc now this is I'm getting this completely secondhand and I apologize but I'm just I didn't think we're gonna talk about this I didn't prepare this or anything like that but I think someone was telling me that he fought some dude and the fight got stopped by an eye poke but that it was a tough fight the Russian cat it might have been the Russian cat look at that look at this fight damn it there uses triangle oh my goodness I don't know if this is true this is just my guess and I think the first person to utilize that body triangle offensively at a high level in competition with Jean Jacques Machado abu-dhabi he was the first one I know there's old pictures of catch wrestling with guys and body triangles from the back but in high-level competition recorded historical high level competition Abu Dhabi Jean Jacques Machado fucking ran through guys putting that body triangle on the back I remember asking him when he got back from Abu Dhabi why were you putting a figure four lock you know while you're on the back why not just use the regular leg hooks and he said and when you're gone nogi is so slippery you know and he goes you got a lock in the hips and from that point on that changed my game I'm like ok I guess when I get the back that's gonna be my main focus is putting a triangle a body triangle on and that was 1998-99 people don't know how much well everybody knows you're a Jean Jacques black belt but a lot of people don't know how much John chalk style of noogie is what influenced you to come up with a lot of the positions and moves from tenth planet not only me but marcelo garcia Jean Jacques Machado was the first marcelo garcia of the abu dhabi historical archive he was the first one because when you look at marcelo garcia and no doubt marcelo garcia when you're talking about the greatest grappler of all time you know marcelo garcia is right there in the conversation can easily be number four to say number one would it be Hickson i'm gonna say marcelo garcia jean-jacques nixon number one row haja gracie half a mendes you know that level but the first one in Abu Dhabi was jean-jacques when you look at what he did he was using X card and he was getting the bag putting the body triangles on the back was his shit and then Marcelo came and he was using X card - not that you know I'm not taking anything away from our seller Garcia everybody anybody that knows me knows that I've given marcelo garcia more props and fucking anybody living i you don't have to explain that he is one of the greatest of all time yeah and so is John Jacques they're both two of the greatest of all time there's a lot of that group jean-jacques was the first Abu Dhabi legend as far as finishing goes and you know many submissions because in those early Abu Dhabi's you had a bunch of wrestlers who were masters at controlling human beings without clothing but they didn't know how to pass and they didn't wanna finish and then on the flip side you had Brazilians who are masters of passing the guard and finishing their opponents but they didn't really know how to do it as well without the ghee so you had a lot of stale mating going on and a lot of bickering and and bantering back and forth about the rules set and all that and for the first couple of years like people you know you had the jujitsu guys stale mating with the wrestlers and there's all this grease and all this sweat flying everywhere and then enter jean-jacques and his first his first year in Abu Dhabi he submits everybody and gets the gold medal so at that point people I what the fuck this guy doesn't even have fingers on his left hand how did he come in to Abu Dhabi and tap everybody and win the gold medal what is Abu ZAR was still big like really big yeah we just had the trial it's still big weeks ago and it was the biggest trials of all the fun the trial there's like 60 70 people in each division biggest shit it's bigger than ever just to switch complete gears to how about that bare knuckle boxing I finally caught Watson did you guys see this not oniy hard Phil Baroni yeah Hendricks got knocked out but I watch like exciting shit was bas Rutten doing yeah yeah it was pretty exciting mayor just boxing just fucking boxer knuckle boxing you know you guys always talk about gloves and shit we do to get fucked up you should be all over that shit ya know start our own league bro para knuckle box is it on the states are Russian was here listen don't give me a job Brenda job dude I hope they do it anything that bas Rutten is attached to I don't laugh or do how about bare-knuckle MMA that's next right well it should be tough it should be boxing happen how how

honey I just wanted a sound I wanted to hear what the best stereo sounds like yeah it sounds but didn't you say that word for word give me the figure out what to do just do the best shit like what sounds the best what car was it in that was a Porsche 962 beau yeah and and you're a barracuda and you're accurate oh yeah like the high-level NSX back in the day this was like bars and we're at jujitsu and he he had a bucket handle tear and he couldn't walk because you gotta take me to the Prolotherapy people and I had a drivers in a sec but he's fucking holding his MRI yeah yeah I got you bro there you go I actually lied and I didn't know I was a Ford Pinto with those little tiny sports caveats one of those for a medical dude for a month I was driving around at 19 with the little two-seater yellow Fiat car I'm the fucking man until it broke down like all Fiats do and I drove it for a month we could never figure out how to fix that motherfucker feel it Fiat repairman dude nobody was not a lot of shit it was a mid-engine dude that thing was so like it was a piece fix it again Tony that's what Fiat stands for dude there was one that was when that car broke down I realized who my friends really were nobody wanted to come pick me up for parties exhaust and I said one night I started crying partying everyone was going on like kind of far how far and I was the one picking 20 25 minutes two dozen why do you think I mean yeah you're cool but 25 minutes is a long way fuck this girl you realize how important cars with up on blocks in my garage and nobody could figure dude how great is this they're doing the throwback logos in that dope fifth anniversary this is the first time Jemaine - Ron to me is fine yeah yeah how crazy is that so and then there's Raquel Pennington who's just a beast top five breakdown okay check this out well how sexist is the UFC think about this Oh joking way this is a joking way but when when Raquel Pennington fun Amanda Nunez the one thing they had in common was they both had girlfriends that were UFC fighters they don't touch I mean everything was fine everything was going it should be cool but can you imagine if there was two male fighters or Gatien for the belt and they both had boyfriends fighters damn how crazy is that we don't we don't get like that sexist though because we don't let guys do that we're okay with girls don't we did it so UFC want to give a fuck if DC and John were gay they still be didn't care you don't think you know you think they would be okay with that hundred percent you think so as long as they're winning fights they don't care but here's what you have to take into consideration I don't think there's been any suppression of gay fighters and promotions there hasn't been enough promotion it's probably super hard for some gay guys to get acceptance in gyms it's gotta be a gay gym right it's gotta be a game runs a gym super open new trainers gotta be gay promise fight cultures old culture and that old old culture from the boxing days and a lot of wrestling days like there's this thought of you know it's not the most progressive concept that uh you know gay guys whoa holy shit girl Pennington that's the quality don't isn't it this is my theory the theory that so there's a there's a disproportionate amount of female lesbian fighters having success in the UFC and this is my this is my theory you know you know why you know this is my theory is they're training camps are not disruptive if they were heterosexual everybody would be making moves on them their dietitian exactly kick boxing trainer everybody's gonna be trying to make moves on them when they're lesbian everybody just treats them like a guy no no this is real this is really home I think there's just some women like to fight it maybe more lesbians like to fight this true more drawn to it straight women like to fight I think there's I think they're camps are less disruptive cuz you take a girl okay let's just take a girl looks like let's take us small thank us the best in history let's take a UFC fighter that looks as good as paid TransAm you know she's just like that imagine all the dick that's gonna be thrown at her every day the diamonds you wanna Cairo proxy single key imagine the drama involved trust me I'm in the fucking fight game the girls are getting if you're a heterosexual girl and you're in the in the near ha you're on I do jitters being a hot marine exactly but if you're lesbian and you're hardcore guys still dude aren't gonna go for it they're gonna treat you like a dude you're gonna have a drama-free training camp and a school you're gonna say you're gonna think this small you gotta stick with the school oh look at all the lesbian fighters the best of history drama drama cyborgs what you're saying is - you're correct what you say is correct but this is just a factor there's a bunch of fat she's beautiful rose yeah fighters are lesbian I'm just saying there's a disproportionate amount of top fighters they're a lesbian and I think that's because you know when you look at Rose namajunas got a gigantic gorilla boyfriend they will fucking stomp on Mary yes Rose namajunas was single can you imagine all the dick they would be flying at her like she'd be doctor shit like the matrix respectfully you're right right whatever says there's less drama dude cos in jujitsu not even striking arrested just in jujitsu heterosexual girls hold on exactly exactly even women are physical at an MMA gym there's way more contact with a guy and a girl and I don't know jujitsu girls are more prone to switch jujitsu schools then she's gotta die right because they start dating a guy from another school and then go you know what let me go train at that school on Saturdays they start training on the school on Saturdays and then the guys at their school die why are you trading over there and but dudes don't do that but the girls do that because it's you know because they're heterosexual a little bit I'm not saying it's a BB Island off I don't think do UFC highlights a man in nuna's enough being lesbian she should be on fucking every poster in West Hollywood no Raquel Pennington who's a beast beeps shit I think about disaster man unless the muses marketable think about the music biz god there's a disproportionate amount of of all I would say 90% of my favorite singers are gay I love other singers yeah singer Peter fucking oh I'm not even gonna say his name I don't want to bust anybody out I'm just gonna say we don't know yeah who knows a Freddie Mercury whatever but what I'm saying is there's a disproportionate amount of gay vocalist out there right think about currently though you would think of people that perform on Broadway you think that at least healthy percentage think about this we all know this we all know this in the music industry there's a lot of gay music producers yes and music executives write us and they do creepy shit right not because they're gay just because they're guys guys do creepy shit and you're gonna do creepy shit with girls or if you're gay you're gonna do creepy shit with guys well to use religious report there's a disproportionate amount of gay singers out there and how is a heterosexual singer gonna compete with the gay singer so you know when they're ready to suck dick at the drop of a fucking hat you know what I mean well how bad you wanna be bad so what are you saying with a lot of guys I'm not saying anything I'm just saying there's a lot of gay singers and there's a lot of gay and I love gay singers most of my favorites in this way are you saying that the same way that like of a gal was trying to get into the music business she could potentially run into some unscrupulous males in the business who prey on young girls trying to enter it to the business exactly same case for young guys yeah with gay guys if they're gay they're willing to suck that producers dick and if they're not if they're straight it's gonna be harder so I do the band's like bass players and drummers do we need a gay singer to get a deal up in this so they look for gay singers that's I don't know the music engine oh shit look at that Germaine de round everyone - that was nasty dress you know one of the worst champions of all time but it's fucking skilled now oh dude really high levels to us to end up a 14-time world championship very very good striking but did not want nothing to do with cyborg isn't that fascinating not like you know I have good my hand hurt dude Holly seems to be here well here's why I agree with you Holly clanged her with a question mark kick and dropped her she had her stunned with that and then she dropped her with straight left hand those are two hugely significant moments the only significant moment really well there was Germain hitter after the bell twice twice and I think the second time you should have taken a point away because it was it was they were hurting her did the last one she landed after the bell I think it was was it the second round oh shit a German looks like a solid fucking striker champion dude she lesbian no she's a multiple time world champion her kickboxing is out of this world man she had some insane kickboxing record Jamie pauper I'm surprised they gave Raquel panthan this fight not just an awful beast man not when it comes well she's just fighting a woman who's just way better than her it was Amanda fucking record those are all wins son the world champion dude oh holy shit yeah dude and she's lanky she's got wide shoulders no nightmare to deal with thing man here's the thing why didn't she want cyborg because she doesn't wanna stop fuck out cyber wars too big cyborg she said was a perineum what she what she calls jeroid user so shit was she had like a like I don't want to I don't want to misquote she was scared scared was like you know I'll vacate the belt fuck that noise I only go by paraphrasing she essentially was saying that cyborg is cheated and that she's used steroids I don't know what she wanted for us and she said because that she didn't want to fight her first shit her hand hurt then she's like you know if I won this she said she needed thumb surgery and she didn't she brought that up like immediately when I asked her about fighting I Borg but I think signboards the boogie woman to these people that's what I think I think she's so much bigger than everybody else I mean she's cutting down from 175 180 Seibert beat the shape she get up shake it up shake it up there bro she's a big woman - 135 no 45 45 dude you don't wanna fuck with her there's no vibe with that girl think about how big Connor is Connors walking around at 170 s right he used to cut down to 145 yeah just think about that now cyborg is you basically somewhere in that same range that's what's going on yeah that's huge that's a lot of weight a lot of weight to cut someone to 170 and maybe a me maybe even during the offseason - she gets even heavy though Oh Sharonda me just hit her with a fucking nasty straight left dude how about the fucking Amanda Nunez cyborg fight end of December John's John's best fencing I think it's too small too small looks so nasty I gotta get out of here I gotta go 0:10 Planet 15-year anniversary gonna perform Sam tripley's gonna perform Steve Simone Lee syat Bobby Slayton what time's it start it starts at right now damn did you were there that first day 15 years ago no that's not time flies like a motherfucker to us dude dude I have so many black belts it's incredible I got today we had a business meeting because this weekend is the 10th planet Eclipse weekend we do it every year and we have the holiday party we have a quintet a 10 vs 10 show that

which is the straw wait girls man did you get a legit business I just don't I'm surrounded by dudes who can kill me they're all around them like these motherfuckers if they wanted to they could just and life right now you show no it's pretty crazy your master splits bread a bunch of turtles I got fucking budget or insanity all around me you know shit ever hits the fan you know you want to be hanging out with you Jitsu clans that's for goddamn sure well unless it's a fire you two people are generally more calm because they're going to war all the time they get all that shit out of their system they're way more chill you know they're way more non-food how easy it would be just to put someone in a rear naked choke and he's like you know what yeah you know if you don't train if you don't train if you don't training you're not a doctor you don't know you're doing if you're not a doctor or some kind of MacGyver and you don't train we're gonna have to eat you to what you said before the podcast was so funny about the apocalypse that homeless people are gonna be psyched are waiting for the end of the world is not gonna change might get better we'll see you get crown dudes and favelas if you live in a favela you don't have to worry about the end of the world because it's already the end of the world for ya you know you already mastered you don't most people that are walking around pushing shopping carts with all those plastic bags hanging off them they're probably most likely mentally ill batshit crazy we're all probably okay ultra throw aways probably child trafficking some of them have to be some throw away because we all know trafficking is going on and like what happens to these people you know a lot of them are veterans that's where it gets really super doubt of them are veterans a lot a lot of veterans come home they don't know what the fuck to do and you know all that scared me sit could be McGregor but it says now available on 5s dude you're the best Congrats man yeah I'll call you later brother house weather we later letter dude to sit over here off yeah it's gonna be weird right thank you bro driver yeah in the back friend and you have an extra friend the friends at the front seat and that friend leaves and the friend the back seat stays in the back seat okay man you got to get up here fuck this dude damn Jemaine - Rhonda me look spooky she's so dangerous because she doesn't do anything wrong you know it's so calculated well it's super like super technical with her movements - and she's basically playing like a a rhythm dance she's forcing Raquel into movements but she has the solutions to those movements like several steps ahead yeah but here's the thing Joe think about how many more fights Duran amis been in yeah Kal Penn I mean Utah not even cold remotely cold not advanced factor at a high level Pennington would have to really struggle to take her down she's a 145 ER and Penningtons been fighting at 135 you know and Germain dropped down to 35 for this fight right is this a 35 or 45 this is 35 so Germain dropped back down to 35 after that 145 pound fight oh shit head kick so she's strong for the weight class and it didn't benefit the tough record - a salty six and five or some shit she's as tough as they come you know one of my favorite finishes ever was her vs. Ashlee evans-smith cuz it was just this wild fucking is good and then she catches her in a bulldog choke and puts her unconscious like a sack the last fight in Debra - was she's from Colorado Springs so they usually put on the Denver cards I think I'm a fan I'm a fan - she's just so damn tough man but duranta me I just I hate this matchup for after fucking Amanda Nunez well it's just that uppercut goddamn it's scary because it's it's real similar and maybe you know Duran Damini is even more more lethal with all the different things I'm not hating at all but her enemy looks identical to the guy in kickboxer that beats the fuck out of John Klatt Van Dam's friend the scary dude is kicking the walls she's so detached but think about the random e that makes her just see for sure Amanda Nunez has more power and she'll assault you and she's more aggressive and reckless she comes after you a Nunez yes and she's a murder power in one power her hands just our speed and then she's not so black but on the ground she's yeah but I think it's the power it's a difference but Duran to me has the full arsenal you know what I mean like as far as her tech she's a serger time yes that's a good way to put it everything she oliver striking has done so efforts effortlessly it's all efficiently and smooth and there's no like weird like moments where her hands are down she's lunging or footwork balance no the only time she you know struggled severely was against Holly Holm who's also a world-class boxer and tricky because Holly's different than probably a lot of the strikers a chief face like Holly to my people yes she is big she's very strong athletic yeah and she also has got sneaky shit that she does like that question mark kick yeah you know I mean she clanged her right off the head with that with you know that was a big moment because Duran de me was in the beginning of the fight was kind of controlling the pace and controlling the rhythm and Holly had a find her spots and and a lot of people thought she could have won that decision it was it was real close it's a tough spot for Duran to me where they go right now you're fighting sideboard and she's like fuck that man so then you know she is stripped of the title we all shit on her but it's been a tough position well if she has real feelings about this and she really knows something happened well grab the shorts happen hitter in the titty did she go low do they did they take a shot do pause so it took it what happened Jamie what happened I poked a pussy shot was it coming I think is a short offense grabbing the guys a hard time grabbing fencer no but it seems like they giving her a chance to recover god damn it I wish we were paying attention it's soft something happened can we rewind a bit but then we'll fuck everybody oh yeah oh she well dream he just apologized I wonder what it was it seems like a strong shit strong - oh nice neat black but not but doesn't go net lateral notice straight back right still good takedown defense but accepting the fact that clinch is definitely gonna happen as opposed to like now almost once the clinch well almost maybe that you're fired it's also the end of the third and she's been winning all the trounce so she's like cool man stay for me yeah I just knock down myself yeah catch my breath and then get you off me and finish the round strong but she's gonna have a hard time getting wrong dude I'm nervous for these next two fights they yeah ear Korean Zombie ones interesting because yeah there's been out for a hot fucking minute Mary he's basically signed with Bellator mmm-hmm like you go through that whole thing where you turn down the beat fight then they go right for not fighting to beat we're gonna cut you then he's a guy obsess with us assuming and then they're like right you finds a beat that's a beat pulls out 2d set beautiful one right hand left hook right leg kick she's fun to watch man she got a bad rap because that you know some down the cyborg stuff well you know what man it is what that is what it is we've said so much about that there's really no reason to continue to talk about it now it's a buncha stuff when I look at the reality of who they are today cyborg is just way scarier than any of those girls one of the things that makes Amanda Nunez interesting as an opponent for cyborg is first of all her last fight with Raquel Pennington she showed a lot of movement I think she needs a shitload of movement this fight she would need all the moves she needs to be in fucking shape she needs to be in serious shape and she needs to be strong rounds and this is one of the things that a man in noon that said at the press conference press conference press conference is interesting because cyborg was accusing her of I think not fighting her at a previous time and she said she needed more time I think they wanted to try to do those two they did they move on it from Madison Square people trying it for a while Amanda Nunez goes I need more time which I actually like that I like that too because she's the smaller woman coming up as 135 pound champion challenging 145 pound champion she's gonna have to put some weight on so let's keep it on be comfortable with it on and hopefully get above 145 so she can cut a little yeah because the reality of cyborg is she's way bigger she's probably walking or and how many how many pounds bigger would you guess then Amanda just naturally just naturally 2530 buddy what do you think there's a number nice I would like to learn what that number is at least 20 20 to be fair bounce it's entirely possibility to be 20 so if Amanda Nunez is the hundred and thirty five pound Women's Champion what does she actually way we're saying if you see if you think the cyborg is let's give it would to be generous and say it's in the 170s yes and then she cuts down to 145 and we don't know by the way we just have read things I would like to know it let's see if the cyborg has ever commented on what she weighs before she starts her weight cut these right maybe let's get crazy and say it's 160 even 160 would be a lot of weight bigger than a manna Nunez wouldn't you think do you think she weighs 150 when she walks around normally cuts down to 135 ladies she's very strong bigger stuff so jacked just got all that back Power Man when she punches she fucking has the longest punches my favorite but she's she punches so long it's like she's hitting you and she's hitting you way at the end and she's fucking aggressive as shit but so maybe let's say she weighs 145 150 at the most we'll say 50 at the most this I work could be 170 she could be bigger than one saying she's rolling around sixties sixties yeah you think she's in the sixties now or you think she's in the 60s all the time do you think she gets bigger than that and then just from green from talking with her and her manager she walks around at 185 Jesus used to oh oh my gosh I said she was okay this one she's approaching UFC 219 which already happened at 170 what year is this she's at the in the last year interesting before I used to walk around at 180 or 85 and now I'm walking around at 170 it's very different than it that's interesting then before when I was heavy I'm getting to work more and more okay that makes sense what 70 I'm getting to work more and more getting light but I really have to be on top of my weight now so she's decided to stay on top of her weight so she doesn't have to go through so much of a brutal cut which i think is very wise 170 is still a lot of weight that's 25 pounds she fights at 145 she's the 145 pound champion which means even right now she's saying she doesn't cut as much but she cuts 25 pounds man that's how how big she is for the division and I did lock our tips maybe with Dolce is one of those weight coming experts were saying that it's tougher for females mm-hmm that the weight cut gets tougher and tougher cuz the adipose tissue and stuff like that and their hormones and yeah I think that was Lockhart I don't remember I just be bro sign it's right now we are but I don't one of us know jack-shit about fat content nothing especially when it comes to women but I do think that you know there's also unique struggles with women when it's different times of the month you know women get bloated they retain water and sometimes it's hard to get that water out I've also talked to some women I've dated in the past women who do those competitions who cut weight - not for fighting but for like bodybuilding where they do bikini their thyroid czar fucked so then their body it'll shut down but then it goes oh shit we don't do that again so it blows up and it's trying to protect stuff so weight cutting for women the high after time gets tougher and tougher yeah so bad for everybody man it's not good for anybody not good for anybody that's that's why cowboy at 70 I like is 55 look so drawn-out but there's guys like fucking timidly then you know wonder boys fucking huge - like dude he's shorter but he's fucking too thick medic and scary and he swings to try to kill you here's the thing that scares me about this fight with cowboy cowboy needs this right he's a bit of a fork in the road for it first career he's fighting a guy in Mike Perry who's trained with his camp nobody knows cowboy better swatched how we sparred more than people at Jacksons yeah and Kelly needs system there's the whole thing with Mike Wiegele and John whose corner and Perry against cowboy yeah stuff shit situation man but it is for everybody it's just highly charged you know it's highly charged but look both guys are there there it's a matchup that people want say you know it's a real crossroads matchup I love the fight it's a crossroads matchup because if Perry can't get past Robert or can't get past Donald Cerrone it puts him in this position where you know he's um he's learning he's certainly getting better but when it comes to world-class competition who's the most world-class guy he's faced before it's Felder and Felder's really a 155 pounds others his best win yeah you mentioned he was hurt before that part yeah he lost the you lost that that's an old Jake Ellenberger unfortunately but it still fucking stunning the way he knocked him out you realize that that kind of older Jake Ellenberger for sure and that but that elbow on the break was legit as fuck dude cuz then we look at the guys Allan Jobe and beat him right out so this would be by this is by far as toughest fight I think this is his toughest fight but also they know each other they've sparred together and I think that but you know I like see those sorry I think Donald thinks he knows his tendencies and he knows what he can do with them and you know I think Donald has some good times with them they say when they grapple Donald tuned him up yeah that's what I think man and that's one of the things that Mike Perry said is that Donald's probably gonna try to grab a hold of me and put me on my back and hold me down you know it's you can't you can't discount this dude I mean he knocked out Matt Brown I mean this fucking combination that he did the Rick story was preposterous I took happily he's one of the great he's just been doing it for a long long fucking time and the way did that Rick story went dude he's just touching him up he's a scary thing about Donald's when Donald can be the bully he's gonna fuck you up but when someone draws a line in the sand and starts going forward on Donald he struggles a little bit look at ideas fight you know there's some right the guys who don't play his games Matt Brown that was a tough fight for him that's usually knocked him out that was a tough fucking fight well is it Matt Browns a tough fight for anybody watch this here it is here's that elbow boom son I mean he's got some fuckin power man he he looked great against filter he really did he didn't just look great because Felder hurt his arm he looked great because he looked but Felder did hurt his arm but I mean he's armed off-mike Perry's head that's spinning backfist leads to so many broken arms think about it there's a lot of guy yeah you hit that forehead and Felder and I were talking about it like he's like he's tries to kind of smash it with like like a hammer fist you know you try to catch a guy like right at the end of it but sometimes the movements and sometimes he hit that fucking forehead four heads are so hard man maybe it's a blessing in disguise cos Felder's a great commentator so do that and quick and punch in the face he is a great comment he's very very good work together man I was like damn this dude is smooth and I'm professional he loves the sport he really does love the sport you know he's a acting major theater me yeah he was a theater major the smart guy he's very smart about it me - you're fucking he likes fighting of course he likes it of course he's fighting James Vick next which is I think it's a very good fight James Vick is a fucking big guy lost his last one like his first big step up for James big lost that but James Vick and Paul fellers a great fight that's a great fight it's a crazy fight right isn't it pretty crazy fight yeah I mean big fight for James Vick but well it's a big fight for both guys Felder's just come off loss and the loss was like a last minute fight I mean that's right I think you only got like a couple of weeks they switched it on yeah yeah less than that right and he moved up to 170 for that fight instead of fighting at 155 which you know I think if you're gonna fight a weight class above yours and you know you feel like it's the time and you made the decision that's great you should do that but if you're not doing that if you plan to keep fighting at 155 to take a fight in the larger weight class is a big risk and to take a fight against an awful lot yeah against a real killer like parry I think it's it's super dangerous Harry's danger cuz he hits like a 70 there's guys who were - Jay hates it but he can hit like a fucking middleweight even he hits fucking which is the real problem yeah and he takes it and you gotta remember cowboy has fought everybody man he's fought so many fucking people you know and this is named a fighter his profile and this is deep into his career you know this is a real like guarantee as a young enormous Walter Wade and Kowboy lost to him it's like damn how good is Darren till tell me less to Edwards - I'd have kept - Leon Leon Edwards that's right he lost a decision what's the one we was sick it's fuck though and he almost pulled out of the fight it's still true it's true no doubt look no one's saying I'm not saying what was in a monster no one saying Cowboys a 20 year old guy who's at the beginning of his career he's been fighting a long time but I think you get a look at a person from their last fight you go huh man he slip and like are you sure are you sure because he might just be unmotivated or lack having a lack of discipline for this camp or it's finding a really fucking good guy and Edwards in there until it was terrible matchups formed heir until his win was against the other cowboy the Brazilian cowboy right yeah and Darren tells such a fancy Madero sorry Yancy Medeiros you can't keep him off you if you can't clip a Mickey oh yeah yeah that one the best in the world and this is one of the things that highlights how underrated Woodleigh striking has become because Woodley knocked down both till who's thought to be one of the best strikers in Division and long and awkward and out wonderboy knocked him like choked him out yeah and now but knocked down wonderboy in both of their fights and had them all fucked up whereas neither one of those guys hurt him neither one of those guys hit him that's kind of crazy impressive - and doing rap albums and shit I didn't hurt and here's rap it was Khalifa uh yeah I mean yeah for sure have you heard it Jamie no it's not bad you know he got upset that we were talking about CM Punk and I was saying that that CM Punk that that that what is that Logan Paul character the guy would be too dark you're right about that I said what you said yes I said as you know why because Logan Paul wrestled in high school CM Punk did not also I was looking at his boxing match I was looking the way chains punches together he could pass he's athletic yeah he could punch so if you allow seeing Punk to fight in the UFC I was am i all does all my point was my point was in the CM Punk is bad and I think that CM Punk is actually a very brave guy I think he's that's a powerful thing to do to take a chance like a logically how dare you but I mean anyone's I'm most certainly not no he's a teammate I thought so I get it he lovely does a TMZ show sat to its rating that to Woodley knows that play the Getty I'm thinking loves the guy too we get some boy I respect and if you go hey lonely Impala can beat up your boy I don't even know if he could off there even the same way I'm telling you because I get a lot bigger I have no idea I'll pick a Logan Pauly's did youtuber so I don't know feel like someone said he fought at 185 pounds in his boxing didn't grab any weight they'll write he's is he that big when he's a big fella then his here's a little brother - who's calling out like Dylan Danis which is silly oh that's hilarious that's hilarious and then he laughs when people go you know Dylan's a world class just chaos no no not jiu-jitsu just just box it fuck to the third law yeah he just doesn't know shit it's about to go down dude Mike Perry's in the cage and cowboys walking now boy he always looks so nervous when he fights in Denver he was 86 kilograms flat whatever that is 86 kilograms what is that is that 100 that's hundred sixty something right Oh twice 189 point fault yeah one so he's way big on CM Punk well see if like this plot at 70 cut weight those guys didn't cut well he might be CM Punk might be in the 189 range looking Paul's definitely just why think Paul is a fighter 170 yeah there's nothing wrong saying that he probably weighs like probably 180 or something if you cut sound 170 if you had a guess CM Punk 80ish or sandy 190 that I believe that so that's WWE because 20 pounds probably not probably actually now it's probably UFC information once yeah well he devised that well desert he competes he might be cutting weight from 190 which is not outrageous so Logan Paul's way younger a lot younger vibrant well it's more you know it's one thing if it was Melvin Manhoef it 36 you know I'm just a guy yeah but you know I'm saying it's like it's not just being 36 it's learning later in life you know there's a thing about striking if you're not an explosive person and you learn later in life man it seems like it's really difficult the people that seem to pick it up are people had a little bit of it when they were younger like a little bit of karate a little bit of boxing and they I kept the understanding in their head and then as they retire from other sports then they start to do it yeah was that the case with you a little bit yeah you doing any amateur boxing matches or anything like that while you were doing football before you're doing football I was doing some jiu-jitsu jiu-jitsu yeah when did you like get heavily into striking mmm I would do it to stay in shape during the football season but before the ultimate yeah before the ultimate how much how much striking had you done I just did Golden Gloves but I had six months of training six months six months a box injury yeah yeah see like now think about well look at this Mike Perry mean face and I'm bow to him look at that mean face he's he looks like almost like a like like a devil type care he's a movie he looks like under lossky miniature size green so mean he looks he's probably one of the meanest looking dudes and this boy he's intense I can do so mean-looking yeah he's becoming more and more comfortable too you know that's what you're seeing from him now this is there's so much pressure on tell my manager I just so much I like my pair but Cowboys a personal friend so I'm rooting for cowboy I feel exactly the same way I am right now boy yes but I love Mike Perry too he's like look no matter what happens we're gonna see a hell of a fight right now hopefully look I like cowboys new haircut son I'm not mad at kind of ammo like yeah a little crazy shaved on the sides patch on the trike is beard yeah looks like a savage you know Cowboys great I think he had a little savage in this fight you know you fighting a savage you better look savage to match the savage here we go look at these two who I know me too I mean we can't wait to make me nervous have a super angry yeah he does you think cowboy flips off Winkeljohn afree wins I don't know if he does well if let's say hey headkick ko be a much besides cowboy dude he's be something since I've known Cowboys hate Winkeljohn maybe some to it let's see what happens here damn he looks disciplined look at Mike Perry striking hands up high light on the face trying to not come out big right hand the Cowboys a slow start or so if I'm what Mike Perry schoo great - he's off the brake Cowboys fucking good in the clinch though damn let's see here well that's the thing about cowboy surprisingly good wrestling he fucks people up ah dude I've seen him fucking amazing they forget because you got picked that he does here that's amazing he lifts his left arm and me picks dudes all the time well he also like he's been that doesn't nice need a bargain that shit was sharp Oh cowboy said he may be with you all day but parries and he was very good as well though but see the thing about cowboy is he's like a he seems like a fun guy right he's always partying and driving around his jet ski and getting wild and jump on a plane yeah all that stuff so people think all this guy's just wild he's also a seriously skilled fighter oh my god a lot of that is a little bit of a smokescreen he's he's absolutely an adrenaline junkie but he's a very skilled fighter he's a professional the inside leg kick yeah and he has he had some rough fights yeah against the best in the world though you're gonna get that this is a crazy-ass fuckin sport he's doing this I was over 40 fight exactly and you're throwing bones at each other at a high velocity you're gonna get some knockouts you're gonna give some you're gonna get some it's just part of the program but cowboy look at that good head movement there Cowboys still here dude big kids come oh damn he's biting his mouthpiece and just going through word because cowboy is fucking tall I thought Perry was a lot shorter Barry's fucking big I think he's 6 feet tall Jesus tank - man he's a tank he's a real thick dude there when you stab his girl in this corner mmm then he lost he's like you know I pray not anymore huh well you know he shoes like this hat off he can't make 55 fuck cowboy can god it's tough on cow as he gets older yeah I mean maybe Perry can make 55 maybe I'm wrong maybe he can kill himself and get like Rumble Johnson used to do he looks great at 70 damn that well pretty good fucking scare it's good but he's doing it on the outside and Donald's slipping away from it now they sparred a lot a lot before they did a lot of farm of thing kind of fucked up I'd like when I fight Andrei Arlovski we sparred a bunch together so we fought your super tender because you knew what I was good at so you wouldn't throw your normal shit so it makes for a more boring fight sometimes in cowboys side though I think psychologically it probably helps him because he's already fought this guy before and if he did get the better of him in training it doesn't mean you're dealing with the same Mike Perry I'm sure Mike Perry's way better now but if they did train together and cowboy did get the best of them then that shit's probably on both of their minds right now there's just no way it's not and that's a psychological edge that cowboy would like dude oside can travel is nasty office I roll he reminds me a lot of Anthony Pettis off his back but they're so expensive even if you know what triangles coming there's fucking the really really stinky man well let's see cuz I can be tough to anything this is not some where he wants to be let's see how he gets out of this that was beautiful yeah I encourage the tape oh my god that was beautiful that was beautiful he's gonna smash him he can go to mount though but this is the thing that Mike Perry was saying that he would do to him in the gym and cowboys doing it to him right now see Cowboys super confident here cowboy grappling with phenomenal it's phenomenal but not only trap that Luke chop that arm he's being sock him in the fucking face been torturing this guy for years right or for well not year maybe a few weeks maybe have some crucified right so he's years I made that up but he's doing though is exercising some serious confidence in my news bully this okay he lost it though he lost the position he lost it he's on his back this is it this is a Cowboys great has a great garden it seems pretty good so far ya know his guard shacking and he looks like he's trying to bait him with the right arm Cowboys triangles yeah back in filthy man Oh need of the ass pipe back there everything anything goes anything but the sun's don't hit the scrotum but you're kind of hitting super close to snack he's like you're hitting this the like the house next door to you getting bombed on look at this armbar attempt Oh he spikes him to break his arm he's gonna break in his arm no no he's passing over it he's passing over oh cowboys breaking his fucking arm that's a wrap cowboy fuck yeah that's a wrap son fuck yeah cowboy do take a moment that is for cowboy didn't take a shot and got an armbar didn't take a big shot we go look yeah I like to come at me motherfucker I love it leave this fucking all that shit you got appreciate it man dude you get kicked out of your own gym here comes his kid baby I don't think that's what he was doing he's telling his wife to bring his kid his kid man that's what it that's phenom it wasn't an anger thing that's phenomenal that was he wants his son oh damn man what a cute little fella Wow dude how happy that guy wow what a great freakin win for cowboy he looks so confident dude look how confident he looked and I think some of that is just damning to not just that he's a really good fighter but also that they've they've Spartan familiar we had yeah he knew he had well if it went to the ground especially dude but he has my god that is Kiva standing up he didn't get hit with a spear no yeah he's moving dude he looked smooth as fuck he looked super polished standing up what a big win for Calvary look like you got to snap his fucking arm too hey man he might have broke it we don't even know I mean he was always mush word man very underrated gets spiked just wrap the leg no spiking holds upper works unless you're rampage on he doesn't let go turns him and then hold some belly down gets that arm and now when the arches is back up like dude there's a there's a ton of fucking torque look at this that arm is in trouble it's the Cowboys it might describe my right there dude his arm might have went sideways look at this again look at this from this angle look look at where the arm is here's our indictment yeah look at where his arm is though is it's almost like he's doing it he's getting it like this way it went work in it yeah he's getting like yeah way joint manipulate yeah he's not getting it like this it looked like he wasn't getting it like this straight now I agree like this yeah it looked like it was almost like this that'll rip your shit apart man that's tremendous what yeah again there's nothing I like Mike Perry has nothing doing like that I just know table square what he's been through he had a baby he gets kid a kicked out of his gym his backs against the wall he loses this one every once tell him to retire it's fucking Donald Cerrone man look goddamn good - hell yeah and the fact that he came to them and said hey I don't think it's fair that you guys train this guy you know it doesn't make any sense we've been together forever and they said okay well we're gonna talk it through and have a meeting and then they come back after the meeting oh yeah you're gonna train them you can't come here anymore it's so fucked up and then but also would have him win the the interesting thing too is you know cowboy bigos greg jackson and corny you next i guess yeah just not this one dude you see this shit movie looks doable what is it called overlord dude this looks so good seen tons of people talk about today said it's really good hose it out already I'm out this weekend oh my god I think so dude am I crazy I'm thinking Wolfenstein Jeff we could have been a video fuck yeah it might be still if it's not they fucked up I remember well make it a video game with the release I know he would play the shit out of that I was balls deep in Wolfenstein do you imagine what has to come into place to make a videogame like imagine if you have a movie I need oh man we're gonna make a video game to get this movie like you to come out with it it'd be the perfect video game what is it Overlord film review great video game movie that's not based on a video game I figured its video game the name Overlord the poster looks like a fucking Wolfenstein so ridiculously fun that's funny that's so funny that's so funny it hurts my feelings hmm yeah man this would have seemed like it seemed like a video game a hundred percent dude look at cowboy he's so happy there's this how can he not be your son's there chewing on a monster can see how about the monster don't let the Sun actually get that model system yeah no that would not be imagine that he gets a hold of that and it's open to and and it looks like all's good in the end Wow beautiful no no no that's okay that's okay I'll say hi to I'm gonna see him and congratulate him he's awesome dude what absolutely in his hometown man so happy for him was a stressful one here's the thing dough man he looked good as fuck it wasn't just that he won dude he look smooth about Paul Felder trained at Jacksons to you knows what's going on most with the history Paul's with Duke Hughes that Jackson's froz yeah before that yeah before Duke yeah dude he loves Duke he loves Duke he's a powerful Joe showing his grandma shaking man McDonald dude how cool is that your sons they're so happy look how fucking happy he is look at animal love it I wonder what Kelly's I love it yeah he's he's a guy that like man look at that resume table' Hall of Famer man yeah 100% yeah he's on some big fights won big fights but yeah most finishes in UFC history most wins in UFC history Hall of Famer yeah even if he never wins a title he's a Hall of Famer I agree he's the one guy I think he passes your eyes the one guy who never won a title that becomes more popular too yeah well you're right you know your eyes been thinking about getting back in there no here's so much shit you just shot a movie healing up and he's thinking about it how about the fly this is super impressive man what's how I did super impressive that he never let it go like that was tidy shit dude slamming yeah but it's the way in the transitions when Sheila step on it yeah because when Mike was doing the right thing by passing over the top it looked like he was almost out but the risk control that he had that cowboy had it keeping it in the position where he wanted it I invented the squeeze I think there's a like again him and Anthony Pettis are guys when it goes to the ground because people think of them as knockout artist which they are in the great standing but Anthony Pettis sending him on the ground or fucking tricky man from their back yeah most people aren't from their back but Pettis and him from their back is nasty it both they both dive on shit real quick to its explosive now yeah well they sick stuff but it's explosive cowboy started off with muy tight look at this see how quick that is I'm so pretty what I'm ready boom the slam and tighten in look I was like to see that look how he's got that like trapped in like that you know he's fucking that elbow up yeah that was gonna be sore tomorrow oh yeah he had tap yeah thank you say it's it's a tough loss for Mike Perry because you want to see where he's at right because the guys that he's beat you do see where he's at though Donald's a step ahead of him least at least a step maybe more yes you know Mike but Mike Perry looked better than he's ever looked before and now he's just fighting the guy was the best guys ever fought before and when he Mike Perry moves in he moves in with his hands up high his Chin's talk his techniques on point look he's not done he's not done I don't even mean this career I mean in his progress he's going to get yeah he just got rejected already from beating Paul Felder even look better in as a fighter against cowboy Chris or the next one yeah maybe just don't give him a the caliber of cowboy he's not there yet well sleep on cowboy man they forget they think for some reason he's done but just because he got knocked out by Darren Till and then lost to Leon Roberts Leon Roberts is a really good fighter and he was Roberts or Edwards as I say Edwards or Robert I don't know no because I weed it is Edwards right Edwards right Leon Roberts or Edwards at fought Cowboys Cowboys last fight Edwards did I say I said Roberts it's all good dude that's ours absolutely yeah I got a contact high dude doing the sober October did you get fucked up right away after sorry Leon Edwards but my point was yeah we got fucked up they do get more fucked up now which took 30 days off I don't think so it seems exactly the same you are no nut November now no it's supposed to be no remember November no it's no not November yeah maybe in your weird camp yeah December I remember hearing about tantric sex you know tantric sex makes sex better and what is this crazy commercial people to drive a raptor though look at that Forrest Griffin still doing the damn thing dude how about a TJ versa who doe but at 25 what it doesn't make sense and it's gonna be at 25 really get rid of flyweight to it they're done that seems strange why do it I know why won't soon it'll come up because I guess TJ wants to be a double champ that's the last fight but it's a fair belt that's four divisions not around anymore well maybe they decided to do it because the historical implications cuz if TJ can drop down and beat him he's the last champ yeah he's lap and he wins title in two divisions unless he wants to go up to 45 you know and then if he does I mean maybe he builds up after a while and goes up to 45 for a few fights you know yeah maybe I mean you got a whole lot for him well well there's some good fights for it 45 for sure not 45 45 to me a tough one for it's gonna be tough 30 short there's still some fights polymerizes right there mhm yeah no I agree Jimmie Rivera just won his last 25 is his natural weight class other person but if he's working with that what size guys name working some crazy me does that his name I forget what is that he's my TJ Dillashaw Jamie searching for it he's got it in the book god damn it I hate when that marriage allows my memory and ruins my argument and I've known marijuana have no excuse got hotbox on how there we go yeah I'm contact ID this stuff is strong taking in smoke TJ a person who does a good fight though it's a very good fight can't find his strength conditioning coach hmm calivita that's right what did I say that it's housing closed you know why cuz he's a comic named Fran salomina that's why hmm so spell it ka la vit ta calivita calivita TJ raves about this guy I know don't tell me his name because you don't want to gettin out on the podcast he was I I don't want everyone working with him I can say his name like dude come on he's hilarious that's interesting but probably accurate yeah it's probably accurate you find out about a scientist out there that's just doing it for the art gives you a huge advantage yeah I mean this guy seems like he knows so now so now I'm him and TJ have that they went on that gym Munoz and Tim right and then that's got in Pico there yeah that little fucking monster yeah Aaron pecos terrifying oh my god that left hook that he Kayode that dude with biggest prospect in a man who's like a shovel hook like a left uppercut his body shots nasty but that one to the chin where just to do just was out cold and just fell back like Jesus it was he takes shots he just doesn't respect his opponents cuz he fucks up world class guys all the time in the gym so when they give him like oh here's Larry's foreign oh he's like fuck that Larry and just will walk forward but they say in the Jimmy some of the best guys in the world he started this boom that is such a nasty hook man and it's so perfectly placed under the the right arm look at that dude that is crazy I'm doing it from the beginning look how slick this is like this he sees the right hand comment and he hooks under it and right on the chin and there's slide so they're doing right by him because they're not throwing him to the Wolves right away you know like he's in the UFC he'd be fighting fucking top 10 guys right away yeah look at that nasty left hook the fucking liver right there he's not two guys out to the body not how man liver shots are horrific nothing really they are might be bursting him knocked out yeah it was literally nothing you can do kids a tank to and a super high-level wrestler wrestler and boxer yeah bottom less long he's been wrestling he can do it all and think about this Freddie Roach has cornered two MMA fighters him and GSP so there must be something special about that fucking kid I am and you know I like the story that he lost his first fight I like that I was hyping up so much on fight but that's a that's a cold hard reminder well that's got Coco why would you give him that big fuckin dude he goes Brennan we asked guys you would know vets and they would not fight him he was like there's like this mythical fucking or about this kid no one wants to find this the only guy we could find wow it was a terrible match for me it's fucking seven and no big bigger guy to weight classes up is a bad idea and also Pecos never fought before and fight that math.sqrt guard in his first fight I didn't know that much bigger than I just thought the guy just caught him with she was a lot bigger yeah a lot bigger dude bad idea what did what did the guy weigh in at I mean they weighed in the same but he's a you know his original weight classes higher up he's a bigger fighter but they just thought it was so special eating star gym well but didn't a dude have a marginal record look you'd only fought your 7 to know why is he really pretty sure 7 oh damn yeah Pecos you know oh no oh I didn't know that ya know I was like cuz I asked Coker you know he's great like a why the fuck would J is Brennan it's the only guy who would take this fight Wow I guess he knew some yeah I guess what's homeboys name who he lost to yeah I forget but it's crazy what's up Zach Freeman that's right he's seven oh right sprite eight no now unless he lost one since then that was a while ago he's 93 now yeah he's lost pull up the met the thing so we could see it two losses before he fighting on Pico so what was his record we fought Pico oh here we go must have been Aiden - it's all about evidence - separation was too sad Awad that guy's fuckin good but still when he fought Pico is seven and two so nine fight mm-hmm that's a shitload four guys zero I'm seven two heats guy with Owen L was it my point you fucking nuts man and you know fighting in Madison Square Garden first debut you know you only get one debut it's a big fail your your pressure on TV everyone knows how good you are and the other guys good and you talk dickhead in a suit and tie in the boxing you're the next LeBron James of MMA his name's Brendan yeah they just they just take your button go I still believe it though yeah like a balloon so I received Franco Columbu make a hot water bottle explode and blowing into it no that's what people were doing it was Bob old-school then smoke deep I was one of those guys man stand by it but he was right you were right he just it was a lesson and it's just part of being a human being in competition and look at Franco Columbu jack he would who would blow up a hot-water bottle that's how strong his fucking told it would explode holy shit I can't make people are watching that bull figure they're out this lady's like oh my god I can't believe it do you not fucking strong your lungs have to be to make this happen like look at them heaving you have nothing else going on in this life the guy is a tank of a human that's some old-school Italian Neanderthal genes some old-school entertainment God look at those dime pieces I bet that hot chick that's the Arnold set a were jacked well I watched pumping iron and I get sad that I wasn't back then hanging out with them they look like they were just doing steroids fuckin girls we'd Venice Beach jacked it wasn't all the bums when they're just lifting your idiots fuckin golds just getting jacked yeah that's all you care about jacks and ages and probably like at a level that nobody had done before the steroids right so yeah along and all of a sudden the party got started yeah look at everyone they're hanging out with you know what I gotta tell you though here's what's weird if you look at Arnold right there he's mr. Olympia obviously jacked as fuck but beautiful nowhere near as Newcomen as any of the big guys that you see today we're talking about different steroids well it's not agency came along in steroids and it's not just that it's they just want to continue to get bigger like there should really be a time and it's hard to figure out when that time is where you really don't want to get any bigger you just want to get more sculpted and more ripped and more you want to get more proportionate well so that everything looks right whether it's your calves here do you like me symmetrical that's why the same Ronnie Coleman kind of fuzzy on Frank yeah they used to love Frank Zane even though he was smaller than those guys yeah unbelievable symmetry they said Ronnie Coleman came along was like oh cool story and just was like cuckoo cash and they said he's just fucked everything up because he's so massive well even before him Dorian Yates Dorian Yates was a giant doctor dumb motherfucker was she tall no shorter see Ronnie was tall yeah that's true Paul her bodybuilder I want to say he's taller than me Dorian's taller than me but I don't hate people I don't think he's six feet tall and maybe he's six feet tall but anyway in his prime he was massive I mean massive dr. Ronnie Coleman massive he was pretty fucking big man really you ever see Dorian Yates his prime yeah she's picture at Gold's I don't know enough to say that who was the first guy to get super jacked like that but he was the first mr. Olympia that I've ever seen going what the fuck kind of steroids do they use in now and he talked about he's like super open about his full cycle already took oh yeah man he did he's the best have you seen the Ronnie Coleman doc on Netflix haven't heard it's awesome it's awesome it'll bum me out in a bunny out girl you know what I'm never squatting heavy ever again or his back is destroyed two hip replacements backs fucked and kiss of crutches and he's like in constant pain now constantly taking fucking opiates every day didn't he have it's a bummer multiple back surgeries multiple back surgeries fused pinched nerves damn look at Dorian now it looks like me now he looked at him there yeah dude he was Jax shiny city he's got money though see him on stage though that's a picture he was bigger than that look at the far left the far left up there look at the size of that motherf are miss Nikki dude look at the size of him he was fucking huge man and shredded and just wanna blameless worked harder than a babe that's huge they were all on the steroids for sure the stare its assure him steroids they were all out all the steroids but for sure that motherfucker worked as hard if not harder we could fill human lifting weights Phil Heath who's Jack - okay here's the question he's lost his last competition look at this look at those two how do you decide which one is more jacked that is insane to me that don't make any sense I look at those two I go well you'd have to have an eye for right hook thing you're a juror you got to go over that shit with a jeweler's glass looking for cut called clarity the - what the fuck tweeted greatest backs in history is that is that is that right that like Ronnie thank God blame him - yeah that's Ronnie Coleman on the left was that Philly anything that story Nathan yeah that's Doreen yes Ronnie Coleman Ronnie Coleman ass he's out of control what do you saying it's I'm sorry Phil Heath I don't know I think that's running Coleman it's Ronnie cool I know Ronnie's ass Wow strong I know Ronnie ass that's a really fuck is lats look at they look like like they're on a supermarket covered in saran wrap hey Brady doesn't know he has any fat to it looks they look like ribs like baby back ribs that you put barbecue on it looks like he could look at Dorian Yates it looks like he could pull your head right through your back here's the wrap your head with your spinal column attached and just pull it out like the movie is yeah just leave a hole yeah your cord used to be for sure here's the thing though during the 8th got that flat ass compared to Ronnie that pictures side by side the picture page it was was it part of an article can't you type in during the 8th verse Ronnie Coleman big glutes right glutes the proper term how about just type in Dorian Yates big booty or nah come on bro okay but he's sucking that in man something pulling his is back at some of the g-string hungry but is eating those look at that ass first of all there's no reason to wear those shorts pores ever yeah but at a certain point time like your shorts are too little it's flat ass little but he's a little but he's on a little bike right yeah I know Lee get Ronnie's fuckin is that Ronnie on the right page I take it back yeah I take back what I said I can tell the difference but I can't though you get my help go I can't go larger again go larger again Rony all day jeez look at his lower back what is going on there that's the same yeah I guess they're both fucking insane the difference really to me is from the waist down but agree but what Ronnie's legs are spread out whoa see okay now it's different but still Ronnie's legs are they're crazy dude we're talking about Ronnie look at his butt asshole look at his buttocks you got extra inches of butter dude Korean zombie just fucking look like I was a CL I just started oh shit Ronnie Coleman is gonna enormous ass do no keep that up make it bigger no keep that up though that's for sure yeah fine I better get them bending over again oh there you go that's plenty that look how its asked dude that's all it's outrageous that's all right our ages let me see that last picture Jamie oh Jesus Christ June 8th got that flat ass the size of Ronnie Cohen's muscles I do it legs muscles look like he could fucking kick through a building thick his back is right okay here's the question now his backs destroyed his hips destroyed his knees are destroyed do you think that they did things differently do you think they said Ronnie did it when you watch the doctor like you they have everyone who competed against even Jay Cutler they go dude we we were trained with Ronnie sometimes and no one wanted trained with him because he would just do things we wouldn't do like what like 800 pounds squats all the fucking time listen Jesus they all the body but say he's the biggest freak ever that how strong he was - they said he just the amount of work you do inside that weight room was insane the crazy thing was when he was a cop oh yeah I'm a genius with a beautiful leg kicks inside there now imagine him pulled over by him for we die by growling yeah fucking more illegal drugs in your system than me with the talking about you like what are we talking about come on Dee let me go right now that would be ironic be hilarious that would be super ironic cuz that guy's on the illegal drugs like literally you can't get that big without him it's not possible do Jay Cutler in these interviews he just I don't know if I want hate on the guy did don't ya I'm not going to it's hard not to right God get a couple beers in you he's dead why talk shit damn J cot was giant to Jay Cutler beat him when he's going for number nine right well everyone thought Ronnie Coleman shoulda done nine she was stopped at eight and then fucking Phil Heath my boy Phil Heath lost the last one who won the last one I was he mr. Olympia never heard of them a guy who they compared a flex wheeler right he's a smaller thinner dude nice a thin I can't tell how many of these are photoshopped er oh my god wait a minute is that real go back to that last picture you just hooked up like Jesus Christ make that bigger what the fuck dude yeah well that are definitely Photoshop but like that one doesn't look like I was real that guy looks like a video game character don't look yeah that looks Photoshop he sent up Yaya while we're talking about ass oh man so Yair was teeing off on him just a moment ago is he yeah dude who 1 2018 Olympia this guy oh wow he's not sure do not flex wheeler at all his giant ass size but to excite a sized there dude his abs are black beard yeah they look like insect how come that's okay but blackface isn't well I think that guy's black Joe what he's black but everybody does that - I know they all do that you know wait a minute is he black well if he's black why did he look so whiter in that photo when he was doing most muscular I don't know okay close in on that gentleman through upper left-hand corner upper left-hand corner like you had before the image in the upper left-hand corner keep scrolling up all the way up that one yeah he might be african-american Prince ahmud he hundred teen always try pay attention what do you think he is Jamie what's his national I'm not talking about that guy that's the same guy no I forgot what the black ABS no that's not him is it yes oh he's that's what I'm saying black right or he's very light what I'm saying is they are allowed to wear that stuff that makes your skin look dark so you can see the muscles bad right but they get to a point where it's weird it's blackface it's blackbody I also faced this from Egypt okay so but he's much lighter most images more Mahatma ha it doesn't make sense since in the past if that one of them has an accurate the one that most muscular that you just put up if that's an accurate skin tone car Jesus Christ Jesus fuckin Christ God is huge dog what that one picture where you see his whole body that doesn't even look like a real person he's an ass on them too that Egyptian ass dude that dude how mad are people that were talking about ass not that funny he won the thing this dude from Egypt he's a beast man and you know fucking this this beautiful musician oh yeah double tap on the face but I think ty green just stopped in Olympia cuz that it was like rigged so he's like fuck this dude yeah he'd be a good guy down the park why they think she think it's rigged okay green always Jesus God damn what big Ramy is you say his name Ramy I think what is a simple name we should be well I tried pronouncing possible let me go back to let me try to pet names than me mon Dieu I don't want to fuck this up Mamadou else ba no my son let's listen to someone say it it's fine don't sound so authentic though I feel like 510 310 pounds contest weight 510 yeah it's me come on son that's a dick dude special type of girl again but white guys like regular white guys it was the famous white guy the big guy the Gunther marry him he would compete with Ronnie Coleman those guys know these names got there he was a giant Swede and you look like fucking colosso from x-men you'd go chocolate face do they get chocolate but you can't Jay Cutler want chocolate Jay girl is so tan girls do it too and we just accept it yeah it's full chocolate body it's full chocolate body and chocolate face yeah it's like as long as you go full chocolate they don't give a fuck that you have to go everywhere you can't have like one side chocolate on one side not happy face trying to win or not well not only that like it's not legal you have to pretend you're one color yeah you do either I accept the fact you're in chocolate body and chocolate face what is that that's not real that reals just as body build he won't leave my face no mistakes I think that might be real he wouldn't leave my face bro yeah dude he went chocolate body yeah he's a really progressive bodybuilder and he couldn't go black face he can't though go back to that picture he went chocolate body but his face didn't touch it you can't give him him they keep pretending he rolled around in the dirt can't give a medal bro yeah man he's gonna win because he went only chocolate body which is totally socially acceptable he totally didn't go chocolate fitzooth chocolate body you know they're literally spray tans people exactly what they're dare turning that guy black go back oh my god but he keeps the face is this real yes that's before he went ABS can I be that's before I wear this is like he's like you motherfuckers are not taking a picture of me with black face on well let's show how ridiculous let's just call it chocolate face I'm not saying there's no intent there to be romantic imagine imagine if from this conversation what the fuck is that guy doing that's broth his bra he's gets his body bronzed up to up to the neck and then he leaves it alone what his hats right before one of them Wow okay imagine just imagine if because of this conversation we put food we bring awareness to chocolate face which is essentially a socially acceptable version of blackface we're basically to look at this guy you need to go to jail sir you don't give the guy no listen but even with forget all that you don't look better when you do that you just look insane like you you have a black man skin color and you have blonde spiky hair this is insanity looking at how hard you work dude I'm looking at a puzzle like what is that puzzle oh fuck yeah here with a nice head kick maybe we should pay attention this awesome fire do that white guy likes cool chocolate body same guy no no that's one guy dolled up natural hey listen man I get it black guys look better you're just gonna have to deal with you see the muscle fiber I say this no I'm sure the body wow I think we might be the first to call chocolate body and I think that shins gonna stick Oh powerful spinning elbow by Yair mmm looking for the sweet but think about fighters tan they get trained they try to get real tan yeah cause yeah they do fighters get tanned but George st. Pierre did but you know there's a there's actually ordered a yellow it was actually there's a there's an actual benefit like in terms of your performance the increased vitamin D from getting tan like I think Steve Maxwell told me about this that they did some studies look at this loss position these boys are scrapped yeah I believe Steve Maxwell told me that there's there's physical benefits to getting tan being out in the Sun yeah well no your tan and your body's jacked up on vitamin D from the exposure to the Sun even I think probably not as good but better than nothing exposure to a tanning bed that makes sense it actually can benefit you it's really crazy your body makes a vitamin no the only way in sunrays well use other ways get it dietarily but you know most of the way you get it staring at the Sun or being in the Sun it is crazy crazy how bizarre is that god I wish when these two went chocolate potty yeah what imagine if a guy fought the absolute chocolate Bonnie and he's like bro Trax I want to look ripped you know you couldn't say anything I see how guys who are fortunate enough to have more melanin in their skin they look better they get more contracts yes you can't hold that shit back for me like you remember when Chuck Liddell used to paint his toenails then everybody wanted to paint their toenails yeah tell my black toes yep all we need is one dude to go chocolate body and everybody goes nuts think it's a big endorsement contract we need my drink is with the fucking beautiful kicks but green zombies don't give a fuck about your kicks he's such a little monster good defense there by area but your Koreans try again I tried again but at the very least it's allowing him to escape host end and elbow look at that is it creative dude oh ho temple that without the zombie dude he's like your flashy shit and just come forward well in a lot of ways this is a real good test for him after the Frankie fight good test for both of them right yes what's the matter logo fighters definitely can't do that I've been faked and UFC fighter Oh Sam Alvey did you do that 2015 Wow you know the UFC had making a policy about putting those fake tattoos on your back that said like you know casino something.com and boxes remember this yeah I think Bernard Hopkins was the average guy to do that there's some guys who did that yeah UFC can't do it you can't get tattoos you know it's in your contract no tattoos of logos Oh interesting label the air it on television no basketball do like Jeff Smith got like I think a supreme tattoo and that you have to cover it up big a supreme death do unless you have ownership in that business don't do that he has so many tattoos he's probably fuck it he's like come on give me free shit that's what he's doing is that what it is wow it's got it right off the back of the tree sick though yeah you're spinning elbow that shit was nasty did you see that replay we should pay attention I've been talking about chocolate bodies yeah I think we have a point though dude I feel like we're the first ones really call it out yeah before I do Jamie there's probably a reason why there was a bunch of them tag together on a website I just think it's hilarious when you see the dudes who don't have chocolate face no chocolate body that's so weird looking just like your face is just a normal color but I get it I get it it does make you look more defined yeah it does when you're tan you definitely look more shredded right oh damn here but the thing about it is like tanning there's not really good for you right I get that dar not all the time right if you got that dark fuck that you can't do it that's why they have to spray-paint mmm and also I would think that I wouldn't be mad if Korean Zombie had somewhat of a tan but whatever oh how dare you that's what it looks like bro dude he does good head movement - he looks he looks good standing up dude how fun of a fight would have been to the beat versi I hear that's a motherfuckin fight yeah that would be a really good fight I don't like that fight for the beat or yeah yeah you're so weird oh man nice right hand by the Coon zombie well I like it for to see entertainment I want to see what's up you know it's like a lot of people thought that uh Mike Perry had it all day for cowboy and cowboy just showed everybody what was up tonight that's what's interesting right you know a long time we know what a cowboy brings we don't know what Mike Perry brings we don't know what Jaeger or fucking the beep ring we don't totally know what they bring but we've sealed the fire bro tested yeah yeah we've seen yair tested against Frankie and Frankie Edgar just destroyed it was even a test that we test what's going on with the left picture yeah I can't put that on YouTube but what is that love pictures that a guy or girl what's a woman how come she's never shirt on she allowed to decision or an artist photographer photographer did like a series of photos on the subject dude that was a transgender no no no son of a bitch oh dude that's a transgender woman on the left no no it's a woman who's how shall we put this a lot of months that is not a woman pants and the titties like that those implants no it's a woman that took that plant they did the titties are implants right but my point is like that looks like like her body in her proportions look like that's a man maybe like a different kind of thing dude if they came up there's a ladyboy telling like bro the fuck out of here do better but this is what I'm thinking she looks like she commies piecing them up is she is he oh yeah that's going after him yeah she looks like she could be like a type of human that evolved on a nearby star she looks like Eve Nash with tits am i right a good type of human that involved in a nearby galaxy that's super similar to us oh no bro hopefully not well the the implant right if that wasn't an implant if that's just what the breasts look like just super muscular on top just like a guy super jacked it looks like a rugby player and then you get to the titties and he's just weird sort of bulbous bags maybe there are horns or something they're hard rocks of the user and chest banging in battle god that's a tough jacked but that's not a classic female physique that's no nails though yeah long white nails are strong touch if there was any the nails really yeah leave them nails powerful that's a demon hands Oh full of veins and thick look like they've been just lifting heavy shit for years jerking off dudes boom boom yeah but hey man if that's how she wants to look do you think these people that love to get jacked they love to just be preposterous ouch Oh Lady total chocolate face how dare you if she was on the megan kelly show if she walked out in the background showing you how my face my face fuck muscles right here that you come off hey bro what I want to stop I don't show my fucking cheeks or his rep you can't do that and someone has to translate the white are looking for gold it's exactly do you bro oh how dare you sir how many people just want to wear a black face because they're super racist and they can't so they become bodybuilders does that happens a lot but there's a few has it happened once as just a fucking bodybuilder bro get over it get over it yeah get over it he starts like oh rapping and shit that guy looks like somebody sprayed ink on him dude you know hard that shit is to get off these bullshit competitions that guy literally here's this mace out in an oil well you know unhealthy those people are you looks like you fell in oil he's like they pull them out of oh well oh my god I was in there I had arrested a kid he went under he went under and saved somebody and he's a goddamn hero you don't have to be black what say okay whoa that guy might be black how do you know Jamie don't get racist on us Jamie Jesus isn't that funny that you can get that would make you racist like if you thought that one of these guys in chocolate face and chocolate skin and chocolate body if you thought one of those guys wasn't doing it what the fuck you feel you were racist like oh my god that's his real color shit it's it's more the women do it too though right Jamie that's more of a Man Thing oh no the women do it for sure enough see what are you showing me man he keeps it up too creepy ow look I just can't man dude this is Round four we talked about this fight for a total of 20 seconds I know it looks like it's good bodies fucking fry up the middle by a year once the Korean zombies forced to fight on the outside like this then the IRS kicks become more dangerous and that's shit like spinning backfist cuz you don't know which what's coming so he doesn't know where the where the distance is where he's safe it doesn't you can need to land a real clean one to stop the zombie cuz he does not fucking studies the zombie yeah - nice right hands oh oh shit oh sure I think he fell there though yeah he definitely fell good job chasing after him but I think you fell Oh nice jab damn yeah just bloodied up yeah they're beatin each other oh there's another nice left hand Korean Zombie switching up from right-handed left here both fucked up boned their noses like broke yeah they're beat up Korean zombies gets his nose but I think with his lip right his upper lip yeah oh we just held air just threw that punch and a wiggle oh shit you just wanna remember with Korean Zombie just dipped out for four years to serve in Korea military you have to yeah it was a few years how many years was it was it two or four the IRA Mary's gone for four years than beat Dennis Bermuda as I think dude his lip is fucked up I think he ko Dennis Bermudez oh yeah - with the jab right on that mouth I think he's got it he's got some issues going on with that upper lip man we've seen that before where lip splits you seen Chuck Liddell's when he fought Rich Franklin that was the worst I've ever seen I'll be Lawler's probably the worst all right close to four years Jamie she missed four years I think he served two but he missed four years in the AFC then came back beat Dennis Bermuda greens ami just into a big right hand fuck big right hand he's yelling something he's saying he's doing something see a nice hole in his glove said something do did it wobble yeah yeah he cracked him he cracked him kid it was a good shot fucking zombie man remember it's badass walkout shirt oh he's saying hit him a nut sores yeah you're looking for a break they're not stopping it for that well come on go Korean Zombie Wow let's take no races I don't I didn't see that did you see what happened zyre who's complaining they get in the nuts then kept looking the reference you see what happened that made him say good hitting them now - but the ref doesn't stop I mean come on dude the probably both exhausts you can see Mike come on give us a break well they're both they've taken a lot of punishment Korean zombie looks like a different person and so does your hair he's covered in blood oh right had beautiful left hand what yeah guy looks like the one those hyenas when they're done when they're eating right they doing right through a water hogs asshole yes like a fucking water yeah water buffalos dick yeah yes face is all red like some like a water pig yeah some kind of wildebeest look it's like a fucking butthole hyena man you see a warthog yeah I've seen a warthog up close what a fucking weird-looking animal that is you ever watch that I forget what the nature metal where the fuck it is we both fall in it's go yeah most like a hyena rifki fucking water buffaloes dude take off and they say sense of material like I'll watch it 5:00 in the morning what god dammit it's like a zebra and his fucking air starched off by a fucking eagle or something James Vic posted something on Instagram cuz you know James Vic has been pig hunting lately yeah and he posted this of a pig eating a deer and you watch it like a boar whoa it's a wild pig doesn't necessarily have to be a boar to eat a deer it could be a wild female so when you think of wild boar people think of like a different thing I think of haha yeah that's just a male oh yeah okay so but I think if but a bore isn't the same as a pig that we eat the pink piggies they're like that's where it gets strange because they're actually all the same species oh damn I did not know that they look different though boar looks different here their noses they're gnarly yep they're different and where they come from to bebop if they're in like Russia like Russian boars and bigger two are all considered among the same genus I think they call it they said genius I always say Janice or genus they say that Steve Rinella told me all this it's an animal it's a species called Seuss grapha and that's what pigs are very different very different because when you leave pigs out in the wild see there it is right there we're different scene aboard a wildebeest no I'm while the pigs call the boar underrated male that's just yes that's right here it doesn't talk about a little of that okay who's to say a wild pig could be called a boar but that's just the name of it Pig European wild boar yeah but what is it what is this is what the question is right what's the difference between wild pigs and domesticated pigs pig in the think a pig is the same family it's the same thing oh there it is a boy yeah uncashed rated male domestic pig that's just a term war wild boar what I'm asking is is a pig in a wild pig a domesticated pig in a wild pig what's the difference between them I don't think there really is I think they're the same thing it's just they bred one and turned it into this like real soft sort of thing but when they get wild their body actually morphs yeah they're not pink in the wild they get fucked up right now they literally have changes to their Anatomy their nose grows their mouth lengthens their teeth grow out there their hair gets thicker and it happens just after a few months yeah I know what the girls yeah there's a wild pig is just both once it's wild and then a Razorback is a it's not that's not the answer to my question no the court the question is what is the difference between a wild pig and a domesticated pig do they have that on there okay just Google what's the difference between a wild pig versus a domesticated pig yeah let's see there we go pig hog and boar essentially described the same animal but there are some distinctions a boars a none castrated male domestic pig but it also means a wild pig of any gender a hog off means okay if we go deeper into it I'm pretty sure that it says that they're part of something called sue scrofa and Sue's graphic is the group that includes wild pigs domesticated pigs all those different animals but when you let them go wild they they literally change who they are yeah sue scruffa that's it so it is kind of the same thing it's just they look different in different places but they're the same thing dude my son was two baby pigs there were eight weeks old goddamn there were other adorable God they're cute when you see him in the wild they're so different it's such a ruthlessly aggressive little thing really want to kill him well they're creepy the I remember the first time I ever hunted them I was with Rinella and we were walking past this field and the grass was the brush everything was very thick and it was really high it was like much taller than their backs so if a pig is you know a couple feet tall the grass was probably like five six feet stalks you couldn't see where they were but you hear him in there with each other dude it sounded like there was little demons in there trying to kill each other what you guys just go in there mark come on this is they're about to throw down for this look at this put their hands up what is going on why are they all three and zombie just looked up at

that right elbow is so nice I've never seen that I've never shot he's like wow that is crazy that was that was one of the craziest elbows you're ever gonna see man that's knockout of the year oh yeah especially considering that he's got this nickname the Korean Zombie and we've never seen that wait wait a minute was ouster and Francis was that this year what I think this is better I've seen how many bright hands connect that was buqun's left hook by the way the left right hook technical Prakash's December no that was the uppercut here last year was last year so we got it it's out it's how I'm running that's a that's number one you had okay but elbow from no look fucking right but that's but that's only you have seen yeah other ones normally counter there they should well okay ballot or

yeah Rockhold was gay Rocco's fantasy is fucked up you thinking that the BTI air fight for some quite some time - well punches you it just seems like a different thing the way he punched Rockhold and then punched him again it's like a different thing do you forget 85 there's some great fucking fighter still it might be the best division right now 55 stack it is 70s fucking nasty but you know what between style bender Regina you know you got Yoel Romero who's still in the mix uh Korea Robert Whittaker Rockhold Weidman was in that fight I know up until the last punch the jock Raylan to the K Odom Kelvin Gastelum Kelvin Gastelum their stat rock holds a beast man who else 85 is up there how about cannoneer who just fought it 85 looks at his first big win stir yeah dude he looks terrifying here it is again oh my goodness see this slide slide slide Bink oh I mean this is bad see dick is this his placement it's so perfect what's he saying about his leg it is campus I was thanking cowboy Cerrone because they did their camp yeah that's beautiful they just he wonder what happened to him he's limping he's bringing up now he break his feet first round he fucked his foot up he said so he kicked his knee accidentally he thinks he broke his foot in the first round or at least fucked his foot up in the first round Wow he call it the beat now whoever Shawn Shelby and Dana White want me to fight always a standard thing to say that you never get big faith when you do that but yeah yeah you always gotta just go for someone even your nature yeah yeah if you really want that fight you got to ask for it got him they put it in their brain otherwise they can give you what you they thinks best very interesting fight though for what we did get to see of it and that elbow was fucking fantastic that's not either yeah that's such a really good important point about the difference between recklessly charging in and you know what the Korean Zombie is doing that turning into a zombie like he does every fight it wasn't working I feel I feel like you'd probably be up on the scorecards look like he was working and then I'd like to know we'll find out we'll find out later what what the people that that were watch and think even hit the scorecards one person I read said he was down 3-1 going into that round for the zombie him three rounds two not one zombie was a yeah from what I saw the zombie in the exchanges looked like it he was definitely coming after him moving forward but a little higher was getting some shots to happy that there's good for him man you hold the drama - there's his family got blood on your mom mmm do this again this is so sick whoop that's some and one shoe he just delivered that look at this that's reading oh my god one of the best elbow chaos of back of all time and perfect time to use that technique that's the number 10 guy in the world and in the Korean Zombie you know he's it's a fight where according to the at least one judge he was losing that's insane and he lands that and it's love how the coach to the bot line in and it uses the momentum of his attacker like it's a beautiful lesson in martial arts for people to watch like when I strike like that lands and it lands so perfectly that opens up that strike for a lot of people 100% right you marry John Jones started the one where he touched the inside leg and did spinning me up and then everyone started it up yeah no John guy does it with that yeah you ever see Gaston Bolanos spinning elbow in Bellator no son dope son really you want to see someone look like they got shot with a laser beam this dude got hit so hard Gaston is uh you know he's a real world-class Muay Thai fighter look left oh fuck dude watch this one more time watch this tone oh my god come on son Boulder them but it's the way it lands - it's just so Oh now was this against the number ten fight of the world No my ears is more impressive but boom but again I've seen spinning elbows land knocked it down that one's pretty cool let's watch it one more timber I've never seen a guy know look KO sewn with a nope I don't think I have either watch this though yeah that's real time one more time real time more time real time real time give it to me real time look at this I mean that is insane that's like that's the restart that's control-alt-delete right holy dark and comes back up yeah but Korean Zombie is a guy who first of all was deep in that fight maybe even winning that fight at least according to one judge known for being a zombie known for being able to take it tremendous shot flat line toughest shit flatline flatline a fight he might have been winning and powerful Rashad here sha looking suave I like what he's doing his hair I like this purple psychedelic paisley tie I'm mad at the beard I like the whole look Jimmy Smith what's that pin we think that pin is so a Porsche pin I just want dick he'd be if you have like a Ferrari pin that's some shit I would do looks like a pin Jimmy what do you think it's probably for veterans today yeah um well dude but we covered it all bro we could go read all but fight he mmm for all you bodybuilders out there we don't really care no keep doing your chocolate body yeah we really don't it's and it makes you look better you're right dude it's an advantage cha write it up bro yeah you're right I get it again I don't think that you shouldn't be able to do it but I do think all of its crazy yeah I think you basis now I look at it more I don't even think it's racist I don't even think it's racist I think they're just trying to look like they're like a black shredded like a black guy how dare you that's exactly what they're doing and listen it's working form and Johnny's the new thing highlights credible well it definitely has an impact man I mean if you're a white light paper and trying to look jacked on TV and you're standing next to a do to win chocolate face and chocolate Bonnie that guy's gonna look way darker who wants to be more truck and the only reason why you should go chocolate face is because otherwise it's super distracting you gotta go all now I don't think you're tan I think you're crazy yeah you're crazy what's going on but why do you have like a suit on yeah just like you know like gotta match it there's some girls who are particularly sexually adventurous and they will even for Halloween parties will just paint their tits yes that was a thing that was going on yeah it was crazy look crazy it was like a crazy hot crazy hot but it was like a loophole where girls could basically be topless at parties with paint on their tits I mean you could see their full nipple but if you can see they had stars are you watching twitch these days what's still going on yeah what's twitch what's going on twitch I don't know what day they changed the rules but the rules got changed sometime why they change the rules no no the other way you're good go do that and paint their tits yeah why not listen if you can wear like some sheer skin tight shirt that shows your nipples and I'm all for that yes why can't a girl paint her tits and make some money what do you want to work at Danny's motherfucker a guy paint his dick and make some money yes okay Wow perfect dude she is so hot this girl just has her titties all done up this one this is twitch world yeah so they have fake dude get on Twitter it's just titties she has some tiny dude this is naked no stop it you asshole they're girls please go separate them oh but this is the dark web now no no we're good leave it alone the point is they're allowed to do it yeah she's got Barb's through those nipples what's happening down there is there something happening on to those nipples am I just looking at this is twitch what the fuck do they do it yeah what are those things on our nipples are those is that some sort of an object yeah what is that so I can ale through it I was at paintball pain okay I thought maybe she had some sort of ring going on and I talked about twitch like my dad asking about CBD well I've no I've no clue I lit I couldn't tell you what I don't people do a lot of shows on which now I know but uh you know who contacted me the other day Bubba the Love Sponge yeah he's doing a show on Twitch he doesn't show on Twitch like it straight what do you mean show he was a famous radio guy did he used to be on Sirius in the early days when howard first got on Bubba the Love Sponge Bob doesn't get show like this on twitch apparently yeah yet I think jeans and and Segura are doing around there yeah Tom and Christina yep yeah they're doing they're doing twitch as well yeah have you looked into it Jamie come on there myself but I play video games but it's expanded over the last I don't know year to to more than video games there's podcast sections there's music sections they try to do like a comedy section even they're trying to entice people to do stand-up comedy on their here well that's yeah it's a terrible idea but yeah but there's ton there's tons more than just video games on there now when people first started doing podcast one guy asked me to do his podcast then asked me to do stand-up they do it the live podcast he wanted me to do stand-up on the podcast I go what are you talking about I go you want me to do my act on your show the foot and then he just gets released on the Internet I just do it that way instead of just getting paid for especially what are you talking about why would I do that you're just an idea he's gonna sell this podcast to put it out and how much do I get out of this zero okay that sounds like my materials out there that's crazy but that was the early days of podcasting we're trying to figure out what the hell it was like what is this thing's hilarious this is just a joke is anybody paying attention who's watching little did they know yeah it's just I remember Kevin Smith was one of the first guys could take it seriously cuz he rented a theater he had a theater on Melrose it was like the SModcast theater and we used it once I used it once to interview was it Tom Green and Jim Norton I think I don't know to podcast there I did one with Tom Green one with Jim Norton yeah it was interesting it's cool it's different it's interesting but it's different yeah doing it live in front of an audience yeah not like do you guys still do live fighter in the kid shows we don't you don't too busy with both of you standing up too busy yeah yes rare Brian I get together there's live shows well I guess that's good because it means you're both busy because that's exactly the same thing that happened like me and Joey and and even me when me and Ari and me and Duncan it's like everybody else just got too big you know Ari's just headline these giant ass places now and Joey's headlining giant ass places and you know to segura selling out everything all across the country skills yeah it's just how it goes you know if you're you're doing stuff with people eventually they wind up doing something else and you know I know you you were doing really well with your stand-up comedy it's probably hard to do those shows still shows are a different thing right it takes away from what I'm doing yeah like the original go like if I'm gonna dedicate time in stage it's gonna be to my right especially because you kind of have to if you want a headline places yeah yeah keep pumping out new shit and you want to do a special as much as fun as that half with the life and the kids it was the exact opposite like that was just improv of me and Brian dicking around what's the time yeah we can I getting better than anything every one time with your buddy right you're not making your act stronger now piecing up your material I'm air less than I told Brian this what meaning him did one at the Comedy Store I don't know like a year at least ago year and a half maybe we got done I was like I'm done with these dude Wow oh you had a weird one right there was one of them that came out weird at the Comedy Store is just wasn't weird cookie gives clunky yeah yeah we've been together a while that we did that like dude this isn't the best product for you or me right I feel like yeah it can right I think you got to respect what that is if you're gonna do like a two-man show you got to coordinate the shit out of that requires a lot of work can't wing it especially from people going from pain to see you do stand-up they see your stand-up act which is you know what it is they go from seeing that to that I felt like it was hurting the brain or anything that makes sense yeah I think Brian agreed to and that you know but like we did a show together with Ari and big J and that was fun that was fun that was a there was all things comedy there doing a festival down brought us all in all things come he's doing a lot of shit man they're killing the kick-ass uber they're doing specials they do know they're doing Ian Edwards special are they really yeah that's dope Comedy Central game especially but there's something with that like Ari Theo Brian big Jay and I were all talking about like we could do the same way freakin they did the white Comedy Tour blue was a clue coming tour white coming her where the fuck it was you do we could do that once a month just pick one city do Blake to big ass shows and get out yeah but dude like announced a tour with it yeah yeah definitely that'd be fun you know and also like you're doing comedy clubs too which is so important at this stage of like when you're trying to ramp up to a special in January yeah you gotta do a lot of comedy clubs cuz you get those to show at nights and to show Friday to show Saturday one Thursday to Friday to Saturday that's good Thursday's a warm-up set yes get that bitch hot yeah okay what's weird to relate to fighting is I was like oh fuck I'm about nine weeks out from the special I almost feels like damn you gotta I don't know I think you know say that Louie CK he used to treat it like it was a fight he would go running and get in shape running like five miles a day he was like ramped up like actual physical training to prepare for comedy special to my diets on swine now my diet my workouts well what I learned from this sober October workout challenge his fitness challenge at Ari and Tom and Bert and I did was that when you work out a lot like that you do a shit ton of cardio you don't give a fuck your anxiety is severely severely diminished you feel so good it's crazy when you do a lot of cardio like I was doing on a normal day and the average day I might be working out three and a half hour too much it's really crazy to month but it was just for a month yeah but the point was that and I don't think you need to do three and a half hours but you might need to do an hour if you can do an hour of hard cardio you don't give a fuck that's what I do shell 60 minutes are hard where I'm yeah 800,000 calories that's all you have to do that's it yeah done I feel really good when I work out like that if I don't I feel like my demeanor I'm not as fun I'm outgoing right rice creative like I don't feel great dude I was saying that if it was a pill if you gives him a pill and that pill could make me feel like I feel after I work out for three now I'm addicted to it I take that pill every day listen that's some I don't give a fuck juice called oxy gonzo but no it doesn't change who you are true like if you just family be I fuck up the same words I count the same and that was the thing was interesting like I was worried that I was going to negatively affect my podcast because I was worried that I'd be too tired I come in here I just be rag doll that beaten down but I wasn't yeah II had more energy right I have a lot of energy like Jamie I didn't seem like any slow or anything did I you know what fucks me up and we've talked about this before what's that fucking yoga classes do when I do a 90-minute yoga class and I come in here I am rain way more fucked up on because that mental energy with that it's not just that it's like what you're what you're doing to elevate your heart rate is so much more exhausting to your muscles than say running for sure you can't hold a yoga pad yoga pose for as long as you can run you can run like for hours and you've been you're not you're not going home it you're doing and you're going left right left right it's just like this steady push relax push relax and your your legs have like a half a second to recover with each step that's what's going on but it's different because yoga you could never do that like when you're in a yoga pose like you're in you know triangle pose or something like that how long can you hold that what do you can you hold it a minute can you hold it five minutes shake maybe you're in fucking tremendous shape and you could do the bow pose where you hold your foot yeah put it over behind you maybe you could do that for five minutes if you were in tremendous shape but damn that is hard to do what does that Jamie everyone had Korean Zombie up yeah except for one gut except for one or one judge had it even going in mmm other judges had Korean on every card - mmm - so not to to others at three one three one three one two - ha interesting what a ko what amazing ko it kale all right let's wrap this bitch up everybody out there being affected by the fires we genuinely and sincerely hope you and your family are safe it's it sucks if you lose your place but you know it's way worse if you're dead what's positive is your friends and your family and your loved ones and that means a lot to me right now so I'm thinking about it even though I'm evacuated and I'm sure I know I already know people that for sure have lost their houses but we'd feel a whole lot worse we lost them you know it's hard to deal with it's rough it's not a good thing but it's also a humbling reminder of where we are and that nature is a thing to be respected and feared and when fire gets out of hand there's some serious fucking consequences and I don't know what solutions there are to fixing something like this but I think if there was an invading army that came here and did the kind of damage and devastation that these forest fires have done there would be some serious steps to protect us against that army if there's a profit to be made and figuring out how to protect people from this kind of fucking horrendous fire like I don't know what it would be I don't know it would be hiring way more firefighters or putting way more precautions in place or hiring people and Donald Trump creating new jobs to clear all this dead wood in the forest and and to figure out some way to get to the scene quicker and have flights that are ready on standby filled with water at all times I don't know what the fuck it would be but it seems to me that these things when they get out of hand like this leave people unusually helpless like we're oftentimes helpless tonight you do yeah this is this is one of those unusually helpless moments where it makes you really understand how dangerous fire is and nothing but love and respect out there for all the firefighters and first responders and all these people that are taking care of people and and shout out to Whitney coming saving animals our girls out there in Malibu saving animals
