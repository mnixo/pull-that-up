the girag an experience you know I would be guy would try to be nice to everybody but I was already on a trigger so if something happened you know where someone did something rude I would over escalate almost immediately I would be ready to take them to fucking full-on war can I immediately can I tell a story which one well I don't I don't know that we've ever talked about this but we had one kind of blowout in our life and it was you were I was living with your girlfriend at the time Jennifer yeah Jennifer from Staten Island Angeles no first names okay right yeah I guess big hair very nice great chick yeah great chick this is I'll tell the story of how this happened because we we went to some club okay I don't want to say where she worked but we Greg and I were there and she came over to talk to us and said that she had a room for rent in her apartment and she needed to find a roommate and and I was like I think Greg needs a roommate and Greg's looking for a room I was trying to get out my friends were all drunks and I'd quit drinking and I didn't get the fuck out and so she walks away and Greg was like holy shit I want to be living with her oh my god look how fucking hot she is I go dude she's fucking hot right and so then I'd this is her girlfriend before Easter before we started dating we just met her we had just met her so um then I called him the next day I go dude your new apartment is fucking awesome Eddie and you go what are you talking about I just oh I just fucked that girl in your new apartment it's amazing oh so we had like a little thing we were Greg kind of liked this girl first sort of and I fucked her and then he was living with her and it was it was kind of weird and there was one night where she had told me that you were talking shit about me and it really hurt my feelings because I couldn't believe that you did it you she had her period and you know we were like 21 years old whatever the fuck it was you know you say stupid shit like that yeah and she was like miserable and she would have a bad period and you came up to her and you confronted you look if you're this miserable why don't you just fucking leave him you know like really what are you doing here this is what she told you yes what she told me and then she told you Greg I'm on my period that's why I'm miserable and I was so upset I was like wow I can't believe he did that I mean she was hot you know and you're living with her I get all that I get all that but I couldn't believe that you said something to her like bad about me you know because in my eyes I'm a very loyal person and when someone's my friends are my friend and I would never go to a friend's girl but it was a very complicated situation you know it's not healthy for a heterosexual guy to be living with a hot girl in a date with two dead it uh but let's go so anyway I go on this gig and the gig was terrible it's a fucking awful gig it was a long drive and I did not have a good set and I was coming back and I was with her and you know she had just told me this thing that you did and I was so fucking mad I couldn't believe it I was so fucking mad and we went and got ice cream and I went to the bathroom and I came back and I opened my ice cream and Jennifer was eating hers and my ice cream bar had a bite taken out of it Ben and Jerry's piece pop and it was Greg had taken the bite out of it and so that I flipped the switch and I threw the ice cream at your face about a hundred miles an hour and I don't know what I said I don't know what I said but I remember I went into when it's a danger zone yeah well I wanted to bring it up because we never talked about we never did and I wanted to because obviously look there's always two sides if of course three sides in this case yeah and I think number one I was a brash fucking wiseass pervert you know with a lot of energy back then and so first point I would say is that with Jennifer if I said I can't believe him live with her I think it was probably more of a comic premise than like a real attraction on any level I think it was like yeah she was hot but I wouldn't be moving in with the chick to try to get laid with her no I did probably more I were doing that yeah I'm not saying but I think there was a jewelle feeling with you that like i had said that and it was maybe on your mind that i'm living with her and you know that's a little bit fucking weird I'm pretty open-minded dude she was living with another guy the gay guy and I would go like hang out with him all the time well he was gay don't give it up Michael name damn it so worked up the whole thing so and the other thing is if I and if I it's possible I'm I said that thing about wait let me just say my side of it okay it's possible who knows I might have said something about you you know and again I was a fuckin loudmouth I said talked a lot of shit I think that in my heart you and I were good friends we had come up and done a lot of shit together gone through a lot support each other a lot and I think if I'd said something it's again I have no fucking idea I don't remember it doesn't you know it's so long ago the memories aren't real anyway they're not no that's why I brought it up in this in this arena because I feel like I don't know if this humor in it but I think that there's a real moment in it where you know where I think it fucked me up too because first of all seeing you get that angry was like you know scary shit and it was like the irony of you hitting me with the Ben & Jerry's piece pop was also not completely lost on me and I and I felt like you know and sadly that was right at a time when you were moving to New York you started going down and working Dangerfield's and all that shit so it became kind of convenient that we just didn't see each other as much we would fucking write together every day we drive to gigs and then all the sudden this kind of blowout happened and and you just happen to be moving and so we spent a few years of just not being in each other's spheres at all and then it was water under the bridge and we started to you know hang out and all that stuff but I always wanted to talk to you about it because I felt like whatever your takeaway was from that experience that you know it was if I did say something it wasn't from my heart and that I think it was a loaded situation it was a loaded situation and there was a few other things that wait and a few other things that were leaning into that that confrontation that you know it wasn't anything bad that you did it was sort of an attitude that you had taken with me I don't know it was weird there was a bit there was a resentment thing I'm pretty a pretty sensitive to it and everything a lot of it had to do with living with the girl well I was you and I grew in different directions as comics you you were going hardcore you were hanging out with another Michael and you were real Kinnison guy and I was starting to move a little bit more towards not clear clever yeah yeah clean and clever stage and you gave me a really hard time about it you could call me a pussy and you got a fucking be real up there and it was intimidating because it was like well I'm not we're you telling me how to do my act but really yeah you would get pissed it is because I loved you I just what didn't want to see you back off you were yeah you when you were at your best Greg Fitzsimmons would have these sets and you would you would have a bunch of really well-crafted jokes you had a bunch of good things and you have one thing where you just went over the fucking edge completely and the comics would be howling and I always knew I was like if he can harness that and if he can figure out how to do I mean you have a sick fucking sense of humor so when I would see you pull back like to do a Letterman said or pull back to do like any stuff like the only reason that exists is because there's someone trying to sell Toyota trucks or Thai yeah the only reason my censored TV exists so this idea that it became clean and clever I'm like what is clever about cutting out the most fun aspects of life yeah and homogenizing it for so that four year olds can watch it really is that what's clever that's not clever that's not real comedy it's and in my head back then I was watching you and saying well yeah you're just going up there and you're just fucking throwing shit and common their faces and your feelings and your fucking prancing the stage and a stalk and you're fucking got your hand over the month and I was just like you know he's killing it but like that's like I was coming out of college as an English major and I wanted to write you know and I've gone into writing right so to me it was just a different choice right and it was one that you didn't respect no it's not that no you just said it you didn't really know I wanted something I didn't respect the writing it's not that I didn't respect the discipline of it I know it's it's more difficult it's a more difficult path it was that with you I always knew you had a sick fuck yeah sense of humor so I was like let's I gone back to time don't pull yeah don't pull away from that are you yeah easy that's like what makes you unique that's what makes us howl in the back of the room yeah I mean it's we're not laughing because we like you and it's not funny it's like you would say some really dark fucked up shit and then ad Billy I can never use that bit but they won't use me now but Boston comedy won't book me on the road because of that bad I know you know they were thinking I think that there was a part of me that I think in baseball terms you were always the guy that was the grand slam swinger and I was the guy that just wanted to get a lot of doubles and singles and so in a sense I think everybody my father used to say everybody ends up where they're really comfortable you know and in a sense for you like you talked about going on stage when you didn't have the material but doing an hour like balls out I'm fucking do that wasn't me that would have been my worst fucking nightmare to me it was like I wanted to make a living doing this I wanted to write I wanted to go on Letterman there was like things I wanted that we're in this strategy not that he like thought about it but it was just natural where I was going right and for you it was like you wanted to fucking explode you know you want it to be Kinnison and that was just a different fucking strategy different game plan than I had and I think that was a big part of it too that was a lot of tension underneath the fight that happened really yeah I really realized I'm on right well I did I resented that that I was feeling like you were not approving of what I was doing you know that's pressure on me not to do it that's hilarious because I always felt like that it was always the opposite with people that the people that were dirty were especially back then in Boston they were the one who were pressure pressure to clean it up yeah Oliver Keithley that's all he ever used to tell me you got to clean it up you got to clean it up you said ten fucks in ten in ten minutes yeah clean it up yeah it was always like like I'm taking some sort of a shortcut by doing things that I'm actually interested in talking about so you saying that I think that that I looked down on you for for cleaning your act up or trying to go the professional route it wasn't that it was never that it was that I didn't want you to stop doing the other stuff cuz the darkest shit was the shit that would make me laugh the most and then when you like I can't do that but anymore I'm looking you're crazy that fucking bits awesome I know and some of the bits I look back I can't I'm one of those people I cannot watch myself I have early tapes you know I look at these clever Lord fucking cute jokes I was doing I I just remembered something he did that was fucking brilliant this is back in the day where there was like maybe it's somebody had heard the Jerky Boys like maybe like you know one one of their CDs were out and like they were like really kind of funny recorded phone calls when they would fuck with people Greg did one where he called in a car rental place and you did it Tom I seen it this extreme extreme Boston accent four years four years after that I go it's on fire the cars on fire the whole cars on fire you're a fucking human being
