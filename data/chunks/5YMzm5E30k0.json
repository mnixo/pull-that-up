in Canada snooker and it got like they got darling they got curling they got stuff like oh we would never show this bullshit you know it's can I get a Kleenex man yeah before they come they say we can we just ran out yeah so it's not that like I don't I'm a caveman this is I like what up Jesus are you doing that on mic microphone yeah but you're blowing hard with that schnoz oh you going deep son you just made people throw up those people listening to the it's funny the fluid coming out of people's noses is so vile a sound you know like when something like you're on a basketball court or something like that and someone doesn't see it and he tells me on Monday I got to get out of the apartment so instead of going to look for a new apartment over the weekend I go to my friend's bachelor party on the Jersey Shore I'm at the bachelor party I'm getting a drink at the bar and I see this girl I start chatting with her she asked me where I live I told her actually as of Monday I have nowhere to go she takes out a napkin she writes her address on the napkin from 21 years old and she says if it's an emergency on Monday and you're stuck you can come live with me Monday comes I get kicked out of my friend's apartment I have nowhere to go I'm like this is an emergency I take out the napkin and I live with this girl and her roommate for six months well turns out that her father is a big entrepreneur businessman owns a piece of the Yankees just like Monster mogul I write this song for the New York Knicks called go near Co and it becomes a big success you remember that song no no okay that's okay that's okay I'm not a sports that's fine it becomes a big hit and I just realized that there's an opportunity to write theme songs for all these professional sports teams but I don't have a penny to go in the studio to do the demos to shop them to the teams so I need money so I go to this music guy and he says I'll give you $10,000 to go and do these songs for 10% of everything you make for the rest of your life he wants to buy me like is that the rest of your life I'm 21 he's like a rest of the rest your life everything you do I will invest in you own an airplane business he owns 10% yes forever yes you have to kill him then yes yeah you have to kill that guy but I needed 10 grand so I say I'll take it so before I take it i go to this girl's father for advice this business mogul that i'm living with her and i sit down i go to this guy's apartment again I'm 21 he's got in his part and he's got a swimming pool artwork like fancy fuck women he's MACT out man it's like I've never seen anything like this in Manhattan in Manhattan I'm just setting the stage of the Shocker station and I go in and I tell him the story about the tenement and he says to me I would trade this is exactly what he said to me I will trade everything that I have for you to get out of my daughter's life exactly I'll trade everything I have for the one thing that you have and I'm like me I'm fucking broke what he taught me I go what's that and he said Youth because he had already gone through the journey even though he had everything he already had gone through the process he wasn't that twenty-year-old that you're talking about that whatever he had gone through it he had it all he would he missed the process the journey of being you coming up at 20 and not know like you know here you are but it was that those were the years man right the first fight the first this like that that's what that's what makes you like so and that stuck with me man at 21 years old it stuck with me and realized that like man I got to enjoy the process and it's really never rubbed off on me it from me oh well why didn't that guy how old was this guy at the time the old rich dude he was let's see he must mean his 60s when I just do shit do a bunch of shoot day lounge his fucking swimming yeah did he had animation he was 20 he had an amazing life he had an amazing life so what did you end up doing he said the sect the second part of that conversation he said do you uh will you make this work on your own I said I think I can he said I didn't ask if you can he said I I said he said will you make it work I said I will he said then go tell the guy to fuck off and make it doesn't go make it work and I did but it was only like occasionally at like a party and always felt like a loser for doing it you know like everybody else would be getting high and but I was probably already drunk anyway you know like when I was 14 or 15 I was like that so maybe I smoked weed a handful of times less than a dozen times until I was 30 and then Eddie Bravo got me into it when I was 30 years old we were doing jiu-jitsu together and he was telling me how marijuana is helping his jiu-jitsu and helping his music and his creativity I was like what the fuck is this guy talking about my tuque marijuana just makes you stupid like don't you know if you know and he's like just try it and he we got high and I remember thinking like oh this is what it is like wow I did not know I believe that feeling like you like by yourself it's this no it's me Eddie oh oh sorry I can't believe this we went and got somebody II walk in oh yeah we'd get like crazy talked about all kinds of crazy shit and then I remember I started smoking pot and getting on stage and I've got rules we're getting real creative with my comedy and then smoking pot and doing jujitsu is like I can't believe houses owned in it gets you with training smoking pot and hittin the bag to this day is like one of my all-time favorite things I get paranoid weirded out I get I get freaked out but I just wrap up my hands put on the timer and just once that sweat starts flowing and you start about it's almost like the paranoia and the weirdness of it all you just fight it off by hitting that bag ba-ba-boom ba-ba-boom you know and you you hear the bell that says 30 seconds and you're Florian and then you get that one minute off to think about life and the future and the fucking universe and volcanoes and Guatemala and Hawaii and mocha bell goes off again you got another 3 right 3 minutes and man it's one of my my Blake it's a it's a psychedelic experience it's like a cleansing experience hitting the bag when you're high I love shadowboxing when I'm high I'll take a rip out at home and just sit they have a little mirror and I'll just shadow box don't even know how long I just can just shadow Boxford just go do you know what's weird like you feel balance when you're high you feel like like maybe like if you got an injury you feel it more you feel like we're letters are off you know what I mean and like for me I feel my transfer of power better when I'm high like the like certain techniques I really get the timing of like when to turn the hip over I feel it more when I'm high like I feel the connection with all the tissue all of it working together and I think that is that's what's happening I think that's what's happening with with at this Aleph rania thing if that's what it's called I might be remembering that incorrectly but this this thing that being around a schizophrenic person like whatever weird error their brain is making your brain Tunes into that error and you start going crazy - as soon as that shit made sense Myles like I gotta get the fuck out of here cuz he's done create yet he's harmonies never hurt anyone but he's still you know these days he's way he's probably he's probably in his sixties not in any kind of shape but back then when he still knew martial arts but he never heard anybody but he knew how to and so one day there's Eastern Avenue in Baltimore's for lack of a better term the Ventura of art of Baltimore's shops everywhere and everything and there was this one woman that had cut his hair one time and for him excuse me to touch his head was a big deal for him this so he immediately fell in love with this lady her name was Carissa so he went home and got his guitar and the thing about this guitar like this dude would pawn his bed his guitar everything but that guitar was always out of tune exactly the same way you understand I'm saying that makes sense okay so always fucked up but always consistently fucked up every guitar he had that's how he tuned it that's how he heard it oh wow so he writes her he writes her a love song and he wants to go up to her shop and now sing it for her so he goes up he stands out in front of the shop and he gets her attention he's got his guitar and he's gone and starts off where he got he goes Chris I love you and Baltimore accents her name's charissa but he says Chrissa okay Chris I love you Chris I need you then he goes Krista don't die Krista don't cry because I would have died cristinaw and she's freaking out like what the fuck yeah like your eyes so they call the police he gets arrested but he doesn't understand why he's arrested in his mind what did I do wrong I just wrote a beautiful song for someone I care about and I wanted to share it with her so my cousin's all of us were like we gotta go to court so they bring them out from the back and he stands up and it's a female judge and his mom my aunt Marguerite she's my great aunt my grandma I'm sister bride's extended family big time and we're all they're watching and the judge says ask the girl her side of things look will this happened he's like she's like would you like to speak on your behalf and he's like I just don't understand what I did wrong I wrote a song for someone I care about and I just wanted to share it and she's like would you mind sharing some of the lyrics and we're all like oh shit and he fucking Chris I love you Chris I need you Chris and all Crocker's I want a dyke she goes okay okay that's not that's enough and then they're about to let him go because they understand I'm gonna put a restraining order he's under provision but they're about to let them go in she goes oh wait a second oh there's a other still an open charge here on the books so we're gonna have to take you back say he starts losing his shit like what my a marguerite stands up into a judge she goes hon we dropped those charges everyone calls people hunt in baltimore cuz hon we dropped this jar that lady said first of all you don't call me hon I am a judge you address me as your honor we're all like I agree got school and they fucking took him back and he was screaming going us that did they put a family put a charge on yeah he had he would do things like he would show up to their place in a cab the man they'd pay for it they didn't he throw a brick through the window so they happy [Music] they really did drop the charges but it was just a clerical error that never made it to the paperwork and she's like I got to do what I got to do we're taking you back today and he was they were boarded back he was gone nuts oh yeah [Applause]
