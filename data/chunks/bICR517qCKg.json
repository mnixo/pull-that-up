hello freak bitches Buddhism is a religion I mean at least in terms of how we understand religion is it tax free is it tax free yeah do you have a tax-free exemption the same way that other religions do we personally don't but you don't you could you could do that yeah you'll get fucking chased down don't do it really hairy when you don't want to pay taxes they go oh really time to take a little closer look at the Buddhist geek organization yeah see what you're doing on Saturday that's their infiltrate yeah I think I mean you inherit but using that framework we inherit all you know we Herod it and so there's a lot about religions and spirituality in general that is not that I don't personally like you know like what so I think that there is a there's a tendency to project I mean you brought in the word divinity so I'll use that like to project our divinity on to the teachers are on to some sort of system and it can be disempowering for a lot of people people can get trapped in beliefs that you know have been carried forward for you know years and centuries that aren't isn't forwarding anymore and so that sense like by choosing to go under Buddhism we're also choosing to you know work on how we can evolve how we think about it and one thing that I really like is the is the practices themselves the mind training aspect of it that's what's been really beneficial to me and that's one of the reasons when I've chosen to continue because if its impact the mind training aspects of it like what what do you think is like the tangible benefits of this mind training aspect of it that you personally experience personally I can say personally I feel much much more much more open and much more generous compassionate there's a lot more freedom I can get stuck on the smaller sense of self meaning you know I have these thoughts of like unworthiness or self contraction or hatred or any of those you know biological kind of urges and at the same time they're so transient and they're so not who I am and I see that very very clearly that it kind of diminishes in just a second on the good days sometimes it's more intense and I've learned to really work with that and learn how to see clearly what's happening so that I have the freedom to really choose how to live my life in a much more full way that just the evidence that the Internet is real that is one of the best evidence is that there are people that are just so far beyond how fucking smart you think smart is it's like remember when you were like five or six years old you had like a lot of times you had like there's one kid in the neighborhood that maybe it was like a little bit bigger a little bit stronger than other kids and when you would play with them on the field like you get like bummed out like you get knocked over and shit like remember what you thought that was like that was a strong little kid but if you were there right now you'd be like get out of here you little fuck stop knocking in everybody you know I mean I it was a more secured that he had freckles or something like yeah you'd be like get out he fucking little weirdo don't be mean to me I'm a grown-ass man but that's what I feel like like technologically and in just the the the mental capacity of a super genius in comparison to me I feel like if I'm that little kid and like if I tried to figure out how the fuck they figured out the Internet I'd just be like oh my brain isn't worked out good I can't talk to you you're freaking me out man you know if you if you went into one of those dudes offices and they had of those crazy like Good Will Hunting shit on the wall and he's doing those equations that fucking nobody understands yeah you know that they'll work on for years you know even if professor didn't yeah how did you yeah I remember like in Good Will Hunting the fucking the janitor fixes the problem they leave it open to the janitor can work on the problem really yeah what if you just erased it what if he's just crazy yeah he's not why you a janitor bitch this is a stupid story you're a super genius janitor get the fuck out of here the fuck out here you're smarter than anybody you can figure out these equations and nobody else Chanin you're also beautiful right what are the yard and charming what are we uh it's just so wacky that's so wacky so I see we could spend the whole thing talking about this because it's so it's one of those things where like there's a bunch of people in on a joke mm-hmm you know and you're like just wanting someone to say okay we're just fucking them well those belief systems the thing about having those belief systems is that they're very empowering for people who believe in them like if you if you look at it and go wait a minute wait a minute fucking planet Xenu really yeah I know it's insane like I'm reading about this after you brought up X Cal for what you're talking about and I pulled up that website that mock Scientology Xenu net oh I've never been there but this oh my favorite site bro they have everything they have they have the entire Scientology like like everything about what they believe all of the operating yeah man you know I got that WikiLeaks operating the operating manual like level 3 which is apparently where I guess Tom Cruise is like four or five or six or something but he was three couple years like they have different manuals you know so he was three a couple years ago now he's four or five or six I don't know where he said I haven't keeping up with his level what rank he's at but I know he's ranked up because they've like given him they made up some new award for him and did you ever see that video that leaked yeah he's like using all the stuff that was like they made up this one they made up this thing they'd never had before as a guardian of the galaxy I gave it to him and he was like he's like saying all that chin it made no sense even on their words and stuff yeah like the internet and people put music to it and she had gorgeous yeah it's so good to work of art it is it is man I mean almost it is almost like like something that you would see from some artists who's doing so I'm like fucking peace yeah where he's gay man that'd be so brilliant if like he just all of a sudden flipped and told everybody yeah I've been just listen it helps my acting if I could pretend to really be into Scientology this long it's like the Dumb and Dumber may the new one coming out have you seen the preview I have oh my god it's genius but there's like there's the old thing where Jim Carrey characters care Carrie's character is like in a insane asylum go over this over that chick the merry Samsonite is it known from the first one and then it turns out he was like joking like for like 20 years and Lloyd Lloyd you mean to tell me that you've been even faking for twenty years all for a gag and he's like yep be amazing if you did that
