five four three two one yes andr live bryan callen we are live on the internet in Kashmir right now everybody how come you know where watches you were just saying I don't wear I don't I was thinking because Santa Brennan I go you can rob my house and there's nothing you find a value like there's not a fucking thing still your car okay oh no wonder why you make money then yeah well obviously a lot of money right I definitely like not work for years yeah I make money what but uh I never thought I was thinking about that too I can I genuinely I did some soul-searching about this because I watched how motivated Shabbos he's so buttoned down about his stuff he's just always coming up with ideas and you know I don't think I ever gave two fucks for real about fame or money and I still don't I have a very precarious relationship with that what I love is coming up with new ideas and writing new stand-up and you know like now having done the album now I got to come up with a whole new bag of tricks that that's a really fun time I'm probably more happy or never as happy as when I'm on the road at some cafe somewhere coming up solving problems coming up with new ideas and surprising myself everything else you know and I like hanging with my boys and laughing and like having a nice house do you get any pleasure out of having a nice house yeah but I could live I'm have lived in rudimentary places and I have I don't notice yeah I noticed that when I when I first started making money you get everything gets normal mm-hmm like this is your house will wake up it's normal you know what doesn't change what always makes you feel good as views I was about to say that I can't believe you just said that view is not underrated no views are views are very underrated I so interesting you say that I just said that you know well said to me Ray Kurzweil really yeah he always lives in a place of the view yeah when I interviewed him he was on a very high floor in an apartment building in San Francisco that's where he lives and you out you'd look out from his apartment and you see the city and you see the bay and it's beautiful yeah it's expansive yes he said views are very important to him they are but I have another weird thing that like if you put me in a French cafe there's that there's a fun office still around but there was a first I'm so French Vasya yeah yeah we should before Cinco Hamill this is my accent as firstly I want you to just for him I said I speak French fluency I'm oh come on people do jumbo how are you so much deep speak it fully no I mean I used to speak it I went to French schools yeah um you know I mean I can give me give me 6 months and I'm gonna you'd hop right Berger I think so the dating pool and France are you sure what were you saying you're about the system's about you were in a cafe in France there's a place called chez Paul's which is this restaurant where you're crammed in with a bunch of people and and the walls and the wood has been there you know you go to the comedy store like a comedy like a comedy club that's been around since the 70s yourself yeah and you think these the wood in this this is a weird thing but the wood in these walls has it have absorbed so much laughter and good energy I was just saying that the other day about the ice house ah it's it's it's very special if they redemptive Mallis that god forbid I would buy that wood and put it up on my walls oh so you it's magic tough yes magical stuff yes hmm I like things that last I like marble and and heavy wood like old railroad tracks reclaimed wood yeah yeah like this table yeah good levels reclaimed wood yeah good a man with a moustache handmade things like guys handmade I do craftsman like like like if I hadn't if I wanted to I would maybe go and have my shoes made in London I'd have bespoke shoes and bespoke love that when they use that I know I'd have bespoke shoes the problem of jewelry watches nice and everything is I have to maintain them and I I I'd rather have mmm I also think we have to maintain watches just put them on that's right but I have a weird I have another weird thing which I think if I have leather under my feet mmm I don't feel as secure and I don't feel like it can run or fight Oh like leather soles we need some rubber bro I got it yeah you should have some tread yeah they can put some leather tread below the rubber tread rather below the leather you don't want those scuffed up leather bottom shows man those bitches useless like they're not socks right but it's good for pivoting if you want to pivot like you want to throw a wheel kick it's really good yes it's true if you want to bear down if I want to what's called squash the bug when I throw my right and squash the bug with my back foot no because you want to push off you wanted to have some something to push off yeah you don't need that much pivot you really need pivot with a kick yeah you know a spinning kick yes yeah this is the kind of bullshit you and I stand well the fucked up thing is that you know I'm always getting ready for home invasion or situations mark it might be the problem is that that there are just too many things to worry about I could also I also have to worry about fucking ticks and things that I can't see like flesh-eating bacteria and MERS to worry about more than anything lastly asteroid Olympics you do yep yeah because they can come and then wipe out civilization almost instantaneously there was something I just retweeted yesterday the Graham Hancock put up they found a new impact site at 12,500 years ago that that coincides at the end of the Ice Age this is one of the things that he and Randall Carlson have been saying ad nauseam and now Bryan or a Robert Schoch rather who's a professor at Boston University did you hear about the explosion on the meteor the exodus ember yes December yeah this meteor that exploded in December had something like 50 times the ortho power it in the atmosphere okay Oh 1010 atomic bombs ten times the power of the atomic bomb that exploded in Hiroshima Wow yeah and explode in our atmosphere but no there's this impact that they think happened and well there's two concepts Robert Schoch thinks that it might have coincided these impacts might have coincided with he believes there's a great deal of evidence for a mass coronal ejection that there was some sort of a solar flare massive solar storm that happened which can periodically happen every few thousand every few hundred years something can happen and when that does happen it just wipes out everything and he said there was thunderstorms it's like there's the they said thunderstorms or lightning storms that were like like the hail that was coming out outside that we filmed today yeah but that but like lightning put that background please Jesus so this is the impact created that they found in Greenland it's in three miles yes Oh 31 kilometres across which is not 15 miles yeah somewhere around 15 miles in fuck insanely huge but do you think as you think about your impending doom which is gonna happen right I just worry about the civilization being we're so dependent upon electricity and any small catastrophe oh this is they have an an impact video of where it hit Wow so it's all all this this hit like where there's glaciers right now with this massive impact they got hit man the the people that lived 12,500 years ago got hit they get there's more than one crater too by the way this is one of the many craters that they found during the time period of 12,500 BC or twelve thousand five hundred years ago rather to ten thousand years ago in that time period that two thousand year time period they think there was multiple impacts on the earth why why I guess it just wasn't our time now well we're lucky we've just been through a really lucky stage but what he's saying essentially is that this is what wiped out the Egyptian civilization the first Egyptian civilization this is what wiped out the civilization that built Gobekli Tepe this is what wiped out the civilization that preceded sumar√© and ancient babylon and mesopotamia that all those were a rebuild of uh I can't wait for him to come back on again he's coming back on again Graham Hancock is coming back on again I think listening debate that other guy you had on the podcast it was Grant yeah Wells Michael Shermer was also actually a friend of mine who I like yeah he's he's a skeptic and there's an issue with skeptics and that the issue is not that it's not good to be skeptical it's very good to be skeptical the problem is when you approach things as a skeptic you're not approaching them as a scientist and I'm not saying that Michael does this but that I think he did in that debate I think it was a mistake people they approach these things looking to debunk them rather than objectively assessing all the possible evidence right and so because of that you miss out on big thing like this is evidence this is not like Bigfoot tracks or some shit like that this is fucking real evidence of a crater that they have dated back to twelve thousand five hundred years ago yeah but people have a hard time believing in doomsday scenarios because it kind of like you know when you talk about taking the entire chessboard and throw it in the air and you have evidence for it look at global warming and stuff like that where there is a I really believe that people have if whether it's latent or not a religious notion that we are ultimately sacred and that God would never do something that terrible to us on mass I really I really believe that like humanity itself to go away no because that would make no sense where we're moving in a certain direction we're making progress there's there's this sort of neural net it's becoming easier to understand what it is to be each other you know and and that's kind of what virtual reality and being able to download other people's brains will eventually do yeah that probably brings us into one I guess universal consciousness I mean you can go on and on so the idea that that would be all obliterated before it happens before the singularity for example happens is too much to bear it would make no sense for us because we have this narrative that we all kind of adhere to it's very easy to do that it's in the psychological sort sort of I want to say I want to say a trick that we play on ourselves but it's really a defense mechanism mm-hmm it's a little trick that we try to pretend that we're important god damn it just look up at the sky and although you can't see it there are stars that are being swallowed up by black holes yeah like if the universe doesn't give a fuck about something that's a million times bigger than the earth yeah why would you think he gives a fuck about you it's eating stars that's a terrible question most people that's a terrible insulting question the problem you know that's kind of what who was it Albert Camus the French existentialist and Sartre and all those guys they were saying like Camus said the fundamental question is why wouldn't you why not just commit suicide because everything is totally absurd and nothing means anything right it's like the rock of Sisyphus that you keep pushing up and it keeps rolling down and then he said but but the truth is most people don't want to kill themselves but they'll commit philosophical suicide meaning instead of like really starting to ask these questions and really getting into it and realizing that it's all hopeless and despair you know you you just you just go on to a certain philosophy that gives you hope religion yeah or whatever it might be which is what it is and maybe the way out of that is just to enjoy every day taste your food enjoy your friends and realize that it could end in any in any second you know one another thing that's fucked with me the concept of reincarnation not the concept of reincarnation like coming back as a butterfly or something like that but the concept of living your life over and over and over again until you get it right Jesus now here's what fucks with me I am having a great time so why wouldn't I want to do this again yeah I'm having a great time I have great friends like you and young Jamie over the Aron I have I love my family I love what I do for a living I love our circle of friends is amazing I mean we are for sure some of the luckiest men I have ever met in my life there's no doubt there's no doubt we have fun man dude I was thinking about all the mistakes I've made but then I went wait a minute but I'm at 52 I'm here I've made like fuck loaded mistakes where we are but we're also risk takers yeah I mean we're professional performers we want into a job that has zero job security yeah fucking headfirst no safety net dove right in you know we make mistakes we make mistakes with our our job we make mistakes with our personal life and make mistake with it's just no women no good because because I don't have a dress rehearsal I'm a presented with these I'm presented with the scenario and I have to make a choice in real time yeah I'm gonna make a mistake right and and once I realize that and stop beating myself up about it and realize that I've always done the best I can but here's where you here's what you can do be brutally honest and assess yourself and see where you're falling short and then just change your approach yeah so that's kind of what I do when I saw acting when I saw what just being an actor was and I saw how precarious it was and I saw where the business was moving with like new media and stuff and I was like this doesn't make out then I watched you doing your podcast and you would say stratified so guess what I started a podcast didn't go well started another podcast didn't make money then start a third podcast with friend and shop and blah blah blah but you know it's same thing with stand-up you just keep doing it yeah you keep following the models that work coz I was doing the wrong thing over here and next thing you know you know you got a grind that's where a lot of comics fuck up like they do it like once a week and then they take a few weeks off and then come back and do it again and they're like how do you do it all the time I'm like because I know how to grind I'm a grinder it's not just grind like for me the idea is original self-expression I'm interested in trying to take the way I think so a lot of things scare me and they make me angry and I don't know how to I don't know how to react but you know instead of fretting about it I create you know Michelangelo my favorite quote criticized by creating didn't great fucking crow he said that's beautiful yeah he said that he said criticized by creating I always think about that because that's kind of when I look at my body of work and the progression of my my specials for example like man class little - you know just about being funny and a silly goose then never grew up a little more personal about my dad but this last one complicated Apes is that out right now it's out right now oh my god is this the number one iTunes comedy album the rankings apparently it's crushing and weird it's number one in the world where you can rent and buy I guess complicated Apes just doing very well you want to get it and laugh hard and learn feel like we should celebrate listen this is not one this is not about promoting my special feel like we should feel you should promote it a little bit alright fine get complicated Apes let's just get out right now right I guess it's out right now iTunes or anywhere your reselect aerial TV you can just watch it on your you get an Xbox or Playstation you can listen up you can get on Amazon I don't stop any platform all the platform you know um Amazon is really getting into the special game yes they're doing Alonzo Bodden special he's gonna be coming on soon I love Alonzo they're doing good man yeah he's a very smart guy good dude yeah um they're doing Jim Gaffigan special he's Falcon hilarious um and I think they're talking to a bunch of other people about doing specials as well they decided to I love that there are all these other people who love it and we're in the Renaissance where Stan's can make real money and used to not be that way you have loves now you got theaters now you've got a whole network now the internet and everything else and you know what's beautiful about the road now is I don't have to do that local press oh that's so good come see me in Kansas City this Friday Saturday what club be doing the improv Oh a nice place Kansas City yeah I love Kansas City Kansas City I like it a lot it's fucking hell yeah I did an outdoor theater there summer yeah it's fucking great me and Santino really fucking amazing man really really fun that's pretty badass yeah yeah Kansas City's a shit it's one of those places that people forget st. Louis that's also the shit yeah that's a fun place especially a terrible town now here's how dare you first of all barbecue no st. Louis I had a little problem with but Kansas a fantastic kind of problem job I just thought it was very ugly city maybe you're jealous maybe maybe didn't go to the pretty spots would you go over like Google Earth he'd drive all over the whole fucking City how about Cleveland this is where we draw the line I like clean I fucking love clean let me tell you why I like leavin it's a beautiful city I mean talk about architecture it's like pictures yeah and some great colors he said like Pittsburgh yes that's true that's totally true it's wet weather oil but then some of the iron I mean it was I think them was were some of the richest people in the world we're at one point last time I was in Pittsburgh well the first time rather I said well not even the first time one of the times I was in Pittsburgh I was there for a furry convention oh I was there for the UFC and the UFC was in Pittsburgh at the same time a furry convention was on that's when I found out about furries I had a nice long conversation with the dudes who worked behind the desk at the hotel they were telling me the furries were asking for their food in bowls so they could eat off the ground no yeah yeah they were all furries except us the fuck is going with me I forget who opened for me it might have been Dunkin but uh the they were asking for a litter box so they could shit and piss in a box I want to do that just for a laugh oh you're gonna wipe we're gonna fetish well it's like grown men who want to be they want to wear diapers and have somebody spanked them and change them and well here's what's interesting and there's a lot of people that think that look I am a hundred percent in support of people being trans don't get me wrong if you want I'm in support I'm supporting you being whatever you want to be I'm a person who believes in free will or your ability to freely express yourself I should say but if you work for a corporation you work for a tech corporation especially a particularly progressive tech corporation you run into some real problems and I was talking to a guy who was telling me you don't know the half of it that we are dealing with a guy who he identifies as an animal and that he he believes that he's kin like he's a fox can or a dog can or something like that and he wants a litter box in his office this guy wants to be able to shat in his fucking office into a box now I appreciate that now I want to say this about him and I'm not a psychiatrist and I have no right to really diagnose but he's fucking crazy yeah he is crazy right but here's the thing like you're letting people be crazy correct look when you're letting a six-foot-four man compete in women's weightlifting because he's decided he's a woman now mm and now he's winning and he's wearing makeup and he looks like a gorilla and he's onstage lifting his arms up hey diversity you're you're stealing from women stealing you're stealing victory you're cheating you're fucking 100 percent cheating anybody says or not you're an asshole you're nice no but you know this is about humaneness and once when someone's feelings how they identify in that moment of course are so transitory right I mean I'm either the hope my fucking not to bring it back but the whole idea of complicated ages your new special basically every way it does oh my god and wherever the fuck look under your fight look in your sock drawer there's my sock but but but i but I do think that you know we are complicated like we're bipolar Apes sinners and saints and everything in between another good so whit your feelings how you feel sometimes I feel like an asshole other times I feel like a saint and everything in between you know it's very difficult to you know say well this is your a noun which means your this as opposed to sort of a verb which is I'm always changing and that that to me is the problem with when you identify when you when you emotionally identify with something well for now you do for now that that's what's important to you but I can't I can't tailor my life and my entire corporation this is what the part of the problem is and this is what you just hit on yeah part of the problem is these people want to be special for no reason at all correct and so to be special for no reason at all one of the best ways is to do what Bruce Jenner did you become Caitlyn Jenner and then he's special that guy was a fucking loser even though he's a gigantic superstar in the Olympics 40 years ago but from then on they shat on that guy every fucking show that's right they shit on him he was the buffoon of that show and then all of a sudden he becomes a woman ever it's like you're amazing and will make a woman here a woman for six minutes all the women that do things like Christina Dodd now came up with Christopher cook whisper cast nine and all those whoa is this the guy okay this is hilarious this is a dude who's a comic is your comedies a rapper he's a rapper and he's fucking jacked so he decided to identify as a woman what Minnesota he destroys the British woman's deadlift record without even trying Wow PS I identified as a woman whilst lifting weights don't be a bigot imagine that so chief biological men don't have any physical strength advantage over women in 2019 okay anybody says that is a fool that's foolishness what he's just did yeah good for him what's his name zou Bisou B what is music zoo B is a stage name shout-out to zoo B looks for a graduate it doesn't mean you're a Rhodes Scholar zubi congratulations to you sir I'm following you right now I'm gonna go right to my goddamn Twitter for the sheriff rethink your free god bless you look it's like this is silliness folks these and here's the problem with a lot of these progressives is that they're really nice people that's what it is zoo B follows me and now I follow him shoutout to zoo B they're nice people as long as you agree that yes exactly don't they try to deep platform you I got listed Tim Poole sent me this thing ready next to Richard Spencer as being a far-right influencer right influencer far-right was it they called me far-right that's amazing I'm left they're liars I am fucking left did that how's the socialist yeah I consider universal basic income a really good idea I want free college education Keynesian I would like to spend more in taxes if they could fix inner-city communities and and take these poor neighborhoods spend more you fucking real promise you the more money you spend it doesn't that's the pricing you son of a bitch feel it coming out of your pores this you socialist 1.6% Africans so watch your fucking mouth dude no one is so uh compassionate Compassion's everything but I think these people are too compassionate this is what the problem is they're like oh you identify a wood elf oh cool you're an elf I don't wanna you know like whatever your feelings and here's the thing they're terrified of someone coming after them so they try to embrace the more preposterous the better yeah like they're having a real hard time now with this woman the congressman you know who set a bunch of anti-semitic Shia whose family stop right antes really shit what is it anti-semitic has you said anything bad about Jews and Gentiles and to Israelis stuff which I think you can make a distinction yes you should I think you should be able to make it intelligent argument that there is a difference between being not anti Israeli but having problems with their policies and Jews Yeah right because there are a lot of Jews that are critical of Israel is a lot of person yeah so it's you know but sometimes to silence you and stop the art yeah I don't I'm not familiar what she said exactly but I'm not either yeah but but yeah but go on what were you saying about about the problem they don't know what to do with her they're stuck in this weird spot because they don't like here's a perfect example where was it was it was somewhere in Europe where these this Muslim group was shouting down this LBGT demonstration and that like everybody's like oh well Jesus what do we do here we have two protected classes going to war with each other yeah and one of them is shouting down the other ones saying that you know homosexuality is forbidden by God but then we're supposed to be protective of LBGT people were supposed to be open-minded and progressive and allowing that but but then you have these people who are saying that it's their religion that they think that this is this is wrong and this is also a protected class you don't want to be Islamophobic so what does everyone do what everyone stands back and this is one of the weird moments where people are standing back while LBGT people are getting absolutely crucified in the streets yelled out with bullhorns told their beings they're sinners and a blasphemer that actually is part of free speech right so so it's organize and express yourself organizing petition your government that's constitutional as long as you don't incite someone to violence as long as you don't say hey you guys go kill those gay people over there well I'm not talking about constitutionally I mean constitutionally I agree it is free speech but what I'm saying is that there's no outrage there's no commensurate outrage like there would be if say like white nationalists were screaming at these people so so here's my issue with the far left or the left or even if I forget the right for a second I have my own issues with that but my with the progressive argument I always notice that the narrative is very binary the narrative is always so for example racism is the argument right so if we need to get rid of racism I happen to think we could be as identical as Penguins and we'd still find reasons to break into us versus them well we'd have an ideological but of course we did look look at the Middle East if racism of the was the ultimate problem then you the Middle East would be fair it would be of Sunnis and Shia yeah the ebo in the Yoruba I'm sure going with would be all kinds of so people are looking Dinka and the newer of the Sudan sworn enemies they look exactly the same so human beings don't need to have different colored skin I couldn't agree more yeah so so so we are tribal and it's fun to break into these us versus them I think yeah the biggest problem is is kind of deciding that first of all the Internet has made it very possible for you to purify your echo chamber yeah that's a big problem and and then you surround yourself with people who think and and see the world exactly like yourself and I think we get smarter when we listen to the other side of me if you don't agree with them because your ideas aren't working and their ideas are working but put your ideas together and maybe somebody gets pregnant with a new idea yeah the the idea is that there's some way that you could stop all division between human beings as long as people allowed to express themselves they live unique in individual lives that's never going to happen you're gonna have people that come from different parts of the world where different things are more important you're gonna have people that come from different economic situations it's going to be different I mean when when I say that I'm almost a socialist what I mean is like look there's certain things we just accept that we need like here one you need a well-funded fire department right whose money everybody we're pooling all our money into that grind right we agree with that we agree there's well-funded public education you have to have that right well we barely do that right now but we do have that and teachers are getting fucked left and right there getting minimal pay children are going to school in hazardous conditions but it's at least there's some money being police officers we agree Street fixing the streets we agree we agree on a lot of things but then it gets to certain things we go okay well that's where we draw the line well why do we draw the line there why do we draw the line with when it comes to community upheavals like fixing fixing communities yeah why do you mean infrastructure like yeah but why did why why don't we have like why don't we if we really a team or if the United States really team why don't we look at it as a team in terms of equal allocation of resources to solve conflicts and problems including crime we don't yeah right a lot of times the problem is isolating the source of the problem right so people disagree on what the actual problem is I can give you examples I mean when when we talk about illegal immigration and what to actually do about it people are all over the board with it and they'll challenge your solution in court and there's all kinds of stillness which probably is a good thing so things don't get too they don't swing too far in our direction universal basic income universal health care gun control these are actually fairly complicated issues you know I don't want spree shooters you know but when you get down to it and and you hear people who are really educated on the subject of guns they can get you twisted up in an argument if you start talking about gun control because you realize this is a complicated issue and maybe it's a mental health issue maybe it's a thousand issue you know that's certainly a mental there's a lot of issues with it but the ability that someone has to do what is it we said only one guy more than one person got arrested in New Zealand correct no I think it was just one guy yeah more but they got arrested but only one shoe yes so the other ones are planning it's not their baby yeah no I think he would say yeah but but my thing is that point is that you have to be ill there's no other way you have to be mentally ill you know or to do that yeah now I want anything about the fact there's more guns there are people so in this country alone there's 300 plus million people there's more than 300 million guns relatively speaking the number of mass shootings is incredibly small in comparison to the amount of guns and the amount of sick people mm and how many people are sick who don't become mass shooter right it's a big number yes it's it's very true those are things and a lot of the gun violence that the left talks about a lot of those are suicides so a lot of it yeah a lot of that is suicides a lot of it is cops shooting bad guys a lot of his people defending themselves and then after that you have gang violence but so so but so the problem is that when people argue they make these things very simplistic yeah and they're not you know even the even identity politics I mean you know so straight white males are essentially the enemy so the idea would be if we take straight my white males out of the equation because this is all power right it's all talking the issue man no but I know I'm not but this tyrannical hierarchy and stuff as if if you took white males and took all of them out of the equation as if there wouldn't be a new hierarchy yeah that's fucking good you know it's just the way shit happens people when you try to make the things really equal in a communist Society the people closest to the government making the decisions they become the new elite so you're not gonna fucking know avoid that shit no and also there's no equality of effort the problem with equality of income and equality we like people want success too they think that if you're more successful that it's because of some sort of a cheat you've you've rigged the system or cheated somehow or another but that's not true some people work harder they just course they just do of course some people become obsessed with success and some people my uncle my uncle Vinny doesn't give a fuck you know what my uncle Vinny does he makes art sells it yeah he's always been that way he used to be a photographer and now he he makes a he sent me some driftwood that he painted Wow he painted signs for my daughters made out of driftwood he says so like that he's so eccentric but he's never given a fuck about a churro his ex-wife cray it just makes beautiful things for he's an artist yeah he's legitimate artist works that way Jimmy Burke is truly not ambitious he is he is only interested in feeding his brain he loved like he listens to a Stephen West podcast philosophize this which is I love that that's my news I've been talking to that guy back in Lois I'm gonna get him on yeah I gotta get him on I love he's 29 and he's got such a command of philosophy but he makes it so accessible yeah like Jimmy he'll start his day with philosophize that's just listen gonna get a nugget and then he goes and works out and plays tennis and just he's a national treasure because he only lives to educate himself and make the world a better place he just makes people feel good about themselves he's trying to enjoy life but do you think you'd want to do it over and over and over again the exact same life I do he's he's the happiest he's the closest thing to a monk I was just with him I I flew him down to Florida I just folks you want to watch a disaster we got him way too high I got him like three or four heads deep and he doesn't smoke weed he hadn't eaten yeah neaten and he was thirsty I don't think that if eating helps when you're smoking it I might be wrong does it he was already low blood sugar and he hadn't slept we barbecued that dude we threw him in a Trager grill and set it to twenty five six hours just for getting stories in the middle of the first sentence he's amazing yeah we fucked him up which is too bad because he tells some great stories now the world will forever know him was the guy who couldn't well I remember when he the he had tuberculosis I called him Jimmy Burke Colossus and he had tuberculosis or did he got it they think he got it from his grandfather when he was three years old and it laid dormant and they couldn't find it cuz I was on the outside of his lung holy Sh oh yeah I'm with him in the hospital I've never seen anything like this I'm with him in the hospital and he had they thought he had two things one the disease that killed Bernie Mac or two hussies killed Bernie man he had a that disease that firemen get from 9/11 where lungs basically turned to sand I mean you know awful so Bernie Mac died of that so they said you have either a fatal disease which is that lung disease or you have lung cancer okay now this was what he was looking at and I remember he was just talking to me like this did it did it do and joking around oh dude yeah and I went buhbuh I go you were you've been given like they are looking at you either being you know you're dead or dead I don't understand how you're not even missing a beat and he goes dude come on I've made peace with my death a long time ago I live every day as he comes and he and that he was getting ready for them to come out and tell him what it was and the doctors you know you can't help but to love him so he was there for three weeks and the doctors finally found that he had tuberculosis now at this point all the doctors fell in love with him all of them they come in and listen to his stories so the doctor came running and it goes we found out will you have you have tuberculosis tumors I got great no no we can cure that this is fucking great we can cure that so he went on nine months of antibiotics nine and he went colorblind from the alibi yeah that's what happened to him he's now his colour blind you know whoa that's the antibiotics did but hey he's a hundred percent but I remember I've never seen anybody face his own death and be that just monk like about he's does he have a good diet yeah now when he was on the antibiotics they give him probiotics as well i does probiotics he brought his body right back I mean he is just a beast he's never stopped working out he's never stopped eating really well do they know what he caused his antibiotic reaction that made him colorblind Adderley is a side effect when you take nine months of a very strong cocktail of antibiotics mmm you know and that cured it though nine months later cured it yeah thank God there's no way it cures it on its own well it back in the day you had consumption and almost you died eventually but some people would go up into the mountains and it would it would tuberculosis can go into remission and not come out again when you go to the mountain the idea was we'll go to the mountains and breathe fresh air and sometimes you could go into remission with intimate with tuberculosis but tuberculosis was almost always a death sentence in long day's journey and tonight the great play and Nobel Prize winner Eugene O'Neill his brother had it and he knew his brother was gonna die and he just watched his brother deteriorate it was a like it was like having AIDS or something you would cough you'd spit up blood and you know I think Chopin the great piano player died of it then why when people talk about you know when their their anti vaccine or their anti antibiotics or Western medicine just read forget about the science don't don't worry about Big Pharma just pick up a history book or a piece of literature anything that's written before 1950 which most people don't 1960 any classic book and the one of the central themes is is the fact that people especially children that Lincoln lost what three of his children three - fever quote unquote usually probably did theoria or something that came rolling through smallpox was a fucking it was the biggest killer forever Spanish flu of 1918 people live 20 mil 20 million billions of people yeah so if you just forget forget me just pick up a history book or pick up a piece of literature it was unavoidable yeah it's very candid Spanish flu apparently was a really weird one because it actively attacked people with really good immune no young people young people like them better than it killed older people some stranger yeah and that was that was a fact of life you usually buried your children throughout history you had to bury your children that's a that's a unequivocal fact we don't live in that world anymore we don't worry about those those diseases like tetanus and diphtheria and things that would roll through and just people are getting it now people are getting tetanus again that's right some kid got tetanus and I saw people arguing that one of the dumbest fucking things I ever saw in my life someone's saying there's a simple cure to tetanus just expose it to open air is that a scientist was that a guy who has his degree why these guys never have a degree is a chemtrail believer but why is it that all these guys make the noise don't have degrees because they want to believe that there's some sort of a some sort of an organized clan of people that trying to keep your health down or support big pharma look they're they're the real facts of diseases like smallpox and like polio like all these horrific diseases that people in our grandparents generation had to deal with is that they were cured by medicine yeah yeah it is modern Pharma greedy fuck and look no further than the Arctic oxycontin crisis the opiate crisis we're facing this country yeah Big Pharma left unchecked is like anything else where it's a corporation that wants to have universal growth they want to have constant never-ending growth and they want to keep making money in the way to do that as prescribed more people poison been cold Aker ever have announced podcast he wrote a book called bad farmer but he's a doctor who takes a very he said they there is evil but you have to know what kind of evil don't just throw the whole exact if you have mersa you need Big Pharma fuck yeah you know if you have staff just talk to anybody who's ever rested there anything dude campaigns son had staff and he called me I was like how bad his staff I'm like Jesus Christ because he told me son his son got it at the gym I'm like get him to the fucking doctor immediately now my wife's friend went into a coma she started having seizures because of an unchecked staph infection she got at the gym she started seizures I'm at sushi with Frank Grillo our buddy and he boxes every day and I see his arm and he's got a long sleeve shirt and his arms bleeding and I go what's going on with your arm because I got caught I was at the gym and he's always on that dirty you know mat or just do whatever in a literally seven hours his he had a sack hanging off his elbow doctor goes you got to get he almost lost his arm he had to get shots antibiotics for a whole week I mean that shit moves quick moves very you would lose your arm yeah die I told I tell you the artist of your story me and Ari are playing pool and he's limping I'm like what's going on with your leg and he goes I think I got a spider bite I'll let me see your leg he poses like I go dude listen to me

me I got bottom a year apart of a year membership for jujitsu for Hanukkah but yeah man it was fucking nasty and he would have just walked around with it and then it would have gotten really bad he probably would have got systemic and died yeah but happens to people my buddy Ryan who is a health Gracie black belt they had to cut out they had to cut an inch off of his shinbone mm because the screws so every time he'd be on antibiotics year-and-a-half in and out of the hospital took him tears to recover with mnemonics year and a half because the screws every time they put the screws back in they bruise the screws had the virus or bacteria so he had to have when they took out the they took out the bone and they had to put a plate there they they would use screws so for whatever reason the screws that were in the metal would somehow they were infected they kept infecting the bone oh and they had to grow that somehow graft bone back on it was too fucking crazy it's no joke man how happy what's that something like that happens though how happy when you're healed yeah I had a cold recently just a little cold not that bad but I was running ragged just too many trips and too busy and getting up early and going to bed late and I was just really tired and sick and then I couldn't work out for like four or five days and I remember thinking to myself you got to remember this you got to remember this shitty feeling when you can't even exercise and I'm Hawking up green shit and spitting in the sink just to look at it I know do you do that you blow your nose in the same course I do I do that I go yeah yeah I want to see it see what it looks like just big fucking Smurfs yeah shit big green gob eul's all over the fucking sink but I just remember thinking like you got to be smarter stupid just be smarter but yeah most of the time I am yeah most the time man but sometimes I just go I gotta hit that gas I got nothing in sank but I gotta fucking keep that accelerator pressed that's why I don't fuck around my sleep anymore I read that book why we sleep Matthew Walker is amazing I I just I don't fuck around my sleep in him should not you should not sleep is critical yeah yeah it's um you know what it is amazing for sleep man you know we should get in your place get yourself a sauna really really oh yeah you do take off that's for fucking you wear a rubber nose

get really cold you chef at ice bath you wanna do that I'll do an ice bath I've done have you done krile yeah I'll have you done the real one when you want head goes in no you did the one where the neck below on it has the bullshit one really yeah the real ones only made by cryo health care they have one in New York or one Center in New York they have one in LA they have one here they've won a Woodland Hills I'm sitting at a nice path for 20 minutes and talk to me um okay you go numb it sucks I'm sure bitch so does 250 degrees below zero have you not done I spent three minutes yeah yeah come on bro it sucks all right bro I get it you wear a fucking do you wear a I somehow knows see I just double burned it singing a song I was singing sing yeah it's not good there's probably some real benefits to ice baths the benefit of cryo overwrites baths you could work out right afterwards ice baths they recommend you not work out they're like you just chill out for a while but it's great after you're working out but for muscles strength and development it's actually not good to do it right after training you actually should wait quite a while like maybe an hour too so when you you've been you've had countless conversations with cutting-edge scientists and exercise people the five things that you do every day like that that without fail what are they in terms of for your health first of all I supplement I think you believe in self I believe absolutely wholeheartedly and supple like wind what kind Tom I think athletic greens it's it's a sponsor they have it's a great whole food supplement I'm doing a bad form right now one one serving as twelve one scoop has twelve servings of fruits and vegetables in terms of the amount of yeah very healthy it's good just for like a back-up plan right take these little packs with me on the road I take a lot of the on it shit I take obviously I'm planning a shroom tech you know we have some awesome whole food supplements there's a bunch of great stuff I take a lot of vitamins I take vitamin D I take vitamin B I take a lot of fish oil a lot of essential fatty acids I believe in all those things alright cut way back on my sugar I mean way back yeah to where maybe once a week I'll have dessert yeah maybe less I do that - yeah I don't fuck around man yeah I just intermittent fast yes me too 16 hours a day yeah I do that every day that makes me feel that you know my psoriasis is a hundred percent con that's also part of its also and I gotta give a shout-out to Dan Garner Dan Garner 88 Gmail if you need his email he's a fuck so he's the guy who was terrible I do no no it's fine it's fine I want it I want to promote him because only fucking people are gonna email pictures of dicks good buddy a lot of people have psoriasis but let me let me tell you it was so so Andy gallopin who you know yes so I talked to Andy Galvin and and a fief Gunn whom who does who Aubrey put me in touch with he's he he's the guy who coined the term the gut biome you should actually have money he's really really smart guy he's a scientist who's leading scientist in got my own they're working with the Cleveland Institute of dermatology I think with psoriasis so how the gut effects psoriasis so anyway long story short Andy Gavin puts me together with Dan Karns got like 12 degrees but he says strengthen nutrition coach this motherfuckers such a nerd with everything and this guy he I did a gut analysis and all that stuff this guy gives me a diet and and finds some an opportunity opportunity confections in my gut like bacteria that shouldn't be there he's gotta be doing like oil of oregano and fucking garlic pills and stuff like that but there's a whole regimen I do for four months long story short then there's a probiotic protocol that you do I do all that my psoriasis just goes away it's just it has not come back and it's been gone now it's something I'll have to manage but when I say complete cuz you saw my back remember it's all gone and I had that for nine months it got bad so let me talk to Kim Kardashian just get that shit off we'll say overwhelming evidence that a lot of these autoimmune diseases are are its are somehow a gut issue you know how Jordan Peterson cleaned his up yeah yeah carnivore done yeah and they think the corner carnivore dad might be from what I've heard on your podcast and elsewhere is that I guess you you kind of give your gut bacteria a kind of a reset or it's an elimination diet yeah you take away virtually everything except one thing yeah your body adjusts and your body just somehow or another it cures itself of a lot of ailments right with an elimination diet and yeah well that's why that's why I'm special yeah that is why in fasting in general it's so beneficial it helps me but this carnivore die is very fascinating because people fucking swear by it man there's people that they look great their health is improved they've lost weight and gained muscle that's the question that is the question you need some fiber I don't think so I don't think you really do most people that are taking it say they don't have any issues some people have issues in the beginning of it but man people have been doing it for years they've been doing they've been on the carnivore diet for you that dr. Shawn banker he's been on it for years and he all he eats is fucking rib eyes he just eats rib eyes and legs but aren't aren't the there are certain cultures that are hard to present carnivore like I think the Masai traditionally were a lot of the Bantu belt in Africa where the Masai look great oh yeah there's I've seen him in person I've been to Kenya twice I mean they look like a professional athlete beautiful people yeah I mean in terms of the effect on their body they don't look malnourished nourished rather there's six foot six there's you know yeah my friend you know my friend lived with them for he's a pro athlete and he lived with them for six weeks and he goes dude I've been an athlete my whole life I'm not an athlete I tried to run with those guys I tried to do stuff with those guys and he's like the way they can like track shit he goes they could look at a blade of grass and the way it was bent or like a certain area and go oh cuckoo whatever they the fucking kudu ran through here or whatever the fuck they could they could tell what kind of animal can throw whoa and then it had this throwing contest they were throwing shit not just Spears but they were throwing like this whatever it was and he said dude I could I was so embarrassed he was embarrassed he was just such a bitch I have I have northern European bullshit genes these motherfuckers from Kenya you know is all this for sure it's really interesting that the cradle of civilization which is where all human beings emanated from Africa has the best genes they have the best athletic genes when it comes to like physical performance look there's no denying the Biafra coast I mean like Nigeria and that area that those that's al of Senegal mm-hmm bring up Senegal bring up that that what's that wrestling they call I know what you're talking about Grillo and on fight world did he went to Senegal he goes dude six foot six I mean they all look like like that's what the NFL is made up of then and that guy wrote the sports gene Richard Bernstein I think Sports Illustrated writer said the fastest people in the world come from that part of the world to be africo so that's where Jamaica that's where the slave trade had gone and and they they came from that area so you can actually isolate the genes lambda Wow this is interesting there like pawn at each other oh and they're all giant why did it walk huh because they punched and they wrestle and they do great high-level Greco shit watch this is punching - now you'll say watch this high level Greco shit they throw Stanga Lee's wrestling in the car championship beautiful it's la lucha is the the title of the video yeah la space Lu TTE single E's wrestling in the car championship now they're working for position but and if you see some of these guys you see that what their bodies look like it's so just so ridiculous like like they live on fish and rice and beef Frank went there it's so poor and they said you just see dudes where you're like well if I had a body like that I would never wear clothes so I don't understand what they're doing there well they're there just yet coaching just getting position whoever gets thrown then these guys are rock stars in Senegal okay you need coaching no no you'll see no they punch me tell you something Cain Velasquez shoots a power double on these motherfuckers yeah I'm just concerned sir I'm gonna ask you to know that's true that's our five minutes five minutes are still waiting bro it's like sumo deuces not so exactly it's nonsense now you excuse me little Incred trip lunch oh they're punching you no shit dude this is serious oh shit they're punching from the clinch yam bro why this is fighting oh yes sir just his headband yeah you gotta always adjust your headband time Tom what a night what are they doing time time that's it that's the match no I may be non can feel there's got to be a better one you guys see the heavyweights they maybe just sucks and you really into it be sir foreign sir that's possible I'm telling you I've seen some incredible land those dudes are playing patty-cake you know you'll respect land okay another one kickboxing world champion I'll go to the far right one that one okay there here we go now we'll see what's up kick boxing world champion challenges singling these wrestlers who is this kickboxing world champions like a documentary aye sir I don't care unless you know it's not like I gotta find the fight who's this kickboxing Morrow's like there's Sufi Muslim so they're hanging out with them very very spiritually kickboxing well okay orally say his name Brian or learn or lean duarte highly rocked a French multiple kickboxing Muay Thai and shotokan karate champion okay so it looks like he's learning from these folks yes and I don't think he's really challenging them okay let's see what happens in the there we go look at look at my man right there so staying still what does it say sort of sans still just let it go we'll see what happens here are they wrestling yeah oh so they're wrestling but what else it's all bonus e with that dude back up a little I wanna see that dude the kickboxing guy interact with him there we go okay let's see up throws okay they're just teaching him how to throw oh they're teaching him some technique that's kind of cool that they do it on the beach though that's smart that's that's a duck under right there took his back yeah standard wrestling they know some wrestling technique wrestling is you know you can make the argument that wrestling would you say that wrestling is probably the best thing you could ever do coming up if you want to get an MMA like to have that face yes I think wrestling is the most important sport yeah because you see guys like Camaro Iseman there's a perfect example who was just on the podcast he's another example of awesome African genes but he's a he's an excellent example of a guy who really didn't start striking at all until like 2009 I mean but he's been watching how your body moves forever yeah I mean he's been watching and fucking around but it doesn't matter like the way he strikes now you would think he's been doing it his whole life he's been only striking for ten years I think wrestlers are just tougher you know Kamara was saying that his knees are so fucked up before some of his fights that he had to walk on grass cuz I hurt to walk on concrete oh my god really yeah his daughter makes fun of him because he goes down the stairs backwards ah cuz he goes down stairs back oh yes yes she thinks it's hilarious when I when I see him like you know I saw him with Rashad Evans he looked as big as Rashad he's a big fella yeah but here's the thing he couldn't be a nicer guy he's great he couldn't be a nicer guy and when you hear him talk on the podcast he's like he's so almost soft-spoken he's easygoing you know it's like it's weird that he's so good but in the way he describes it when he gets inside the cage a switch gets flipped yeah and he just becomes a different person I felt like I'm all due respect to the great Tyron Woodley but he did his body looked a little different and he looked a little bit I don't know he didn't look as he didn't look the way he normally does I see they something I don't see it I didn't see it and I look for that shit his body go to I don't know about that man go to tyron woodley vs. come on see if you could get a the video of the the two of them right about the fight wait wait shaking your head so new I don't know if we can so new just happened so what it's not online yet that's it's online everything's online you don't think it's online how much one bet this is the line we cross right there I guess well we don't have to show it like peopIe can show you guys yeah show us just show us people find it go to you're gonna have to go to ESPN from now on folks all fights are on ESPN all pay-per-views ESPN plus you have to get a subscription for ESPN plus if you want to get a paper presented oh yes yeah yeah that's a good word stranges good words you I love you know like I have certain favorite fighters of course Donald Cerrone I love Nick Diaz yeah but Jorge Masvidal mr. beast I just love I love like just a true fighter like an animal and he's so good so he's so fucking good I'm so smart oh he's so smart man clever changes it up things like you can't see what he's doing it's subtle he lives for fighting to really does ah he's a fucking smart man there are men and then there's horse our hats mother just shows another least for sure he's on another level he's he's I think he's such a contender for I mean he just he is 100% alert it was less than a cowboy and it takes two years out of the Octagon I don't know what he must have an injury takes on Darren knocked out Darren till I mean knocked him the fuck out I mean he hit him with that left hand a couple times earlier in the fight - he was doing some sneaky shit he was switching stances yeah he was switching stances and throwing that left hand yeah he was throwing the right hand switching stances throwing the left hand and I think he started to read till point back like not take ten he fighting through that right and then oh when that left he'd caught him with that left hand several times caught him in the first round and then caught him in the second round he's a he's a bad motherfucker man he's coming on soon - I'm gonna have mom with Joey Diaz miles Fidel is gonna come on with Joey Diaz get a little bit may also be able to get knocked down like that my dear until who hits like it you know and come back and just regain his composure not his first punch of the fight oh it was the first punch of the fight now and smiled oh my nads all right he did the first move of the fight he charges towards till and tries to side kick him in the thigh and hits him in the dick yeah like right away first shot right to the sack yeah yeah I love that guy I love I love watching a fight well he's very crafty he's a real veteran you know I remember him knocking out Eve Edwards in BO dog fight do you member bo dog night now Botox no Calvin tires is some super millionaire playboy character who he came up with this Bo dogfight thing and it was back when you used to be able to gamble online right you were able to gamble online now you can again but you used to be able to gamble online a lot of businesses were sort of constructed around the premise that online gambling was going to be legal but through some bullshit finagling the federal government put the kibosh on online gambling they put the stop on this thriving business and a lot of these companies like there was professional pool organizations like the IPT that went under because they were counting on online gambling but Bodog was counting on it too because he had like this online gambling website well because of the the online gambling shit he's like I don't want to say this I don't want to be incorrect because Dana White was saying that he's a fugitive he wasn't even allowed in the country but that's not too far removed from the truth I don't think he's allowed back in the United States I think he has to live and like you know just for providing a service people wanted to be part of well for do for being a part of online gambling when it was illegal I think that's the issue oh no it's fucking stupid people let people do what they will I I think you should be cool if you could bet on fire iron would leave versus kymaro's daughters would get more money and everything we'll see what Tyros mom looks jacked let's see what Tywin looks like when he gets into the cage see to me he looked exactly the same let's see what happens when he takes his shirt off hurry up Tyler and he's a beast yeah I just don't think that was it man I mean you're also dealing with Tyron he's 37 now he is also in the middle of he's in a transitionary stage in terms of his career see he doesn't look quite as jacked yeah but is he's laying not long he's a beast I'm just pretty goddamn good to me yeah he always does not I just see him blood you know saying yeah like that's what I mean that's what I'm good it's pretty good hard to say great fighter man yeah he's 36 I think he's 37 now he's also he's got a rap career now he's like opening for Wiz Khalifa really yeah yeah he does a bunch of shit for TMZ now you know he's a busy man come on top of the fighting good lay that shake it out of the fight yes he has nothing approved well he's one of those guys that can do that - he's a great talker yeah he's he's he would be a great commentator if he decided to get in the commentary in percent but he wants a rematch you know I don't think he's happy with his performance and I think he thinks he could have done better I just looked like a bigger in a different weight class man well whose mom's definitely taller but I think even more importantly who's Monts gas tank it's just fucking it's well that's crazy and I feel like Tyron may have done a lot of cardio for that camp because he knew he's gonna have to deal with that so he looked he looked a little thinner well lucemon just pushes the pace and pushes that that's such a weapon some guys can do that that's such a weapon but he can do it for five rounds two men he doesn't get off the gas we're time he's pretty honest - he's funny man when he was talking about the fourth round because in the fourth round he had Tyron hurt and he poured the gas on just poured the gas on and tyrant managed to survive and when tyrant managed to survive he was thinking of some own Oh what have I done but he recovered quick yeah you know yeah yeah he does look a lot bigger though huh yeah nice and long any legs though in comparison nerve in comparison you know also skinny legs Jon challenge exactly John John Jones you look at John Jones calf have you only saw his cast so weird and someone said to you all right is that guy an elite athlete like get the fuck out of here that guy's an accountant exactly there's no way that there are a lot of guys like that we just don't judge a book by it's cover you'll go to sleep yeah but John Jones is the Mount well his upper body obviously six five yeah that's a different thing well he's got a phenomenal frame for for combat sports because he's got length but he's also has muscle I think that's the best frame I am apparently that's not real that's not real that's photoshopped down so that's real that's Photoshop trust me those are his calves no they're not that small yes they are ankles don't even fit into his shoes those are his he's got very skinny he has no guts but that last one was that's ridiculous but he said just like yeah the one up there is a perfect one we're throwing that kick right there how do you look game plan for that terrible photoshopped they cut off the back of his leg there what you talking about I don't know that's his leg no look at that that's like there's nothing so that's 100% Photoshop you can see the blur on the Photoshop why is that blurred yes from a guy that does Photoshop every single day yeah that's photoshopped you do Photoshop every single day what are you doing online I baked our logo thought I thought you doing weird shit photo makes me stronger give Brian ABS I need to get out TRT let me see yeah well we know John has skinny calves point missing oh you how do you defend against that terrible front kick to the fucking stomach every time back well he likes to throw it to the thigh too yeah the he throws that oblique kick to the thigh and the side kick to the knees you know it's interesting when I see people criticizing that kick I'm like you're crazy that they're kicking people in the face yeah you're mad that kicking them in the knee well like oh you can ruin a career I like oh you can't ruin a career by head kicking somebody yeah like Wonder Boy I was saying that about Darren till they thought Darren tail was trying to ruin his career by side kicking him in the knee and he doesn't think that technique should be legal damn okay man I mean I I get it but your head kicking people yeah his wheel kicked Jake Ellenberger in the fucking head yeah how good is that for your career not so good come on man yeah brutal sport man yeah it is it's as brutal as it gets man but it's not the worst thing for your body I think football's the work some dudes don't get hit like a mustard I was another example of that I don't think I've seen him I don't know one last time I saw him actually get cracked was he's so good at opening punch from Darren til Mighty Mouse for the best example Mighty Mouse gets hit less than anybody but there's there's other guys that they're very hard to hit y'all get hit in practice though yeah I know a lot of guys though who don't spar like that anymore yeah I think Robbie Lawler stopped doing it I think cowboy these guys Robbie stop sparring completely for years while he's fighting for Strikeforce but then when he moved to American Top Team he started sparring again and he was training really hard that's when actually he became the welterweight world he's he's he's so fucking tough like I want to see that Askren fight again because he I put my money on Robbie Lawler that he does not care about he looked better than I've ever seen him I've gone back and forth about five times I'm whether or not that was a good stoppage but lucemon convinced me after we watched the footage that was a bad stoppage yeah I think Robbie was okay I think he just relaxed he was there he had what how I don't know how many more seconds but that Bulldogs time but yeah I think he was all right but it's hard to tell it's just unfortunate and again Herb Dean is as good a referee as there is on planet Earth yeah there is no one better than him there's no one better Herb Dean is as good as it gets he made a mistake but it's hard to say if it was a mistake because I wasn't even sure it was a mistake we were not sure it better than err on the side of caution as he couldn't hear him he couldn't talk but here's the thing he's only getting choked out like if it's Ben Askren it's only he's only get choked out if it's Francis and GaN oh and he's fucking punching you in the head and you think you're unconscious then stop the fight but if it's just a choke like Ben Askren is not known for being in any way shape or form a power striker no and he's not hitting up now holding on to his neck and I think that shows have been how tough Ben Askren cuz he got his head bounced on that fuckin I was like you're getting crushed here and he's like whatever yeah I'm gonna stick to my wrestling yeah he was getting fucking pounded but he figured it out and he even though they disengaged he managed to get ahold of Robbie again and get him on the ground and get that choke on yeah look it was it was fun while it lasts but he doesn't want to fight Robbie again I think if I was the UFC I would be absolutely trying to make that fight again do you think they will I think they want to that's what Dana White said but been said why would I want to do that I already went I already won why would I want to do that oh but the thing about you know a Camaro was saying like you don't get a choice like the UFC he's gonna tell you who to fight him yet mm-hmm maybe they just offer been a good amount of money from Robbie is Robbie is you know he deserves that privilege and I think he's easily up there and he can always be the champion again we got more he looks as good he looks as good as he's ever looked yes that looked a main matter he looked amazing physically he looked amazing when he was fighting yeah even more importantly I think that's the fight that makes the most money because people want to see that I want to see it you want to see it all the real fans want to see it yeah I think I do enough of that in USA they do sometimes but what I was gonna say is like that he deserves it Jesus no one deserves it more than Steve Bay Miocic steep a losses to DC and we haven't heard hide nor hair of him he's the fucking most successful heavyweight of all time he defended title four times no one's ever been able to do that he does that and he gets nothing after that no love no respect no nothing no talk about him fighting DC again you know they're just talking about DC brock lesnar and they don't even know if brockless is really gonna fight isn't DC kind of retired know this he wants to fight Brock he's got a fight Brock and he's gonna retire he's gonna just kind of get that to me to me the most the most impressive fighter to ever step in the Octagon is Daniel Cormier you certainly won a fight but I'm just an intern see more impressive when when John Jones beat him because well so John Jones is without a doubt the most talented and best fighter to me with the tools that DC is working with when you five nine five ten and you you know you just you're dealing with guys with so much taller with so much more regional he's undefeated as a heavyweight the only man he's ever lost to was John Jones and everybody else all comers see Pam you know she just give me a number yeah and he take he's taking everyone I'm out listen almost giant fans just incredible don't get me wrong he shows you how good John Jones mr. John Jones has his number whatever the case but it's both yeah I'd like to see DC fight John Jones at heavy way me too 240 that might happen that might be the big fight the big fight might be if DC fights Brock let's assume he beats Brock which I think he would then DC fights John Jones yeah but he might not be Brock here's the thing about Brock and this is so ridiculous to say he's still a fucking giant Viking human he's so extraordinarily big he's so powerful that if he clips DC anything can happen yeah but he's got a he's gonna get punched in the face by DC and I think I personally believe that if you are not getting punched in the face and working on patterns and really working on your striking you get into the ring with a guy like Daniel Cormier who does that every day true but we don't know the rats in the jaw we don't we don't know that that's the case we also know that he has been wrestling with this Michigan State wrestler that's one of the best wrestlers on the planet Earth this video of him wrestling with this current phenom yeah and he's training with like real elite world-class fighters but you're striking yeah but Daniel Cormier got that yeah down and he's also Brock is also the WWE champ bro fine there is that she's throwing people around there is that got hit with a chair you're right I don't know man I'm putting all my money on DC I would say that DC would be heavily favored yeah I would also say that that big gorilla can fucking punch any person on the planet with those lunch box fists and he fucked he's so big man when you stand next to Brock you just like oh you're a totally he's been flying silverback yeah he's this close to a silverback as I've ever seen as a Viking yeah you know so long arms giant human yeah ridiculous fists the real question is I mean how much has he really been working on his striking in in these years that he's been outside of the cage how much is he much easier to work on your wrestling if you're him ground striking is a whole different animal well particularly sparring not just like hitting mitts and hitting the pad but getting getting good rounds and against people that can crack and people that can crack like DC where he clinches you and then hits you in the clinch and also learning how to adjust like the great fighters that I noticed our guys who they come in with a game plan that game plan gets shut down and then they change it up right then they do subtle things they just start doing little differences and you go oh you're you're doing it you're doing a whole different thing here yeah and that guy can't see it or a lot of people can't see and that's what I think it's amazing then there's the other thing he's got to get off the sauce he got he got off the sauce so if he gets off the sauce now he's 40 and he's been on Mexican supplements for the last few years for sure yeah and your whole endocrine system is just like good luck yeah yeah I mean yes who knows who knows I'm gonna I'm gonna have to get myself on some I'm looking forward to getting off TRT I don't feel like I need it yet right now really should been a long time ago you think so a hard percent but telling you forever I know I know I want to I wanna keep squeezing every little ounce of natural juice well it's real I mean you you can do it without it but you won't be as healthy you won't be as strong you won't have as much energy the real last you got some energy the best thing would be if they could figure out a way to revitalize your body's natural production of testosterone that's that's similar to the way it is when you're a 30 year old man they could really do that right now that camp you know right now they'll you can only add it you can you can get your but there's a lot of other stuff going on like if you listen to that the podcast that I did with what's the doctor's name anti agent doctor Oh David David Sinclair yeah there's a lot of factors you know there's a lot of different things you can do nmn resveratrol all these different things that's I want those things I want mmm and and what does nmn it's telomere elongate er yes lengthens your telomeres which was telling me the best sign of telomeres let's keep google the actual definition of telomeres but it's the best sign of whether or not your body's aging correct where do I get good rezerve it oral resveratrol is very strong I'll get online all right yeah you get that that little container out there you could take that if you want i got shitloads oh yeah yeah yeah when he told me about I started taking it every day I take it every day with my morning vitamins mm-hmm a lot of meat you have he says no right he also says to take I listen to him when it's convenient to me miRs also called terminal telomere terminal transferase is an enzyme made of protein and RNA subunits that are long gates chromosomes by adding ttaggg Oh triple G sequences to the end of existing chromosomes tell them telomerase is found in fetal tissues adult germ cells and also tumor cells the result of aging cells in an aging body so it just slows down aging I'll tell you what man that nmn stuff makes me feel great it does 100% yeah gives me a lot of energy really yeah how about getting Oh Bryce um I'll get you some yeah yeah unless you want me to die faster no I love you all right get me some fucking let's go TRT for eggnog get on tea or tea - I got on it ten years ago and I was telling you - you should be honest like yeah good I'm good I know I'm still nervous about it but I'm gonna do some tests nervous about I want to get thick boys wanna go like that I want to go Eddie and jump off a building and glide fucking around kid you got a nice body let's go ahead and lose that shirt let's get you around the corner over here scared yeah I wish there was a way to do it naturally and I think there's going to be I think they're gonna be able to do it through some sort of gene manipulation their little turn on your butt there there's so close to doing this to mice where they're literally reversing the age of a mouse and Sinclair was talking about this movie and I've had some conversations with some other people that are really deeply entrenched in the world of genetic engineering and and crisper and all the the new innovations there they're going to be able to do that it's a matter of when I think when we're 80 it's there's a high probability the by the time you and I are 80 you're gonna be able to be 20 again come on I'm not bullshit come on no I think that's real dude I want I want there's that gene that people can get just five hours of sleep that wakefulness thing it's in 3% of the population it's called adderall yeah well there's that - is that - but there's one gene that is yeah that where you can and then why we sleep he was talking about it but also my friend has that gene this genome and they died you have that gene frank grillo cuz you have that gene because I know he doesn't sleep at all I'm always like how do you sleep five hours because I just wake up and he's fully awake and he works out for fucking two hours and and I've only met one of the dude like that and that's a gene that's vanishingly rare and some people that can can get 5 to 6 hours of sleep five hours and achieve total wakefulness they're gonna be able to do that yeah they're gonna be able to manipulate your eyesight with germs they're going to be able to inject you with a germ that repairs your eyesight what's going on with this bitch can't wait UC San Francisco neurology professor yin hue foo PhD discovered the mutation of the gene Dec 2 in a family of natural short sleepers people who go to bed normal time 11 p.m. midnight but usually wake up naturally at 5:00 a.m. I wonder if jackal has that shit problems or not I think he just gets up with pure hate that now he probably has that gene I don't believe it cells draw open what discipline only so I wish he was right next to you change your tune and start sucking his dick Jacques kind of tough it's terrifying Blackburn forty pound serial killer who is he that thick I don't know he's that big oh my god oh Jesus chuckles a tank oh I didn't know that dude he's an inch taller than me anyways 240p come on you don't know what Jocko a fucking white Samoan dude Jocko taps Dean Lister in training what yes you don't understand what you're talking about he's a freezie gorilla yeah yeah he said there's that picture him with his shirt off some men are just men's I don't think that's him now click on it I'd see it fine no saw him yeah he's a gorilla dude that's stupid it's getting into bowhunting you should too yeah he's a killer don't wanna be sworn worries yeah pheasant hunting with my boy Tariq and his brother fun right blast flushing peasant huh to cook the fuzz yeah that's what I mean nap all right oh and Sonoma awesome guy next time we come out we'll go okay my boy Tariq has got it locked down we eat we shoot pheasant and you eat the best pheasant and drink the best wine there's nothing better and smoke cigars and hang out tell me a better time tell me about shakes buddy buddy Jake city corners chick yeah tark Tarkas he teaches me boxing like he's got this incredible gym called empower I go there San Francisco I go to San Francisco just collects hangings it is this you guys that would be me running Oh getting cardio did you have a dog to Festival sure did German Shorthair and my buddy Tariq Aziz and shout-out you why are you running with a gun no dude because I get my cardio a loaded gun don't look at mustache that does William you look like you have a mustache right now are you growing one no I just got to thinkin a show there bro seems like you're dancing with it dude I just I grow hard I grow hard if I could if I take a poo and I push hard I grow a mustache hmm interesting yeah do try yeah just happens I like being manly I like shooting pheasant okay and by the way did you flush them and then they fly up in there about six feet in front of you and we're still missing still five quarters it's so annoying I went pheasant hunting once with Bourdain oh you did yeah I shot one in the feather I saw its feather a blue a piece of its feather off and flew away laughed at / took a shit in my general direction it's a only cut off one shot but public land hunting is hard you know most of the hunting that I do is on private land it's publicly on hunting a lot of pressure a lot of people out there doing it yeah you know well animals get smart well they get sits and there's the argument there's two arguments and I support both of them one argument is that public land hunting is harder and you should really be more proud of success on public land because it's for everybody it's not a leadest thing it's very difficult to do you got to really put in the work yeah not a discipline I get that argument but my the problem that I have with it is first of all I don't have a lot of time and I like success but to the animals when they're pressured they don't act normal they they don't call as much like elk elk in particular if it in a high-pressure area its problem with wolves when wolves move into areas the elk just shut down all the calling one of the coolest things about elk hunting is they fucking scream one the first time I ever won elk hunting with campaigns we took me out hunting I remember this morning we're out there in this base and you hear just you hear I'm screaming it's yeah it's still dark out we're walking them like this is the fucking coolest thing I life just hearing them scream and yelling at each other and trying to fight off the other males and you hear their their horns clashing against each other because their antlers are there they're fighting and this is on public land there is this was on private land yeah yeah cuz I for me a lot of that hunting and we need to do it again by the way yeah I don't it's not so much about killing the animal it's the camaraderie yes like like so I'm on this they stock this field with these pheasant I'm not there to kill the fence I love the meats and stuff and but but it's more the experience with my two friends and we're out there with a dog I like to say that too but I like to kill elk other to eat that I like the food like I live off ELCA you checked my DNA it's 65% elk I need to know I'm not bullshitting I eat so much of it I feel fucking great I bet I mean I think there's something to it I do too it's like I need a lot of me to die meaning this dark-red pro that's good it's coming from his fuckin the most that are dodging mountain lions it's good for you yeah you take the life force of the animal into your mana there's something about that I swear to God and even the pheasant like you know it's it's there's just something there's something about looking for an animal that focuses your mind and even in something as lame as when they're roosting on a field you got the dog and the dog points you know anyone fishing I had said what's that you like fishing I don't I'm not a good Fisher look I'm sure if I learned how to fish but fishing is technique which I didn't know I grew up fishing oh you did yeah I was real I was in the bass angler sportsman society when I was like 13 years old we're competitive weren't you no I mean I just like to fish yeah I mean competitive my friends you always want to catch the biggest fish but there's something about fishing man there's something about casting a line and the best to me is like a top water bait like you cast a plug and you see it land on the water pauses the ripples sort of spread out and then you give it a twitch give it another twitch and let it pause again and then a big explosion of water fuck oh shit dude my little daughter my youngest is 100% hooked on fishing she caught a six pound bass in Florida it Geeks me out to no end because she's my little fishing buddy like we're we were in Maui and when we were Maui we went we went hunting for hunting we went and caught a yellowtail and she caught out gang a yellowtail and this little tiny girl like a 10-pound yellowtail is a motherfucker to try to reel in oh yeah they're so hard to reel in and she was reeling them in on her own man I mean all I had to do is hold the rod because it literally would have yanked the rod out of her hands I'm trying to show you a picture that's amazing I got a picture in here someone take my daughter fish dude it's fun man and then you know with with the bass we'd let them go okay here's a six pound bass perfect with with the bass we let him go as a catch and release deal but the yellow we ate that that night so the whole family needs something that she could add that's good she loved that's huge was so excited by it she got so she just she beams with pride this little tiny girl yeah you know and she's holding on to this right she would not let me reel it in she's like do you want me to I go do you want me to reel an insert no she had two hands on it going cranking and I'm holding on to it and she made sure she pulled it into the boat to like she's obsessed mmm it's awesome I love once I think once you've felt what it's like to catch a fish and then cook it and eat it once and by the way if you never had really fresh fish it's like really fresh fish is so flavorful and delicious and just a little bit of butter and lemon on it and a little bit of seasoning you know I've done that plenty of times I've gone on organized fishing you know and deep-sea fishing you know we should do we should organize a gig in Alaska in July during the salmon runs a great idea would do a gig up there and Anchorage will catch some salmon for a few days do a gig to pay for the whole trip yeah just have a good time ari and I did that offense I would love to do that did Ari and I did that we caught some giant salmon let's do that we caught some king salmon they're like 30 pounds amazing Wow eight salmon for fucking months Jesus yeah I love that so fun I'd love to do that but you know what's fucked DOS it's crazy the world never seen anything like it it's looking assault yeah it's like a gang violence I saw it in Indonesia when I when I when I was tracking or Angleton's in the rainforest I was 21 or whatever and I thought I wanted to be a naturalist Yeah right I'd love that story about the ants oh dude fuck forget the ants you had to carry a sulfur coil because bug repellent didn't work on those mosquitoes you had to carry around the sulfur coil look at that that's re in the sand look at our I had to clean afterwards fuckin salmon great Jewish house doors has a big-ass salmon yeah is there any more pictures of our fish one picture there's one other thing but I didn't check that that's a big-ass fish though look at Ari handsome bastard yeah it's fun man I love fishing I really wish there was a place close to my house where I could fish it's very peaceful mmm you know like fish for your breakfast catch a trout yeah and then you know cook that motherfucker in a pan right there on the shore Oh incredible so you know they have a lot of and people like just in Napa Valley a shitload of mountain lion yeah hunt them no no they're everywhere though apparently too many of them yeah but there's a real dumb thing because they do hunt them but they hunt them with professional hunters that the state has to hire because they get depredation permits because things start killing livestock or dogs or well I grabbed a llama when I'm grabbed a llama and jumped over the fence with the llama in its mouth yeah I mean that's fucking nuts yeah you can't do that crazy a train but even if you train you put on your back let's see let's say if you put a llama in a backpack say you got like a fucking Cafaro back yeah good luck stuff the llama in there you had the whole lot it in had it okay go over that fence well my buddy who's a guide in Alaska my buddy Chad he said that they were climbing up this mountain it was a fucking nightmare like they like just slogging up this steep mountain just like and they were like looking up and they're like goddamn this is a nightmare you know you're making like inches yeah just like oh oh and you got a backpack and it just I wanted this exam you over and don't try not to think about it dang let's take a break you know yeah and they just hear this and they just see this grizzly with an elk in its mouth and it just bounds up the mountain it just goes shaggin shaggin right by them with a with it with its berg and just goes up over the mountain and over the ridge just no problem in 12 seconds and they were like well that's a grizzly that's just wrong a fucking good face and this is me Jesus Christ I don't wanna I'm so terrified of I'm terrified I don't want to fuck get fucked up by a chimpanzee Shem bones II will eat my face in my balls so I don't want that and I definitely don't want to get attacked by a grizzly because they'll start eating you when you're still alive yeah and that's a problem most of the time I Grizzlies eat people though or most time with Grizzlies kill people they're not killing someone because they want to eat them they're killing someone because you startled them and they're with their female the females with their cubs oh that's so mostly so what happens when what are you supposed to do when a grizzly just pray well if it's a female grizzly you are literally better off letting her fuck you up right it just curl up in a ball you're supposed to put your hand behind your neck lay in a fetal position and don't let her get access to your organs because she wants to chew your organs apart Jesus yeah it's one of the reasons why it's really important to have a strong backpack you have a strong backpack she'll fuck up that backpack well you're on on your you know on your knees curled up in a fetal position but that's assuming you can survive that she's probably gonna break your arm she's probably gonna snap your legs bite into you in ways that you can't imagine the kind of force and power she can generate I mean she's trying to immobilize you she wants immobilize you as a threat to her children but a male if a male's trying to kill you it's usually because he's starving to death they don't recognize people as a food source so they rarely people so that male he probably is never eaten a person it's one of the reasons why it's safer to be in a place where they hunt Grizzlies because in a place where they hunt Grizzlies grizzly she's a person who goes fuck this they'll smell you and get the fuck out of there right but like Yellowstone they haven't hunt Grizzlies there and forever so people still get jacked they're still they get jacked there every couple of years I would it's killer gun you should but you might not be able to get to it and you also have to be able to prepare to pull it out and shoot quickly you can't think that just because you have a gun you're gonna be okay now cuz you don't hear them coming up on you come up so fast they move so fast they run they run fast as a dog okay there Hugh is that true yes they run fast as fuck man and they're huge it's a giant animal it's not 800 pounds think about that sure war just stumbled across a story about this just happening for the bear spray didn't work yeah and it was attacking the guide and the client went to grab the Glock out of the pack and it didn't fire and then the bear came after him so he tried to throw the gun to the other guy and then it didn't that guy just ran it I guess I shall follow this okay who died it doesn't I don't I didn't find now I'm an assault I'm the best story is Rinella story Rinella and Remy Warren and Jana sweet Alice and our friends they they got attacked while they were in a fog neck island in Alaska Jesus yeah some things yes like two years ago and Remy came on here and told the story and it's fucking terror well they killed an elk and they had hung it in a tree and they had taken some of the meat back because you know you have to hike out a fog nack is particularly dense it's very very dense vegetable like remember when we were on Prince of Wales on dance dance yeah well it's like that but even worse and Grizzlies everywhere yes Grizzlies everywhere was a huge problem that when we were on that island that Island had black bears yeah which weirdly enough they're not as dangerous but they are more predatory to its people I want a giant spiked helmet and spiked collar and I want my guns lot of clothes and I want Kevlar clothes I want an Ironman suit that's right I want to be able to correct rockets out of my hand that's right and I want to be able to Electrify it when the one thing bites yes kill it and then immediately cut its head off and put on a stake so all the other grizzly bears know not to fuck that's exactly right right okay there you go man yeah we definitely need to go on a hunt again I know dude it's so much fun yeah even if if it's a rifle hunt I'll go on arrival on you you just love bow hunting huh I love you bought me a bow I need I'm gonna bring it to tells you you shoot it shot I wanted to hear what you both three years ago I know a new one no boy comes out with new models every year I like that one I haven't never shot it's great bow so let me let me get used to that one I'll become expert well what I would like you to do honestly what I'd like to do and we should organize this with John Oh John Dudley because we have access to the literally the best archery coach on the planet Earth in John Dudley he's the best Wow I'm so good we need first of all he's a world he was a world-class competitive Archer oh he competed on the world stage he traveled all throughout the planet but so what is his like what are the principles he teaches first of all it's just like martial arts if you have a bad coach you'll develop bad tech and it's gonna be very difficult for you to learn you could still Excel some people still Excel with bad coaching you know there's people that have just a natural ability to fight right and you teach them just a few things they know how to like put knuckles to your face some people just better at that yeah and they just they have a good mentality for it but they would be way better if they were with ferocity they would be way better if they're with Duke Rufus there's just no doubt about it great coaching is imperative for achieving your full potential that's the same thing with archery with archery a guy like John Dudley will put the fundamentals in the perfect position for you and he changed my archery so much that like I'd been doing archery for more than a year so before I met him maybe a year and a half my whole my ability jumped up 20 to 30 percent within the first couple hours of meeting it Wow yeah what 100% Jesus got video of me and him in my backyard and I'm laying these nocturnal arrow knocks they lit knocks so they fly through the air it looks like laser beams and I'm laying them into my elk target at like 65 yards thunk thunk-thunk all of them going into the vitals a boxing is like that like oh I had Donald Cerrone one time just sit there and explain to me like where to place my feet and what I was doing wrong and why more weight should be on my back foot but just little things like that or my buddy Tariq all I'm weighing mcculloch of course but but my boy Tariq like he'll teach me stuff that comes from that MMA background but just where where you're looking like how to judge distance and there are certain techniques to do it or just wear your back foot should be in relation that person's foot regard you know just how to set things up yeah and they can some people can simplify it and teach you those basic principles where you're like damn yeah damn it makes such a huge difference a huge difference for you know yeah I mean there's ways to do things correctly and people have spent their entire life learning these things and we're learning how to teach these things to which is critical you know there's look like we both came from a Taekwondo background and I got very very very fortunate in the the school that I found that I stumbled into J Kim Tae Kwon no one's doing Boston was one of the best gyms on earth yeah I just got super lucky so I learned from the time I was a young kid I learned the right way to do things and the emphasis was always on technique it didn't matter how fast you were if you were doing it wrong you were corrected the Russians are like that like there's this tennis woman in in Moscow who's responsible for the tennis revolution Sharapova and all those people and she is a coach she's like 77 she's got like two courts and the kids when they get there I don't think they're allowed to really hit a ball for the first six months I mean there's sweat your swing and your your positioning is she in grains those fundamentals so that you can't do it wrong so before you start playing tennis you are in graining neural pathways and patterns that are perfectly correct so that when the shit hits the fan you get emotional you don't know how to do it wrong yeah you don't know how right right like I think Virgil hunter and those guys do the same thing when they train you know like when you were ill I'm sorry I'm sorry for no but but Hunter who is a who's a Andre Awards original coach Virgil oh is that right now I think it's personal Hunter look that out but but but what they'll do is the Virgil Hill was the light heavyweight champion that Roy Jones jr. knocked out with a body shot burnable interest I think his I'll be talking to Andre Ward on the Instagram - lets get him such a mass get him in here he's not just a master it's a brilliant analyst - he's amazing but he was trained where the discipline of fundamentals and perfecting your tech or hunter yeah hunter Verdi can you listen to Virgil hunter I've listened to had the way he speaks and I just I obsess over that like I loved watching the old-school guys this is got coach Anthony who I watched his videos on YouTube I think he's in Kansas City by the way I'd love to get in there and train with him but he's he's a guy who like breaks shit down in those little details and you just realize what a science boxing is and you realize like it was at that awesome Alice thing you did way goes his boxer like you're making mistakes but then there are mortal like you're making sins but you're making mortal sins like getting hit with shots you don't see he can teach you how to avoid that yeah and that's a little detail that's and everything in life is that way it's like you want to be really good at something get great coaching and it's those small adjustments that make all the difference like the bid there was the number one the hundred tennis player in the world and the number two tennis player in the world is that much but it's all the difference in the world yeah learning how to do things correctly in every single discipline is the most important thing yeah learning how to do it correctly yeah and then from there all your creativity and all your ability to improvise all comes from these perfect fundamentals that's right did you watch our old Spence jr. Mike and Garcia I did not I want to see Earl Spencer he just looks so much better than Mikey I see a lot bigger yeah lot bigger I want to see her all Spence and mr. Crawford go at it woo me too that's gonna that's gonna be a big fight I just felt like Mikey or SEO I love I'm gonna watch it but he just looked so much smaller and ro Spence it's too hard he won't look bigger he won't look that much bigger than Terrance Terrance Crawford is about he's big he's a guy who changes things up man always thinking and he'll come out and fight the first five rounds of the southpaw and you think you gotta figure it out and then we'll switch stances and fuck you up so weird yeah that that kind of genius that kind of high fight IQ is crazy what's also that ambidextrous ability is so critical and that was Marvin Hagler Marvin Hagler used to switch back and forth and no one you couldn't do jack shit about it he would fight you as a southpaw just as good as you'd fight you Orthodox you didn't know what the fuck was coming next there was that Duran could do that there was that fighter he said I can't he's reading my mind my mind is what he goes he knows what I'm gonna do before I do it well well Duran understood those patterns so well he could he could just he just cut you off yeah he just be like I know what you're gonna do I can see already what you're setting up before you do it yeah that's like jiu-jitsu you're a roll with someone who's really good then I watch tenor I watched wrestling way before you're gonna do it I watched Henry Gracie take Brendan Schaub lyoto machida I mean all these guys these killers I was like I would he was starting on his back and there on top of him and he wouldn't choke them out uh I was like what yeah he lets them take his back but but again he's so far ahead of them he knows what you're gonna do so he done cut you off it's like every time hurtin I try to move around with way McCall like he'll just he just no matter what I'm doing I'm doing the Winky right thing I'm keeping my hands here I'm like there's no and he just finds your face yeah he's touching you and it's like everything right along that things get you get better at everything I mean like you know that feeling that you get when you watch someone who's only been doing stand-up like a year as you see them going on in front of a crowd and you see they're choking up and panicking and maybe rushing a joke or being awkward I have to run away yeah weird but then ladies and gentlemen here's your next comic Bryan Callen yeah just go up and just loose and relax you've seen it all before what I do but this is what I like what I like is that there are all these things that you can do like that where you just get better if you keep doing it you learn more I think learning things and there's an article learning yeah there's an art to learning but I think it's so critical to enjoying life I think that's one of the like learning stuff and doing difficult things we can see incremental improvement that's that's based on your effort in your concentration I think these are really important for happiness a hundred percent I think about all of our friends are really happy that we're all pursuing things also I know where to place my energy and I see myself getting better but more importantly I can not only do I see myself getting better but I come to understandings when I'm writing stand-up now when I'm thinking of what am i next my next one hours gonna be I I start kind of like getting to what I think about in essence like where am i right now I've kind of arrived at a place I set these goals for myself and now what now what now I got a standstill maybe what the fuck does that look like yeah well I'm gonna write about that I'm gonna write about not not my life has been either a fight or I'm not I'm ready to run away right just joke about not wearing moccasins and I had this therapist wore moccasins as I got on trust in many ways moccasin are something really good for stalking yeah you're either I was gonna say the only time I mock moccasin is macho's if you're sneaking up on a castle guard to take him out with a knife or you're hunting deer that's the only time otherwise you're a cult leader and you're selling your collar have you know how many pairs mom's yeah well I don't trust you unless you got a bone your head you come out with moccasins and you're smiling you're trying to spot a new pair okay yeah all right well good just for stalking I like just so you don't break any twigs in here well when I was in when I was in Indonesia and my Dayak guides the indigenous people of Indonesia didn't break a twig under their feet bare feet sir bare feet Oh bear if you're great in the in the rain forest if I know we're about cooties I'd hunt with bare feet you got you got leeches you got spiders they didn't give I he ain't I'm worried about snakes and girls us of us well you should be yeah especially warm months the last scene when here's fuck man I've never been bitten but I've had my dogs bent in three times with Frank yeah Frank got bitten three fucking times yeah Frank and Lucy they both got bitten you have to get him it'll bring him to the fucking doctor one time I brought him to the doctor doctor looked at him says well I don't see any swelling the my it might not have gotten him because he killed the snake I was like I don't see that he's such a psycho he's not smart yeah I just would charge in and just snap at things yeah like the idea that this thing didn't bite him he goes well you know if he's feeling bad take him back in again I bring him home an hour later his face has got it growing up basketball off the side of it so having my dog just fucking bring him back in but it was expensive two months which is a real bummer because it's thousands and thousands of dollars for this anti-venom and if you're a poor person and they want that money right now I know man yeah I have I have pet insurance my dog got hit by a car $14,000 sir thank God for pet insurance well I paid like nothing it was it was incredible mm-hmm so pet insurance is a necessary thing my dog got bit by a rattlesnake didn't see the rattlesnake but I heard my dog like that and I what the fuck and we're walking back I'm I've never seen it like it we're walking back my dog's tongue is out and my dog starts weaving and then just kind of falls over oh Jesus I picked the dog up I bring that dog to the vet I thought maybe he got stung by a wasp or something I didn't know then I was like this is she I was like I think she got bit by a rattlesnake and she was so swollen her head was so it left by the time I got there her head was like literally looked like a giant balloon yeah I said I think my dog got bit by a snake do you know what's really cool they ever gave her of anti-venom when I think about it you know what's really crazy is the venom is actually digesting tissue yeah that's what's fucked up like that what that venom is for give they bite a snake like a snake bites around a bit or some shit like that it's actually digesting the rabbit so they don't have like a stomach like we have there their whole body's just like one just rot track the things just rot inside of it they absorb it don't get to it yeah dirty monsters do you ever see that video that I posted that I got from one of those guys that I follow on Instagram but they were in the desert and this big fucking huge fat rattlesnake had a rabbit and was dragging the rabbit away no this lifeless rabbit is being dragged away by this thing that's as thick as my forearm oh my god see that yeah see we can find it good luck finding it probably four years ago three years ago four years ago is it found it watch this so this thing look at this it's got the rabbit Wow yeah and they close in on it and it just drags it away Wow it's creepy this is a different video I've had the one that I had it was a bigger snake and it pulls it away way quicker but it's just it's just a gross little animal but then again you need those gross land you know animals like that's the same like the argument that people say you don't want coyotes in your neighborhood well okay I kind of see what you're saying but the problem is you don't want rats in your neighborhood either stupid yeah and coyote is gonna kill the rats but they do right over this what is this one the mama rabbit comes and fucks up the snake oh that's right yeah that's right yeah yeah the mom rabbit recognizes some shit is going down fucks up that snake get off my baby yeah look at that yeah rabbits are fucking fierce man they're rodents man yeah I ain't rats a video where a kid stopped a cat I think it was a kebab cat a small Bobcat like in a village was getting attacked by some snakes and was protecting its babies and the mom just left the babies to die or whatever cuz she knew that she couldn't fight it the kid just grabbed the snake by the head and walked it away and threw it like in the bush came back and grabbed the babies and gave him back to the mom it was a crazy video blow like eight-year-old kid maybe younger Kratt he was wild grabbed a snake grabbed the snake it was a 8 7 6 5 8 foot snake 60 foot crazy some kids grow up hard dude no I was a kid I would grab snakes if I saw snake I'm going for it yeah obsessed you look alive I know I'd grab whatever but I didn't live in a place where there were poison snakes well when I lied when I lived in Florida I was always worried about running into an alligator we'd run into alligators and snapping turtles a lot of snapping turtles some snakes there are some snakes who we'd run into do the problem with Florida yeah once in a while there's a crowd an American crocodile mm-hmm or they even say in the Everglades they got a couple miles out there oh yeah they do a couple the old Nile Crocs yeah assholes who got them as in the seventies and they just let them loose and now they have a viable population as it sounds what we doing it's almost fake because they have cameras everywhere fake I think that's what he does it regardless of the fact if it's a pet Python I would have done that in a heartbeat as a kid so he's pulling on it he's got a Python oh they set this up bro that's right I mean as I was pulling back up and seen all the cuts I think okay it might not be real this is not real this is a setup look that kids been grabbing snake no life yeah he grabbed that thing expertly I'd make that thing a cock holster let's go did a cock holster cock rings just a bunch of cock rings or a cow holster motherfuck into a belt huh yeah it's like growing up like that around snakes and all kinds of evil fucking shit like that have you been in South Africa no Cape Town I'm scared okay Taz most beautiful place I've ever been in my life I saw wild that's a lot but thanks for playing it is know it might be the most beautiful place I've ever seen just like way it looks oh fuck it's incredible it's so beautiful bring up Cape Town it's ridiculous ridiculous it's ridiculous when I saw I saw what isn't for me it's ridiculous it's not that no it's just it's so PFF looking nah nah you don't sound like Australia better no you have no idea wait what about Maui it's better no that's not true I'm telling I've been I've been all over Cape Town's is it got my name I'm sure it's awesome in terms of breathtaking really yeah and food mmm any interest in going to Africa and going hunting well I've been Africa now four times yeah it's a long flight mmm what would we be hunting antelope shit like that kudu I love Kudo I've healed guys it's delicious but at the end of the day I feel you get the same you know why I feel like you'd get the same because that can I tell you what that would be you'd go to a game reserve which is probably a cattle an abandoned cattle range yes and they stocked the area with those animals yes so in a way I think you could get the same exact feeling in in Texas yeah Texas right good Texas I'm not kidding and in Texas you could go get tex-mex correct sir get some great food in Africa is the old malaria that's there a lot of those issues Yeah right so so the the trip by the time you get there you're older it's just too fucking horrible 16 hours in 16 hours but then you gotta take a fucking bus and the whole the whole thing and something goes wrong every time what do you got Jane that photo I just flashed up at Cape Town just made me think I saw yesterday that I know I know if you saw it's a so they can create a picture like this oh yeah I did see that if you draw like a little sketch yeah they could turn that into like instantly turn that into a photorealistic picture I mean you haven't seen that no yes it's fucking bananas so look at that sketch on the right so through the software rendering they could do something like that on the left and then they make it on the right but make it with a lake and a mountain like watch this BAM yeah yes yeah so this is within seconds they can create this and what is this software called Jamie I don't know the software it's it from what I saw is made by Nvidia which is the back video card maker and right and all sorts of other things they'll never be able to replace comics no no I don't think they're gonna be able to figure out personality but I think what they can't they'll never figure out Joey Diaz right I think what they can do is make artificial reality they're going to be able to make artificial reality it's like how long will it take for that artificial reality correct I don't think you can quantify creativity but don't think I don't might be wrong though I agree because part of what creativity is is is surprised and almost destruction like when you hear somebody say something you've never heard before or a different take that kind of destroys the old way of thinking it's kind of what a lot of creativity as innovation is a form of destruction yes and and so destroying ideas yeah but like like when when you see a great piece of art like like there's a majesty to it yeah it's an awe you're awestruck like the Vatican the inside of the Sistine Chapel perfect example I mean you're you're on that a human being did that for the sake of beauty in itself like all those lives of hundreds of years well yeah generations of artists right they'd work on the same tapestry or something for like three that is an act of faith and you're doing it for its own sake you're not even doing it because you're making money it's like you you are doing it because you can and because you want to see what you're capable of like creating beauty for its own sake is yeah but its original its it it changes in many ways your perspective like you kind of go you you so-so Nietzsche and Schopenhauer talked about the idea that there's the will right so as a human being you're stuck in this fucking I gotta eat I got a fuck I gotta sleep and I got a breed and I eat and I sleep and I fucked so I can breed you know and I can stay alive and then might you know further my gene pool and you're stuck in this kind of like will to live there's the but there is a respite now that rest by this is when you when you see a great work of art or you're doing great works of art and somehow when you see something beautiful when you're laughing really hard a great standard when you're seeing I'm an amazing movie like American Beauty the state it puts you in is so incredible because it gets you to forget momentarily about your own biology about your own urges your own needs your own wants for whatever reason you you rest in this state of majesty this sort of high relief this your higher self or you go you go man that might be what God's about that might be what it's like to be touching something bigger than myself or bigger than all this other appetite stuff like I it's almost like it's almost like something you you forget that you forget about death and you forget about your fears and everything else you know those feelings of inspiration that can happen when you're listening to great music or it can happen when you're making great music but that is almost the only time you have I guess and of course we can talk about flow and you're climbing a mountain with no ropes or whatever it might be I think that puts you in those states of true focus and true flow and that's what we stay alive for we stay alive for that and when you are not that you know everything else becomes drudgery almost because everything becomes and I would even I would even equate like we stay alive also not just for accomplishments but like when you're with your friends like we're doing a fight companion and we're laughing and being silly geese for no other reason there's a flow to that oh yeah there's there's a you you are you are removed for temporarily from the world from from from the reality of your own limitations and there there's something that's so beautiful about that I think needs you talked about the idea that you can you can actually make your life that Dec your life should be a work of art live dangerously and leave a good-looking corpse don't don't worry about all the other things just just it's worth living a bleeped she was a mess they're all that's part of the problem of listening to him every fuck yeah philosopher I've done my own Studies on that every philosopher didn't get laid and they lived alone and somebody's lived with their mothers and they were all a disaster but they thought deeply they have these concepts they have concepts and oftentimes they're not really putting these concepts to practice in their own life which is very strange that's right yeah that's very true yeah those moments that we have when we're doing the fight companion where we're just fucking howling and laughing that's that's why and and those you can't recreate that you know one of the things that's interesting about fight companion is a bunch of people have tried to recreate it they've done their own and they always abandon it just give up testers weren't really friends we're really friends and we really go hard getting fucked up I mean how many shows are there where people are just getting drunk and saying ridiculous shit live I'm in front of millions of people now and then we'll have a show where there's a you you know UFC that may get a hundred thousand pay-per-view bars and we get five million views is that I mean how many we get between the the in between YouTube and iTunes the next time I take my shirt I gotta be I gotta be a little more jacked well least you don't surprise us anymore that's true but job likes people I try to come like they're like well you know fighter new kid I want to start my own podcast well I don't we're friends there were really friends that's why it works I can't I just make it like the Monkees I'm just fuckin organize a fake band no fucking way we're just were just friends no matter right and Eddie is legitimately crazy too and he's also legitimately a jujitsu genius you know he's fuckin and he really does think the earth is flat like him and I have conversations but I'm like Eddie stop stop once you go flat you never go back what does that mean what does that be he's so great I don't understand that thinking but that's part of the reason why he's fun you know I was saying I was talking about him the other day and I was there like he bugs me about I go he's a genuinely good person oh he's awesome he said Jenny love that guy I love he's been one of my best friends for 20 fucking yes that's why because he's a good person yeah he's a great guy he's a great person and he's like he's brilliant when it comes to jujitsu I mean really brilliant but like his unique way of thinking is creativity is what allowed him to formulate that system that system of jujitsu was a lot of very unorthodox entries and and submissions it's very very very very clever with his jujitsu very clever it's so important but that you know you wonder sometimes his brain that kind of brain mhm can have it cuts all the way across it can have liabilities your strengths are the same as your liabilities well he'll have that super obsessed with computer conspiracies like legitimately super obsessed but I wasn't always it's a form of identity though it's also gives you a tribe and it gives you people all of us have that yeah well he does that tinfoil hat podcast to sam tripoli and then they do conspiracy stand-up comedy where they go to performant clubs together but it's really selling well I mean they're doing it right it's great for Sam - yeah that's good to see Sam's a great guy yeah it's like I was saying earlier world we're insanely fortunate in our circle friends and insanely fortunate and the camaraderie that we all have they'll protect each other and look out for each other and support each other and you know I noticed the two they come I feel so lucky that I get to do stand-up because the challenge never goes away yeah and then I I see a lot of actors like Sean Penn like Johnny Depp like the guys I really looked at Mickey Rourke and something happens to them along the way Brad Pitt not so much you know but the real actors that I really kind of thought were something goes on like I'd rather they had had a real struggle that he married a crazy lady yeah yeah I don't know married a chick who's ridiculously hot but craziest fuck yeah I think they might get I don't know acting doesn't when you when you've done a movie when you're on set you're shooting a page a day and that mundane repetitive process you're in costume you're saying the same fucking lines doing the same scenes over and over again I'm sorry man you're there 16-hour days and I don't think that's as satisfying no matter who you are it becomes a very peculiar skill that it's not like doing a play here it's different your standup is stand-up though you're writing and you have to perform and it's always changing did I agree but I also think that you and I were supposed to do stand-up like a guy who makes clocks that's his passion a guy who fixes cars like there's certain people like my friend Steve strop who built my Corvette and you know he builds a bunch of muscle cars and shit that loves cars yeah he loves the construction of them and the design of them he loves putting them together and now Daniel day-lewis and Christian are supposed to be actors yeah there's people that are supposed to do that they're really good but then there's other folks that get into it and they become disillusioned along the way because the process is so weird and also it's so fake that's what always drove me crazy like being around all these people that are like not really there talking to you that not really being vulnerable they're not really being present there was a little act but also the trap is having a persona yeah like I think like Johnny Depp got caught up in that persona became a pirate yeah scarves in real life you can't be that vane you have to have friends like me and you if I showed up yeah if I showed up with a lace hanky hanging out of my pocket and came all the way down on my knee you tackled me Otis like Jimmy Burke when I showed up after MADtv I showed up in New York and I'd start wearing Kangol hats backwards they look good on me and I was hot I said I'm gonna be a good look cuz I saw some actor do it and I and I go there and Jimmy burrows dude I'm so fucking proud I'm at the bar with all the guys I'm so proud of you robes can go out smoke a doob celebrate raise a glass take the hat off right now I'm gonna slap the shit okay what about fedoras so what's wrong my hanakos it's too busy it's busy but a fedora that's a bet that's the best know what's the ultimate a straw hat oh I'm a member of the press well a beret no a beret is this if you wear a fucking beret I'm gonna throw a French braid and throwing you in a flying headlock brockless if you have a beret and a cigarette holder like like hunter s Thompson now I kind of like you if you're a dandy if you're a dandy and you have an ear trumpet and a cigarette holder now I like you I have a hard time with dudes who wear vests me too I do want to go I do want to dress like that like a like a salsa dancer I want to be a Cuban gentleman at the end of the day like I do kind of want to be I want to wear linen suits I want to be an older gentleman and I want to smoke fine cigars and there is the ORAC pipe there is part of me and I want to pontificate and I want to hang out with Stephen West and I want to talk about philosophy I like Watson to him smoke cigars never ever ever so what's stopping you I don't know it just the store to say I just thought I should get some cigars this is a joint bro oh Jesus a blunt yeah I like that yeah it's tobacco on the outside really because the shit that crashed Tesla stock rock down so don't hurt my lungs man is it mostly weed oh yeah the insides wheat yeah well a little head rush from the tobacco then they get a little little little life I'm such a lightweight life inside the brain we only had some wine Hey break out some fine whiskey huh I have some fine whiskey yeah I we're not many glasses and would be alright or could just drink out of the glass like do we have any yeah we have cups you have to get out of here no all right I never have to oh sorry I'm here did you have a special trip on Oak I'm glad you mentioned that uh complicated eights guys get my my number one selling one hour and I'll be at in Kansas City at the Kansas City improv this Friday Saturday and then I'll be in well Phil he's already sold out well then I'll be Calgary on the fourth fifth and sixth of April this stuff is single malt scotch and this stuff is made by a boy band good whiskey I don't like this bullshit where's this come from I'm not trying risky I believe it's the Florida Georgia line's whiskey oh okay they're not a boy band or a bambam I thought it was like in sync or some shit at what point in time does a boy band ever get to a point where they're like okay we can't call ourselves a boy band anymore we're 40 boys are still rollin it's a man it's a man bent nervous they're still backstreet called a man band does your glass empty there no finish across our face oh you know pour it in there I'll put the coffee in there good move good move I'm just a whiskey in there alright gallons obviously exactly Scott Scott Jesus days as much what you're doing take it easy don't whiskey was it the Irish scotch scotch the Scots so Highlands but so the Irish stole it from the Scots I don't know I don't know is that your uh that's my brogue my broke you know who Scotland who's on his way holla who Billy Connolly famous sir is he dying yeah I didn't know that yeah how old is he he's I want to say he's in the 70s what happened he just got some terminal illness see if you can find it 76 great comedian great comedienne supposedly I've never met him but supposedly a great guy too we're all gone brother yes that's the other thing I think about I want to make I want to I don't want to be too attached to immortality I want to make that's way doable watch I've been doing the area's you know what I've been doing is I do Sam Harris's not dying not dead sir Billy Connolly sends reassuring musical message to fans okay so he still to go he's still going he's got some sort of a cancer and Parkinson's says hmm double dose fucking machine breaks down I've been doing um I've been reading I mean I was doing Sam Harris's uh waking up app real guided meditation I've been doing it like it for three months I actually I love it because I read his book spirituality without religion and I really liked it I've always dabbled I've always thought about meditation but I without fail I've done it now for over three months and it's only ten minutes a day sometimes I do a little longer you know but um it's it's kind of profound I never would have seen the value of it but it's it took me a while to see he helps it's very he's he's a very good guide because he's been doing it for thirty years yeah and he's a very smart guy obviously he's doing all of those quiet retreats yeah so did you know there re who wrote sapiens he is on three-month retreats I mean when I started seeing guys with that smart and do that I kind of went this is very interesting especially from Sam who's always takes flack for being an atheist but he's pretty religious for an atheist I mean in terms of how he speaks about meditation consciousness mind versus brain you didn't use the term spiritual or appreciate that people say that I'll never they just but I'm spirit now yeah yeah I guess he's he's very concerned with the health of his mind and he recognizes the power of meditation you know I do a bunch of different things that um help me keep my mind clear like one of them is running or something about running that I never really understood until I started doing it to form a meditation well yeah you're you're in this sort of weird state of mind where you're just trudging and breathing and that's all you really can concentrate on you don't have much room for other things like when you're really struggling like when I'm running up a steep hill and I'm running with a dog he's so much faster than me he just fucking takes off he'd say I have the best dog man he turns around checks just make sure I'm okay like you're all right I'm like I'm good dude I'm good I'm right behind you and then he takes off and runs again he's loves freedom yeah he's so he's such a good dog like I never worry about him meeting people he would just be kissing them yeah like the only thing I worry about is like cats like mountain lions you sure I do worry about that because we do run in these really remote areas and when when I do that when I'm trudging up those hills all I'm doing is breathing I'm pushing my thighs and I'm fucking trying to get to the top of this hill and it's a rough steep fucking long hill you don't think about jack shit buggy than that and then when you do come down and your heart rate drops and you're ready to go again you know I'll do like a long 200 yard hill like I'll sprint it as much as I can yeah and then I get to the top and I have to catch my breath I don't want to kill myself but then when you catch your breath it's like during the time where your heart rate is dropping you start looking at the actual real magnitude of your problems like what are what are they really like what what is what one of our biggest problems is the way we interact with each other right if you think about all the problems that people have in the world obviously this is the big global ones global conflict war financial conflict and weird shit that countries do to each other back and forth but it's human beings in conflict with other human beings and how much of that could be avoided right like isn't it mostly avoidable like with people with one-to-one to reasonable people you and I you and I is perfect simple we've run into some people we've run into a person and it's not how wars are I think so of course it's with groups well no no it's also like sometimes it's about resources I mean if you if you only have access to one water way and your kids may not be able to drink water you can get genocide right quick of course you know so there's there are certain things where you kind of go well we have to fight for our survival but again people go to war the way you organize men young men is not whether we hate them that doesn't last as much what you do is you you go hey it's about love it's about defending our country our way life and you you create symbols and propaganda and things for them to march behind that's always how you motivate large groups is how you create an ideology in your you know your fighting force you need that because they tend to fight for something you know I think it west points as a nation to finds itself on what it's willing to fight for nobody wants one world government right that's one of the things that everybody scared of like one world like one group that runs all the countries on the whole planet like that's too crazy right that terrifies all of us yeah one group having all that fucking power yeah anytime anytime one group that's my problem with a big federal government right but like isn't I mean it seems that they're all ridiculous at this point but if there was laws like laws that we all agreed on like you can't just like you say if you go to Singapore with weed you're gonna like the rest of your life right you know like huh dudes if you're a dealer there yeah yeah they will fuck you up and it can't be traveling over there with cocaine or anything crazy like that yeah yeah you're in deep shit no jury just to judge Lee Kuan Yew talked about that he goes yeah we hang about seven people year SADS terrible no you know just judges but mmm how many people die from drugs from your drug issue in the United States how many people how many kids are orphaned I was like shit hey man they have a perspective it's a hard-ass perspective but we've got to realize that that that perspective exists still on this earth yeah like it's really interesting we think of all the different cultures like I was thinking of like stoic cultures and cold northern cultures and they have to get ready for the winter yeah man or you starve Germans and the Swedes and the Nordic folk yeah time becomes a real factor time with your harvest when all that stuff also no bullshit some fucking insane genes in these people right like that Game of Thrones guy you know Brock Lesnar's folk are from that nice world yeah land of the giants yeah this is the craziest hardiest stock serve the real the real Vikings yeah and the real survivors like they have to deal with some shit in the winter before there was any kind of cars those people were living up there riding animals when it was God knows how fucking cold war those animals Overton skins and shit and they would open the door was blowing a giant beards one fire in the center of this fucking house and everyone's gathered around the fire it was all about staying warm yeah and having enough to eat and then you had to worry about some other dudes just like you coming into your town and fucking you up while you slept I'm just taking you as a slave oh my god chopping you up in front of your family people just chopped people up that's right and that's the mostly what happened forever that's right mostly what happened and by the way we're gonna impregnate your wife and kill your kids oh yeah everybody got killed everybody got raped and that was normal that was life and people made it through that to some form of security where they started thinking about rules and laws and how to force them and keep things civil well yeah I think it just well I think the fascinating thing is slavery slavery was the order of the day and the leading philosophers and moral thinkers of our time from Jesus to the Buddha to Muhammad to Socrates and Aristotle to all of them never ever really spoke much about slavery about owning other human beings about selling someone's children they just was never really brought up I mean it just wasn't you just see it's like it was just what was done and then you know really started the abolitionist movement that they were they I mean the the beginnings of the abolition of slavery worldwide you know did it no British in the eighteen hundreds really a button you know did it in specifically evangelical Christians well the abolition movement was started by what you'd call you know fanatic you know Christians but they were they were they were they risked everything and convinced the crown to enforce a and on slavery in the high seas so if you were a British naval you know ship even if the Ottoman if there was a Turkish ship of the Ottoman ship over there and they had slaves the British were spent years and great costs at basically hanging slave traders freeing slaves all that stuff on the high seas you know even though they're obviously there was a lot of racism that went on the Brits and their Navy were the ones that began the abolition of worldwide slavery didn't allow it on the high seas now how amazing is it that that didn't take place into what eighteen nineteen sixty-five sir eight now listen well that's when it was abolished in America it was that abolished there all country no a Britain abolish slavery I believe way earlier than America did so we were 1865 or 1869 and we got another thing to remember is the United States has been a country with slavery longer than it's been a country without so that gives you an idea have a recent that is okay just stop and think about that yeah that number 1865 seems so recent now used to when I was a kid it felt like it was forever again I know when I was like five years old I thought about slavery I thought about it as being like eons and eons in the past do you know a book I just read it and it's it's the it is without besides the Bible a lot of arguably one of the most influential books ever in the written in the nineteenth century what yeah Uncle Tom's Cabin whoa yeah I realized I hadn't read it and well I mean I think that Harriet Beecher Stowe and and I think the legend is that Lincoln said so you're the little woman that wrote this book that started this great war because she she put this she had never actually she was from the north but she interviewed fugitive slaves and people who you know we used to be and if you read that book man it was it puts such a face on what slavery the brutality what it was really about in this country or anywhere where you could take a woman's child an eight-year-old and you get some money and it's the story where the slave trader goes well I'll buy the kiddies yeah I could fetch a good price for him down often well we'll take him when his mom ain't there maybe gather go do a chore so when she comes back you know otherwise it's all kinds of hemming and hawing and they had slave brokers who wouldn't come in and go look your plantation is in debt you got to start selling some of your slaves now I'm not gonna take those guys but that that woman she's got she's got those two healthy-looking boys and they and you would sell them and she could do nothing about it that was the reality and and Uncle Tom's Cabin controversial book because of the way they described Uncle Tom as a simpleton and a Negro but I'll tell you what it did is she she made you realize in Technicolor with a human face just exactly how horrible it was and what happened to the women who would have to see their children sold in front of them and they couldn't do anything blah blah blah but but yeah it was well it was it was for many people what galvanized the North to say we can't have so this is crazy can't have slavery how crazy is it that wasn't 200 years ago I know I know that wasn't even 200 years ago now man that's that's like you know that joke that I have about the president the being like we became a nation in 1776 yeah people live to be 100 that's three people ago right now that's rising it's real we we are since we are infants in something well we're in the process of this thing where we're figuring out life what's fair what's right how to run shit and we're we're doing it based on this idea that someone had already got it dialed in whether it's through the Constitution or whether it's through the democratic system or whether the educational system all these different systems that we have that they're perfect in there in place and they're ready to rock and they've been rock solid for generation after Jenna wait a minute how long has it been around I know anyway to hold on said that's it oh wow so what did they do before that what they do before when did they have the ability to print yeah okay that was like what 500 years ago what was the fuckin when was the printing press made for it in the 1400s by Gutenberg but then I didn't really take until the 60s so imagine having everything you read someone has to write with their fucking hand you have no idea if it's correct you have no idea if they're telling the truth they're just writing it it's not for years and years and years and that's like probably the main reason why they probably had established higher schools of learning well this is writing this hold on what are you doing yeah the stuff that you're writing how do I know it's true what's your method yeah and there are very people that great was usually the priests and there's a book called how the Irish saved civilization and it's about how the scribes how the the Irish priests wrote down all the knowledge they wrote it down in books and they carried it with them so it's like this whole story of how the libraries had to be painstakingly imitated and then the printing press in the 1400s 1445 or whatever and couldn't Berg invent he was a watchmaker and invented this thing called the printing press and nobody really used it but then you could like you could people could disseminate ideas it was like the Internet you'd have an idea and all of a sudden instead of having one book for you know 50 miles you could print out paper and make multiple copies and send them out and then all of a sudden a guy named Martin Luther goes if I had the Bible what do I need these corrupt priests for what do I need to be pledged leaders can you see them and our mentor used to make those posters I split them up yeah the proclamations yeah and in Bitburg Germany I think but either way this this guy was yeah but you ever listen to the Dan Carlin series on that I didn't oh my god it's amazing Dan Collins he explained Luther ISM explain the whole movement and how he got away with it because he had a high public standing so they didn't prosecute him or sue him or they figured out a way to translate the Bible where other people could read it they couldn't speak Latin that's right they figured out a phonetic translation for it so that so that now you had so if you have the Word of God what do I need the precedent the Catholic divide was about essentially wait a minute I don't need to place these into this giant institution call the Vatican with all the money and the costumes what if I just have the Bible and I do it Jesus six I can read it right here yeah all of a sudden now you're a Protestant that was what everybody was scared about I mean must have been the most horrific thing about the religious power back then like Rome had armies right yeah they this was this was like when Genghis Khan was roaming the earth and running through Russia and Asia and Eurasia they the rome was like they were thinking about going to battle with these people the mongols like the roman armies yeah the Pope had wives this was like really in a lot of ways was almost in an ancient way like a similar position to that the United States has now in terms of the whole world right I'm so hot right now yeah of course you are I mean I don't wanna I'm sorry but what was what was that you gave me because I only took one hit it's marijuana it's a blunt why am i in a tunnel it's good good for you there's tobacco on the outside of it and marijuana on the inside your head wiser that's so beautifully shiny there's a beauty to use I'm gonna be honest with you I'll use a moisture you do wash moister nur well it looks I got you a little nervous because you have a nice patina looks like up a spokes you see Irish Benghazi I bring about complicated experiencing it's out now you can buy you can buy it everywhere everywhere Amazon shed everywhere wherever you get you get your joke joke wherever you get your funny there is a hundred million comedy specials out right now God what no yeah I don't know what the number is but I'm gonna say it's a hundred million still rare he's gonna count them all yeah still a great fraternity yeah it's rare eternity but it's interesting how many of us there are today as opposed to the days of your you know my question is how much material these some of them dude he knows god damn hilarious right now is Sebastian not that's not always hilarious but he's got some new material that he was doing at the improv oh my god dude he's so fun he's so funny he's hilarious he's just got his own groove like we're talking about Theo von earlier like he and Theo in my mind they're they they they're very similar that their Styles way different yeah their materials way different but they're they have their own thing yeah they have a hundred percent their own thing Sebastian has his own music it's like a music it's a reality yeah yeah yeah and you love him so you count on him reacting to these things in a certain ways is it it's his unique is like you know Christopher Walken as always you know you know he's in this zone right now you know Sebastian is in his own sold out for seat four shows at Madison Square Garden god damn that's for sold-out sees amazing for four that's like 18,000 seats a show that's nuts nuts yeah it's got to be some money he's a beast yes I'm sure there's money in it but the point is like he's in that sweet spot of his career yeah you know that's why I love that's in a way why I still have faith in the American system he was a waiter for nine years yeah just a smart easygoing dude who's easy to love that Italian yeah yeah it's got a lot of that we're so fun to watch on stage I don't want to say what he's talking about I want to ruin any of it because you know his stuff isn't even it's you on paper I would never do it justice you have to Sonic you he's funny man but it's that same thing I say about Theo like Theo is in this rare place right now you know like he's on stage and he's like you just start smiling when you see him he's his hypnosis game is on point oh I told him today on the podcast he did better than kid I was like you're an original yeah he's not beating yourself up beats himself up every comic does bro I know every comic does I just stopped doing it at 50 to do with this Sam Harris app no I just decided I got tired of I realize I've been doing my best and I got myself here yeah I mean you know well c'mon there's like a to thing going on right there's two things simultaneously going on there's one that you know you want to do your best and so you look at everything you do and you go I think I could have done that better god damn it why did I do it like this like fuck what is that about like what's this about why'd I do it like that why not haha rework that redo this but then there's the other part that has to be like look why are you doing this like you're doing this because you enjoy it do you enjoy it okay you're gonna feel gross about anything that doesn't work out well everything that you do that doesn't work out well just don't be a bitch about it right just get over it there's a certain self-indulgence involved and dwelling on your mistakes that it becomes almost like a self-pity thing you got a there's a strength in a discipline in learning how to go okay I fucked up did you did you ever read Martha Graham's letter the Great the mother of modern dance she wrote a letter to Agnes what do you think when you ask me that question timely mother of modern dance it's timely though it's you sure like I like but it's still funny I know because I'm asking you about a fucking how do babies what is this woman's name again I'll say her name is Martha Graham she's the great I'm gonna just it's like a really short letter but she wrote this she was a great choreographer she created modern dance she was basically like it's not just there's not just ballet let's how about just moving naturally and doing crazy shit bring up Martha Graham she's at 80 she was dancing but she was a she's a giant she's an innovator she's a giant that being when you think of dance she might be the most famous one of the most famous names ever in dance okay whatever but she wrote this letter and I think you'll appreciate this it's really short there's a vitality a lifeforce a quickening that is translated through you into action and because there is only one of you in all time this expression is unique if you block it it will never exist through any other medium and be lost the world will not have it it has B and it is not your business to determine how good it is valuable it is now how it compares with other expressions it's your business to keep it yours clearly indirectly and keep the channel open you don't even have to believe in yourself or your work you have to keep open and aware it directly of the urges that motivate you keep the channel open no artist is pleased there was no satisfaction whatever at any time there was only a queer divine dissatisfaction a blessed unrest that keeps us marching and makes us more alive than the others damn that's beast shit how about that that's on the money anything is a woman that's her that's her she was doing this nobody understood you send me that yes coz I'm so high I'm not gonna remember it really into what she's doing here but I appreciate her words it's like I feel like you shouldn't show me this wasn't no no this was at that time when they were only doing she was doing the craziest shit this is how I dance if I really hurt my back isn't like 1943 if I'm not mistaken I'd say 43 people were probably struggling then for freedom from the orthodoxy struggling to express themselves in different ways yes you know that's one of the more interesting things about stand-up is that it's indicative or it's um it's representative of the time in which it's performed in like there are little windows in time to how people behaved and thought and there was some shit that people did just 10 15 20 years ago that you just can't do now right it's like it's not it's not an it's not possible it's not it's not in the the public's menu list anymore right you know but back then it was normal it's like you you can and some stuff just isn't funny anymore it's weird like some of the Lenny Bruce stuff man he was for the time he was groundbreaking right he's like nobody had seen anything like this before a guy who was talking straight and true about real social issues and making them funny on stage and rice you know I handsome looking Jewish fellow with beautiful hair yeah and he just had a look just he was disturbing his are is it's comedy shook people up yeah but it was there was no way the you and I can put ourselves back into the minds of people that lived in the 1950s when Lenny Bruce was doing this there's no way we could put ourselves there we we're tainted forever by technology and innovation and the way that it's the way that interaction I think is the big one right the moon as people started being able to exchange information with each other and it'll you know whether it's through television and then through rate you know radio and television and television shows and then Internet and the more they express themselves the more they sort of figure out patterns of behavior that are acceptable yeah but I wonder at times whether or not I think stand-up has is having a renaissance but like music and things I don't think we're living in a time of genius are we or do I not know enough about there's some great shit that's being made there's just so much that's being made black keys are always putting out great shit Gary Clark jr. has an amazing new album it's amazing it's so good he's he's got such a signature guitar sound man his fucking guitar sound is like I love is that style of you know he's got he did a hymn and honey honey did a show together one night in downtown LA and I recorded some of it and put it up on my Instagram and they were doing I saw them brothers midnight ride yeah see if he could find that it was phenomenal crazy man she was reading the lyrics off her phone does she even know the lyrics this song she had to go and get it and she was singing in real time while she's ringing yes I'm you know right while she's reading rather and so he's doing Midnight Rider but he's doing it Gary Clark jr. style and it's fucking amazing wonder how things are right here it is [Music] you see that's like that's his style you know say [Applause] he's Jerry Clark this song oh look at he's a killer here see Stevie Ray Vaughan to you child there's a video never saw him live but I almost got a drive-in life I drove Jeff Beck when I was uh when I was a limo driver I almost got to drive Stevie Ray Vaughan I was thinking I was they get to drive Steve very Wow but he won't take limos he would only take cabs he wanted to talk to the cab Julie yep man the way he people what he does with the guitar is just he was performing with Jeff Beck and all of his people were in the limos man and he went in a fucking cab damn it was legit as fuck but what's crazy to me was that Gary Clark jr. he Gary Clark jr. that song while still having it be clearly that song so cool but it was like yeah you know it was so cool due to be there live and it was like 12 o'clock at 9:00 a.m. Tuesday in downtown LA it was only maybe a hundred people in the room and Suzanne Suzanne Santo from honey honey she's so talented man she looks it the fact that she could have read that sure voice is insane she's reading that off of her phone and singing it yeah but Stevie Ray Vaughan you can't put any of this music up don't yank us off the phone if I if I gave you a if I told you that you would have a few would could trade a deep knowledge and practice of music over your knowledge of martial arts would you take it right fuck no no no I would rather be a better a great fighter than an amazing guitar yes yes how I feel of the art yeah I don't have to make it no but I can't play at all and I'll listen to Gary all day listen to this podcast I'm Joe Rogan experience because of my obsession with Jimi Hendrix right that's why I did I mean why need I stole it from Jimi Hendrix right I love music but I don't have any talent no I got none I'm not no desire nothing you don't have to fucking make movies man you don't have to be a painter you know Taylor boss made this Mitzi look at that watch over in the studio I don't want to paint no you could paint I agree you do things really like I do it source it I'm not giving up martial arts for nub nothing no way no it helps me so much it's so it's so important for me to just to have the ability to get out a hundred percent of aggression be able to hit a bag and just get into a flow smoke a joint and then hit a bag you ever do that oh I don't I'm so hot right now the last thing I want to do is punch somebody you might be interested in day two of the 50th anniversary of the Woodstock did you hear that we're doing it first of all no what are they doing well the lineup just got announced and date - it's got Gary Clark Sturgill and the Black Keys holy shit and David Crosby and chance the rapper and Grateful Dead oh there who knows Jesus whoa that's a fucking line up right there son Sturgill Simpson and the Black Keys that's to my top ten it's so much music what's amazing about music man is that they're they're still making it it's like everyone's still making music so it's not like there's the database just gets bigger it's not like stuff goes away right you bring back old Donna Summer shit you know like dude I have what is that no I think it's nowhere to run oh I got some playlists thank you this but okay Allman Brothers or James Brown like you go you go back in time when you listen to that you listen to James Brown song it's not just that you're listening to James Brown you're listening to a time capsule from 1963 or whatever it was so astonishing oh yeah James Brown he was amazing oh like that I when I hear Zeppelin and I hear James Brown I never get I never lose my shock at how good they were how unique they were yeah no Zeppelin was incredible the only thing that ain't Zeppelin is this allegations of plagiarism which seem to be totally true I know I've heard the song so you can do this side by side with Sam you stole those riffs yeah that's rough yeah it's unfortunate because the end result is fucking incredible but you're still so great the immigrant song one of the best workout songs of all crazy how much credit today I mean should they have that I'm not trying to disparage it at all but like they should get a lot of credit for how good okay we're still they were still the greatest they were the definitive they're the definitive heavy-metal they're so good Vannevar there's no doubt that they're so good that you see the thing is it every song I don't know you know I don't know how every band does it every song is probably constructed differently put in a lot of cases there's a lot of people contributing to the song you know the drummer has an idea and the singer has an idea and the guitar player has these riffs he's trying out and they're trying to figure out the best way to do this song it's a collaborative effort it's no doubt that the collaboration was fucking phenomenal the question is was it consensual like how many of these people were collaborating and didn't know it right so that's what happens if you're plagiarizing it seems like it's okay and you know maybe they just thought that bands gonna go away no one's gonna care about that anymore because we're LED motherfucking Zeppelin that's possible too because before the internet that kind of would have been the case you know no one but now I still are taking something that doesn't belong to you you definitely also in my opinion you have to buy that from the person yes give them credit yes but there's no way you can discount the fact that there were motherfuckers when they were on top when Robert Plant would stand on that fucking stage with his shirt open I mean he's the what's one of the weirdest things like what they think about that change in history right go from 1950 to 1969 go 19 years and you see you go from people that look like Hank Williams senior to Robert Klatte who apparently was wearing blouses or dresses or t-shirts that the girl he had the night before had worn do you know that doesn't it we're on stage that's correct sir that's what I hear so probably fucked his way through the shirt he always wore girls shirts that were too small for him well you could always see his hog in his pants yeah he always has hog press to the side yeah the the the every every heavy metal band in the 80s poison you name it whatever Motley Crue they all had a blonde lead singer boys yeah that was because their hero is mr. Robert yeah no he's a beast dude they're he's wearing a girl's shirt oh my god that's amazing yeah that's amazing this shirt barely fits them damn right all of so many of those pictures what a crazy life that guy let yes look at that you know I don't think any one of us will ever be able to understand even even if you became like the new Led Zeppelin you'll never understand what it's like to be Led Zeppelin in the seventies yeah in the 70s what clique imagine if you today became the new giganto fucking multi country rock doesn't matter to me people watching you well it's not just that too many people watching you and there's a lot of you you got to think that's when Robert Plant was Robert Plant who are the royalty you were you were literally like a king yeah you had the who you had Rolling Stones yet Elton John yet people yet people but maybe you have 30 yeah you might have 30 yeah 30 big name artists maybe maybe maybe but it's true maybe a hundred let's get crazy here's a hundred do you have paint Floyd you got the who when you think about the Beatles obviously CDC yeah yeah you got all sorts of shit you got a lot a lot going on back then you know of course you have Hendrix John Glenn Janis job at doors yeah you got a lot shit and then you got the weird ones the Mamas and the Papas amazing band wasn't there some weird shit that went on with that family well yeah but also heroin and cocaine kind of kill of all that hold that hold music scene yeah there's a lot of that that's the problem it's sort of starts it up and then it poisons it well psychedelics and we'd probably good fear music when you get in a cocaine heroin well your musics gonna dying don't don't you know I get it that it's bad for you but I think it's theirs it can't be a coincidence that so many of you that love heroin made amazing music beforehand though so a lot of forehand yeah look at Lou Reed any of them who got into heroin their music stopped Lou Reed was always even Hendrix and Jim Morris I mean a lot of the songs that Hendrix was writing me he died at 27 yeah so that was a relatively new his musical development I think was done less with you know maybe maybe psychedelics but I don't think heroin played a factor until later on in his life so um it's hard to say I mean I don't know I know he was arrested in Toronto with heroin I don't know the whole history of his I don't by that time so famous he had already written those songs that got him there you know maybe I mean I don't know when he started using heroin or why yeah I don't think heroin makes you more more artistic or more successful at all but I think what happens is you have very talented people that have a substance abuse problem you know that's what Stephen killin King said he said I'm great writer but I don't remember writing Cujo yeah my alcohol didn't make me a better writer I'm a really imaginative talented writer who happens to have a substance abuse problem and I'm a bit of it yes and no yes and no cuz yes he is unbelievably talented yes he's an amazing writer he's one of my personal favorites I mean I probably read more Stephen King books and any other fiction author but the stuff that he wrote when he was doing drugs was hard-core shit he wrote The Shining and Cujo and the Tommyknockers he wrote all sorts of wicked books man where there's just evil intentions and ruthless actions and shocking scenes and the fact it was a coincidence he was doing coke just a coincidence he was drunk no I think co-wrote the books though I think they did not no one saying that if you look vitamin C doesn't make a person right it's these are these are tools yeah to squeeze the most out of your imagine while suppressing any sort of a sort of societal handcuffs you might have put on yourself because of the horrific notions like he said he would say things in his book where you would go whoa like you would have to take a step back like where the fuck what what kind of fucking person thinks this up right what kind of person I'll tell you what kind of person a guy who's drunk as fuck doing coke who's also a great writer it's not that writing that stuff and digging into his I'm not saying that I think you probably could have achieved the exact same results on the natch because he's Steven motherfuck okay it might have focus is my firm it's also it's also positive possible rather that that stuff is rocket fuel it's rocket fuel for your your your physical energy your anger your moods your inhibitions dissolve and it might open up the pathway to that for payment or payment rate that you didn't want to get to here I can have two comes like in a Stephen King book Oh what the hell's that cemeteries came out what is it that just brought up maybe remade it the way last week or something knows a week or two yeah I thought is it a comedy definitely not all right I heard it's really good really yeah Oh John Lithgow son gotta go kids guys always good you gotta go
