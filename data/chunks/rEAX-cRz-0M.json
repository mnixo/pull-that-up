the Joe Rogan experience III was I was 22 and I my wife left me I moved to Boise just cuz it sounded funny enough fraud telemarketing so I could do it anywhere there's a phone right I'm in business and then after we moved a Boise and immediately my wife left me for my best friend we all moved out there together and then my other buddy that moved with us couldn't handle the stress so he went back to Vegas so I'm almost shit to Boise and within two weeks I'm alone so I moved up to this fucking I bought a cabin like a for sale by owner like like I didn't get alone I was like hey I'm just gonna give you it was what do you call it or I just signed a contract and I'll pay you I didn't go through a bank right owner financed owner finance and the little cabin the two bars in town and you're either a Long Branch guy or you're the Dirty Shame guy and I was a Dirty Shame saloon guy and I would drive back and forth because in a small town they open around noon but not necessarily at noon and how old were you then 22 that's hilarious they'll fucking chicks there so you were I would drive back and forth in front of the bar until Jolie showed up to open so if it's 12:15 I've been just driving back and forth waiting for her to open and I would I lasted like six months and then I had to ditch out on the phone you there by your sound or financing yeah at one point my buddy that moved back to Vegas came up and he was there for a couple months but we'd get on the phone just enough to pay our bar tab in fact my bar tab I traded out like furniture when I when I bailed six months later I traded Jolene like my furniture in the cabin for my bar tab and yeah that's fucking crazy so you could set your own hours when you're doing that scam telemarketing stuff you just did it whenever you want to and they just got like you clocked in he got paid I would do it out of my cabin just pick up the phone I had leads I stole from Vegas and and what did you do like how did that work I did call up businesses and add the pitch and you won one of these awards and you're you just have to buy this many you know a pens like addcom ad specs advertising specialties this mug with hey Joe you want a big award and I'm gonna all you have to do is make a small purchase of these mugs with your business name on them the Joe Rogan podcast and you're guaranteed to win this big award that's worth Weibull Wow so it was just a total scam yeah Wow but cleverly phrased so to stay in that gray area of legal right we're like whoa I knew it do to have a really interesting scam he had a scam where they were making it was a company that would allow you to fix your credit so they would give you a line of credit and you would buy things and then pay off the credit and it would boost your credit back so if you had fucked up credit it was it was allowing you to fix your credit but the catch was the only things you could buy with their credit card was things from their catalog so my soul to the company store yeah I get you know those things so they had these scam but a catalog being worse girl with stuff but say if something costs you know whatever was a toenail clipper every cost like three dollars of the grocery store there is $25 so if you want to buy it you're giving them a giant chunk of profit so they would ship these terrible little items and it would really actually boost these people's credit it actually did work where booth so was enough but it was a total scam so you're the only shit they can buy with your credit cards and stuff from your catalog and everything's marked up through the fucking roof and this dude made millions on that made millions that's what I have spent so the products like when I was working for a company originally the we would have the the black matte pen with the gold-medal Florentine trim and five lines of your ad copy on it and we'd be selling these fucking 25 cent pens for like $4 apiece so it was but the scam that I was just getting into when I started doing comedy and then bailed out and went full-time and comedy was the the invention once like the George Foreman oh look the grill yeah do you have an invention tell and it's a fucking yeah it's just such a great scam cuz egos involved and it's good you know everyone thinks they should be on Shark Tank those kind of people and you go I can't say but I think what you have here and and then it's a multi-level weather event help there to submit your invention idea to companies I'm not saying invent help is a scam I'm saying scams of that do you have an invention and then there's a step one is we're gonna do a patent research to see and this is gonna cost you this but honestly Phil I think you're on to something I can't say that this is a million-dollar idea but I know when I have a feel it's the way you say it but you can look at examples where the United States has imposed a minimum wage on other countries I mean the minimum wages did a lot of damage in Puerto Rico but you know look at another American territory American Samoa right American Samoa we basically destroyed American Samoa with our minimum wage I mean the Samoans are you know you know are furious about it this happened years ago actually and I the reason I even found out about it I was watching 60 minutes and they were doing a report about I think football players in Samoa and and during the report they mentioned that there was like a depression going on in Samoa and it was like there was 30 percent unemployment and really high inflation I was like what the hell's going on in Samoa so I wanted to research that on my own and I found out that we imposed the minimum wage on Samoa and we destroyed all their jobs they're the two biggest employers were to a chicken of the sea and Starkist they were canning tuna and then they shipping the tuna back to the mainland but the minute they raised the minimum wage they made the production uncompetitive because now you had to pay the higher wages plus the shipping cost to get the tuna back to the mainland so they stay all the canneries shut down and then it created massive unemployment and then prices went way up on the island because they no longer had boats coming back and forth to pick up the tuna so now all of a sudden the shipping cost of imports went way up so they had massive inflation sky-high unemployment all because the minimum wage so you know you could look at you know examples of how minimum wage destroys jobs you know right there yet you know they continue to advocate for these higher wages because it sounds good Oh everybody should earn a decent living well you know not if you don't have any skills you can't and I'll of course you know a lot of kids you know they're 16 17 18 19 20 I mean people live with their parents still the most important thing is getting a job so you can acquire the skills to get a better job to you know to move up the ladder in an organization to enhance your you know your value to employers in general what's the argument against this I'm against what you're saying about minimum wage against all these ideas that you're you're just proposing do you do you get a lot of pushback I mean I'm sure what you're saying this free market capitalism approach is it's you know there's a lot of people that oppose it of course I mean there's a lot of people that don't think it out they think with their mind or their or their mothers and they don't even get the origin of the minimum wage was racism I mean the first minimum wage is here it was designed to keep employers from hiring the Chinese or from hiring blacks because they you know the that that's where the minimum wage came from you know to try to prevent employers from hiring certain people so they said well let's have a minimum wage and and that will reduce hiring of people who have less skills and and so and the labor unions the biggest supporters of the minimum wage are the labor unions and none of the labor unions workers earn the minimum wage so you might think why are they a so care about the minimum wage if they don't get paid a lot higher than men wage and it's because you always have a competition between skilled labor and unskilled labor right so let's say a business this man has the option of hiring a skilled person to do something and let's say the skilled person is gonna charge $20 an hour or an unskilled person and let's say I can hire three unskilled people for $5 an hour and that equals 15 well hey I'd rather hire the unskilled worker I can pay 3 $5 an hour to do the same job of one skilled worker but now if the skilled worker can could lobby for a $7 minimum wage now if I have to hire 3 unskilled people it cost $21 AHA now all of a sudden I hire the guy with skills so the labor unions benefit by keeping unskilled people unemployed because they have more skills and therefore they can you know they can get more work that sounds like a complicated mess to me it is a mess for the owner for the people that get get priced out of a job yeah [Applause]
