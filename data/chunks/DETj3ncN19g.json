ready young Jamie here we go how are you sir I'm great thanks nice to meet you nice to meet you um we were talking before about Adam Curry who's just here who has these crazy ear enhancements that are these software base so he can tweak it and change levels and stuff like that and you were saying that you also have hearing but you got it from rock and roll yeah I mean honestly I've never been tested I just know that when I'm out eating with my family or friends that everybody can hear everything and I can't hear anything so but no I love rock music for mm six seven eight nine years and uh yeah it it it does what they say it does know what those people tell you to do but look I like the technology like I have older relatives who have a hearing aid or whatever they called now hearing enhancement devices that are like light ears better than they used to be oh yeah yeah so I figure if I can hold that a couple more years mine are gonna like be so good they'll take out the garbage the ones that Adam has so I'm pretty fucking amazing he said it just sounds incredible and he can actually tune into people at a 50 feet away 50 feet away I having a conversation he can hear them and can you tune out people you don't like that's a good question I bet there is a way Betty we has various settings but I bet there's like a tone the world out I don't need to tone the world they're just some people times you know yeah have you used any of those air pods that have the noise canceling technology oh not air pods but I wear bose noise-canceling almost every day I wear him a lot oh you know when I started as a journalist in newsrooms this was whatever early late 80s early 90s I didn't like a newsroom is an open place and a lot of people back then were on the phone doing your reporting it was pre-internet reporting right and I didn't you're a writer you're writing and you're editing and I I didn't understand how people could think with all this didn't going on I couldn't do it so I started wearing just the good foam earplugs are made by flints I think is the brand that I use they're kind of non tapered and they're very thick and if you compress them and put them in it'll block out like you know 70 80 % so I've been shutting out the world for like twenty-five years now so when the the noise cancers got good i-i've embraced them yeah yeah some people need it though right they need that sound like at the coffee shop like they love to go to coffee shops and all the milling around actually helps their creativity you know we're doing an episode right now for economics radio on noise basically as you know kind of we got into it thinking about noise pollution right cuz noise is a funny thing it's what economists call an externality and negative externality meaning you can produce it and it affects me but you I don't I can't charge you for it right it's like pollution if you have a big factory your pollution goes up it blows over to someone else that's an externality on them so noise is that but what's really interesting is that there's a huge variance in how different people receive and perceive noise as you just said so some people really need it and want it for some it's a burden and then there's all these rather weird intricacies of noise like have you heard of Musa phone eeeh you know that is I have heard of it but I remember what it means it is an intensely negative reaction when you hear other people chewing or their mouths making any sound and it can be debilitating for people who have it but then there's something called I'm gonna get it wrong amsr ASMR you know that yeah there's all these videos online right right right yeah that's so noises that stand for them yeah I can I'd have to look it up automated sense or someone would have to look it up at someone yeah we do if someone screams in your ear unexpectedly and hurts your ear that is a form of assault right you don't think of it that way but if some if like if you saw a girl she was stand there and a guy ran up tour and just Wow in her ear just like ah and she's like falls down cuz your ear hurts I agree you can do that with sound what about when airports play CNN at blast volume yeah that's I mean is that a form of assault borderline oh god sweet deal to CNN have with airports I think it kind of made everybody hate CNN blast and when you don't want to hear it that's right right it shows that it's a little bit annoying but it's also it's like you don't want to be looking at all the world's problems when you're about get on the most stressful thing that a person does you are you ever flying you you have to self-medicate pretty heavily before flying then no no I don't have to we enjoy it I enjoy it more yeah well this is what I the way I think of it on a plane one of two things gets either where get some work done or get some entertainment I'll watch a movie on the laptop or I'll get some writing in write or I can get really really high and then get on that and just freak the fuck out and and make it but go through a rollercoaster ride of thoughts and a lot of times I'm wind up writing to you know if I wait when you get high you have a worse experience on the plane no no it's not worse it's just scary it's not warmest and scary is not worse no because there's benefits to it benefits in terms of like creativity and then insight and like Justin I I have a whole bit about it but it is based on the truth like I often times take a heavy dose of edibles and then get on a plane in order to intentionally put yourself in a state that can be somewhat negative but also creativity I also I see I don't use that word negative an interesting is negative even when I'm freaking out like if I'm sitting in the chair and I'm like whoa and you know I'm looking out the window we're flying and I'm realizing we're 30,000 feet in the air and I'm really fucking how is this so I'm not a like a roller coaster person but is this a similar kind of like you put your you intentionally put yourself in a scenario where you're gonna heighten some senses is that the ideal because I think a roller coaster is just fun right it's just goofs this is an essential thing you're doing you're travelling to a place where you're going to and as you're doing you're incredibly vulnerable great you're Ambala is in a chair while you're going 500 miles an hour in the sky you're like whoa already you're going a little weirded out if you look out the window but now when you're really really really high it puts you in this very strange state and you start thinking about your life and you start thinking about how you talk to people you start thinking about things that you've learned and documentaries that you find fascinating you start dwelling on weird things and then you know oftentimes I'll either watch something or I'll start writing so I get something very productive out of what would be dead time it makes me it my whatever it is that creates creativity for me whatever the source of it for me for some reason it gets enhanced oftentimes by being on a plane on edibles how predictable though is the experience unpredictable right so is that not a little a little bit that's not nobody gets hurt that's the thing yeah it's not like a real fear and in the back of your mind you know this is just a yeah a physiological chemical response and I'm gonna exactly exactly and I mean that's what paranoia really is marijuana based paranoia if I had to guess it's a hyper awareness that you're not not comfortable with and so in taking in all these things it's like if you just can't settle in you're recognizing every threat that's around you all the time the fact that a rocket come out of the sky the fact that the the tsunami could hit at any moment the earth could shake what if a super volcano blows up all those things that you know to be real all of a sudden get dragged do you put yourself back into caveman mode like every rustle of grass is the lion who's coming to you alright let me ask you a question sorry I realize I'm not supposed to be I'm gonna here's a question let's say for people who don't use drugs Yeah right but they hear you say this and like they say wow that is I recognize the value of putting yourself in a place emotionally cognitively kind of unleashing yourself or maybe putting yourself in a new place where you're gonna have thoughts big thoughts maybe scary thoughts is there a way to do that that you know of the without drugs yeah we were just talking about that with Adam in fact we were talking about holotropic breathing and he has had some experiences with holotropic breathing so like a meditation based breathing routine that if for whatever reason it activates psychedelic chemicals in your brain and you can really trip out and he was talking about how he's flying for like a half an hour and I've had various friends do it I've yet to experience it you tried it no yet I have yet to experience it but I've had various friends who've done it who have had spectacular experiences like like full-blown mushroom experiences for several minutes and is it guaranteed like if you do the breathing is it guaranteed to get you to that state or no no I think you have to learn how to not as reliable as drugs and right and also physically demanding like I think it takes a long time I think you have to work yourself up into this state where this stuff starts to happen and you also have to probably follow some routine that's tried-and-true all right I don't know what that routine is but I do know that people that I trust including people like Adams super smart guys will tell you that for them it gave them the same experience as like taking a drug all right I'm gonna look it up because I'm not big on drugs I don't know why just nods you're smart no I'm not I'm also not judgmental about I I know but no issue I'm not saying that you would be dumb to do them but I see you're a smart guy so if you're a smart guy and you see drugs you see a lot of people have problems with drugs and you're fine with reality yeah I mean I smoke dope in college and it just I mean also dope was believe me son I smoke dope but also the dope was a different caliber then it wasn't very good it wasn't very predictable and it just I just had a bad experiences so whatever I drew I like out I like whiskey me too and I like the predictability of like even like the difference between if I drink my Laphroaig is my favorite scotch like and if there's not that and there's another that's that stuff we had the other day I got logs good very close Laphroaig it's it's the PD family some people don't like the PD stuff OPA - I think oh you've never heard of that the marvel was half-empty though so I don't know what the fuck happened I was probably so drunk that I was drinking it and not even realizing it was it's a nice thing about scotch oh you can sip it behind it forever yeah if you're you know that stuff - I would imagine is even better when you're gently sipping it because you're dealing with this really exotic flavor it's also good for you isn't really you don't let me rephrase it's not bad for him in terms of alcohol I mean beer look it depends how crazy you want to be about caloric consumption and so on but beer has a lot of calories wine has a lot of sugar and whisky is actually pretty a pretty low cal low sugar just high alcohol content so the sugar works a little bit differently but uh but no my doctor fully approves of a couple drinks a night there's been research that shows that a couple of drinks a night for most people is actually fact my doctor who's a researcher as well she said that if you look at longevity the people who have the shorter life expectancies are the people who drink a lot not a surprise and none so it's the people who drink from like one and a half to maybe two and a half maybe a little bit more drinks a day have the longest life expectancy she doesn't know though whether it's the teetotalers why do they live long the shorter it may be because they can't alleviate the stress maybe you know it could be that alcohol does have physiological benefits we don't know but the message seems to be that everybody should drink a little bit yeah there's got to be a benefit in relaxation there's got to be you know I was listening to your podcast on loneliness hmm and in statistics it's really good I love your pocket appreciated thank you and and that one you know talking about loneliness and you know that whole correlation how they came to the conclusion that it's like 15 cigarettes a day but that a bad feeling that a bad feeling is bad for you and a good feeling is probably good for you and the little trade-off health-wise look I kind of feel like you can get make that up in the gym and they're like you could achieve a good balance there's something about like having a drink every now and then it's nice yeah you might hug people you want to have smiles agree it relaxes you also you know this is a phrase that younger people will not remember but actually I can't remember it either so um I think it's the social lubricant it was a usable alcohol right and so the fact is is that a lot of people have a lot of trouble communicating with other people period whether it's loved ones you either say you're too candid or you're not candid enough with strangers so a lot of people have a hard time being with other people kind of in the way they want to and if alcohol can act as that kind of take the edge off as they say it's an interesting but I'm always looking for ways I'm always trying to isolate the places or the circumstances where I get good ideas and the problem is it's very it's unpredictable walking is the one thing that I found and the is it writers throughout history a lot of creative people throughout history have embraced walking now in the old days it was one of the few things that you kind of could do you know you could you weren't gonna go out and well I guess you could have played golf or whatever but people have been walking for a long time and they say that there's something about what the brain and body do in concert with each other on a walk which is your kind of mapping you're kind of decoding you're kind of figuring but you're also getting some fizzy lock physiological stimulation and I find that's one that's pretty good but I wish there was a thing I could do to make the good ideas flow because that's the hard part I don't think if there was a thing other than show up and start writing if there really was a thing it would cheapen whatever the fuck it is that makes you have those weird thoughts that come across like where'd that come from yeah a gift from the heavens ya know the mystery is beautiful yeah yeah yeah but walking to me I didn't really walk until really recently I didn't go on hikes or anything till really recently usually would run and running a lot of times you know you're just so tired you're not having any good ideas you're just thinking like how long you lived in LA since 94 and before that I lived in this is my whole thing set New Jersey until I was seven San Francisco from 7 to 11 Florida from 11 to 13 Boston from 13 to 24 New York from 24 to 26 ish 27 maybe before 27 I'm on the west coast okay so did you find that in Boston in New York which are easily the best walking places of all those places you just said did you walk a lot more there and did it change anything for you no I was busy while I was 20 you know my early do you were working in clubs in New York very tiring I was working in clubs in New York and I was doing a lot of road gigs and I was playing a lot of pool and I was hanging around with a bunch of comedians and I wasn't going on any hikes right we were we were you know I would go to the gym occasionally and worked out but we're doing comedy you know but as grown up and I usually run with my dog he loves to run and I haven't been able to run recently because of a little injury sorry for the last two months I just been walking with them and then hiking on the trails and he runs around and when I was doing I was realizing like I can listen to podcasts or I can listen to music or I could just do it silent and when I do it silent it's like really interesting there's there's there's inner dialogue that starts playing out it's like you're having a conversation with yourself that it's a little therapeutic so I go on these hour walks with my dog at the end of it you know I feel like I've got some a better handle on stuff I wonder what you're saying makes me think and I hope it's not too late for our episode on noise because this is actually a component that'd be good to get at is like the way you just described slight quiet or solitude whatever it is right I think almost everybody who hears that would say oh yeah I definitely see the value of that because you know you need time to process your thoughts to to feel things whatever but it does make me wonder the world is obviously more noisy now than it used to be yeah way more and I do wonder if you just get conditioned out of even thinking about that like my kids who are teenagers like I don't see them ever having silence or solitude right and again I don't want to be judged I don't want to be the generation because every generation thinks that what the next generation does is horrible like the people you know and the Rolling Stones came the people who like Perry Como said this is the worst music ever and then the people after that said they're owning stones you know etc but I do wonder how much we're losing by not having availability of that quiet because you kind of its unless you build your life to have a lot of silence which I do because I'm a writer and I sit alone all day not many people get to have that and I wonder what the loss is there's got to be something because there's a shift in intention is a attention rather and there's a shift in focus that's Germanic we've gone from just looking at the world around us to fixate it on a device you know you look at people's phone time it's a lot of times it's six hours in a day just constantly on their phone on the toilet constantly on their phone when they go to get a coffee on their phone at their desk texting people while they're walking to the other office they're texting and walking down the hallway I mean most people are on those goddamn things all day long and there's for sure you putting energy into that little device which means you're not putting energy into thinking without that device and though you might think of it as a well I'm just I'm still paying attention I'm just doing this but you're not you're not dedicating any resource to being bored and it's thinking about shit and they're just walking and talking to yourself yeah thinking to yourself and there's something about like a long hike you take a dog for a couple mile hike where you're just walking and you hear crunch crunch crunch crunch and you're just thinking and no one's talking to you and you're not talking to anybody you're just walking and talking with your dog and then you're thinking about stuff in a way that is like a tangible sort of meditation on your life it's it's a real moment and we don't value that real moment we think of it almost as like waste I don't not even listening to anything no good tune but it's really like there's value in thinking and we we haven't put a value judgment or a number judgment on that it's interesting some of the people you hear these days talking the most about really limiting or even forbidding their kids screen time is Silicon Valley executives oh yeah that's where you know they're so yeah yes you have to say like you know at a certain point you have to say okay the writing is on the wall here but on the other hand look every technology that's ever been invented people get scared of it people embrace it people trash it and then you know for sure for sure you there's there's always a thing where there's an example in history where people are wrong but then there's the reality of what it is what it is is an ever increasingly immersive experience that everyone is addicted to and when you're walking through a Starbucks and just see nothing but people on their phones like people in line or on their phones people sitting down around their phones you go through a mall everyone's on their phone you go through a movie theater people can't put their fucking phone now on movies on people are driving they're on they're on the other hand but you got to consider the upsides too oh there's a lot I mean even in the even in the environment you're describing that sounds like let's say Starbucks everybody's on the phone you got to think wait a minute maybe that person over there who looks like they're a slave to it maybe they are maybe they're sending a text to their gram that they wouldn't have done they wouldn't have been able to do ten years ago so that's the tricky part I mean that's why that's why I like economists because economists are ruthless bloodless they almost don't know what humans are but they're very good at measuring costs and benefits and that's what I feel that our kind of political social media discourse is missing people are all for the most part advocates are activists they pick up Blaine and they stay in it and they want to pave over the rest of everybody's lanes and make it theirs yes and it's not a good way to be no it's no you know that's another episode that I was listening to of yours recently about how hard it is to get people to change their mind on things and I forget who the expert was who was talking but it was a really interesting point that he had about the mind like people say change your mind you don't really have a mind you have the mind of the community and if you step outside the beliefs of the community it can be very bad for you in terms of like your personal connections with people and I've really enjoyed that episode it's funny thanks it's a it's a paradox though because the way you just said it like if you are in your tribe yes then even though it can be healthier for you and for presumably many other people for you to change around or at least think differently about things right you you risk losing credibility or whatever yeah well I mean some religions I mean that's how they keep you right you get ostracized there's there's religions we that we know for you if you decide to leave you don't just get ostracized you're you literally you have a death sentence like now you've you've escaped our group you are you're you're an outsider and my father who can both my parents converted from Judaism to Catholicism before they met each other whoa yeah it was it was very unusual happen it's a long story I'll tell you if you really want to know but anyway I'll do this short that's what I'm getting to and this was during the during the second world war they were both in New York both first-generation American Jews that makes sense they converted for different reasons from each other and then they met my father's family was Orthodox and his father guy named Shep's will do who'd come here when he was in his maybe late 20s from Poland he still lived as every day in Brooklyn as if he were still in Poland he didn't change at all when my father converted and his father found out my father was in the war he was overseas he was home on leave and his father was cleaning up and from my father's pants that he'd left over a chair rosary beads slipped out and fell on the floor that's how his Jewish father Shep Zelda burner found out that his son had become a Catholic so what he did is he proceeded to sit Shiva forum the Jewish morning ritual were for seven days you mourn the dead he declared that he would never again speak to his son and he forbade everyone in his family from speaking to his son so I by the time I was born I was the youngest of eight kids in this family because they'd become very Catholic I didn't know this whole family of my father's was unknown to me entirely so they did exactly what you're saying now holy shit yeah yeah that was what I thought too when I hold it mm-hmm and my mother's did the same thing but it was less dramatic because her family was less religious so they still didn't like at all that she had converted but she had any children yeah I got a couple how did you wish again though I it's a long side my first the first book I wrote long before Freakonomics was called turbulent Souls although it got then republished under a different title called choosing my religion and it tells us this story of my my two parents around me yeah I love to hear that but I just want to put in your head that what I was gonna ask you is like how could you imagine a scenario where you would be capable of doing that to your children so no chance no chance no chance but you're so scared yeah it's scary it is but on the other hand I mean this is um what Freakonomics is what I try to learn through doing Freakonomics is you know to measure the what and try to figure out the why but then not be the judge who says that was terrible this is wonderful because you know different people have look if Shep's will do Peter were here we can ask him what's your side of the story he could tell us a story that might convince us that you know what this son of his did a terrible thing to the family he did a terrible thing you know he would say how could it be that we Jews existed for generations and generations and generations when ever we were lived there was always someone trying to you know get rid of us and then we finally come to America you know the land of freedom religious freedom economic freedom and here after generations and generations of forefathers fought to stay Jewish here my son decides to become Catholic what are you thinking so you know everybody everybody's got a perspective everybody's got an emotional experience so I try to respect that but no I would not do that to my children I understand the outrage I understand being upset but I can't understand choosing that over your son and over the relationship you have over your son yeah it's ridiculous the the saddest end of the stories and when that grandma and my grandfather who I never met this was a long time ago my father's father and my father died when I was very young so I didn't know the story either that was why I wrote this first book was to defy to try to figure out this all the stuff I'm telling you now none of this I knew until I was in my like 20s when I was writing this book but when Shep Zelda burner was dying of cancer and the maybe late 50s or so a nephew of his who my father used to be very close with and who looked a lot like my dad and this guy was maybe in his early 20s late teens by now he walked into the hospital room and Shep soul you know on his deathbed really thought that that was my father his sons my dad's name was Solomon he called him Shima and he was he was calling out to a slain Mishima as if he was you know happy happy to see him it wasn't him though and my father didn't go visit his own father dying in the hospital because he'd been forbidden to go anywhere near yeah so it was terrible so look this is why religion I've been long fascinated by religion and I think that again if you think about it the way that economists think about things there are costs and there are benefits and it's complicated I think your honor right and they think that's hard for people to handle and you know people are hardcore atheists where they don't see any value in it whatsoever even though people are there they're getting some sort of ethical value moral value and the way I always put it is like it's like a scaffolding to live your life by you can live within these confines and it really kind of makes sense if you follow it loosely that we're doing to try it for the benefit of community and it's also like a real community sense that comes from meeting and Sunday with all those or whatever day it is with your your religion and you meet in a group of other people that are also in the community and you all basically are saying together that we should do good things and be good to people and treat each other the way God would want us to like all that as undeniable benefits and also it says differently is like you're deluding yourself like your points the atheists who are hardcore who make points about the preposterous nature of a lot of religious texts they're on the money but it doesn't mean doesn't mean that it doesn't give people a benefit and that I couldn't even disagree with them continuing it because there's a lot of people that benefit greatly from religious someone wrote to us after that loneliness episode came out and said how did you fail to write about this supposed epidemic of loneliness without addressing the huge decline in organized religion in America which I thought was a very good piece of criticism that would have been a good because you're right it's a community you know one other thing I would add to the list that you provided of what it can give is humility right because you know if you have an image of some superior being god deity whatever you want to call it you kind of understand that one mortal is you know the world does not revolve around me the other thing I would say and look I it's hard for me to scientifically logically embrace a lot of the arguments of a lot of religions make especially about things like the afterlife right that said even to an atheist I would suggest one way to think about it is if someone does believe in those rewards or if in economic terms we're talking about them as incentives even if it's a placebo effect in other words if I if I'm encouraged to do to treat other people well on this on the chance that if I do so I have a reward an eternal reward hey it's not a bad reason to incentivize people to do well it sounds like a nice justification from them psychic houses you drive by they at the neon sign they're helping people you're giving people a sense what the futures gonna be like how do you know they're to help it might be imagine if that's where the real psychics are those neon signs maybe that's where God lives there could be I went to one of them in Brooklyn by the way the only one I ever went to was in Brooklyn for an audition in the early 90s and I'm like why not fuck it it was like 10 bucks or something I'm walked into this lady and she's wrong about everything she thought I had a brother she thought I was trying to get into the family business you really tired you dad no I don't even know him it was a disaster all right so maybe you didn't you need we need like a Yelp for psychics and that one wouldn't have been the good one yeah I think if we're gonna do something like that we bring in James Randi we having him go by the rules and and someone like Penn Jillette who because he understands all those carny tricks where they do where they can pretend that they're psyched yes by leading you into questions but you know what's funny I think he's a pretty strongly professed atheist dressed right but somehow I find his talking about the subject incredibly like embrace yes like he doesn't rice because it's a smart way of doing it he under sees a generous person he is a really really nice person and that's even if he disagrees with you on something he's he'll laugh and joke around but he's he's a nice person I kill he'll let you have these conversations and and and not like some people try to shove their atheism down your throat and like mock you and I just don't all you're doing is reinforcing the ideas of these people because your act like an asshole like wow that I'm now connecting atheism with assholes oh fuck it fuck assholes you know that's what people do it's like a natural but if someone's nice you know um did you ever do you know the story of Darrell Davis mmm Darrell Davis is a gentleman who's been on this podcast before and he is a musician by trade but he has converted over 200 different guys to leave the KKK and Nazi organization Wow and he's converted it by becoming their friend because he was doing a show and this guy came I'm butchering it and I'm sorry Darryl but just what he said on the podcast I'm sure he'd do a better job telling the story but he was at a show and he was playing in this band and this guy said you were really good you know and he sat down with the guy and the guy said I never had a drink with a black guy before he's like how is that possible and he shows him his card he's in the KKK yeah and so he's like he goes well how you having a rational conversation with me a normal conversation they like you you really think that black men are evil or black men are dumb and and they have this conversation it's civil conversation and then he gives the guy his I think he gave him his phone number said I'll call you when I'm back in town if you want to have this conversation again and so then they become friends and so they go back and forth for like months hanging out and then three three months or so into the friendship the guy brings his KKK outfit he goes I want to give this to you because I'm never wearing it again he goes I'm done and from being this guy's friend unreal and so then he meets a bunch of other ones he starts talking to them and it just nice his pie just nice friendly intelligent super articulate - so it's hard - hard to describe him is dumb when he's way smarter than you right you're talking to him and he's so eloquent so he converts more and more and more it converted a guy who was a Nazi who's a he's converted a bunch of people it's more than 200 now and he continues to do and there's been there's some pieces about it online but hearing him say it and hearing him talk about is the most amazing he just he grew up in a way that he didn't really experience racism until he came to America thinks to me like six years old he's from Italy right that's where he was from before that up until then I think somewhere where he just didn't experience it and then when he was a little boy people were throwing things at him in a parade and he had no idea I couldn't understand it he'd never he didn't know and stay at a Pullman side and say it's because you're black he's like white like he couldn't believe it so because the fact that he didn't have it in his early childhood and then he had it when he was a young boy and realized how crazy it was that he didn't experience this before this one moment and became obsessed with it was Italy he had this is wikipedia says he grew up all over the world but when he came back in 10th when he was 10 he was in an all-white Cub Scout Pack in Massachusetts yeah so that's what it wasn't here so it was ten years old and and if you want to pick somewhere to experience kind of straight-up racism Massachusetts it's a good place to start it was definitely some spots and I have some thoughts on that I feel like there's that heirloom civilization that still like it landed there from boats just a couple of decades ago I mean my grandparents came over in the I think they were here in the the 20s from where were the 30s from Italy and Ireland and everybody came from somewhere right there's mostly most of them three of them came from Italy one of them came from Ireland some 3/4 Italian but it's the the families of those people were risk-taking savages they didn't even have a video to watch right they just jumped in a fucking boat and hoped America was better and then when they got there they got checked in at Ellis Island they then they started working in factories and scratching and clawing and there's just a lot of struggle that's still in that part of the world that you when you come to California one of the first things you feel is like a lighter a lighter sense of discourse than the East Coast is the East Coast I always felt like people had their guard up a little bit more a little bit more tense a little bit more like what the fuck did you say there was a little bit more of that a little bit more sketchy people just the the echoes of the savage past it's still in the soil you know I hear you but there's also so the thing that I like about New York I don't mean to trash California I like California law I Love New York but man when I'm in California first of all it feels much more like a foreign country to me than any other place in America maybe like what makes it seem like a foreign country it feels because I feel people have a manner and a style that is totally divorced from this intensity that I'm used to write for in New York now I grew up on a farm in upstate New York so I grew up not in the hurly-burly New York City was scared because my parents once they converted and they became Catholic they needed to have someplace where you could have tons of kids so we grew up in the middle of nowhere so I grew up I was a farm kid and so the intensity of a city scared me until ultimately I moved to New York for a variety reasons and then I then I caught the bug and now I love cities so I love California but when I come here I feel like it's running on a different voltage you know yeah and I am envious of people's ability to run like that like they seem right like their shoulders like you look at me I'm sitting here my shoulders always up to my ears like kind of just a built-in tension and I feel like I thrive on it maybe I do I mean things have worked out okay but like I said when I look at look at the way people are sort of congenitally relaxed I envy it on the other hand I think that that intensity produces some things that I I like a lot like I like I also like the environment of a you know of university campus the to me the tricky part is there's that fine line between intensity and competition that treats it like a zero-sum game so I don't like to be around environments where people are trying to win so that they can beat somebody else except in sports that's why sports are awesome sports are a good proxy for life people can be very competitive you win or lose you go home you come back and do it again because you've lost it doesn't make you a bad person right sports are very valuable I think for also for war you know I mean it's well that was football yeah reason why invented it right you know about population densities right that you know you can accurately depict or detect how many people live in a given area by putting a camera on one red light and then a camera on another red light and then as the people walk by measure how fast they walk no kidding yeah I didn't know that and when they do that you know if they swim faster is denser yes faster denser also how many syllables that they say per sentence how quickly they say those syllables that there's actually a cadence a speed that an uptick what do you talk about he's talking about the word you're saying there's a people get to the chase cut to the chase and I think that that urge to walk faster that are just talk faster is an energy and that energy you know we're looking at in terms of its results right the results are you can actually detect if you know the formula you look at a camera here and a camera there you know a timer so someone walked from here to there you add it all up and you can guess like really accurately within a million people pretty late someone lives it yeah yeah I think it's because there's energy that comes out of cities my friend Jeff lives in New York my manager he's lived there forever and he loves it he goes I'd never leave New York I Love New York that fucking energy of this city cuz it gives him juice right I think not for everybody we should say right not for everybody some people I think just get weirded out by and they need to be alone and some people like a yard and some people like peace and quiet but some people live for that bad man fuck you they live they live for being stacked on top of a building with strangers below them and everyone's all together in this hive feeding off you know what's interesting is you know how will you 52 okay so I'm 56 so great thank ditto so we're the same generation and we remember that back when you know computerization was starting and the internet was starting that all the predictions were that you know now anybody can do anything from everywhere so nobody's gonna have any reason to have to live anywhere and cities are just gonna empty out yeah exactly wrong around the world the more digital we've gotten the more in fact the urban population now the share of the human population is urban is higher now than it's ever been in the history of the world it's unbelievable so it says to me is and this is not about New York vs. California anymore well that says to me is even when you can engage with people remotely or have a lot of space whatever there's something about humans wanting to rub up against each other physically intellectually etc that is incredibly strong I inaudible that's why going to live see live music and things like that it's a shared experience you're all seeing something live there's a benefit to that and I always tell people like if you watch a comedy special on television you that comedy special is that the very best 70% is good as seeing it live it's never 100% yeah because you're not there so it might be great because it's a funny person but you're missing for sure at least 30% and then you know when you're live there's like this intangible quality you feel it in the air when you're all laughing there's a buzz that everybody gets you're laughing together yeah like right now it reminds me of I once watched somebody else's wedding video I can't remember the circumstances somebody forced at gunpoint it's pretty it was pretty close to that and and they said it was some it was somebody showing me like their siblings wedding video because they thought it was they said it was such an amazing experience it was so warm it was a lot to get and I felt like I was watching a detergent commercial like no emotional reaction because I wasn't there I wasn't there that's the worst thing that people make you do well they make you sit and watch they're the only thing worse if someone was in a really bad band and they want you to listen to their album believe in front of you yeah and you have to sit there and go dude you making me do this when I played music my so I had I never so first of all when I started in this band I was and up we were in North Carolina and my family was mostly up in New York State and so on so they weren't close but then when we started to travel and tour and and whatnot we would get within their range and they'd come to see us these are like my older siblings who I love they're great people but I would say to them I don't think this really is gonna be for you it's gonna be pretty loud raucous rock and roll a little bit punky a little bit whatever and they're like no no I want to come see little brother did it so then they see a show I remember this one show we played at the old Ritz in New York and I remember my brother who's a musician by the way and very good musician but much more refined than on I was he came up and he said you guys really looked like you were having fun up there like we weren't I wasn't you had so much energy up there so yeah the difference between the experience from the inside and perceived experience was a massive gap yeah for sure yeah going to see something live like that where it's bad is actually extra super painful like when you watch a comedian bomb on stage and you're in the audience you're funny like you're mad at this person for putting you through this like oh my gosh you can't be mad at him don't you isn't it more empathy than anger sure yeah but sure but you there's a lot of anger to because who are you are being tortured like imagine if it's not really physical pain but there is a certain level of emotional pain you experience that someone's bombing someone's in front of you like oh god especially me because I've done stand-up for so many years like I know what it's like to bomb I've bombed so I see someone bombing I'm like yikes I gotta get out of here I can't take it it's almost like my guts are on fire the thing I always wondered about comics is why they don't cheat more because laughter is plainly very contagious right yeah so every time I've seen someone bomb I always felt like if one or two people had started going with it laughing responding you mean cheap more by packing the audience some people laugh something or just putting your iPhone in the audience and having it start laughing I don't know how to there's a lot of ways to cheat because I've always thought that it's such a it's such an obvious dynamic that laughter real is very very contagious but even like you see like kids in school when they're supposed to not be laughing in one kid laughs they they all can't stop it's just incredibly contagious behavior so I think if you did pipe in laughter first of all I'm not saying well maybe I am okay that's most drastic let's say you plant people in the audience right you could probably swing things in a way from a really bad set to maybe an okay set but you're never gonna make it funny see all the best way to do that is to just make it actually they focus to bothered to be good that's not that cheating things not helping you ever it's like it's gonna get in the way you make anything from it it's like people that steal other people's jokes they never learned how to write you know they did they you have to figure out the language of it and when you're up there if you're just doing fake laughs in the background to juice it up you're not gonna know how to get real ones yeah I'm gonna feel weird about it oh you're gonna be also you're gonna know that you're doing it the audience is gonna know that something's wrong you're gonna do Rea so maybe I'm not talking about cheating per se as sense as having as having some and I'm sure every comic does this already so it's not like I'm telling anybody anything but having some something in your pocket that's gonna get them on your side even if for a little while just to get the momentum going in your way we certainly do have some bits that you know work because like when you say like if you bomb or somebody else bombs you could give exactly the same set an hour later to a slightly different crowd and it would go great right so now times sometimes you're bombing because you get off on a bad start like you'll you'll come up with it like the real sketchy time is when you're writing new material that's when that's touch and go the way I always like to describe it's like you have no weapons like you're going into a fight but everything's made out of rubber like fuck like nothing's good yet right yeah like when you you have new material you have a stack of notes and about four or five premises and one or two of them might be any good but I got to go through those other premises that suck multiple times to find out for sure that they're no good all right let me ask you a question when that's happening to you do you learn over time to not let it hurt your ego to the point where you're gonna get even worse in other words if you're not doing well what you need to do is you need to say I've got this material I need to work on it because it's gonna get better but I could imagine that if you start bombing what happens is you just feel so hurt that you get worse and worse as you go how do you fight against that yeah it's a psychological mind game for sure you you definitely could look and I've seen it happen to comedians while they're writing a whole new our it's almost like they lose their glow as a human because they're just eating shit all the time and we get away from them like they're diseased like I'm selling bombs they come offstage you get away from them because we know what it's like I don't want to feel contagious a little bit yeah it's you got to get out of the room like one of the worst things that people do and I don't know why they do it but a lot of comedians like to bring terrible comedians with them on the road so that they look like a hero it's a really sneaky move and they literally hire people that don't work any other way is that a bad idea ultimately terrible idea because you want everybody to have fun and if you make them sit through 20 minutes if someone was terrible if you're torturing them are you do you end up lowering your own standard because you're around you think we're in the vibe of the show you it just fucks it up especially if you're doing it on purpose you know there's a thing that's going on onstage that's not quantified and is that there's a mass hypnosis that's happening when someone is killing for me as an audience member my recognition of this is as a person who performs it and also as an audience member when I'm an audience member and someone's killing I'm letting them think for me right I'm not even thinking I'm just like letting them take me down a trip like say like Dave Attell Dave Attell was at The Improv the other night we work together and he was fucking amazing I like the one of the best sets I've seen from him and he's always been amazing but God he was on fire and we were all it was me my friend Owen Smith and Tony Hinchcliffe we're sitting in the back room and we were watching Dave and we were in a trance we were just laughing we were letting him think for us you know I'm saying like he's doing all the thinking we're just on a little ride that Dave's taking us on this ride and as an audience member I recognize that there's a mass hypnosis there's a thing that happens well we all get into this mindset and if someone has like really well-crafted material like Dave Attell and they take you on that you let them you're like we the attenders gonna take us on a ride you know I mean you think the same thing happens a when a politician is speaking that's a good question for sure Trump has a lot of elements of stand-up comedy in his routines for sure a hundred percent if you watch his most recent speech where he's making fun of Joe Biden saying 150 million people were killed with guns he's like I looked at the first lady he's literally doing stand-up huh who does a very good job by the way I looked at the first lady like where all these bodies where all these 150 million people that's half the population like they just let him say nobody talks to him he's like hello Idaho like you're in Iowa Oh like he's doing stand-up so someone took it and they made a video saying Donald Trump at the Apollo and so they put him doing this speech with audience reaction from people watching stand-up comedy and laughing and a laugh track over it and it seems real it seems like he's a comic so he's what about Bernie Bernie for sure is a powerful speaker but I don't think he's not funny you'll say a funny thing every now and then race but are the same when you talk about like going along for the ride like they're doing the thinking for you such an interesting idea bright is a trustworthy person people trust him they see him up there he's not polished right the thing about Bernie it's like when he's saying things there's um xand there's us and there's you know quality there it's a different kind of polished Whitney is a polished performer yeah like he he's like a comic doing scat you know it's that that you know it's like a I'm telling you that's exactly what it is it's an amazing it's an amazing thing he's like filling in the blanks loading up his weapon for the next line that he's gonna throw and called crazy Hillary lock her up lock it stand up it's basically like he's doing stand-up that's why Biden is so fucked he's so fucked because he can't talk right he has a really hard time talking he keeps screwing things up and he and it's a real bad horse to bet on because he's an older guy you're still a Bernie guy I was moaning right I loved the guy I loved what he represents yeah look I don't know if he's gonna be able to get anything implemented but I love what he represents as a man who wants to do good for people that don't have much that's that's a sentiment there's a there's a quality to that that I think helps us as a community as a community of the United if we have this agreement hey let's see what we can do let's see what we can do to balance things out and to for the downtrodden for the people that are hurting concentrate on them and he's made that a huge priority of his life and always has and to deny that it's like look what he's trying to do I don't know if he can get any of this shit past I don't think anybody knows until he gets in there but the idea is we're saying we want better for people who don't have much yeah that's what he stands for and you can call it democratic socialism but but it's an idea the idea is like helping people just helping people helping people you don't even know wasting the world a little bit better place for the working person what's then the corollary what's the trump idea and why did it succeed bunch of pussies out there trying to ban free speech a bunch of pussies out there come on fuck America's number one fuck yeah fuck yeah there's also he doesn't talk like a politician you know he talks about China you go to them listening motherfuckers when they charge you 25 percent every yea more stand-up it's more stand-up right it's way more entertaining he's the most entertaining forget about value judgment of me on who he is the person without a doubt the most entertaining president that's ever lived and not even close there's not even a close second he buries all of them and he drags him into his fight even Hillary is now talking differently about other people she said about Bernie nobody liked him she would have never said that before Donald Trump she would have never uttered those words his victory over her is deep in her DNA now hmm and she's starting to exhibit some of his patterns yeah I saying nobody ever liked him how could you say that what kind of crazy of course millions of people like him they're voting for him millions millions of people to say nobody like him or nobody liked him in the sitcom course of course people like him and then they started writing I like Bernie whose hashtag I like Bernie start popping up like that behavior is a direct reaction to her getting pounded on by Donald Trump through the entire campaign all right so let me ask you this you've talked to a lot of people from all different realms in here right if we can agree let's say that being entertaining is a great prerequisite for qualification for being president if we can agree on that Jeff seems pretty easy yes very agree on what can be done whether it's in the political sphere the media sphere putting something in the drinking water to let people to encourage people to have a little bit more of what you're after whether it's compassion whether it's understanding whether it's balance whether it's moderation in other words why is the entertainment force winning right now and if you don't like that notion what can be done about it well the entertainment force is writ for whatever reason is being portrayed through Trump only see he's not a politician he's a guy who's a media star and he's been a media star for decades he knows how to manipulate the media he knows how to sit on the Letterman couch and kill he's been doing it for a long time he's very comfortable being in front of cameras none of those people have those kind of skills and nobody thought of it as a skill they thought of a politician being able to do their politician stuff well this guy's calling you crazy Ted or lyin Ted or you know lyin Hillary he just makes up names for sleepy Joe I mean and I'm smiling because it's funny because he's good at it he's funny he's good at it there's the problem you shouldn't have a goddamn popularity contest to see who controls thermonuclear weapons that's fucking stupid it's stupid don't allow people it's vote but it's existence but in the system we've got see that's what I'm asking you is what now well the system's only a couple hundred years old I know even this is this kind of I mean the way that these elections are because I don't think it was I mean if you look at lincoln-douglas debates those were actual debates it's two people it has evolved a lot but I mean let's say that you're not happy with the way it is and there's a lot of people even there are people who like Trump quite a bit on some dimensions who are very troubled by other dimensions so there's a lot of people out there who are open to like no let's let's try to adjust the thinking let's try to change their minds let's try to not be influenced as much by what we're being influenced by do you have any uh you have any pointers the the real problem that we're having is this tribal battle of left versus right the strongest voices on the left the loudest voices and the most extreme often times are the worst representations and the same with the right the loudest most extreme team members are the people at the front of the line fuck yeah we're gonna kick their ass like is that guy with me am I on this team fuck we had a war now we're in a war with the left I think that's what it is you know and um and there's also these ideas that we have that are cemented in stone that you know if you're a left-wing person you believe in X Y & Z this is your doctrine right there most of us have like a little bit of this yeah maybe you believe in the Second Amendment maybe you believe in the First Amendment maybe you think that maybe you know maybe we should incorporate a lot of things we do with Fire Department and you know and do that to schools and do that to housing and do that to make sure that all the the stuffs covered make housing like an important part of a civilization like for everybody we did a piece Freakonomics radio piece a year or two ago called America's hidden duopoly and it was about the Democratic and Republican Party basically acting like Pepsi and Coke right they kind of divide and conquer the market and they've built an industry that is incredibly valuable yeah the thing that's amazing to me is this Trump won the presidency as the Republican that the RNC most wanted to get rid of Bernie last time around was the Democrat that the DNC wanted to get rid of they lost by getting their candidate Hillary in this time Bernie who may very well become the candidate is again the party that the DNC is out to get so what does it say you've got a duopoly literally the machines running the system that we kind of let ourselves get manipulated into buying like you said I've never understood my mom my mom and dad were Democrats for a long long time typical Catholic okay maybe not so typical because they were former Jewish kappa typical Catholic working-class big family meat potatoes issues no-brainer that they're Democrats okay and then but my mom as a devout Catholic she started the local right-to-life chapter in upstate New York where we lived New York State had legalized abortion before roe v wade so she was fighting that fight early when that happened and the Democrats lined up against in favor in favor of legalized abortion she switched parties everything else about her was still mostly Democratic but she hadn't become a Republican because of life and that's a that's another powerful one but it's integrated into the right and it happens to all of us know we take there's one issue that kind of sets people off and then they have to join the team then they may you know with a lot of people I know it's a Second Amendment right people that are afraid of their house being broken into and they don't have anything to protect their family and they'd otherwise be kind of libertarian issue Democrats yeah and it's almost always guys who have kids yeah once you have kids and you think about someone breaking in your house and and doing something to your family you know you get real scared and then you want to get guns all right let me ask you a slightly different question it's actually totally different question as I'm sure you know if you look at any indicator of like prosperity longevity health literacy access to food etc humankind is way better off than it's ever been yes no without question on average there's still a lot of people with a lot of trouble there's still parts of the world that are still in bad shape and so it's trending in an amazing amazing direction why are we so unhappy I don't think we know how to manage our life correctly in life doesn't come with a guidebook it doesn't come with when you're in this condition seek out these remedies start exercising get together with your friends tell them you love them meet up and have dinner and hug each other sleep well sleep well drink water you know there's an whiskey a little bit of whiskey too right and also you know so many of us have a bad head start like you're starting off you know like how about your dad he'd been growing up getting kicked out of the family yeah I mean and then starts a family of his own well you don't even know your grandfather I mean it's madness right madness so you're you're coming out of this stressful pocket or maybe your dad goes to jail or maybe your your mom dies when you're young all these things that happen to people were they have this bad start right and then they develop defense mechanisms to deal with other insecurities and they get around similar minded people and you curse the world and fuck everybody and fuck the police and fuck to this and then you get in these communities of people that think the same way and then maybe there's gangs and maybe there's drugs and maybe there's crime and despair and sadness and it may be just negative people maybe there's none of the above maybe there's no danger it's just fucking annoying everyday people complaining about shit and you're stuck in the mud of humanity with people it's real hard to engineer 350 million people out of that but for yourself you can take actions to make your life better and if everybody did that if everybody took actions to make their life a happier experience by doing those things by exercising eating well hugging friends enhancing community just trying to be nicer to people everybody there would be a massive shift so let me ask you this I feel like the list you just gave is basically my list to write I try that's what I try to do pretty much and they all sound attractive yes so why is it so hard for so many people to do it because people are lazy and the reason why we're lazy is because it's very difficult for us to waste resources on something that we don't currently do and even though we know something to be true that if you do this long-term benefits are that but short terms like I want to do it right now right because your body like craves relaxation because it used to be a very rare thing to achieve alright so if you could pick one thing let's say let's say I'm a bird why would I pick one thing well the first thing I would say the first thing let's say let's say that I feel like you know what society says everything's great I'm unhappy financially okay why is exercise the one because your blood pumping right release natural endorphins and you legitimately feel better I know I also think of the I think about this all the time I think of your body as almost like the energy in your body is like a battery and it requires a certain amount of use and when you don't use it it overflows and then you get weird behavior and overreacting to things and you almost like get antsy you got to get up and move cognitively it's a big I find what do you do with let's say you have to take two long flights let's say you're unable to exercise for like you know 24 36 hours you're fine you don't have no I mean you you know you don't know how many days off yeah yeah it's fine mmm it's fine that the whole key is just to develop regular habits if you have to take two or three days off it doesn't matter the whole key is just regular habits what's your sleep regime oh yeah tells me every night how much I sleep yeah and how has it improved it has the feedback improved your sleep because it may be accountable yeah I was like I get like seven eight hours every night and I was getting like four and five and I was like oh you lying bitch so it maybe and maybe concentrate more on getting what we do to sleep better or sleep well it's just a matter of the time it's my what did you change like do you sleep with earplugs and I mask anything like I don't have a problem sleeping okay I sleep well you just problem is doing things and waking up early and I realize like okay if I'm gonna wake up that early I got to go to bed early yeah I really need to you're not a Napper no I don't know how come um I just never enjoy it really yeah you never tried it no I have no but doesn't work like when I'm done I'm done do you drink caffeine yes have you ever tried the caffeine nap do you know about yes yes yeah I know what it so you that's not my problem all right my problem is when I'm off when I shut down I shut down say what 20 minute nap becomes eight hours it's not interested I mean a horse I don't mean to criticize your now you're plenty productive plainly but is there's a balance there's a balance between being productive and being happy right and I think it's hard to find that balance because we look at like the the numbers that come in whether it's money or productivity or you know a number of things you've been able to create and you think of that as being like but look I can get so much done but if you maybe got less of those numbers but more of the numbers in terms of the amount of sleep you got you would enjoy the whole overall experience more I worry that uh I think for a lot of people who are successful in different realms could be sports business entertainment whatever success is intoxicating yes and then you want more event right and then it becomes very easy to see that as the main goal at the expense of loved ones other people I'm looking for I'd like to know how and I know some people do manage that really well and I know some incredibly successful people are incredibly generous in spirit to people around them but I find that's pretty rare I find that success often is driven by a sort of ambition that's a little bit unseemly and I'd like to know how to deal with that a little bit but it doesn't have to be but it seems like it would be if it's a number game right if success meaning like you're in a business you're trying to sell the most placards or whatever like whatever it is you know you have this thing in your head and like you're really driven just like you're selling placards you're already starting behind ok widgets alright you're selling the most widgets and you you have this goal in your mind of being number one and you're obsessed and you know and everyone's gonna tell your story Oh Bob he wouldn't let it go every time I got there he was in the office and he left after everybody but look now Bob's got a fucking yacht and he's also got a pacemaker right and Bob's ready to take over any minute now but also I think the thing is is in pursuit of success I think what often happens that I've seen in people I know and in people I don't know but I've read about is that your moral compass starts to shift now you're willing it's not necessarily true there's a lot of people that are successful and we're only talking about business right we're not about athletics are we I'm talking about thinking of some people in academia who you know even though the average person may not consider the stakes in academia super high but like if you get in a big university department and you start to write papers and get published and then get grants and accolades and so on you're on a trajectory that's very intoxicating and then all of a sudden I think it's uh it's more I think it's tempting or not even tempting I don't think it's even a conscious decision you start to make decisions that are not as sound not as morally acceptable as you would have made five years ago when you were starting out and I don't like I see that happening a lot I see it in media I see people cutting corners I see it in business academia I don't have any experience with but I would imagine that that would be particularly frustrating because those are the people that you call upon to be the objective purveyors of knowledge that are talking to you about this because they're dedicated to be an intellectual exactly you know what I think of as being a social how how strange is this though how strange is it that we talk about economists for just for one example but it's a good example because because they're the most involved in policy and so on there are democratic economists and they're Republican economists you know that shouldn't make sense right right but it does there's a list that when you're if you're a Republican and you win the White House and you start to assemble your Council of Economic Advisers you get the list of the Republican or the conservative economists now I'm not saying that's a terrible thing prima you know per se but the fact is is that like we said before if you're in the tribe if you're for one thing you got to be in for everything and that's not a good way of what goes on between the two parties ultimately you know in a lot of cases that we've experienced have been about perception like there's a difference between the perceived actions of Barack Obama versus the perceived actions of George Bush like even though like things that would freak people out about bush people didn't really seem to budge on with Obama like drone attacks right like a lot of people killed in drones attacks that were innocent and you know that happened during the Bush administration inhabitant Obama but people particularly on the Left treated the Bush administration's drone attacks very differently than they treated when Obama was doing it they seemed to like let it go because it didn't fit with their narrative of the evil you know military-industrial complex influenced president who only gives a fuck about money it didn't didn't seem to jive with that so they let it go and think because it's a team thing they were they were rooting for their team to be good so they listened my teams made some fucking slips up this year but I'm with the Yankees all the way yeah basically what you're doing you're just doing it for the demet exactly yeah if you're if you're watching a football game let's say you're watching a football game in a bar and you're with let's I'm a Steelers fan since I'm watching with Steelers fan we're playing whoever Ravens the minute there's a call let's say pass interference call the room divides equally because one side knows that it's a bad call and the other side knows and these are people who if you took them out out of a football context yeah totally gonna have different feel they're not going to experience everything in the same way and even if it's a bad call as long as it's for your team absolutely yes we got it and once in a while if it's such a bad calling site we get we got lucky there but all those it's amazing little fun in it right the triumph I agree and that's why sports again it's it's like a low-stakes you know replicas of life and war and all that stuff relatively so I'm totally in favor of that I am so I think it does show how kind of you know suggestible wheel are super suggestible in selves how strange it is that you could make this format like football you know a ball across the line represents a victory right and we've decided to like make huge amounts of money attached to this game and then fill up the biggest arenas we have we have enormous 50,000 plus arenas of people cheering when a ball goes across the line there was this story I read about some rabbi in Europe one hundred two hundred three hundred years ago something and he wanted his students at the C Shiva to just study more and when they would have a break they would always want to go outside and play football soccer and they called football and he would say to them you know I don't understand the treasures of Torah are so huge they're eternal why do you want to go out and kick around a ball and they said no no you don't understand rabbi it is so much fun it's got a little competitive we get X it's just great he said they said you know just come outside and watch it once and we think you'll see how it works and how great it is so this old rabbi comes out once at lunchtime and he's watching the two teams with the ball going back and forth they come back in after lunch and he says I think I've solved the problem for you if you get two balls instead of one you won't have to be fighting each other all the time over the one ball everybody could be happy so you know different ways of looking at the world yeah for sure yeah if everyone can look at the world that way the world would be a better place yeah it's um it's sports are for whatever reason the best escape for a lot of people because it's it's exciting and unpredictable and it's really happening whereas a movie even though it's an escape you know it's not really happening agreeing right you watch a sport man if a guy can make a fuckin 3-pointer at the buzzer and it wins the game and everybody goes nuts that shit's real like jazz turn to your friends everybody's so excited hey no wonder so this is the universal symbol for yes right but here's the one that also gets me the universal symbol for something great almost happened that didn't is this ah hands on their head everybody around the world where does that come from in the human head what kind of where in the code dictated that that's how we're going to express but everywhere around the world that's what they do that's a really good question yeah I don't have an don't know he's like my brain right now together my head still here what's your favorite sport to watch um I like fighting mm-hmm cuz I do commentary for the other side and I find them the rest of the sports to be boring I don't really watch other sports you like fighting because of the tactics cuz the action etcetera or is it because the personality primarily the excitement that comes from being insanely difficult it's the way I describe it is re for everybody's heard this a million times its high level problem solving with dire physical consequences so you know that they're on this this crazy path where one guy's trying to slam a shin and the other guy's face and the other guy's trying to do the same they trying to take each other down choke each other and and to lose is horrible and to win is glorious and everybody's cheering and then you know when it all plays out live the rush of these guys that these guys experience and then the rush that the audience experiences it's hard for me to watch like tennis mmm I get it I get it it's very athletic I'm not there's no knock on the athletes yeah and again I like playing pool so I'm watched a lot of dumb shit I won't get pool on YouTube every tale so so let me ask you this UFC let's say is I mean it's doing pretty well it's not it's not the bonanza it looked like it might be a couple years ago right business-wise the leagues forever is it is that right yeah so the athletes themselves I know the superstars do great what about the rest of them is it a steep pyramid and is it it's a lesser in the middle it's a less steep pyramid than boxing unboxing when you see the undercard so fights like if you see a fight like Manny Pacquiao Floyd Mayweather is biggest boxing pay-per-view fight ever huge fight right millions and millions and millions of dollars the guy's further down the bottom of the chain they're getting an awesome opportunity to fight in front of the crowd that's gonna see Manny Pacquiao vs. Floyd Mayweather and they don't make much money and that's the case in boxing overwhelmingly in the early stages of a person's career it's the same as MMA and then as they become famous they start making more the difference is there's a Floyd Mayweather and the closest thing we have to that is a Conor McGregor and maybe Ronda Rousey Floyd Mayweather when you people talk about money in boxing you're talking about Floyd Mayweather I mean maybe you were talking about Tyson at one point in time and Ali before him and Sugar Ray Leonard the guys who made the big money Roy Jones jr. but there's only a couple of those guys ever even in boxing it's the same thing with MMA there's a couple guys like Conor McGregor or you know a few superstars and once you get beyond them once you get to number 100 let's say well then you're trying to become number one it's not a thing that you're gonna have any sort of security doing right you know do you like that so that's what economists call a tournament model right which is where a lot of people are willing to enter it because the the winning is so high but you know that you're not going to make anything unless you advance a whole lot would you rather see MMA like that or would you rather see more like would you rather see it more like the team sports where you're at least guarantee you're on a salary right so NFL if you're the fifty-third guy on the roster you're not making a ton of money but you know you're gonna make money as long as you don't get hurt would you rather see MMA a little bit more like that would you rather see the the fighters have more of a league and have more leverage or do you like the way it's set up now fighters are always going to be individuals it's very difficult to get a fighter in a union that's why it's never been done although the PGA Tour is basically the Union for the got they did that that's what the golfers did and tennis is a little bit different but anyway I mean couldn't they do it if well now UFC has too much leverage I think for that to happen right even if they didn't it would be very difficult to get fighters to not jump in and take a fight because opportunities are rare and when a fight comes along if you say look I'm gonna offer you fight Conor McGregor for X amount of money and you're like I want more and they like look this guy standing right right right that's always going to be that case and you're Conor McGregor yeah and that's the business model that's always been the business model in boxing but in UFC it's different and UFC it's controlled by one company so they can force big fights whereas there's a lot of big fights in boxing so this is their justification for this structure that they have those big fights in boxing didn't occur and it frustrated the fans and the reason why I didn't curse is multiple promoters well under one banner you have one promotion that has the most fighters and the ones who and the best presumably and the ones who are the most popular make the most money the question is should the guys the bottom make more I think they should and I've always thought that because I think it's a very very very difficult thing and I think we should be trying to give them enough money so that they can do their best if we can see the best fighters come up I think one of the impediments of guys coming up is that in the beginning you have to work a full-time job as well as fight it's really hard to train it's hard to make that leap and if we get someone we could sign it I agree with you there should be some sort of a minimum and that minimum would we would agree upon something that would be sustainable if you're fighting we'll say once or twice a year on the other hand with twice a year at least okay especially the beginning you would fight you'd probably fight as many times as you can in the beginning you'd fight three times a year if you could four even and guys like Donald Cerrone even at the top still fights like four or five times a year just cuz he's a wild man so theoretically like if you're looking at at as supply and demand it seems that there's a lot of supply as fighters right it seems like there's a lot of audience demand but what UFC is doing is according to you kind of smartly constraining the supply so that the quality is high yes if you were to come in let's say you or ten other people were to come in with alternate leagues to UFC right now and take you know after the UFC as whatever let's say there's a hundred very good fighters right now we're 50 I have no idea but let's say you take the next 200 and make those other leads are you saying that would basically be what happened to boxing and then do end up when we are doing that ya know if you know but there's multiple organizations that actually are doing that there's one called Bellator that's huge Don the paramount Network its enormous and it's this the biggest rival to the UFC in America but still pales in comparison but there's world-class fighters there and they're starting to get people from the UFC that they their contract up and they're still in their prime and then Bellator comes with a better more track GOC ever and they take that offer also in Bellator they're allowed to have sponsors the UFC is solely sponsored by Reebok so the fighters of one sponsor that they wear the Reebok gear and do the athletes get a shake they get they get a share and I don't know how its structured but in the butt I know that the fighters prefer the Bellator model which is they can find their own sponsors and if they have good management company the management can get three or four sponsors on their shorts and they might make more money from sponsors than they do from the fight itself which is what was in the UFC so a lot of fighters were really bummed out when they switched over to a different business model so that I think probably better for fighters but then here's another thing those fighters have to enforce that they have to chase those down chase those sponsors down a lot of them go bad on you and a lot of them don't pay and there was a real problem with that with fighters where you know they would gotten fucked over by a couple different sponsors and it created a hassle and so so then you have fighters who didn't get paid but the sponsor did get put on UFC oh boy and thank you so is the UFC responsible like who's responsible for that and it turns out it's the fighters that are responsible but that's a fucking giant burden on them whether in the middle of training to try to go sue some you know fight gear company that didn't pay them their money I don't think it's a justification for not giving them the freedom to choose their own sponsors I think a better scenario would probably be have one sponsor available that you you know like everyone couldn't choose this sponsor or a competing sponsor you know like maybe something else so like you could have a Reebok guy that's fighting against a guy who's like some motor oil company yeah yeah bothering them it's like making it mandatory it takes some of the power we've got fighters for indigo so forgive my ignorance but getting back to just the actual fighting two fights a year it sounds kind of like standard three is kind of a lot for as a whole lot why part it would but I mean like I've seen fighting a little I've obviously I mean you look at me you can tell I've never known to myself but I mean like the NFL is hard right and they're playing 16 games a year plus preseason practice why why is it how how can it be that hard that you can only do it a few times you're adorable questions because the sport of hurting people yeah football hurting people is an accidental occur no that's not true not if you're playing online yeah but they're colliding into each other but they're not doing something specifically to knock you unconscious or you break your liver all right what are there's techniques that you're doing that are trying to fuck a guy's knee up I understand that but is it that you need three four five six months between to literally recuperate from the pain even if you win is that what it's about not just pain it's punishment there's guys there that their leg it takes Randy Couture he fought this guy named Pedro his Oh Pedro his oh is this Brazilian kickboxer that had the most devastating leg kicks maybe in the history of the sport he would slam his shin into people's legs and you could see them like visibly hobbled by it and Randy's leg was so fucked up from their first fight that he had to wait six months before he was fully recovered six months just from a guy kicking his leg slamming his shin to the thigh his legs were just chopped meat they were just destroyed all the the tissue was broken up there was blood inflamed his legs were swollen up I mean it's horrific I have to say you're reinforcing the validity of my decision to become a writer it's not a fighter it's a land rear it's exciting but not too exciting so why okay so I don't mean to sound even more naive than I've sounded now but like why why is that why do you choose the life of a fighter if it's that punishing well they do it this is initially they do it for self-improvement okay you get involved for self-improvement they want to learn how to defend themselves maybe they want to learn some self-confidence then they get excited about improving and they get better at it and then they achieve a level of expertise that makes them the person in the gym that is above the other new people that come in and then you get to experience what it's like to be an assassin you get to strangle people all the time and then you get to a point you like I want to test myself and then you say I'm just gonna take an amateur fight so then you take an amateur fight and then you go you know what I think I can do this for a living and then you think about being stuck in some fucking cubicle selling insurance or maybe making Conor McGregor money maybe I can get to the poor my I know how to talk shit I think I can hurt people I think I get in there makes them and I don't have to fight three or four times a year and I have a fucking boss no one tells me what to do I can talk shit and I can go out there and just do something that I really enjoy doing martial arts and just continue to be as good at it as I can to be a professional athlete it's attractive to us especially to risk-seeking young males or females that totally makes sense but let's say it's you let's say you're 21 years old you and you have the ability to do that right you're discovering that you have the ability to do that and then if you could project that decision forward let's say 30 years and say okay I'm gonna go for this and I'm gonna and I'm gonna factor in the probability that I'm actually gonna make really good money or have an amazing life changing or life-affirming experience for 10 years and then get out and do something else versus do that insurance cubicle job in other words you know it's kind of the short the high probability high-risk bet versus the longer steady one where you might have more of a center of gravity to have a family etc which would you choose and why well first of all why would only have two choices that seems I'm only giving you a fight I stopped fighting I was 21 because of I was worried about head injuries right it was too dangerous and when I was doing it there was no money there wasn't a UFC there if if you were making that decision now though with the money now do you think the decision would be different there was no UFC then so there was no but take 21 year old Joe yes I would have fought yes sure 100% right I definitely would I was excited by it right it was it was scary I was terrified but I also knew that I could get good at it and then while I was getting good at it it's it's a wild rush it's a wild crazy rush because it's so dangerous to do and the risk seeking those kind of people that are risk seekers the ones that do rock climbing and BMX bike running and BASE jumping that's a type of person there's whatever whatever reason that's a type of person and they gravitate towards those fights and they gravitate towards martial arts and some of them are the nicest people I've ever met in my life hmm there are some of the nicest kindest most interesting introspective people deep thinking people people that that read a lot they can talk to you about things that can be honest and personal about things they have a really good control of their ego because they're getting trounced in training all the time everyone's getting humbled all the time but you you're on the path of a professional fighter and it's a it's a very dangerous path and so there's an incredible camaraderie between the people that do it so there's they understand that very few people have the stones to do something like this or the nuts though or that you know the chaos in your brain or the insanity that lets you risk your life like this versus take that cube of yeah what for them it's insanely attractive what's the long-term health complications from MMA do we know a lot about it yet I mean we're learning a lot about football is any comments point yeah football is like a car accident these two giant dudes are slamming into each other and I tend to think that there's some impacts that I've seen in football that it's not recreate abble in an MMA ring because they don't have momentum you know yeah you're not running at each other but that said there's plenty I mean I've seen dudes get kicked into oblivion and women get kicked unconscious multiple times in one event and I've worked I don't know how many events I've called more than probably I have to say like 1,500 professional fights like easily somewhere in that neighborhood definitely more than a thousand definitely without question that's being real super conservative so out of those you know how many people can had like legitimate brain damage because of fights a lot of them yeah they know going in there that there's gonna be a risk and they've got to know when to get out and sometimes they don't and sometimes friends and family have to intervene and it's a scary thing to watch someone slide down that road when you know oh my God he's Chinee which means you can't take a punch anymore which means you're starting to develop some severe damage from all the sparring and the fighting and you got to know when to stop and if and some people can stop and they're fine and they're they can live a long healthy life as long as they stop in time yeah similar to boxing very similar in that way in there somewhere um very similar yeah I think maybe boxing is a little bit more damaged because all you're doing is punching you're not kicking the legs you're not taking each other down you're not choking each other so the cumulation yeah the accumulation of blows to your head might you might be able to argue that they get more but but then there's a guy like Floyd Mayweather who doesn't get hit at all yeah he's so good at not being hit he's probably been hit less in his entire boxing career of fifty victories in zero defeats than most MMA fighters in like in their entire light like tenfold yeah they think you know ten times we on him easily so imagine that I came down from Mars and I look at you know human civilization I think you know this makes sense this makes sense this makes sense this one doesn't make any sense well I was gonna use fights as an example what about the Coliseum I mean it's always been a part of humans right we've been interested in people beating the shit out of each other since the beginning of time yeah because it scares us so it's entertaining to watch other people do it that's why we want to watch a bar fight I don't want to be in a bar fight you know a lot of you want to be in a bar fight right but what the fuck is this really happening so a lot of the people who have turned against football the last let's say five or ten years fueled by the CTE which is obviously a legitimate thing we don't really know the magnitude and scope yet but a lot of people who've turned against it do it for a kind of moral argument that I don't want to support an endeavor where people are hurting each other period right how do you feel about that I mean should there's a libertarian argument to say what are you talking about people can do whatever they want they can do drugs they can go bungee jumping they can work stock trading which is stressful you know can you can do whatever you want so where do you lie on that well I think first of all they're right and you are doing something that's definitely gonna harm you however I feel like if you want to do something that you enjoy doing that's going to take some time out of your life that's finite anyway who the fuck am I to tell you you can't do that right am I gonna tell where am I going to draw the line am I gonna say no gymnastics yeah like we're managing other one you know you know soccer causes tremendous amount of CTE do you know that yeah losing the ball crosses sub-concussive trauma yeah just heading the ball causes a lot of scene I know a lot of youth leagues now are starting to cut out head yeah which i think is probably a pretty good it's a very good you should probably eliminate it totally it often it's not the ball it's the collision with you dying often yeah yeah but they think heading has a huge infant no know what I'm saying when you're going up for headers you're often you're knocking heads you're not gonna shoulder to a head and elbow and around on a field india clip you're gonna collide with each other where do you stand on paying for organs but let's keep going with this because we didn't even touch the surface of this I'm in favor of people doing what they want to do with their life if you choose to do something with your life away are we gonna take away race car driving because that's one of the scariest goddamn things a person could do not as much anymore oh no yeah but you know what this is I think fucked up do you see that recent crash did but the fact that we remember that so well one reason is because there have been so few since Earnhardt died back in whatever that was 2000 listen I had Dale Earnhardt jr. on his podcast and he want in depth about brain damage that he's gotten from multiple crashes he talked about the severe impact of the concussions he talked about the difficulty coming back and the different modalities a different medical treatments that he's had to have I that's Dale Earnhardt jr. this is after his dad is gone right this guy talked like really extensively on this podcast about his personal struggle with brain damage that he's received from car accidents yeah it's a fucking scary way to make a living yeah arguably more scary than fighting because there are guys like Mighty Mouse Demetrios Mighty Mouse Johnson who's like this Elite MMA fighter that barely gets touched there's guys like him that don't take any damage and then there's guys who are elite NASCAR drivers who wind up these crazy collisions and go sent through the air and they wind up in the hospital all fucked up the impact just the impact even if you're in a cage just your brain rattling around inside your head fucks you up and we're letting people do that and I don't think we should stop I think we should let people do whatever they want if they want to do they want to take a tightrope walk across the Grand Canyon and film it on YouTube I can't I'm not the guy unless it's over private land or public land and with there's a law against using it who are we to tell people they can't rock climb who are we to tell people they can't ski where do we draw the line yeah where do you decide a person can't do a thing I don't know you make a good argument I don't think there's a bad argument with what you're saying though and saying that it does cause us damage to people you're right by the way I'm a I love the NFL I would cry if it went away on the other hand and I and I know a few NFL will now former NFL players one of whom stopped playing in his fifth year way earlier than had to because he was worried about CTE but also he was getting a PhD in math from MIT at the same time so he had a plan he had an alternative but then there's another guy in combination he's anime you would you would you should have him on your show John Herschel his name is you are as CHEO okay we'll talk about a fascinating guy um there's another guy Dominique Foxworth both these guys happened to play for the Ravens which happens to be the team I hate most but I've gotten to be friendly with them Dominique Ross worth had a great money-making career because he kind of got his big contract and is whatever fourth fifth year well took out insurance on it then got hurt and there and really never played again so he banked enough money after that he went and got an MBA from Harvard because he's a bright and interesting and ambitious guy he will never let his son play football it's like you hear these stories about the guys who've done it who've made a life you know out of it and it just really makes me think about you're right everybody should have the right to do anything for their own livelihood or for their own excitement right on the other hand like if we had the Coliseum today per se like what we have is a modern version the Coliseum if we had the Coliseum per se fighting the Tigers slaves getting thrown in to fight the Tigers we don't like that it's like the line things are repugnant until they're not and it's hard to predict where that line is a lot of things that used to be not repugnant slavery fine the whole world if you had the ability to do it right and then get go straight back to the Coliseum that's the same thing it's like we have a line and whatever the cultural line is especially depending upon how many people died around us how much plague and murder and how much you know how much you're dealing with war that line moves yeah yeah right now people find it repugnant to use the plastic shopping bag so good and that's a dangerous argument if if it's not a good decision right because if you can feel like oh we stopped using plastic shopping bags therefore this is called moral licensing i-i licensed my because i've made it one good moral decision now i can license myself to do other stuff so i read on paper right like if you had a brain every time you go to the supermarket you have to bring a reusable bag right it's great on paper until you don't have a reusable bag and so then ya hyper bag and then it rains then your groceries fall in the street I mean that's the extreme no but these are I mean the problem is plastic bags if you look at the menace to the environment over all plastic bags are pretty pretty small part the danger is when people feel that they've contributed by doing something small and then stop thinking about bigger better things to do that's it's interesting too that we just accept an inevitable amount of litter yeah it's not because it's really a garbage disposal issue yeah right it's true if we have as how hard is it I know it's it's interesting because sometimes sometimes there's accidents right things fall off things blow down the street you can't get to them but there's a lot of that a lot of it is just a soullessness I agree I happen to play golf which I'm embarrassed about cuz like the area I know I grew up is the kind of person that looked at golfers like that's not my club when did you start like eight ten years ago I love it I absolutely love it it's also nice because you're outdoors for a long time you're often alone for a long time and another thing I really like about it is I get to be around other people often men in a way that you don't get to be around other men in that way you know what I mean it's like it's it's good for the it's good for the soul you know in a way yeah and I just like the competition it's a really hard game so I like trying to get better at it but um the thing that amazes me is how much crap there is how much garbage there is on a golf course and I'm like thinking it'll blow out of your bag and I'm just like I don't know I like nature Allah I don't like the idea of like candy wrappers all over so then I write I extrapolate and think bigger like you do plastic bags should it be that hard to take it home use it maybe once or twice again and then throw it away and I understand that they're less you know recyclable but you know we have a lot of landfill space but even landfill space that's where a lot of it goes you've seen landfill space with things are flying around the wind it's just like goddammit we it's hard to contain all of our garbage we produce so much crap it's true although much less per person weight weight wise than we did 50-100 years ago that's mostly this garbage used to be heavier well you speak rate technological improvements that are difficult to see while you're in the moment like if you go back and look at photos of Los Angeles in the 60s and you see the the pollution it was insane it was literally like there was a fire yeah right and now it's gotten a lot better it still sucks but it's gotten a lot of questions I wouldn't have gotten a lot better without let's say relation yeah we didn't Easter you've done it on the town no chance no they would accept it Clean Air Act which president don't I don't Nixon oh wow that's crazy go to Mexico go to Mexico City wild yeah like where we're flying in I was like holy shit that's real like crazy pollution yeah I took photos of them put it on Instagram like this is wild yeah you've been to China no never been shot bring your bring your face mom sure yeah yeah no I've seen videos it's um I'm hoping the technology catches up to our pollution at the same time we're emitting our situation by trying to be better with recycling but I'm hoping that someone figures out some giant building size filter some huge thing they put in this middle of every city and it sucks all the carbon it just seems like they're ridiculous there are so particulate pollution has gotten so much better in fact one wrinkle of climate change and global warming is that the particulate the soot in the atmosphere in the 60 50 60s and 70s was apparently what kept things a little bit cooler because they're refracted it sunlight in here thankful that's so so the irony is you clean up the air and you allow more warming exactly anyway there's a global warming is a very complicated issue yeah this is another example where when people reduce it to the headlines and then divide people into tribes it's exactly the opposite of what you want perfect example because it's clearly a right versus left thing to in some people's circles if you're on the right you're supposed to say it's exaggerated it's a hoax it's this it's that's not my concern my concern is jobs my concern is like UV repeat the talking points and if it's on the Left it's how dare you it's great a third I think the biggest that was a that was not the best creditor that was actually now that I know it's her it was not a bad imitation I think one of Obama's biggest mistakes he plainly wanted to address climate change global warming but he did it in a kind of standard left Democrat way by calling a global warming by saying that there were bad actors which is true the thing that astonishes me that Democrats haven't done is talk about it in a language that every Republican every conservative every hunter Fisher would respond to which is pollution which is what it is by the right right why why it became a conversation about a much bigger much more abstract much more difficult to understand and act on problem is strange to me because you know humankind comes together we came to look polio vaccine it wasn't like everybody was working on it but there were enough people concerned about it and then you had a president who said hey March of Dimes let's have everybody raise money come up with a vaccine and then interestingly you know Salk with the vaccine this is just interesting about the way medicine works today he basically said no no I don't want a patent I don't want to own this patent he could have become a billionaire right you know this was this is was this is the way we've have thought in our past as humans about solving big problems we seem to have gotten away from that a little bit and I think that's where to me that tribalism is the most dangerous it's not about the political charades I don't care about that I don't think that's particularly damaging where I think it's damaging is by dividing yourself into these tribes that are so exclusive and they have these purity tests what we're doing is we're actually diminishing our collective ability to come together to solve problems the good news is there's a million people out there at academic institutions and garages groups of one and two people who are working on solutions that are that keep coming you know human humans and cool species what I'm trying to say yeah we really are yeah yeah and I think it's interesting but Jonas Salk when he did create that vaccine the world was a different place and there wasn't this pharmaceutical industry that we have today that's you know has such a strong ability to influence the way people look at things through advertisements and just through the way the influence politicians we're is it's a different world so to compare the bounty that was awaiting Jonas Salk for coming up with the polio vaccine it's just a different word true the world's different didn't he like wasn't there some controversy that he didn't give credit to the other people that helped him with the facts yes there was and I don't okay with money but not good with given people I hadn't read this in a long time so I can't I can't speak to it but but even like I've been do you like Richard Fineman you know Richard Hyndman so so you know when he talks about I love hearing him talk about when he was drafted to work on the Manhattan Project and you think about it America was it was an existential fear yeah legitimate right sure I mean we wound up using it we didn't use it on us we did in DES and and when you hear Fineman talk about all the complication of that we have an enormous scientific challenge we have an enormous competition against the Germans we're trying to do the same thing and then even if we win then we have another whole challenge which is the moral challenge but but there's a way of thinking about those things and again what measuring the costs and benefits at people who would might disagree aggressively and they did about the Manhattan Project can sit down and say okay here's here's what we're gonna do what's what's the lesser of the two evils and I feel like right now I don't know it's as as much progress as we've had I feel we've gotten worse at looking at the lesser of two evils that looking at weighing costs and benefits well what is the lesser of two evils in that regard is it drop the bombs and stop the war or is the lesser of two evils never drop the bomb and stop the war later yeah I mean look there's a million books been written about this mmm I could make an argument in in either case I mean Japan we were very very scared of Japan Japan had shown a lot of ability to punish the United States even though Germany was ow America still felt very fragile so I I totally get the argument that it was meant to be you know I get it - yeah on the other hand you're picking some pretty big cities to drop it on and you're picking two so you know killing mostly civilians yeah yeah so it's hard to imagine that decision would be made today but as you just said about you know polio vaccine different different case but roughly same time Europe you know it's very hard to project your morals on two you know fifty years from now we may have a very different view about MMA for instance it's very hard to project it well that I think that's far more intense and extreme than MMA we were talking about nuking people literally out of existence but I think that just the fact that these brilliant scientists were forced into that moral dilemma like one of my favorite videos online it's Oppenheimer when he's discussing what he said when the first atomic bomb was detonated and he quoted the bhagavad-gita and he said I am become death destroyer of worlds and it's just to say that to see have you seen it the video um please let me play this for you play play Oppenheimer right after when describing what it was like because it's so eerie because here you have one of the most brilliant scientists ever who completed this fantastic project yeah the manhattan project created bombs that literally were nuclear weapons never happened before in all of human history as far as we know and here the guy that did it that knew that knew that that was going to be the death of untold amounts of people listen to this listen to what says two people laughed few people cried most people were silent I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture the bhagavad-gita Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says now I am become death the destroyer of worlds I suppose we all thought that one way or another doom imagine being that guy I mean here's the guy first of all was quoting the bhagavad-gita in 1945 little ahead of his spring pretty incredible or 40 it was 46 one of the when did they first detonate 40 the tests where I think 44 and Hiroshima and Nagasaki 45 correct somewhere in that range being this guy who you know he's just a brilliant scientist he's not supposed to be the guy who destroys a half a million people in one moment one brief flash of light and vaporizes a half a million people he he went to this school in New York City called the ethical culture Fieldston school which is where my kids went so Oppenheimer is kind of a patron saint for having the brains to do something almost unimaginable and having the ethics encouraged to know that what he'd done was unacceptable on some levels you know on the other hand but look if we're talking about costs and benefits let's think about nuclear power nuclear bombs as a deterrent against others down the road right so you have to say killed a lot of people how many lives did it save impossible to say sound like a Republican sir I know I know but I mean no to talk about then let's also talk about nuclear power which was the byproduct of this right and there are those who could argue and I would probably aid this argument to say that if the US had continued on the path of nuclear power in the 70s rather than totally flipping out after well after Three Mile Island then later Chernobyl which was a much worse accident at Three Mile Island if if that had continued what we'd have now is probably much much much cleaner cheaper safer nuclear fuel and instead what happened because we basically stopped building nuclear plants instead for the next 40 years we burnt crapload of coal that's been terrible for the environment for lives a lot of lives lost in mining coal but then the pollution and so on so you know actions have consequences what seems to be all benefit often has a lot of costs and life is complicated but I think the more wood that we can measure and weigh things sensibly the less screaming there is I just you know I love changing my mind I love hearing somebody make an argument that makes me say oh you know the way I thought about that before I see why I thought it I don't feel like a fool for having thought it but Wow now that now that you've laid out some facts and laid out some counterfactuals I appreciate the opportunity to change my mind I enjoy that I don't you well I think we're so often married to our ideas like our ideas are a part of us and we're losing if our ideas that we've been discussing or incorrect if our assumptions were incorrect it's a value judgment against us right you know I think the nuclear thing is interesting because I think one of the problems with what happened was the shitty design of like Fukushima where they can't shut it off it's freak people out rightly so and it's in there it's built in a bad spot it's like a little spa yeah and the back-up plan sucked everything's wrong and now they have this nuclear hot spot that they're you know it's gonna be like that for a hundred thousand years right there's a better way and they never had a chance to find that better way right because they've had a better way for everything else and the later ones the ones that they're operational now are far better than the Fukushima one and they could have gotten wait-wait-wait-wait-wait better and that is it's one of those things that doesn't seem like it makes sense like women nuclear is clean right it's fucking really clean it's really clean if it's done right and if they allowed them to innovate over those 40 years we would have got to someplace where it's like super efficient just like everything else if you look at a 1970 car yeah right and then you look at a car from 2020 how about a Tesla zero emissions right like maybe they would figure out how to really knock it down I mean something there are still a lot of people working on next next next next generation nuclear power including Bill Gates is involved in and including some that are working with using as fuel what's called spent fuel in a traditional nuclear act it takes care of two big problems at once right right right so look yeah yeah reason like be cheerful Bunker's filled with shit that's eventually gonna crack through the bunker and toxify everything around it maybe or you could also theoretically use that as literally as fuel yeah so you know that have you seen the thing where they've discovered bacteria in Fukushima that's adapting to eating nuclear waste no that's interesting yeah I'm pretty sure that's Fukushima pull that up bacteria that eats nuclear waste together they're discovering bacteria that life is so sneaky life just finds a way like those vents those volcanic vents right at the bottom of the ocean you like what are you doing here this sounds like the way you know CRISPR you know Chris Chris do you know this was discovered it was found the mechanism for that was basically these bacteria that we're living in some deeply inhospitable place like this radiation eating bacteria could make nuclear waste safer all right yeah where do we buy those like a Walmart you get what was the date you just highlight there James 2017 oh I think that's the different one but that's that's probably something they've been talking about but I think there was something recently where they discovered some bacteria that was eating radiation all right I got a question for you Joe Joe Rogan let's say that we collectively decide that protein is a really important intake for most humans but that some people either don't want to eat meat or they find that meat is too resource intensive etc etc but they also don't want to eat the kind of processed fake meat which is you know processed food etc and let's say that we decide that one of the best most available sources of protein if you develop it well as insects mm-hmm okay but that most people find that disgusting what do you do to make people less disgusted by something they find disgusting well with all these things I think it's very important to give people the opportunity to choose for themselves right especially with things they've been doing forever like eating meat people are terrified is someone coming along and legislating that they can't eat meat and then they disagree with this agree with this argument they have an argument that life eats life and that we've been doing this for thousands of years and that's why we became human in the first place and that Agriculture's allowed us to have these cities and yeah it's cruel to these animals but you what you can do it ethically and you can do it morally and it's not like they're gonna live forever anyway right so you can have that argument right but then there's a people that don't want to eat bugs well then don't eat bugs right but here's what if I hold on here's a thing for the people that do want to eat bug it's a good source of protein yeah and ethically we don't feel as bad about killing bugs okay really doubt we said an ashram once and I was actually I had a friend that was renting a place that the ashram had for rent so I'm hanging out with this lady who's a monk I guess I don't know how you would call her but she ran the ashram very nice lady but she had bug spray and I go why a bug spray she goes we have an ant problem there either getting into the garbage I go whoa I go do you understand what you're saying I go we're at an ashram and you're fucking spraying death from the sky on these little life-forms like imagine if she was running around killing kittens with a hammer right we would go no fucking way she'll I got this shit everywhere there the piston on my garbage I got to kill these fucking kittens right well to a Buddhist right spraying ants with bug spray should be the same as killing a fucking what an arbitrary decision right the kids making very arbitrary see many vegans slap mosquitoes right you don't just let him eat you there's there's a thing where we decide that an animal is not as valuable and big furry animals are the most valuable animals you know one of the horrible truths about mono crop agriculture and there's a video that a friend of mine put up on his Instagram page the other day about farmers this farmer was talking about like when I grow up acardo's you have to understand like you think you're getting this organic avocado and nothing else and I goes I have to kill thousands of Gophers thousands of them yeah he goes I'm gonna kill untold numbers of bugs he goes I'm spraying all this organic pesticide down that's gonna kill weeds he goes I'm fucking up the ecosystem I'm turning up the land I'm displacing all these animals all the places that I'm putting things on there should be wildlife I'm moving I'm heading getting ridden off I'm fuckin up this system and like that's a uncomfortable truth that if you even want to buy Lettuce which is the most harmless thing like oh I just plucked that head and you know I'll be fine no one's getting hurt no one's dying but they are because mono crop agriculture devastating and Inlet you are growing an organic garden which I firmly encourage people to do and I think that would be like one of the best solutions for community although a one argument against it takes a lot more land because the yield is so much lower yeah yeah it takes the Orlan but I'm not talking about for the entire city I'm saying like if we had blocks right like say if there was a block of people right and in that block there's one patch that everybody tended to do together right there was a community cuz my parents actually my parents are hippies and when I was a kid in San Francisco they actually were part of this co-op and we would go there and if I was interested when I was seven I didn't know that that was unusual right and we would go there and as a part of this university project that my dad was involved in and they're growing all these crops and I'm like oh this is kind of cool like you just grow in and it was in San Francisco's it was in the city itself had this area where we would go and it was all fenced in and people would grow tomatoes and different different vegetables and stuff and they'd learn how to grow and it was classes on composting and stuff like that people are composting their organic wastes and they would reuse it and that is something that could be done inside communities I mean we could it doesn't have to be that we have these giant swaths of land where nobody grows it you just take Central Park for example no an amazing Park I'm not saying somewhere near there I'm not saying grow veggies there but take it as an example of everything doesn't me have to be hardscaped right yeah Central Park is this beautiful part of New York City because it's this lush green patch in the middle of this urban sprawl so you have this urban city around it and then it's really cool to be able to go through that and to see the Ducks and you know does that sit by a tree and there's one duck in Central Park now that got like a plastic bottle ring stuck around its beak it's become a duck cause celeb have you eaten have you ever eaten insects like well yes whatever hosted fear factors I don't think there's such as roaches do gross people out more yeah but don't others is it because they're garbage eaters preserved because they've near humans that's the problem yes that's the ones that we hate you do have everything you have to appreciate their indestructibility though it's unbelievable yeah I mean if you were in if I were an engineer I think the road should be my like inspiration it's a special animal I mean it really is a special little creature it's figured out a way to live in every single urban environment yeah to live inside your walls inside your house and exist in your garbage is the rat essentially the roach equivalent or are all rodents clear because rats have technically carried things that have killed millions of people don't squirrels as well though now not real gum cuz they're herbivores they're they're not involved in those tight-knit groups where they spread diseases and I mean they could technically get fleas that could carry plagues and I'm sure they have you know they did that's where a lot of people used to get diseases yeah alright they'd get it Philly from a rat and they're right that was the plague right and they blamed it on the rats but it was really the bugs and I think that rats I mean if you ever seen the Netflix documentary no I got a long list from you got this look here's a lot of this number what to call and scrub rats all right it's a Netflix documentary it is amazing did they deal with this story I've read about years ago and I think this was insight on probably years and years ago maybe that's that might not be right about when you know there's a rat infestation this has happened throughout history it's happened in many places I know what happened in in South Africa not long ago either where the city will call for like a bounty say you kill the rat you people start breeding and growing extra rats is that in the film no it's not but I know that still of stories of incentives gone wrong because we do it you know isn't sunrise something yeah boys Oh gross yeah would you eat a rat yeah for sure mm-hmm have you specially if I was hungry no rain it's just me yeah no once you cook it and you put some seasoning on it I bet I'm afraid of a - coyote and what's your meat situation right now you're eating you're still eating mostly meat yes yeah mostly wild games yeah mostly what I eat is elk it's stuff that you've hunted yourself yeah yeah I just but I eat beef steak - right but I've been on this diet for the last like a couple months that's right basically just me what cut L see you eating besides me that's it no fruit no vegetables so what's that feel like just uh this is what's weird about it first of all it's weird is your energy levels that you have like without the carbohydrate roller coaster ride the spike of the insulin and the sugar and the the body processing it it's amazing it's just steadier you're saying you don't get the crash I did hear you talking about though feeling like you are more angry or aggressive in some ways you still feel harshly joking around about that but I was saying that you almost like have to work out more - I think it's just energy I think my body not having to process a large amount of carbohydrates particularly not vegetables vegetables seem pretty easy but they they do like if I eat a lot of vegetables I do get a lot of gas thanks Sharon don't yeah yeah but then everybody gets you not all vegetables some vegetables are super gassy the Jerusalem artichoke is I believe the gaseous veg well it's really dependent upon your personal digestion such a yeah for sure I mean for people that are your gut biome sort of dick writes what you what's what happens and since we're on the topic what happens to be more gaseous vegetable oh I don't know it's when I combine a bunch of them together I'm sure it's usually when you combine protein and vegetables together that you get the worst reaction yeah but the point is there's none of that with just me it's so what's your duty breakfast turn yeah what ends it depends on the day today I did what you have today I had six eggs and I had four pieces of bacon okay let's breakfast lunch then I haven't eaten anything since okay we should say we're p.m. local time yeah I had work out and I hung out my dog went for a walk with him rained and came here due to podcast right and you're gonna again today yeah what do you have I'll eat meat right just but just to play to meet then yeah yeah does it get boring because I love me but I can't imagine that it wouldn't get a little it does not it took the it gets boring if you think it's boring but it is delicious food if you have it every day you get bored because you have too much delicious food so I think it's really a perspective issue and it's also the health benefits that I've found like just the the way I feel the energy level and mental clarity it's very interesting like there's something going on with mental the struggle that you have thinking about things when after right after you have a big meal you know that mashed potatoes and pasta I'm so dumb I'm like 30 IQ points dumber for sure that seems to not be an issue when you are on this steady diet of just eating animal foods butene because your body your body creates its own glucose through gluco genesis where it breaks down the protein and creates glucose and as long as you get enough fat that's what's really critical you can get to lean whether the meat is to lean you don't have enough fats your body doesn't have fat to process and that screws with you yeah now what about the things that are in vegetables that are not in me nutritionally are the question are they significant enough to either take supplements or to worry about what do you do that's a good question I take multivitamins and take an athlete's pure pack that's like us a bag a little baggie filled with multivitamins then I take glucosamine and chondroitin I take a bunch of other different things fish oil I take quite a few supplements and again I'm not telling people to live this way don't do it what does an all meat diet do - your stool if you don't mind me asking um it reduces it mm-hmm yeah because mostly you're using if you eat eggs and meat you're breaking it down your body uses a lot of it there's no fiber right and because there's no fiber which is probably the biggest argument against the diet yeah when you look at research for the benefits of fiber brain the research is weird right because it's epidemiological it's all like how much vegetables do you eat how many instances of colon cancer let's quarrel it what's why all that stuff is very very very reliable yeah it's very weird so there's a bunch of doctors that are currently like and I use the term in air quotes that are promoting the carnivore diet okay and seeing positive results with it and getting a bunch of other people that achieve positive results the big one is autoimmune issues people that have severe skin issues right eczema is a big one that seems to be cured with an elimination diet which is essentially what a carnivore diet is right if you eliminate all those plants and all those carbs yeah I mean maybe the plants are fine but maybe it's the sugar and maybe by just eating me and your body is one thing to concentrate on it can relax a certain amount of the inflammation that you're getting heads as brett has there ever been a population that's been studied at least quasi scientifically that's had a mostly meat diet for a long time Inuit yeah and and what do we notice I Inuit what do we know about cancer longevity and so on I don't know it's good question Inuit apparently now suffer and one of the reasons why they suffer is the introduction of alcohol and tobacco and you know cigarettes yeah yeah and also you know just Western life the foods change so you look at those communities it's not the same community as the ones that were just eating seal and whale blubber and eating whatever they can get ahold of the Masai lived for a long time on milk and meat and blood and they were very healthy milk from what animal from cows okay they're they're cattle herders let me ask you this let's say that we just let's say you and I run like America for just a couple days and uh and we decide you know what of all the things that people do that's not good for them that we feel is a good idea to get rid of right especially if we're going to be having a little bit more socialized medicine right so you're paying my taxes on of all the things that we should maybe you know ban would be sugar right because like there doesn't seem to be that much nutritional benefit to sugar people like it but it's demonstrably bad on a lot of levels how would you do that let me ask you this why the inclination always to ban thing no I'm not I always go to the extreme just to show so that it was always ban the word banned the food ban the the action it is a sport because we're not very good at regulating honestly because we kind of vacillate between an all embrace and I hate look I think the best example of how bad we are this is with vaping it's like vaping in this country was handled very poorly yes there were the deaths which were mostly as I understand it black-market THC pods you're right Perry just ran over this entire thing okay ecig arrests are they might get you addicted to nicotine which may be a bad thing although nicotine per se not a bad thing in moderation in fact it's used clinically people have been using it it's a new trick yeah yeah okay but the UK did something very different with e-cigarettes when they saw people 10 12 years ago starting to use them they said Oh people want this we can either say no you can't have it we'll make it illegal in which case there will be a black market and they'll get stuff that's probably not so well made or we can try to deal with it in a responsible sensible way and what they did is they allowed e-cigarettes with about 20% as much nicotine as are in the unit's the United States so what you don't have in the UK is a bunch of teenagers who are now addicted to nicotine who never would have been smokers you also don't have a whole bunch of counterfeit THC pods in the UK where people are dying so to me banning is almost never the solution you look at prohibition I mean prohibition is actually they're wrong but do you understand the hustle what would happen behind the whole THC ban this is this is why it's Yves aping Bailey excuse me the the vaping ban after they peak the people died from the THC they knew that those things had nothing to do with it they started blazing cigarette seabright they start blaming is because they were trying to introduce a tobacco based ISA Guerette right and it was all about the company that bought out the Joule Joule cigarette which was a very popular one right in order to kill it they were just trying to kill the business and then they passed this they're trying to pass this rather legislation against flavored tobacco right all they're trying to do was clear the room for their business their business being and Adam Curie laid it out brilliantly it's it's shocking how well it worked in he said it's basically the tobacco version of who killed the electric car yeah it's a sneaky backroom deal and they hoodwinked people and next you know you're oh I don't want the kids to be smoking dreary vapor right and really they're just clearing the way for this tobacco flavored bullshit because it's made with tobacco right this is the only stuff you can have this is yours it's like doctors smoke camels it's really like those goddamn commercially aware yeah that's what's going on so it's really just a sneaky business move and we're all like I don't get it like how the fuck are they gonna ban vaping with cigarettes are still legal you're talking about something that kills 500,000 people every year in this country alone they die of premature death due to tobacco use and you're not gonna be on that be gonna ban that flavored smoke that didn't even have anything to do with the 10 people that died from the nicotine or the the tip team would say vitamin e oil you're also gonna drive a lot of smokers who are trying to quit smoking back to cigarette that's right that's the osseous stuff sucks yeah yeah people are mad I can't even have strawberry anymore I'll join the strawberry right and a lot of smokers who take up vaping to stop smoking they specifically don't want tobacco free yeah it's too reminiscent of the cigarette so you just want that hit were you ever know yeah just by never had any nicotine never Oh nicotine is an interesting drug oh I've had it I've had cigarettes when I've had a cigarette with my friend Tony Hinchcliffe a couple of times before shows yeah and Dave Chappelle smokes and that when I do shows with him I'll steal one of his cigarettes and if you don't smoke one cigarette I'll get you pretty good right you don't just get high you get like like race jittery no no it's like your brains firing like pow it's one of the things that Stephen King said about quitting that really bothered him was it was great that he cleaned up the habit and stopped doing it but the the firing of the synapses like he misses that when I wrote my first book I was a smoker not a heavy smoker but I smoked and I was living in the middle of the Catskill Mountains beautiful place by myself middle of the woods whose grades from man total as a romantic writer store it was romantic if there had been someone else with Nicole it's a romantic writer store is great I love the Catskills by herself even better the house I bought even though I didn't know when I bought it it used to be owned by this guy named Anton Otto Fischer who was a painter and an illustrator he was German ran away from home had an abusive father this was in the 1910s or something ran away from home in Germany became a sailor talked his way onto a ship got to America I think fought for America in World War one on a ship and then he became like the preeminent maritime painter in the US and the in the decades maybe between the two wars and maybe after he then got married lived in New York and had a kid who was had what do you call it not tuberculosis not emphysema what's the old one where you need to get the clean air fresh air you know they'd send people away no it's something we would know it's it's a respiratory saying okay right and the catskills had this clean clean air so they went there he built this house and it had he because he was a painter but also because he spent so much of his life on ships he built this studio his painting studio that looked like a little ship with this great window looking out over the Catskill Mountains that's the house I bought to write my first book it was unbelievably I was so I could focus for like 14 hours a day 16 hours a day writing but the reason I was able to focus so well was because of cigarettes I'd write for about 28 29 minutes total focus go outside smoke the nicotine which is reset all the focus it was an unbelievable drug but it's a terrible delivery system I've heard someone recently say I heard a kind of reluctant Trump supporter say the same thing about Trump that a lot of the things he's doing policy-wise especially foreign policy or economic policy really they like it so they say he's like he's like a cigarette like the drug is good the delivery system is absolutely terrible now how is the vaping did you switch with never but no I quit smoking a long time ago although I quit you know it's interesting I wrote in my first book my family memoir about the Jewish Catholic family I wrote in there not that I was a smoker but that there's one instance where I stepped outside with my brother after this intense moment and we had a cigarette and a few years later the book had been published I was buying for the fruit I was now newly married and I know that you're supposed to buy life insurance and so I got this insurance broker and he knew my name he said oh I read your book I said oh that's that's great glad to hear and then we started to price out the insurance and he said you know what do you do are you a smoker I said no not a smoker because I'd quit a few years earlier and then he called me back and he said you know I read your book were you stepped outside to have a cigarette with your brother all of a sudden I got the smoking rate for life insurance even though you quit yeah even though I quit because you used to smoke yeah oh yeah oh so you smoked at all well that's not what I thought he asked me to are you a smoker I said no cuz I'd quit but anyway Dave isn't there like scientifically like this there's a certain time window where your lungs of they also say so so this message I would say is really serious for anybody even if you've been smoking 40 years they say if you quit your lungs can actually recover it greatly so it's worth it yeah smoking is I hate to say it I think smoking is a terrible idea it's a terrible idea there's no answer on the other hand this vaping replaced the feet like Adam curry switched to vaping yeah this crazy contraption one of those guys is in there really complicated you know Garage remote control looking vamping things that he's into those things and you know he quit and that's how he quit so the best science at the moment says that vaping is almost certainly much better than smoking yeah because they don't know all the chemicals and all the damage potential damage that vaping may or may not do but they do know the damage it's cigarette combust combustible cigarettes and all the chemicals there are demonstrably pretty bad yeah so even though like you said we were told doctors do it this is the best we were told the same thing about sugar sugar gives you a great boost and so on it's awful but again my take is if you want to smoke go ahead well but wait a minute I live in a finite life oh wait a minute let's say now we are talking about who pays right so this is gets back to the externality thing if you smoke and I'm paying for your health insurance as the tax payer don't I get to have a say it's a very good question and how far should we extend that because if you're fat should I have to pay right you keep eating why do you keep eating right okay if you if you don't sleep well and you're prone to heart attacks so am I supposed to pay right now you sleep more you know there's there's so many variables are you a guy who rock climbs well what have you fallen break your leg I have to fucking pay for that there's a lot of variables so you got to wonder about when you you start breaking down how much how much assistance people get based on their life choices but the way to do that is to is to price it and this is where economists are really useful you know even though they sit down for the individual and punish them for their behavior not punish them tax them charging them right if I want to be a rock climber and a smoker and and everything but I get free free health care then there should probably be a premium or I should probably pay into a little fund that is a free if there's a premium well it's never look health care is not never free right no no even in Scandinavia it's not for its free to the user at point of purchase yes but no it's expensive and that's what's hard na VIU's done well we're talking about the user that right we're talking about the user having to pay a premium but you're right you're already paying your taxes let's say you're paying twenty percent total tax whatever that goes into the healthcare but then additionally right you theoretically know this can be hard to regulate behavior because again where do we draw the line it would about BMX riding what about people would do this and that there's a lot of things that people a sitting US tax well how much the parents have to pay how about driving in a car yes well the scariest right how about so many things we should just all sit inside with helmets and watch YouTube about CrossFit how much you got to pay you want to do CrossFit you know well then then we got to measure the benefit to CrossFit right you're building up your body you're gonna live longer well that's positive and you're also probably hanging out with lunatics like you who are riding you know crazy vehicles right so I'm a kind driver but I think that CrossFit the benefit yeah is you're getting in shape so that balances itself out as long as you do it intelligently you're involved in athletics but should we reward people should they pay less so if someone does yoga three days a week we supposed to make them pay less I mean I think you get into some weird swampy area and people start Juke the system the same way when you know people got paid for rats they let rats loose and then fucking kill them because people are gross yeah but we're improving again as a species yeah let's not lose sight of that it's good news I'm an optimist yeah yeah 100% glass-is-half-full yeah yeah have you ever tried to turn other people into an optimist and then successful no I don't think I think it's real hard to turn a battleship yeah I mean if I've made a incremental push in the direction I've moved in one or two degrees to the right over time maybe it'll change their direction but the reality is you got to want to change yourself and sometimes someone's inspirational words could be the thing that you needed and that sets you off on a good path and then you do make change but for the most part when someone comes to you and tells you you have to change it's really hard for people to accept just like you were talking about in your episode on changing your mind right which I really loved but I'm sure that a lot of people who've listened to this podcast or who watch this podcast have you know drawn in the both the X and implicit optimism yes for sure but in China the specific reaction with them right I haven't havin a specific interaction where I got them to change changing because they're hearing me but they're also probably hearing a million other people they're hearing David Goggins and Cameron Haynes and you know fill in the blank all these different people that do incredible things and they go why I gotta fucking do something with my life I gotta get my shit I gotta stop drinking soda I got to stop doing this I got a you know I got a just just starting healthy taking vitamins maybe not one workout class a week just one start with yours also though I guess a danger I don't mean to be a downer because I'm an opportunist I'm an optimist too but the downer the danger potentially is that and this relates to suicide so you know suicide is a little bit of a mystery because it's such a tragic thing if it affects someone that you you knew or even you know even people you don't know it just seems like such a drastic solution to a problem that is hard to imagine right but if you look at suicide rates through history and around the world there's a lot of variance but there's one trend that's pretty strong which is suicide rates tend to be higher in countries with more prosperity which would seem nuts right you would think that if your life is kind of very very difficult on a kind of Maslow's hierarchy level right not enough to eat worried about paying ran or being safe that you'd be more likely to be suicidal but it turns out it's it's generally the opposite not always and what one suicide ologist deduced from that or the kind of theory that he came up with it's he calls it's the no one left to blame theory of suicide which is if you live in an environment where let's say you've got a spouse that's cruel to you or you've got a terrible work situation or you live somewhere where the government is repressive whatever you can always kind of see a light at the end of the tunnel and you can say that you know when that problem is done my life will get better but if you live in a society like ours where you've never had to worry about having enough to eat you've never gone too cold or too hot where you're surrounded by prosperity and you look around at everybody else and like they're not depressed and you think what is it it's me the no one left to blame theory and that's one argument for why there's like right now is a lot of teen and young people suicide in a country like America where the riches are the prosperity is boundless have you read Jonathan hates work yeah yeah so his take on that is that these kids are experiencing social media and they're experiencing this addiction to the Internet and this cruelty that they experience the bullying the meanness the coldness and that when it's targeted on people and when they're losing their position in the social chain and they feel left out they don't have the tools to cope with this they're developing minds and this is the reason why you're experiencing this uptick that's directly correlated to the invention of the iPhone and the invention of smartphones the invention of social media applications is there's all sorts of correlations where you see the inventions of these particular things that have changed everything and then you see the uptick particularly with girls particular girls in suicide and you see them trying to keep up with the Joneses and this this feeling that they're inadequate or the judging themselves against girls that are you know supermodels that are photoshopped and they just feel inadequate I hear you know that we have to be careful about correlations proving causation because it's really tough because I totally hear you on it it looks like they both travel together Yeah right on the other hand history is full of correlations that looked good you know we were talking about polio the vaccine earlier polio for reasons that are still not understood by the way because they never really figured out the disease they just figured out a vaccine they never figured out what caused the disease but it turns out that polio would always spike in the summertime so there were a lot of theories maybe had to do with being outdoors so parents would keep their kids indoors maybe it had something to do with swimming pools people keep it out of swimming pools but then there was one theory that what else happens in the summertime that doesn't happen in the wintertime ice cream consumption so there was a theory for a while that always caused by ice cream on paper the correlation looks pretty good so I'm saying look Internet and depression and suicide are a little bit more complicated than ice cream and polio but it's hard to tease out effects for sure no you're right but it's also hard to ignore the effect of social media on people's self esteems people are addicted to phones people are addicted to likes it's a real occurrence it's also been engineered in order to attract the most eyeballs and the best turns out the best ways to get you outraged I agree but again just to bang the same drum again and again where there's agreement with you where there's costs you got a look at the benefits and this is what I hate about politicians is they'll talk about a policy that they like they ignore the costs they talk about the opponents policy they ignore the benefits so with social media for instance I know a kid a boy who was a friend of the family who if he were born thirty years earlier and there were no way to connect with people other than in person or phone whatever he would had a very disconnected life yet he just had some issues with with doing that with kind of in person he kind of you know behavior that's a little bit on the spectrum just would have been very difficult as it turns out because of the digital revolution he was able to build a community that is unbelievably good for him are there downsides to these things absolutely but you know you got to look at the benefits oh I do I do and I don't know I mean we're adapting I think human beings are adapting to a new normal and the new normal is constant connection with all the people around us all the time if we so choose to engage and leave our from so choose the problem is when it becomes more invasive than that right now it's if we so choose to engage but if we get to some point we're wearing something that right for transmit stuff into our brain or where someone's wearing us or if you don't if you don't do it then you can't be a part of this corporation because we're about succeeding and this is the best way to succeed is to connect yourself to the network to uptick your bandwidth so that you can keep up with us come on Steve what's up you know I mean it's team let's go team you know and then next thing you know you're wearing the fucking Hat the headband are you are you optimistic about the future in a general way though people are awesome great time to be alive I love it I love people how only a lot of people love people how old do you want to live - that's a good question it's not how old I want to live - I don't want to live 300 years in an agony and pain right I want to live a healthy life as long as I can I don't know when that when you know what a given how old you are now your health now in the state of science and technology and medicine now and where it might be in 20 years would you like to be 120 and be interesting if if I was functional all right if things worked I don't want to be a prisoner to my shell but I think that people like Aubrey de Grey where I had on last week who's fascinating character he believes were 3 to 5 years away from a giant breakthrough and that one that giant breakthrough house this is my concern the haves and the have-nots will never be more separate than ones there's some sort of innovative technology that allows you to live forever but it's a thousand dollars every week or something like that yeah but history shows us that all technologies most technologies start out very expensive read and almost all of them get really cheap really fast you know Douglas with that greed with that biggest wall street phone on the beach right and digital era even more social leverage is accelerated so my thing would be but here's the question would there be too much of an insurmountable head start from the people that are used in that technology or enough right transitional generation two sets of the technology okay they have the life extension technology or the age reversal technology which is really talking about and then on top of that they have the things like what Elon Musk wants to do with that a neural link yeah or some more advanced version of it or the next competing version of it what what if both of those things are highly expensive the amount of head start that a wealthy family would have over a poor family that just has to go out natural fair enough but in the in the scheme of history we're just talking about the blink of a couple generations with your transition if you want to be marred and cruel and just look amber's to me the alright to me the harder question even is whether immortality is desirable or even if like 200 years because you know there's something about scarcity that produces euphoria or at least desire right so I sometimes think that like every day feels precious because you know there aren't that many of them and if I know that there are 300 years worth yeah I wonder well that's all scale right 300 years if that was normal right fine yeah yeah okay I'm gonna be so wise on the 250 and then I'm gonna settle down over the last 50 years I mean that's I mean people could really think like that I'll eat vegetables only for that one year between 250 and 250 yeah I I think what we're used to is a hundred years if you're lucky that's where we used to yeah so the idea of 120 is like whoa is that real he thinks it is and he thinks that yeah probably looking at people that one day in the future will live to be 300 years yeah I do worry I do think about this so like you know retirement is a relatively new concept is only for the last like 80 hundred years and you used to work yourself pretty much and then you die and I do find that a lot of people get lost after they give up the thing and it's a it's a you know it's an it's kind of a rich kid problem you know could be a listen time it's like a sadness problem people need a task and I think when people are just waiting around for death to come knocking on their door they do get really morose and they just don't feel good they don't feel productive so don't deal so one thing with old people they don't feel helpful yeah well that's the thing they say the single best if you're feeling down generally about yourself the single best thing they say you could they as though there's some quorum of they who all agree on everything but a lot of people say the single best thing you can do and this was in our loneliness episode as well as service helping other people so do you have you run across anybody that you've interviewed who you thought had a great kind of prescription for how to help other people like doable sensible you know that if people really like let's say I say you know I work hard I try to love the people around me but I really want to have some kind of service component but I don't know what to do good question I think first start with the people around you right start telling them you love them hug them enhance the sense of community that you share with your friends and your loved ones do your best to sort of be the person who steps forward starts it off you know like makes an action tell someone how much you care and them I care about them and appreciate them when you maybe wouldn't have done that ordinarily you can do that we can all do that and we've all had it done to us and it feels amazing when someone comes up to you out of nowhere and goes hey man I just want to tell you I really appreciate you I know I know sometimes we don't talk to each other that much but when I do I really enjoy it I just I love you give me a hug I just want you to know yeah I'm very fortunate that I have a lot of friends that do that kind of stuff I have a real supportive group of friends and if you don't you long for that and I think that's a big thing become that person reach out and try to try to start that I can't imagine anybody hearing you say that would disagree it's like such a obviously good way to be and yet and yet I find that so many people kind of go out of their way to not just be generous cuz they're scared there's not scarcity they think that they have they have to make it and that if you make it like zero sum they're a loser yeah it's famine thinking it's real real real calm our hardware is the same and our software is not and we can manipulate our hardware we just have to understand what the patterns are and also been there you have to make mistakes you've been there you feel it you understand what it is and then you have that time to adjust that's why losing in life is so important whether it's getting dumped getting fired losing a game loot loss those feelings where things didn't work out your way that's important because it lets you know this is the bad feeling that comes when it goes wrong and you improve and then it makes the good feelings of victory all the better and I mean that you know in a relative sense like even getting good at something forget about victory like making a terrible book that gets rejected by every publisher and then writing a really good one and people accepting like fuck I got better yes like this thing yeah those feelings of failure are really critical for your motivation that's interesting I've always thought of failure like or like like a yeah failure or just like a bad event I've always thought that they were good because I'm like a scaredy cat in some ways right and then if the very bad thing happens the very thing you feared happens right you survived it and then you learn to shed more fear in more directions you know what I mean well so I could look at it that way look there's a lot of ways you could look at bad events you can tie a bad event is just who you are and you just have bad events and you're a fucking loser and life hates you and God hates you and a hook look at that happening to Mike again can't fucking believe it there's a lot of guys who go through life like that and you know they could say that they seek comfort in lowering the standards that they expect out of things so when things go bad and they say look I fucking knew it for them alleviate some concern about what's gonna happen in the future because the future is always dogshit so by doing that they've taken away the fear of exceeding the fear of overcoming the fear of improving the fear of getting better as a human being yeah if you just exhibit the same patterns you fall into those patterns whether it's alcoholism or gambling addiction or sex addiction people fall into those because they're customed to it it becomes a normal part of your life I think that's a scary thing for people to recognize that they're on a bad pattern and to say okay I have to stop drinking how do I dress yes right what what steps do I make and what's the best way community yeah they've shown 12-step programs you get together with some other guy and he goes look Mike iced drink too much to where we're just people we can help each other I'm your sponsor now and they work together that's and I think those yeah though that solution is a really good solution you know I have three brothers all older I'm the youngest of eight and I don't mean to disparage them and I also know you're younger than me but I kind of wish you'd been my older brother it would have been really good maybe I've been sucking up pussy come on man stop crying yeah that's okay yeah now that bit of that we're not sure I have a sister I don't have a brother but you know having conversations with your brothers and sisters sometimes they're the only people that really know you like I have conversations with my sister sometimes she's the only person that really knows our childhood right we'll talk about what it was like when were nine righthand and do you have the same perception of events yeah my sister super honest right and she's but I mean you remember you remember yeah yeah yeah yeah she doesn't distort anything right we both have real similar recollections of our past so it's uh but but those people that have experienced those things with you they're like the only ones who really know you deep at your core and the more things you can experience with people the more you're going to share that sort of but them people that make me sad are the people with no friends and no confidence they have no one they could talk to there's no one that knows their secret said they have no one that they could tell a terrible joke to and that you would never say in mixed company right there you have no one who you know this especially comedians we're the world famous for it we say things to each other all the time that are the most horrible things and just to get a rise out of each other you know like one of my friends will say something terrible to me on my back like about me like horrible shit about me and I just think it's so funny I'm like do that so that is what I look like we're so accustomed to it and there's also in our culture there's a currency of being able to joke around like that and of course physically if somebody makes one of my friends makes fun of me it's hilarious it's fun we do it to each other all the time there's actually like a currency and be able to take it to like you can make fun of Andrew he doesn't give a fuck it's not good you know that's what people you know I mean you're in the business and making fun of things if you're mad at someone makes fun of you it's not good in our world yeah all right I got to learn I got a lot to learn from you I have a list things I'm gonna look up and watch things I'm gonna read I think we should all be concerned about each other sensitivities but we shouldn't Cano people yeah and that's the difference between compassion and just full-on Nerf in the world you know you can't nerf the world and you and and when you stop humor like you nerf humor there's a real problem with that cuz it's fun it's fun when people talk shit talking shit is fun it's interesting to me how comedy is like the last place in society where you can actually say stuff yeah come to the comedy store we still see ya ridiculous shit ya know and it can't happen in the media it can't happen in politics yeah that's the art form though it's like I was talking about Quentin Tarantino's new movie that um Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and now he's sort of grandfathered in because there's scenes yeah violence in that movie against women they're like if a new guy came out of nowhere and he was didn't have a track record yeah and he had some woman getting her brains bashed in on a fireplace yeah why yeah what the fuck is this but when you go to see a Tarantino movie you know exactly what you're getting into you're getting its mad that's chaos and we survived you ever seen porgy and bess what is that porgy and bess George Gershwin musical from the 1920s I guess once upon time in Hollywood no not at all but it's a couple of white guys writing about this african-american community in the like coastal South Carolina or Georgia and it's this drama so it was written as a Broadway show and as an opera - and I saw it at the Metropolitan ah I don't go see a lot of opera I saw this recently and it was very very good it was incredibly moving even though it was opera which wouldn't seem to be but it was so unbelievably against everything we think about now about how to talk about race everything against it and yet it was about 80 actors opera opera singers and actors on stage all african-american right so first of all you have to think it's it's great to be to have a vehicle for that but written by these two white guys in if it were to happen now and I was surprised - Metropolitan Opera allowed itself to put on this show because it feels from the light of day of 2020 way too dated or racial or whatever and yet what was really interesting is because it's a really good piece of art it overcomes that I think we should be really careful even with bad pieces of art of shielding people from the reality of our own evolution so if you go back and watch some of the early like there's a Disney film that Splash Mountain is based on that you can't even get any more it is this really racist film about the Splash Mountain Splash Mountain is a ride at Disneyland but it's based on a movie okay based on a movie you can't even get any more because it's late so Pro kicked it out of the archive yes yes so problematic yeah like I think stuff like that it's important to know where we came from like I don't know if you've ever watched some of the old Popeyes I have yeah from the 1920s and 30s or whatever it was Bluto was a fucking rapist all he was trying to do was rape olive oil he was always grabbing olive oil and trying to rape her that was normal I've been watching Cheers you remember cheer as you remember cheers but the even cheers but stop and think but I'm sure that was but some of those old black-and-white cartoons were insanely racist yeah their depictions of Japanese people their depictions of African people their depictions of like all the pop I once fucking crazy your people need to be allowed to see you should be able to see evidence of our own evolution we shouldn't pretend I just figure this shit out right we shouldn't pretend we shouldn't pretend and look the the fucking there's so many things that were on look the dukes of hazzard they took away the Confederate flag from the the roof that generally you literally can't watch The Dukes of Hazzard anymore because they pulled it off television because people were so offended by that flag right look I'm not saying I'm not promoting the Confederate flag yeah I've got a Lynyrd Skynyrd poster I saw this when he stole my stolen yeah Rolling Stones got second bill how did that happen his Larry Skinner was a shit back then son and the top of it in one there on stage there was a confederate flag right in the background of the image of them on stage and that was rank look I'm not a proponent or a supporter of the Confederate flag or that Confederate anything but that is a part of history and I think whitewashing it I think pretending that it didn't exist eliminating it from the historical record of who we were in 1980 yeah who we were in 1930 that's not good it's good to see what it was like Little Rascals are gang right some of those things were ridiculous what they were was an example of the way culture and art viewed those times now what about what's what about the argument and say well for the people who belong to the group that's being discriminated against is just too painful that's a good argument but I think that we should recognize that these people were wrong but they existed right don't hide it don't make it impossible to get to because then you're gonna make it forbidden if you make it forbidden gonna make it attractive right you know if nobody give a fuck about swastikas no one we care right you have them up everywhere I'm not promoting a swastika but it's the the fact that if you have a swastika tattoo it's so awful that makes morons want to get one yeah because it makes them want to spark up the taboo right you know there's there's a thing that people do when you take stuff away you know where you make it look you're deciding right that they can't see this anymore why you shouldn't want to watch it but why the fuck is Hogan's Heroes okay it's a goddamn sitcom about Nazis and a concentration camp and these guys were prisoners of war it's ridiculous and they're joking around with these fucking baby murderers you know that's it's a crazy concept for a show that you never could do today I'd love to see you pitch that to a studio here that I can see rosengrant writing a new version of who knows mm-hmm yeah there's certain things you can't pitch in him great and I don't think you should do a new version of Hogan's Heroes but I don't think you should make the old one a banned product either I understand historical record of our evolution is yeah good work I like that lens of looking at it there's also the idea of how the line between what's your Pug meant and not shifts yeah and then once you get past it how much access do you want to when it you know yes so just imagine if you had a cartoon today where the main character is constantly fighting off the co-main character trying to rape his wife yeah that's what Bluto and Popeye were I don't think you could sell that in the room and violence they're always solving it with violence stay away from me girl she's my girl and then they're duking it out and there's cartoon exaggerated violence at every turn every episode his biceps are firing up and he's punching the shit out of somebody but it's a sign of the times people that back then lived a hard hard life and that was what they didn't want some bullshit ass fucking modern-day Disney movie to calm them down that wouldn't work right if you put tried to put one of them modern Disney movies like the Lions King try to put that shit on in 1920 they'd be like what are you talking about hard to say we don't know the counterfactual I mean you know the art that's produced as it part of its time if you import an art from a different time okay interesting to see yeah I mean look you can make the argument in Reverse what happens if you take a bunch of aggressive violent people now and play for them classical music does it work I mean the evidence seems this show that not really so well it's way more complicated than that you take someone who's our life's already gone so fucking sideways that they're violent and they're reaching out smashing people and getting arrested and they've got problems you're not gonna fix with Beethoven yeah although Beethoven can go a long way you know a little bit I might make him angry you know it might lead to the no one left to blame theory I can't stand I love how you pick apart everything though that's one of the things that I really enjoy about your show you look at every single potential angle and today in this side in this society there's there's certain subjects that people don't like to do that with because it it it interferes with the orthodoxy interferes with this accepted upon nere narration of reality that we are for whatever reason or another are stuck with I think we're stuck with it I think a lot of people have shortcuts because life is busy and complicated and if somebody's done the thinking for you yes and it seems okay on the surface like I touch it and it's not too hot not too cold then I'm gonna go with it and the fact is thinking for yourself and ferreting out the information finding the data and then finding conflicting data and trying to measure one against the other takes forever it's right look we barely we put out one podcast a week and it almost kills us just to do one a week because there's a ton of like I think of it as you know I mentioned I grew up in the country we used to make maple syrup and you would have all these maple trees you drive the tractor around banging in the taps put the buckets and you'd empty them out into the big vat and then you'd boil it down and you get this much maple syrup and it was very frustrating because it goes damn it's good it's really good but the ROI like it took a lot of effort a lot of time you think it and so the fact is is that that's what I do for a living and I enjoy I wouldn't I wouldn't trade it for anything but I totally get why people reach for the fastest piece of conventional wisdom we're seeing it with coronavirus there's just so much so I'm very thankful that there's someone like you who's not doing that I'm can I tell you I'm thankful that there's a market for it yeah because that's not an easy that's and there's no guarantee it would have never been the market if it wasn't for the internet because if you had to go through a network and do what you're doing 100% I had a I had a trick kind of fooled my way into getting so when I started the the podcast I also wanted to have a radio component um but I knew that if I went to like NPR or somebody like that Sirius whatever and said listen I want I want to make a radio show that's basically you know inspired by the freakonomics way of thinking and we're basically going to interview a bunch of scientists and academics and more you know philosophers and we're gonna try to wrestle with these big pieces of life and and there'd be no way that any executive would go for that so thank God for technology it had made it so cheap to make a podcast on my own that I just did it put it out there and then I could go to these partners which happen to be WNYC in American public media and they said oh okay that works there was already an audience for it so that's another case where if you people are able to use a technology that's in front of them and marry their ideas to it you know then but it's also but I I agree with you but it's also like what you were talking about before where there's so many ideas that like it's so much easier to let someone do the thinking for you right it's so much easier to just fall into place so the vast majority people do that but there's so many of us there's so many always gonna be a market so even if the vast majority people might slot into a previously grooved little opening and and fit their thoughts to fit that little space yeah there's plenty of people that don't want to do that and great a beautiful thing about your reach is you're getting a pure sample of people who enjoy what you're thinking because there's no reason to listen if you don't enjoy it yeah it's true and look I am very again just appreciative of being in a world where there's people who are willing and able to have ideas that are prima facia unpopular like my co-author Steve Levitt when he wrote this paper it's gosh more than 20 years ago now I think about abortion and crime man there are all kinds of ways in which you could talk yourself out of even thinking about that much less writing a paper right so it takes courage but if you look through history if you look at the people who've really changed the world they have courage yeah there's a really really controversial subjects that are of uncomfortable fact of our reality and some some uncomfortable facts people would be happier with you if you left them alone yeah yeah but you know the world doesn't progress very much unless there's a guy like Steve Jobs or a Copernicus or whatever you know sticking the needles to poking people in the eye with a stick and they you know very often they're discredited or hated for their whole lives I love the stories where someone like gets pushed out and then finally toward the end they're they're appreciated for what they did there was a geologist in England named William Smith who kind of invented modern geology but he was not of the the gentrified class and so his work was kind of stolen this is an amazing story told in a book called the map that changed the world by a Simon Winchester mm-hm and basically his ideas and his research were kind of hijacked he was discredited he ended up getting thrown in debtors prison it's a class it's like a horrible story but then at the end of his life he was able to persuade people that he had actually done this work and he was lauded at the very end but like many much more often you'll find the stories of the people who just get like stomped on for their ideas and don't get the credit but you look at the people who've died in disgrace who've had world-changing ideas it's you know artists look at all the artists who were like not at all popular in their time and only now do we appreciate so you know got to take the long view I agree I just have just happy that you do it I'm just happy that you're out there and that your podcast really does explore things in every nuanced corner and really objectively and honestly and I think it's it's a powerful thing appreciated favorites hey thanks for having me hey thanks for being here man it was awesome we did 2 hours and 45 minutes I believe that I really really enjoyed that conversation I thought it was a lot of fun thank you so much thank you thank you very much and where can tell people everything where social media is easy free yeah we're on social media just Freakonomics if as long as you spell it right it's freak fre AKO na max n om ICS but you know the main thing is the pockets we're also starting a little caste channel with some new shows that are kind of related so we're doing that in the next year this is our tenth year for economics radio we might do it another 10 he's going yeah thanks I'm home babe pretty good appreciate it thank you so much [Applause] [Music] [Music]
