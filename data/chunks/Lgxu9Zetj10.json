president knighted States 2024 Dave Smith is with me every day what is that a date with me 24 that wouldn't be it right 1628 what I'll be ready dude you could pull it off we need a real Libertarian candidate that could fucking hang in there someone who's gonna ship a break the mold Dave Smith and I can't stand up comedian as well I didn't want this task but now that Joe Rogan's called me you could do it you're relatively immune to all the trappings that hit all its people of course there's dirt on you you're a part of skank fest you know it's gonna be there's a lot of grabbin by the post you're on a podcast called the Legion of skanks that's could that be introduced in a presidential debate and then I have to go mm-hmm yes that was my show yes but you would do it just like that and everybody would start laughing we're realizing that I just do it like a politician or I'll be like I repudiated that show years ago I no longer associate with big Jay oakerson dude speaking of which they put Weiner in the pokey today 21 months in jail for sexting I believe was a 15 year old well look I that guy single-handedly probably changed America yeah I mean I really yeah I don't think she really did by he changed it through dick pics which Hamill's were you gonna change America in 2017 edge Anthony Weiner gets hard time is that the phone that post is hilarious whoever writes for the post goddamn they have some fucking great headlines Anthony Weiner gets hard time oh you know what's horrible is before all this happen he was fantastic that guy could have been the president he was he had that politician e thing I mean it was he and he was like for a young politician on the fast track yeah but he I mean I really do think Hillary Clinton I mean I just think it was such a close race that any little thing probably could have made the difference so you could blame any number of factors but I mean the FBI coming out and reopening an investigation on you like less than two weeks before an election that's pretty tough to get over politically like in any normal year any candidate would be buried well after all that locker up lock her up there's no way you can survive that the FBI is looking into it all the people that don't want to look into it any further than the surface they immediately go oh we fucking God yeah it's over and I you know like I think there's also just in terms of the politics and the way people work there was something about Anthony Weiner where so it just it made the American public think about him again yeah Trump was bringing the women who are accusing Bill Clinton of rape to the debates and I think the average person just kind of went like wait a minute so so your husband is a sexual predator and your best friend her husband is also a sexual predator like who the fuck are these people story for yeah well that's one of the things that got me about Fox News because Fox News has always been the voice of conservative America on television right the staunch verse the start staunch voice of conservative America but yet all this sex stuff comes out like the Bill O'Reilly tapes where he was calling up is whoever the girl was and saying crazy shit with a loofah sponge remember all that yeah I read about it it was correct but they had recordings of it and then it was you know the all the women and accused him of sexual harassment and sexual harassment with other people and other people are sending dick pics and like whoa you guys are freaks and you know it was really crazy about it was that so Roger Ailes who was the head of the network he went down first for sexual harassment and then as soon as he was down like a whole bunch of other people started going down and then you really start wondering like oh shit like was it just like a new guy isn't letting us sexually harass anymore well I think it was just there was a culture that they could get away with before the Internet where they were the bosses and the women were the underlings and they all felt you know I'm sure there's probably a lot of dynamics playing there right there's a power situation the man the the guy who's the boss is in position and then there's also women that are attracted to power figures and then there's also this conservative like really repressed environment which always leads to freak shit it always does yeah I don't have like people button down they always lead to freak show they have to find a way out that pressures gotta go yeah you're right I I mean I really always say to people if you're in if you're in New York City if you go to a bar in the financial district like right after work it's a really crazy scene something interesting like the exact dynamic you're talking about where's these people who are all day working in this crazy like this and then like the ties are loosened and it's this like girls drinking and they take their shoes off at the bar like whoa people are getting slapped on the ass like crazy shit is going on that you wouldn't think you're you know the guy the guy who runs your retirement account you know why because like we were talking about before with a game before the podcast start with like these ancient reward systems there's an ancient reward system for plundering I really believe that I think these guys feel like they're goddamn pirates like they're plundering you know they're they're part of the financial market and then they're doing shots yeah we're gonna fuckin take them down and if you think about I mean if you think about the acquisition of property of goods or anything like that throughout human history I mean the idea of like a just a theory of just acquisition of property his life yeah pretty relatively new and the way everything was acquired for all of human history was through conquest you you know you take it you take other people's shit and you gotta think that like a hostile takeover must feel incredibly like sacking a city yeah these guys oh that's from Wall Street from what's his name wasn't Wall Street what the fuck was it's called wolf of Wall Street yeah yeah that was a great scene but people resonate that scene resonated with people I'm not fucking going I'm not fucking going it's like being above the system kind of is but this is tapping in the same way football taps in uh-huh it's tapping into this ancient reward system for plundering yeah when men get together and they fuck up other men and take all their shit and then we kick ass it's unbelievable how much I I thought about this a lot this last year through the election but it's like unbelievable how much like that football team dynamic is just the whole thing like it's like human beings love to get into a stadium be like Red Team Blue team identify with one team and lose their freakin minds like you literally lose their minds and that's when they know it's meaningless no it's just about a ball crossing a line this has absolutely no will still bring God into it we're a team and all these and again you see like with this Trump thing now that he just stepped on me and Jamie were joking around before we started like it's like he he like threatened nuclear war and insulted Steph Curry in in one thought everyone in America is like excuse me excuse what I mean did you say it's like and both sides like this is just what gets them interested well we are a gossip country now like 100 percent officially like what we like is a squabble between the leader of the free world who was a reality star and some of the best basketball players that have ever lived like oh shit it's ball players I mean LeBron James is making videos about the president being a douche bag he's making videos about all these different people like expressing their right to free speech I saw one of the tweets that he he tweeted out at the president where it was like just kind of like a broken English tweet like he used the word ain't a lot and it was like and it's just him verse Trump and I just had a moment where I was like so this is where the national conversation is at now like do you remember I just remember watching like William F Buckley versus go Vidal debates and you're like how fucking retarded has our country gotten have you seen the documentary yeah it's amazing really interesting if you haven't seen it folks it's on Netflix what is it called something I don't remember bitter rivals yeah no that's something is called bitter rivals that might've been a UFC best of enemies thank you stupid pattern no I've seen 54 obliteration yeah I was saying they're gonna run out of adjectives yeah we are this is bad you don't ever see it's never like Nick's verse six errs clam fest a total slam fest yeah like you never have a name it's just the World Series it's just the fucking Super Bowl it's never there's never you know domination event are they figured it out somewhere along the line but what we're talking about oh yeah how crazy it is to see that this is all going on while Puerto Rico has no power and only 5% of it has cellphone service holy shit you want to talk about there's some there's a weird racist thing that we will really like if that was an island filled with white people do you really truly think it was an island filled with white people that spoke perfect English and that sounded just like us do you think we have so little coverage of Puerto Rico the way we do now Oh Puerto Rico's technically a part of the United States it's not a state but it's technically like we had on and uh Peter Schiff yes we just had a mother ship who was was fantastic Amazon he just moved his whole team down there Wow boy I bet he's regretting that shit now for a guy who's known for predicting the future you really missed that one just like that moment and that that animated gif with that black future what he did you not see the destruction of your empire turns out he can only predict subprime mortgage crisis is he's not acts of God fuck dude and there's another one along the way look at this one that kids face is so fucking classic like if he shut you down and gave you that face you'd be like fuck he got me there's no counter argument after this has happened to you but he just accept that you lost yeah I mean you might be a little I gained some ground afterwards with a couple of good insults what the fucking contest is over if that's like happens halfway through a roast battle just like call it for the judge you gotta know when to walk away to with a loss cuz it's way worse if you stay there and keep swinging yeah just keep getting fucked up when that guy gives you that face you come back and fight another you can't believe it and then I mean that might be like the perfect events in human history forget about like you know planting the flag at Iwo Jima this dude just dude making that face that will be used who knows how many countless hundreds of thousands of times how many times that thing been used maybe millions right if a YouTube video could get millions of hits that's probably in the millions millions of times used oh yeah sure right yeah it's a it's a weird fucking time with all this because we're concentrating so much on weird stuff like whether or not you should stand for the flag or kneel well and first of all I think what they're doing if correct me if I'm wrong they're protesting cops shooting innocent people that's what it's about so it's kind of ineffective on their part the message because you have to listen to them afterwards right it seems like you don't like America right that's what people have a problem with in Trump's playing on that that they get down on one knee and you know I mean it's kind of weird because it's kind of respectful as all also getting down on one knee for the flag is actually more respectful than putting your hand over your heart which is really weird right so they they're supposed to be protesting cops who have shot innocent unarmed people which have been a fuckload of them but that's that's a weird way to do it because you're doing it during the anthem the anthem is in those cops the anthem is all of us so it's alright it's a shitty way to divide because it's not really making a whole lot of sense because the people who wrote the star-spangled banner who are singing it right now the people who have sung it all throughout the years and stood there they aren't the ones that shot those unarmed people what you have is a cop who's a probably a nervous wreck most likely it's been operating with PTSD for the past five six fucking years if friends are cops a few yeah they tell you crazy shit oh yeah you know I know a bunch cops especially from jujitsu I know atonic knobs and and from the UFC as well they tell you some fucking horror stories things that they have to deal with like they stumble upon a crime scene and guys got half his fucking head missing people chopped up you know all sorts of dark dark dark shit in their head all the time they've had buddies get shot in the face at you know routine traffic stops everybody's freaked out because over the course of 20 years your police officer you have seen a fucking amazing amount of shit yeah probably unfit for the job these guys that are shooting people and we think about the vast number of people that are cops that aren't doing this the interact all the interactions we're concentrating on these terrible things that obviously there's no defense for right there's no no no defending someone shooting a 13 year old boy with a plastic gun there's no there's no defending any of the crazy stuff that we saw the guy who shot the guy and then planted the Taser there's no defending any of this right but how many interactions are cops having with people where this doesn't happen happen a fuckload marry like let's keep some perspective because the other and and if you live in a country with 320 million people and you see one incident or a few incidents that there's no perspective there so you can find it any any example to paint whatever narrative you want to if you're just going off random examples yeah you can god I really like it's really frustrating for me because the whole it's like the whole Trump thing and the whole moment were in now it's it's all about a culture war but that's what it's really about it's not about politics or policy or anything it's really a culture war and what you have here and this is why everyone gets so into the the kneeling for the national anthem thing because it's symbolic of two cultures and to me it's like I own the world in perspective at all so it's it's like yeah right so they'll be protesting say like cops being shot or something like that which you can say certainly there are legitimate cases of that and I'm a person who believes real like a real real police problem in America and and we have like just insane amounts of arrests for nonviolent crimes and really fucked up Shangri mass incarceration all these fucked up things that being said like there's also justifiable shootings sure props do you know but so you have these people taking a neat but it's kind of like symbolic to people who aren't on the left of this culture of like everything over the on the left is just like anti America anti-capitalist anti-white man anti man in general and anti Western civilization with no perspective right like no perspective of like you know just like America is a white supremacist country it's like well what does that mean compared to what you know what I'm saying and I'm not saying it doesn't exist it's like but it's like when they say like we live in a rape culture it's like what does that mean if I'm like we live in a robbery culture right there are robberies but compared to what so if you're gonna say we're a white supremists culture to me it's kind of like saying it's like saying America is a poor country I mean I suppose compared to some richer country in the future that's figured some shit out that we haven't compared to everything else that's ever existed we're a rich country so if you're talking of white supremacist it's like well know by and large we're probably the best like melting pot most diverse most inclusive most like we feel more guilty for the sins of our past than pretty much any other country on earth and I don't know any country that like you know it's like America was founded by conquest of the Native Americans is like right and so was every single other country and so and every country had slavery and every country had all these things it's not no one 150 years ago wasn't fucked up there's nothing Exodia right and so if you have some perspective the left-wing thing gets pretty frustrating after a while however then on the on the Trump site so I've kind of been more sympathetic to the right than the left probably over the last year and a half because I really do see like the issue of our time becoming this like are you for free speech or against free speech that to me is like really because we don't really figure things out unless we get to debate them yes we can topics and we can't have topics that are supercharged to the point where they're you you can't have a position on them yeah and you can't explore them there is a real powerful yes yes that's that's exactly right I mean it's it's one reason I think there's many reasons but that's one of the most important like why we need free speech yeah because unless you fucking unless you come from the position of I have everything 100% correct like then maybe you need to have a conversation and someone has a conversation back with you because the odds are you don't have everything was it percent correct it's their correct versus your correct like their correct is gender quality their correct is transgender rights their correct is socialism their correct is like and if you if I'm talking about people far left not talking about you if you're listening just I'm talking about the hypothetical extreme far left person that is protesting ben shapiro on berkeley campus calling him and knots like this isn't this isn't just you know right it's not you're making it talking about a hypothetical person but obviously this is happening lots of them and there's enough to the point where like it's like this real thing where okay so the great threat to free speech and our time isn't coming from the state which by the way like as a libertarian that would be more comfortable to my narrative like that's what I've been thinking for years is the great threat to free speech but know it's coming from this left-wing culture that says a right like ben shapiro can't speak Milo you novelists can't speak uh Condoleezza Rice can't speak like oh yeah but look if if Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson need to be silenced yeah I mean that my only problem with those two is that they're too moderate like these are like these are not bigots these are not these are these are intellectuals making an intellectual argument and they can't even speak yeah so it's it's very scary and then the other thing I would just say on this left-wing culture and is what Capra that kind of like embodies to me is just it's this frustrating ignorance like this class so you'll be protesting police brutality and mass incarceration and then like you'll put a Castro image on your jacket like I mean come on man come on dude you can't stand up for something and swing and miss that big like that's like you got to research a little bit I mean do five minutes all the informations on your phone like I just don't so there's that and I get being against that and I want to be like on the free-speech side and I see a lot of these guys like who I'll bring up like steven crowder and ben shapiro guys you've had on your show who I really admire a lot because they're fighting against that and Jordan Peterson fighting against that anti-authoritarian that authoritarian PC anti-free speech stuff so I kind of more sympathetic to the right but then there's this thing with the NFL where and it really just reminds me of all the cultural aspects of the right that I hate which is when first of all I'm sorry as someone who's standing for freedom of speech I'm pretty fucking troubled by the President of the United States the man who's in control of the most powerful army and the military in the history of human humanity coming out and saying I think if someone takes a need they should be fired now that may not be writing a law against a speech but that's pretty fucking showing to have like the government telling you hey you know what would please me is if you started firing people when they spoke out against me I don't like that and fucking right-wing like praise the flag and if you say anything against it your your net it's like religious like you it's blasphemy it is a criticize the troops or criticize the country like fuck that yeah it is a power issue when I was gonna say earlier is that when you were talking about the state when you were talking about the fear of the state and the censorship coming from the state it's the same thing because the state is just power and the far left is power too and its power with shame and with blogs and with protests and it is the power that they're trying to exercise to get you to behave the way they want you to and the right does the same thing I think what we should have if we're gonna if we're gonna really keep doing this whole we're a country thing we should have like an armistice when then this is I think with with regional people reasonable people have an issue with this idea of desecrating the flag because the flag is just a flag and it's not important but what is important is that we treat each other like we're a team and we look out for each other and we're all together and we're all United together we shouldn't be fuck if we have an issue our issue should be with communist dictatorships across the world that have nuclear weapons that are holding their people captive right like if it was ever a time to look at a country and go wow this is a country that is in an unjust position and it's a really terrifying dilemma that you have this murderous dictator who's in control of nuclear weapons and he has an entire country of people enslaved which is essentially what's going on in North Korea right it's basically like a giant hostage situation that's that's a real giant issue to us that it's not whether or not transgender people can use the fucking mails or the men's room of the women's room that's not our issue that's that's that's a cultural conversation and that cultural conversation should be calm and we should be friendly to each other because we're supposed to be on the fucking same team yeah no I agree with you but I that stuff with the like the transgender bathrooms I gotta say meant and it's really weird for me sometimes I just can't I I can't even believe I hold some of the positions I do because I grew up like a kind of left-wing kid and you know I was like raised by a single mom in New York I thought like that's kind of where I belong culturally but I really can't you know it's almost like the the kooky conservatives who the religious kooky conservatives who I just dismissed for years is like this is just insane had more of like they had a grain of truth that I didn't realize like they'd be like you know you can't legalize gay marriage or they'll start coming after the kids and you're like well that's just insane anybody's yeah only gay marriage gets legalized in like the next year they're like kids should be able to take hormones to suppress that you're like whoa this is kind of weird it's very weird to me that the left didn't take like a minute to celebrate this victory on on gay marriage that they had been fighting for like my entire life they got a huge victory the Supreme Court came in and forced it on the remaining 20 states or so who weren't ready who weren't gonna vote for it they forced it on them and there wasn't a big backlash like that one chick went to jail for like three days it's not like the one in Oklahoma we yeah wendy davis yeah and then she and then it's not like oh there was like this wave of republicans who rose up like we're gonna repeal but we're gonna write a law to reverse that Supreme Court decisions like no actually they elected the first pro-gay marriage president it's like you won on this issue and immediately as soon as they won they're like now transgender bathrooms now that's now like well I think I don't think they're related this is why I think first of all the gay marriage thing is consenting adults they should be able to do whatever they want to do the difference between gay people and transgender people is pretty radical no I agreed if almost the same difference between straight people and gay people yes they're but they're in the same four letters according to the land but that whole lbgtq a a+ whatever the fuck it is now there's a bunch of new ones that they've added on asexual no I agree with you and I think it's actually insulting that they lump them together as if it's like the same thing I mean I think it's a weird that when Trump tweeted the thing about trans people not being able to serve in the military I saw a bunch of people being like Trump you know has come out against LGBT rights mhm and you're like what the hell does this have to do with LG or B yeah like what why is that's crazy they're just a gang lump it all together a big progressive gang of acronyms but the the whether I was gonna say about all this stuff being lumped in together is that the left has been the side that has looked towards the hard science when it comes to global warming right the hard science when it comes to climate data those are the ones that always pushing whether they're right or wrong or getting the right data they're the ones that are really harping on the science and if you looked in terms of the amount of people that are working in universities they're far more left than there are far more left professors and they're all right so you would think okay you have this like base of academia and knowledge on the left but yet the left is the side that's willing to entertain the idea that a young kid should take hormones to alter their sex when you know for a fucking fact that when you're a young person you're extremely confused constantly back and forth left and right there are hormonal changes the cerebral cortex of frontal cortex doesn't even really fully develop they don't say you're a real fully developed person till you're like 25 if you're a man which explains a lot of the shit that I said right it's a lot of people listening that are 20 and retarded that like what the fuck am I doing with my life exactly dude you're barely an adult oh you think about things you do it like 22 and you're like I can't believe I'm saying he's on the same aren't human but so this same party the same progressive mindset that is so incredibly open-minded but yet also so deeply embedded in academia like far more than the right is this is the side that is willing to put aside all that they know about biology and psychology and physiology and children put aside that a lot of people are not all of them not on one lung but anybody the other put aside that for progressive brownie points for saying that you are so incredibly open like this child obviously knows right he is a she or she is a he and we need to start addressing them as that and this is just a fact well it's not just a fact it's a conversation that we should have and I think it varies in individuals and I think there are some people that I have personally talked to that are transgender people that for sure are happier being a woman or a man and they were born in what they feel is the wrong body and I absolutely 100% salute their right to go out and do that but we should have a real conversation as to how many people is that really happening to how many of these people have a sickle issue how many people is there a physical trait that we're missing is there some some switch that gets flipped when they're young I mean it's a fascinating aspect of human beings that you are one sex and wish you were another right and it seems strange to me that on the left the rules always seem to be there's this topic like it's like the left thing forever it's always like we need to have a national conversation about race right but if you say the wrong thing I want you ruined yeah you know and it's the same thing with like the transgender thing it's like they want to like it's like we want to have a conversation about this they put this forward as like this is an issue we need to talk about and then also by the way you're not allowed to say anything so if you bring up the 40% suicide rate and say maybe this isn't due to societal oppression because there's no real link between societal oppression and high suicide rates but now you need to be fired or something but they say 40% of transgender people commit suicide and the people that want to support the idea that there's it's not of any sort of a mental illness in any people and sure it's not in some we're not generalizing but it must be in some right the people that want to deny that say the reason why they're suicidal is because they don't get a chance to express their genuine authentic self which is a very good point so it's not it's not that either or no I'm open to the argument but it's like the argument that the 40% is possibly it's maybe a combination of those two factors maybe there's some people that are mentally ill that are suicidal in the first place and they hope that maybe becoming a woman would make them feel better and it didn't work out there's there's a whole website where people how I think it's called transgender regret or something like that and it's all people that switched over and we're like really upset that they did it and then realized it was like some strange phrase they were going through or whatever and then you know there's there's people that are sure suicidal because they want to be one way and people just constantly shit on them and bully them and and heckle them and and they that's what's causing them to be so deeply it's not like one or the other no and I think in every individual case there's probably like a complex you know a complex set of you know different cause causing factors you know it's so yeah I agree with that I just think it's like no matter how look obviously I'm Thor you know like everyone owns their own body and she's able to do whatever they want to it if you can find a doctor who's willing to perform a surgery on you you know whatever surgery you want to have and and I think transgendered people should have the freedom to do that truthfully speaking though I don't really see anyone not that anyone isn't saying that but I don't really see anyone agreeing with that you know like there's people seem to agree there are people that think it's a sickness and they absolutely shouldn't be allowed to boys maybe it seems like that's pretty rare like people who are getting a lot of a lot of heat for like their stance on transgender issues like I've never heard Gavin McGinnis say it should be illegal I've heard like ben shapiro say it should be illegal what they will say is that i'm not going to pretend that you're a wet you're a woman i'm going to acknowledge that that you have a y-chromosome like that to me is like okay that has nothing to do with your freedom to have a surgery he this guy has a free you know it's the freedom of thought to describe what's going on and it is kind of crazy like you said with the global warming thing like it's like yeah the left prides themselves on being the science party like we believe in science although the problem is that and and like i try very hard to like wrap my head around all of these different you know like issues and i've read a decent amount on climate change and um it's pretty tough pretty tough stuff it's not easy it's not like some of these other issues that are much easier to understand and i I will say that about 90% of the people on the Left who are like have the science they haven't looked into it they've just been told this is the science and they're like oh great now I get to bash people by having the science because if you're gonna say like you're the side that that believes in science I'm sorry to deny that there are biological effects on biological effects on gender is but that's my science as you convey such a small fringe group that do make that distinction they think that there's no biological difference in the sexes and those people are really just crazy the idea pushed it so far there's so far left that they're in some crazy alternative reality there are a lot of those I look at it like the same way you're like Scientologists have like their levels I look at like like yeah it's like like the social justice warrior who's like out in the front lines like like protesting christina hoff sommers right she's like top level yeah left-wing mindset but there's a lot but no the idea that gender is a social construct is pretty well accepted I think on the left and to me that is insane that's true I think it's only accepted in a very fringe group especially academics maybe you're right and people in school that protest about it and people that are super active so so justice warriors I think if you polled people whether or not the thing there's a biological difference and you gave them three choices yes/no and uh that most people would say uh okay here's here's the only thing I'll district I I think you're 100% right if they were taking that that test anonymously but not honestly I think it ought to put their names behind it I think you get a bunch of different answer I'm really right I talked to college professors like my sister's a college professor I talked to our friends I talked to other people I a lot of them will come up to me and it's almost like this thing like at a dinner table it's like get close and be like hey just you know I really agree with you I'm like a lot of stuff and I'm not you know like it'll be like the people who they're for the one Jordan Peterson who by the way a guy like Jordan Peterson really does beg the question why aren't there more Jordan Peterson's like why is it just you and five other people why are there not more professors and the reason is because they're all intimidate look at all the shit he's had to deal with yeah they're all intimidated by that Brett Weinstein who's a super progressive guy I mean he's way left and he got shamed and he got like literally threatened I mean now he just won a lawsuit though he just got paid he went five hundred thousand dollars we had him on like right after evergreen college had to shut down and kids were patrolling the fucking parking lot with baseball bats looking for him like it was really crazy yeah man that's insane really crazy stuff that the left I mean if magic if that was coming from the right you would start calling them Nazis you started calling them white supremacists you start calling them thugs but on the left they conveniently ignore the same types of behave my god it's so unbelievable like the double standard life ax dude you will look so you have like the the the thing that happened in Charlottesville right where you have like I mean a few hundred people marched and and I guess there were dozens of them at least at least who were like wearing Nazi gear which is you know don't get me wrong I mean it's pretty like eye opening and like holy shit again what it's it's like disturbing and kind of very very interesting to me that anyone in 2017 in America is putting a swastika on not only that these dumb fucks got together in public would lit their face with torches so everybody could take video and photos of them and march to the street together yelling like blood and soil and all sorts a weird fucking shit like what without quotes that they do you remember what the Jews will not replace us was well yeah what which can I tell you is that as a Jewish person I've never felt more empowered in my life then the Jews will not replace it like I've never even entertained the idea of replacing anybody and then when they're like the Jews will not replace I was like I think we can replace these motherfuckers it's like I'm worried about let's make a move Jews let's go replace these charlottesville how many people were there that Pro 200 I think between three and four hundred that's it that's it good sighs crying I'd be psyched if they came to see me we're doing good tonight and I feel like it's pretty white supremacy in here no in here really uh I mean at first I thought it was well lit can they bring their tiki torches in the dirt outside who's gonna someone even watch those fires and how do you know which torch is yours we got a guy we have numbers we got it all figured out cheap-ass Walmart torts when you had a nice Home Depot torch good solidly constructed American Home Depot choice and some dude stole your shit and left you with some Maine Chinese bullshit that would be I'll be tea Oh bullshit and it's by just good enough that you get halfway through the March before you're like wait and look up and she made in China like fuck I knew this felt light used to have a little American flag and a little metal on it now let's get real they were all made in China yeah probably there's not a big market for tiki torches but anyway I saying but these guys like I mean no but even like people who are real far out on the right wing who are like pretty you know considered you know like whoever like ben shapiro who's being protested by these guys he doesn't associate with any of those guys disgusted by them Gavin McGuinness won't associate with any of these guys he's disgusted by them these guys can't even speak at their own rallies they don't come to the right wing does a I think a fairly decent job at just being like no we're not we're not even associate let it Trump did not denounce them correctly well no I don't think so I mean look from what I saw I actually thought it was a weird reaction to what Trump said it's like like so what I'm saying is I see this going on here with with the this one thing that happened in Charlottesville all right and I haven't seen too much Nazi stuff outside of that um made on the internet but I mean like in terms of much right but response but this is make this point cuz I want to address what you're saying but so then this happened this one limited there's one thing with a few hundred people in Charlotte still happen the media goes fuckin nuts like this is the biggest thing that's ever happened on the other side on the left wing side everywhere that someone tries to have a free speech wrap rally everywhere anyone who's who's one step to the right of Bernie Sanders wants to speak like Condoleezza Rice can't speak like anyone who's one step to the right of Bernie Sanders gets shut down and there is this mob okay called an Tifa who who actively go after assaulting people who and this isn't just Nazis they go after Trump supporters or anyone anyone who disagrees with them they they wear hammer and sickle flags which is you know representing representing an ideology that killed more people than the Nazis so you know let's put them both on the level of like genocide 'el horrible groups however this one group on the left is going everywhere across the country and are given comfortin aid by college professors so when then there's yes yes there actually and when it's brought up and it's actually backed up by things like forty percent of Millennials in a Chicago University uh study say they're they're not don't believe in free speech for hate speech which basically means you don't believe in free speech you've got about forty percent of Millennials who don't believe in free speech because you have to define hate speech and that's where things get slippery and what you might call hate speech is so different from me right what I might what you might call hate speeches me saying that I don't want to call a transgender woman uh her right that well it's a man that has been labeled hate speech that's a microaggression these are all so it's like once you define that it's like oh you can punch a Nazi but by the way everyone who disagrees with me as a Nazi yeah so it's I'm against hate speech and by the way anything I don't like I'm offended by his hate speech and and that's but the whole idea of freedom of speech is to protect unpopular speech yeah it's not there so we can talk about things that don't offend you obviously no one has a problem with that but so you have this on the Left which this mass problem and then the media demands that everyone on the right denounced this non-existent thing so when Trump is on a non-existent thing was disturbing was seeing hundreds of people walking down the street torches yelling out racist things together as a group and the only thing that was differentially differentiating their idea was so much more stupid than the free speech idea because their idea was just to differentiate people based on how much melanin is in their skin what part of the planet their ancestors came from that's one of the dumbest fucking ideas in human history so what you have is this river of dum-dums walking down the street and the president doesn't say that the president doesn't say he's the guy who's run the country right he doesn't say hey this is the lowest form of stupidity that we we know of with humans the lowest form of stupidity is to accept everyone that looks like you this is so fucking stupid you're pretending that someone has any power whatsoever over where they were born their national origin who their parents were you don't you don't have any fucking power over that so you're putting all the power and things you have zero control with that means you're a fucking loser all right and that means the only thing that you got to bank on is this white skin that you need even work for yeah this is the group that you lumping everybody together with and you don't know do you not know any great black people do you not know any great Hispanic or Latino people you don't know any well then you can heed to get the fuck out of your neighborhood but I think that applies to that that thing you're saying about kind of being like a loser and then grasping to some collective yeah because you don't have anything in your own you know story to really cling to or your own life I agree with you but that's I mean I think that applies to people who get into this identity bullshit on all sides I don't I don't disagree it's like yeah I mean for everything about the president sure sure but I just think to me what he said from what I see was like he did call out those guys he did say it was like disgusting but what people were upset about is that he said there were bad people on both sides did you ever see like storm fronts reaction to Trump's speech that he never criticized white supremacy and they were saying that it was very good very positive overall and he said there was problems on both sides and bad people on both sides well I did these videos slide that auntie feh was bad also and they would say God bless Donald Trump okay so this is what I saw from videos that I saw because I have learned and we could go through this forever that I don't trust the mainstream media they're completely foolish so whoever rotated by karate people a reporter sure no I'm not saying that is really correct but I'm just saying an embedded reporter they just wanted to write a story maybe maybe but I'm from the videos that I saw like videos of what was going on there it's like yeah I saw all the stuff you're talking about like the tiki torches the Jews will not replace us swastikas all that really you know garbage right and then I also saw like David Duke and Richard Spencer and all these guys who are kind of like I mean Richard Spencer I think is a white nationalist David Duke has been around forever you know his is a bigoted guy who had a almost successful run for governor I think at one point in Louisiana but you know he's been around forever now I find a lot of both of their ideas fucked up and offensive but they got a permit and were there to speak and this was the next day this has nothing to do not before they were out doing all that crazy shit that we were talking about and then I did see this video of groups of people who were forced out when they canceled the speech forced out through an antifoam AAB and a bunch of them getting tear gassed and rocks thrown at him and shit like that so I don't know I mean as as disgusting is like white supremacy maybe or National Socialism particularly to me someone whose family was fucking slaughtered by them I believe in freedom of speech and I think like so I I do think to some degree I get I just get where and and like I get where Trump is being I guess what I'm just sympathetic to is that he's being like like raked over the coals for not but for calling out both sides instead of just calling out one side right whereas everyone on the left is silent about this anti-fur group it like just started getting press actually covered in a fair way in the mainstream media but it's everywhere well I think there the idea of an T for though is to react to people they disagree with who are speaking right this is this is their idea versus the idea of right supremacists to walk down the street and denounce other weaker races and get together as this big group with torches and then people protest them and there's a violence I think you got to address like the root of the idea of it as a representative of all the people the United States the root of the idea of it is that it's okay to be a white racist and you know there's a lot of people that say what about brown pride how come Cain Velasquez's Brown tattooed on his fucking chest if you don't know the difference between a guy who is born of immigrants that literally his dad walked from Mexico you know I mean this is he's first generation I mean you're second generation I guess his dad was first generation how does it work no he's first generation American because his dad was from Mexico I mean this is a it's a different I mean they came here to try to get a better life because they got a shit roll of the dice they were born in Mexico and he wanted out and he wanted better for his family so they took a chance to come here when he has brown pride tattooed on it he's not saying what like you know they're gonna dominate and the Jews will not replace us he's saying I'm proud to be a Mexican it sure when you say you're proud to be a Mexican for whatever reason and I don't know why it doesn't mean you hate white people it doesn't mean you hate black people it means you have pride in your heritage when you have white pride for whatever reason I don't know why but our thought is that you hate other races like if you are if you're a white nationalist like you love white people people look at you like you're a piece of shit and you're a racist and you you think black people are inferior and you think Mexican people and Asian people and American Indians you think they're all inferior that's what how we look at it but if you have black pride we look at you as a strong person who's resisting this really fucked up society that is brought your group ancient ancestors over from Africa and enslaved your people and literally marginalized everyone who looks like you and you were there to fight against that yeah yeah well but it's kind of strange in a way like even as you say it it's kind of strange that we think of one this way and the other that way I do think like I get that I I get the certainly get the point that like Cain Velasquez tattooing brown pride on his skin given his story is a very different thing yeah then tattooing white pride on your skin was you're like a neo-nazi or something like what Cain was the UFC heavyweight champion and it never came up yeah he's arguably the greatest UFC heavyweight in history oh it only it only came up in the in the fact that like they were like oh we're gonna sell numbers in Mexico City Brown pride and they didn't he lost the belt well he shouldn't use brown it's a fucking English word people what the fuck I'd say no you can't even what is uh what's the word brown and Spanish what's the word pride in Spanish I guarantee you it ain't brown pride if you go over there you go I got brown pride they go what what'd you say so it weirdly symbolizes how American is uh aur ghulam are all that's how you say it that's what it should say that's what should say cane fuck cane okay wait to see like that fight I hope injuries yeah and just his whole career he's had a lot of injuries but he's been gay like you said maybe the best heavyweight ever but I just wanted to say to what you were saying like I do I get that I get the difference and I think that's a very very valid point but like there is this thing like the idea of white people embracing identity politics right the way the left has kind of embraced identity politics oh it does in some sick way seemed like the natural logical progression if you want to accept what the left-wing believes and then you're like okay well you look at the demographics white people are becoming a minority in this country in the future and this is how you kind of have like I get the point you're making but at the same time it's a bit of a weird setup that the left has we're like everyone else is allowed to say these things except white people Evert like political correctness kind of only applies to this one group right we're gonna put everything you say under a fine-tooth comb but somebody else could say like whatever they want it gets to a cartoonish point where you have Ice Cube lecturing Bill Maher about making a joke and actually on ironically while he's promoting his gangster rap album sitting there going now what made you think it was cool to say that Bill Maher and it's like motherfucker you made cop killer yeah ice-t oh no what it was his song heist he was canal wheeler now I'm racing sorry they both didn't like class is my point but I'm just saying like he makes you know it's really funny as he calls eazy-e a house nigga on that album right he uses the same insult actually toward another black guy not as a joke not as a self-deprecating joke the way Bill Maher used at but in the worst way you could insult another black guy he uses it so I just think there is this weird dynamic the left where it's like their rhetoric is so anti-white and so anti-male that i almost sit there and I go like man if you guys think Charlottesville is ugly you're gonna you're gonna create a lot more of this I was sitting at my sister's place a couple weeks ago and talking with a few of her left-wing professors and my sister's got like she's a College pressures got as big like bookshelf up behind the you know like behind the table like lots of books and I just looked over and there was a Michael Moore book from the 90s called stupid white men hmm and you just look at it and you're like huh yeah maybe that's why they're all angry what yeah people don't like being the bad guy so a black guy wrote a book called stupid black men they would come at him so hard yeah it sounds like something larry elder my right but with a more eloquent title that's right wrong with some stupid black man yeah if a black guy wrote a book that was like you know all white people aren't stupid they'd be like Uncle Tom right away it's like oh you sellout it's yeah well it's racist yeah we just don't like to think it's racist cuz it's about white people and generally white people don't have to deal with racism nearly as much as other races so we allow it to be okay it's also sexist there's a big thing that's going on now especially lately where women think it's okay to say all white sis men are trash I mean it's so fucking common it is such a crazy generalization to say that all men or all white men are terrible in their horrible trash until prove until they prove otherwise and it's so fucking contradictory to say that but it's so contradicts everything they've supposedly believed so like you know if there's like um if there's like a Muslim terrorist event and then somebody lumps that into like radical no lumps that into all Muslims people on the left will lose their mind like how can you lump every at the whole group in with what this one bad guy did and then they turn around and lecture white people about like the evils of history but forget if we just stop saying left and right don't you think that what this is is just human beings doing that team thing you know and once you start adopting the rules and the patterns of the team whether you're Wisconsin cheesehead or your Boston Red Sox fan or whatever the fuck it is that you're into you get in this like you've ever heard those Vikings or they they get the whole stadium like a thousand people and they clap their hands together oh whoa it's insane it's amazing it's amazing right but obviously that is a groupthink sort of a situation and they all they all gear together and they all support this behavior that makes them feel good that they're a part of this group and I think people do that when whenever they support right-wing causes and I think people do that whenever they support left-wing causes and what the right and the left are is essentially just frameworks that we can fit in our ideologies in our mind and our needs and all of our social and emotional requirements and we can fit them into these patterns that we follow and when anybody opposes the structure that we've adopted as reality then we fight with by clocks and fucking pepper spraying girls with Trump hats on and you know you find all sorts of insane justifications for racism sexism all sorts of crazy shit that you would know if it would happening to anyone else other than the person that you're opposing you would see think of it as being a horrible front to everything that you stand for but as long as a white man who cares hit her in the head with a bike lock no matter if it was a black woman that it was this professor was disagreeing with and he stepped up and he hit her in the head with a bike lock it's insane like that's when when you see someone who does that from an Tifa it is exactly the same as that that redneck who pulls out his gun and shoots at that black guy was holding a torch yeah yeah this is all the same thing well I also know I mean you're right and it's it's like they're shocking similarities between between the extreme left and the extreme right or you know whatever you know these teams and I agree with you completely I think it's all there's this tribal team groupthink bullshit kind of that we have to a large degree outgrown but that's still like kind of haunts us and it still don't think they've outgrown it in universities and that's a part of the issue that's why this is all happening UC Berkeley that's why you're seeing it all throughout the country and these universities because in universities first of all you have a bunch of people let's let's like try to be as honest and objective as possible first of all you have a bunch of you are seeking knowledge the young people that are idealistic that want to change the world that want to stand out as being better they want a virtue signal they want to do all the crazy things that they can to be something great and there's other ones that want to get laid and there's other ones that want to manipulate and they still don't know who they are they still don't know how to behave then you have these professors and a lot of these professors went through this process and then after they went through this process they got their PhD they wrote and then they started teaching and so they have never been outside the hallowed halls of academia since the time they were like 19 they've been going through the whole system and some of them do it and they do it with balance and they figure out who they are and they take great pride in the fact that they can mold these young minds and give them information and some of them are incredibly broken people who are never sexually viable when they were young and now they're in a position of power and they virtue signal to a sickening degree and you see them and you see them standing up for women above all else which is what happened with this whole Betsy DeVos thing when she's there they're trying to push this they say name DeVos I think I think they're trying to push due process in the case of these sexual assault cases on campus and people are resisting due process people are resisting guilty until proven innocent oh my god that's what they want and I'm sorry like and I don't mean to also like you know like keep harping on this kind of left versus right thing but it's hard for me I almost want like some term to like define but this left side of a met like the on college campuses this grew yeah their position is simultaneously I mean it's really quite amazing their position is that and this is what basically what was just repealed now but this is what the guidelines under Obama basically did on college campuses they said okay there's no due process for men who are accused of rape oh and by the way and this isn't in the legislation this is just the cultural punch but so there's no due process for men accused of rape and and by the way everything is right everything is right everything is right yeah I mean if you had anything to drink by the way the man is not is not responsible or the man is responsible the woman is not so you have all these great beers I mean you've probably taken 90% at least of the pool of what men and women in America previously considered good guys even like rapists good men like just the guys who you think are good people not like considerate 90% of them are probably serial rapists have you heard a story from University of Amherst it's one of the most ridiculous ones or this guy suing now and he has gone through hell for the last couple of years but it was a kid who was a student from Nigeria and some girl who was in his class and they hooked up and they got together and they apparently they were slightly intoxicated I think on marijuana the girl gave the guy a blowjob and then she wanted to stop and he was trying trying to get her to do it again and she said no and so they ended it that was it she talked to her friends they decided that she had been sexually assaulted because he was trying to get her come on please you know I don't know what he said I don't know maybe I don't know what the fuck he said I don't know what the scenario was but I do know that was it was essentially an awkward sexual exchange between young people which is just a part of being a young person who's having sex when you're your person and you're 18 years old or whatever they were and you're in college and you're having sex and you're in some sort of a sexual scenario with a new person what do they how long you been doing that three years how good are you at it are you probably fucking terrible at it you probably awkward a shit you probably weird around women you can't believe they like you don't know why they like you maybe you're confused maybe you think you have to act a certain way you know the finding yourself yeah and like you said like you said before you actually do not have a fully developed brain and it's a different there and forget even insects and stuff like that there's just things how many things did you do at 20 where you'd look back and go wow what a douchey thing that was to do like that's not how I'm treating someone you know like so this young guy I think he was 19 at a time somewhere in the college age whatever it was he's fucked they kicked him out of school they labeled him some sort of a sexual predator and he's in this terrible position where you know he's suing the school but it's gonna take a long time before anything gets resolved and you know we don't know the whole story of the case but if the case is as he's representing it and as no one's that said he held her down no one said he tried to rape her no one said he threatened violence no one said anything like that her version of the story is that they had some sort of a willing sexual encounter and she just didn't wanna go any further and he asked her to and she said no and then it ended that's it that is a normal that's just part of being a young person that's just part of being a young person having sex especially if you're intoxicated is it a good idea to have sex intoxicated I don't know I mean I've done it a bunch I'm sure you have too lot of fun have yeah stop pretending you haven't done it stop pretending that a lot look there's all sorts of mistakes you make when you're drunk why they why are they so much bigger if it's sex and that's and there's something about just using the word rate rape I mean it's like look rape is a particularly horrific cutting word because of what a horrific crime it is and then to try to make everything else like it's literally I mean the extent they go it's almost like you know it's like if you if you punch someone in the arm and they go you committed arm murder or something it's like you can't work you can't just throw that word at everything yeah I mean everybody wants to it's worse than that that's an assault race is an actual egregious offence if you're talking about people having sex yeah yeah you're right you're absolutely calling you know it would be like calling a glance murder yeah I mean it's really it's fucking crazy what's the idea of microaggressions and this is the whole this is the whole thing that underpins the philosophy which I you know find really terrifying is that you're you're the idea of micro aggression or social justice is if you take these terms like aggression or justice that meant something yeah and now you've made them mean the opposite of what they mean yeah micro aggression is not an aggression inherently it's not an aggression no no it's a normal part of human communication you say something to me and I go like this and I walk away that's what people do okay is that some micro aggression and and and this is why I find it to be such that like the issue of our time I almost forget like you know like it's not the issue is acerra Lee wanted to be the issue of our time I was hoping it would be like embracing libertarianism full-on or something but right it just seems to be like are you for free speech or against free speech and free speech is such a prereq for everything it's a prerequisite for everything about the the society we live in and and everything particularly like what you do what I do everything we do like you can't you can't what I love in life is like comedy and truth and you can't have either of without free speech of this conversation about free speech then we couldn't have this conversation if we were on a state-sponsored program we couldn't have this if we were on a corporate sponsored program we likely couldn't have a conversation without being interrupted or being lectured to or having some conversation with someone who says hey you can't save the word nigger right you're not allowed to say it forget it yeah you can't save that noise with your mouth right not calling someone in not saying you are one you know and like no one can go but that's fucking retarded it's what's the dumbest thing I've ever heard but that this was the rule and this is how everybody operates and there's a thing where it's not I mean it's not if we're living in a world of I can't commit a microaggression I can't go down a path that might offend anybody you you need that freedom in order to find anything interesting there's nothing worth saying if you're living in this world where you're like oh I can't get outside of this box right I find that to be very just it's like very dangerous and I feel like people in America it's almost like we've had it too good for too long that people are removed from the fact that we can lose all this shit it's like there's no there's no respect for like like what we have how much different how much higher standard of living we live than the vast you know uh purport than most humans that are alive today and the vast majority of humans who have ever existed I mean it's like what I get this from a Jordan Peterson lecture but he said uh it was in 1895 the average American lived on a dollar a day adjusted for modern inflation so in 1895 you know it's like like Central Asia level poverty in America hmm and that's just everyone before that living in back-breaking poverty was like just life that was just all of life and it's like we figured something out in these last less than 200 years you know like we figured something or a little more than 200 years we figured something out wait what am I saying no no less less than 200 years we figured something out in this industrial revolution that like now lets us live up here on this and it's like we can lose that and a lot of it had to do with freedom but the whole thing to me is freedom the whole thing is that we embraced look if you look in the year and something that you had on your show Thaddeus Russell it was great I just did his podcast recently and he put it this way where you you know in the year 1800 because I was talking about what an incredible thing the 19th century was and how it transformed humanity and he goes in the year 1800 Americans are all making their own clothes in the year 1900 Americans are shopping at Macy's like we if you had said in the year you know in the year 1845 and been like dude in the next 65 years slavery is going to be Impala shhhhht in the West and we're gonna have an industrial revolution you know it's like magic right happened and that's why we live the way we live today and no one is even interested in that story right like why do we have this much wealth right like we you say I think it's it's all about freedom and when you have a guy like Bernie Sanders who harps on and on about income inequality I have a real issue with that because it's one of those blanket statements it sounds really good at the campaign speech but freedom itself breeds income inequality yes because freedom means you can do whatever you want you could do very little or you could work like a maniac well if you're gonna work like I'm if you're if here's the game okay you do something for that something you get current so you use that currency to buy things or to make sure you don't have to work again buy food and goods and take trips and travel the more you work the more you decide that you want to pursue something the more chances you have to acquire their currency if we do it correctly that is income inequality due to freedom I mean take away all the other factors that might be you know in play whether it's racial discrimination or sexual discrimination I'm not denying that those things exist but what I am saying is that the idea that you are going to have income equality in a capitalist society where anybody could do whatever they want you know people that is so counter to what we know about human behavior is this you're talking about a fantasy person who doesn't exist who has motivations outside of wealth outside of you know that most people want some sort of reward for what they do and if everybody gets the same amount there's no fuckin reward for working extra hard yeah and that's solutely you're not gonna get Microsoft you're not gonna get IBN it's not just i mean it's not it's not just i mean they talk about fairness a lot which is a strange concept but it's not just that somebody works twice as hard and doesn't get more that's that that's not the right thing no no anyway but like what you were saying and I just think it's like they use the term so much but what's misleading about it you're absolutely right that freedom breeds inequality but what's misleading about it is by that people think like the poor get poorer now that is objective that is a you know like objectively false demonstrable false it's not that you know they make it out like the rich get richer and the poor get poorer like that old like you know sang but it's like that you know if you think it through like that can't really continue to have rich but if the poor work hard and figured they haven't possibility to escape whatever economic situation they're in it is possible and homeless people here live better than then rich people in third world countries or I'm certainly at least better than average people in third world countries so it's like it's not just that the inequality grows it's like everything moves up now the inequality grows up here this is like what I just what I can't understand and and again it's like what I saying before like if you have any concept of the fact that we're by far the richest freest human beings who have ever existed in recorded human history at least recorded yeah human history who knows what he just going on in ancient Egypt but like before ancient Egypt but uh but if you realize that we have this incredible amount then it's like yeah it's like just being like oh we need all of these policies to like give handouts to poor people it's like well actually let's continue this train of getting richer and richer and richer which is not at all you know like what people like Bernie Sanders man it's like well it's a hustle Bernie's got a also going on yeah you find out so hustle when you find out it's got a bunch of houses yeah and his wife tried to buy up all this fucking land to expand a university that she was running and she killed the whole fucking school like how about the fact that the motherfucker and we haven't seen first off he made a million dollars off a book on how it's wrong to be a millionaire I mean it's like how are you not happy look at you like it's a serious leader when you did that so you're saying what people want to hear and there is something some truth to some of the things that he's saying I think that it would the world would be a better place if we had more social programs in place I think the world would be a better place if colleges were free if we I think I mean I I don't disagree with like the thought behind that and I think they all of the things would be better suited in voluntary arrangements than some forced government monopoly but I do agree with you that like sure I'd like great schools to be very affordable or free if possible I'd like everyone to be too and Bernie Sanders certainly addressed some very real problems like he would point things out that were very real like he would be like you know they claim it's a great recovery but you know 90% of the new wealth has gone to the top 3% you know they keep - and that has to apply to every New York Jew who's out there so like there is and I don't care if Bernie Sanders makes a million dollars but there's something like number one making a million dollars while claiming it's kind of a moral issue that some people have so much what others have so mental endorsing Hillary Clinton I mean I just don't know how you can how you can look at the guy who goes the problem is incoming inequality and these and and the banking you know cartel but I'm gonna vote for the candidate of the big banks like to me that that's insane it would to me it would be if Ron Paul endorsed McCain well don't you think the big banks sort of were on both teams yeah well not I don't know if they were on Trump's team but they've certainly been on every other team as I said Wow yeah yeah no sir oh you know it's not like the team's they run the Treasury Department in the Federal Reserve like they run the whole system but the fact that Bernie Sanders never had like a fiery speech about what happened at the DNC about how they literally conspired to ruin him and to take him out of the race with Hillary because they the DNC wanted Hillary to be the candidate they literally sabotage him oh they were very open I mean president said they were very open about that openly they lied and said we don't have a pick but the leaks that were recognized yeah I mean really some of Russia did it Russia ruined everything I actually remembers is one of the most surreal and I'm a guy who's always preaching about how full of shit the media is but even I've like this last year that I'll give the Trump moment credit even I've been like holy shit I can't believe it but I was watching a CNN and they had they were playing clips from a Hillary Clinton interview and talking about it and Hillary Clinton was claiming that Vladimir Putin a weaponized information against Hillary Clinton and and they're discussing this and they never mentioned that the information is on CNN they're breaking down this piece and never mentioned that the information that was weaponized was that CNN leaked debate questions to Hillary Clinton before the debate quest like you know they said you're talking about undermining democracy for a month what could be more under what could do more to undermine democracy than the debates the things that people actually watch and vote on in America they gave hillary clinton the questions that were asked at the debate we know for a fact - I'm sure there were more but we know two questions were given to her and that they were both asked and Hillary Clinton takes them doesn't have a problem doesn't have a moral issue with that just takes them and pretends she's hearing the questions for the first time and the show that I'm watching described talked about this on CNN that's talking about the weaponized information and not mentioning what the information was the show is called reliable sources it's a show where they breakdown the media it's like it's surreal to be watching and then those same guys in CNN go we've got an epidemic of fake news on the internet and you're like man I don't know if I'm living through a fucking simulation or what but this is some nutty shit well it's also so obvious when you watch the strategies play out like for people who don't remember Hillary Clinton before she ran against Trump was running against Barack Obama yes and when she was running against Barack Obama one of the things she did was she positioned herself as to be right-of-center so more right than Obama was so one of the things that she did was she was publicly stating that gay marriage was wrong she was publicly stated that she believes that marriage is a sacred institution between the man and a woman mm-hmm and that was her way of positioning herself to the right of Obama that she would appeal to all the religious nuts well I'm okay with going left because I don't want no more war in Iraq but these fags marrying each other and buttfucking it's just it's me and Gary been married for 25 years do you think it's right if they get to be the same thing we are under Christ that's right well she was just to be fair that Obama was also against gay marriage in that election but she absolutely you're right did What did he say how he was it he he did the same thing it was these motherfuckers it's like 51 percent approval rating right then all of a sudden they come to Jesus 53 yeah yeah it's like but it's like right win it right when it starts being a wedge issue we can use yeah you know right what Obama's going oh we need reelection and I didn't end any of these wars and it's still open it's like if you're a comic but the only way you could work is if somebody give you an earpiece and they fed you great lines like you couldn't just ad-lib yourself like if you were doing this podcast and while you're doing this podcast big Jays over in the corner feeding you lines to one of your ear pieces right oh there's a team of guys you know the guys in the back they're doing like they're like running like research on it like Jamie's over there constantly googling focus grouping leadership and you have like a screen in front of you like you know Howard Stern used to have that with Jackie the joke man this is way back in the day really see the jokes yeah what he did was he had a thing where you would write on like an oh like a overhead projector this like it was like a thing it was like a camera and he would see the video of it on his side he would see the picture so you had a funny line you would write down the funny line and he would put it on the projector and Howard would get it on his screen and that's one of the things that Jackie the joke man did cuz he was always he was great at like one-liners and things along those lines he knew a lot of jokes and so he would give Howard like really funny things to say and he would juice it up huh and I did the Jackie chair for a couple times when Jackie the joke man quit Jackie wanted like a million dollars a year and they wouldn't give him a million dollars a year they were giving like nine hundred thousand he's like fuck you so he left and so when he left they had a bunch of guys sit in that chair and one of them was already and already wound up taking that job and part of Artie's job was to feed Howard lines and like that kid Benji he's really funny man that guy would he would write down stuff and feed Howard funny lines so he has a few guys on the side that would toss him stuff which is essentially what a politician does right a politician like you're not going to get their full unadulterated ideas except for Trump and that's one of the things that was so refreshing about your mouth even though I was a shitty message even though there's a poverty of words and the way he spoke and there was this clunkiness to it although certainly as a clunkiness there's no question about that it's a very very simplistic way of speaking compared to what we're used to from politicians yeah yeah ian's Mayans work I think there is something about it the fact that he was as as you were saying like completely unrestrained completely on you know there's something really interesting about Trump I mean the whole thing's really fascinating but it's like the most profoundly hilarious and interesting moment ever and like no one wants to appreciate it because they're so dug into like nuclear war with Koreans yeah well I get that that's kind of scary I mean it's more for like the people in Seoul than us but still like that is scary but the thing with Trump is that he speaks and you know it's like okay the people who hate Trump hate him more than any anyone I mean I've never seen a political leader hated as much as the people who hate Trump hate him right now no one in America for sure no no one known in my lifetime has in America has even come close I'm sure there are other countries where it's like you know some dictator falls yeah yeah I'm sure but like there but Trump is hated and I got to be honest if if you ask people on the left why they hate him I think they struggle to give you a really good honest answer for it I mean they'll say no I think they say things like racism or like bigotry or you know I'd say PA people were paying attention yes is doing yes sure short right they were worried about that although I gotta say the EPA thing I don't think any of this is actually the source of the Trump hatred I think this is like we hate Trump and now what's he doing there's no evidence so we go we're going to get evidence against him the truth is what they'll say nine out of ten times if I present this to a left-wing person or I'll go like you know he's pretty much continuing all the Obama policies or it's you know virtually the same which i think is one of the really big stories of the Trump era so far that how much is the same since Obama no one wanted change --is there's a big change I'm not saying there are no changes immigration policy in immigration policy he wrote one executive was expended write about courts but it hasn't really gone into effect but it's the idea that he's promoting his rhetoric is very very different no question about that he's promotes different ideas his rhetoric is very very different um but in terms of like monetary policy fiscal policy foreign policy the war on drugs the Stasi if you're talking about immigration I mean that's kind of okay I would get I'm putting that in domestic policy in my mind but yes well in foreign policy it speaking about because I was saying 9 out of 10 times the answer to me is they go well that's kind of your white privilege and if you were an if you were in one of these uh groups that's worried about being deported you would feel differently but the fact is that deportations are down right under Trump there were more under Obama I mean they're down now there's a few different arguments for why that reason is there have been a lot of arrests but but not deportations but it's just like even that the narrative isn't fitting the way like what really to me what really drove what made people hate Trump was his rhetoric it was all rhetoric it wasn't Obama was deporting lots of people Obama was bombing the crap out of em Obama was targeting families of and he was torturing like all these things were happening but he didn't talk about it he spoke about it in a nice way and Trump was like this unapologetic like white rich man who didn't play the PC game and spoke of minority is not in like a glowing I'm so sorry like minorities are better than me I'm the evil white guy it was like now we're great I never say we're great he would say you know some nice things about minorities when asked but his central message was like our team's great and this to me is I think the reason why left-wing people's blood boil well just so many pieces of evidence a point to corruption with Russia so many pieces of evidence that point to the idea that this guy is operating in the interest of himself in a big business and then he's profiting in a huge way off being the president and one of the ways they're doing that there is if they're not rolling back the Environmental Protection Agency standards because they don't believe in them they're rolling aback because it's impeding business that's infuriating a lot of people I'm sure shit out of people when you have some crazy old man who's just doing everything for profit some guy who wants to literally like start diss fights with basketball players and that host from that was the thing we talked about this before but the the host from ESPN who had tweeted all some stuff about him being a white supremacist and then he asked for ESPN to apologize like hey how come he didn't talk about her man he can't talk about her he can't can't say her name because if he goes after a black woman then it reinforces all these people's ideas right prejudice right no look III get what you're saying and just to the point about corruption I mean like of course I mean that's the nature of government like whatever decision they're making is based on what lobbyists is lobbying them the harder and when it's all corrupt but my point is just that that is not at all different with Trump I mean like if you like the corruption under Obama was I mean Obama just went and collected four hundred thousand dollars for a speech to Wall Street so he's in there just a couple months ago right don't they I'll do that was like like you're in there you preside over the bailouts of the banks started under Bush but continued under Obama and the big ones the Fed policy which really bailed them out like you're in there you take all this money for your campaigns you present you vote every way that they want you to you preside over the biggest profits for the big bankers you put them all around your administration then you get out and you collect your check it's like time to get rich now now someone check he's gonna get oh yeah speaking everywhere I mean maybe I'm wrong right I'm being too cynical probably all of those bankers just really love the way Obama speaks is you know I mean he is a great speaker but that's not why they're paying him Hillary Clinton is not agree and they paid her shit tons of money and that was one of things that Bernie said well there's the transcripts and you know what a transcript and of course she didn't but WikiLeaks did get their hands on one of them in which she said something that kind of indicated why she didn't release the transcripts because she actually said I'm lying to the public I mean not literally but she basically said to all these bankers to not be concerned about cuz you know she hurt public rhetoric at the time was like you know no one's too big to fail no banker too big to jail and then she basically said to them in this speech that WikiLeaks leaked the transcript of where she was like you know you have to take one public position and then hold a different position in private so she was basically assuring all I know that that's unaltered you know I mean it's kind of like the same way that we we know that all of the emails are legit like they've been presented even the Clintons aren't arguing very legitimate like nobody's really coming out and arguing that they're not legitimate and it and it seems to be from a Julian Assange is sort of shifting over time being more and more aggressive like his his position on things he's like a more he's more aggressive I'm more leaning one way like I think he's bummed out that he's still stuck over there I mean it's gonna be rotting him away sure but I think he's been kind of consistent it's almost like everybody else is like changing their tune like I feel like everyone at Stu me and the people who follow them and the Trump haters it's like insane how much they've changed their positions like to me Julian Assange was exposing all this bullshit under bush he exposes all the shit about Clinton and Obama and it was like yeah from my perspective they're all part of like the same network so he's kind of exposing the same network whereas like the Democrats became cold warriors like the Democrats as soon as Trump got in it's like well everything the CIA is taken without any evidence being project presented and Russia is the evil threat of our time and like when did you get you guys became Republicans from the 70s like just that quickly and and then every I even saw somebody today like it's like the Trump haters like again feel however you feel about Trump hate him sure like go ahead and be against like I said I think it's it's terrible that he's telling saying people should be fired for speaking up like that's ridiculous but I say these guys who are like they're like oh you want you know you want to talk about patriotism and and like bashing Trump for being a draft dodger when he likes wants he dodged it a fucktard dude if you dodged it dude whatever you did to stay out of the vietnam war god bless you God bless you for staying away from that fucking nightmare that was started on a lie that was like the most disgusting mass slaughter for profit I mean like if someone avoided that like you you're mad at him for avoiding going and killing some fucking poor people in Southeast Asia well it's just a point that they could grab him on hypocrisy of being a Chicken Hawk fine like like same as Dick Cheney they did it with him as well but it's not because he's at look I'm all for hitting someone for hypocrisy like if you're advocating a war hitting them on not wanting to fight a war but you're just mad at him for like not being on the same side of yours about police brutality it's like winning out his character they're pointing out who he is fine but don't example this guy he's not like JFK you went over and fought in the war I get what you're saying but I don't think there's I'm just saying if the left is gonna say to me it's kind of abandoning your own print if you're gonna bash someone for like not fighting in the video yeah you kind of know what they're doing they all do that they try to find something that you did that's kind of questionable that they can politicize yes did I get it I'm just making the same thing with like the Democrats becoming the cold warriors it's just like yes so whatever wins whatever gets two points what really gets me with the Democrats with the left is how all of a sudden Julian Assange is a puppet of Russia now like for the longest time WikiLeaks was supposed to be the voice of honesty this non you know non bipartisan sorta or bipartisan open-minded group that's just trying to disseminate information they think is critical to the American people that they're being denied like the casual would have called casualties what was that one video that they had there was a vid that one of the first videos was I forget what they called it but if they had a footage from one of those gunships on those helicopters they showed these guys sort of casually talking about gunning down these reporters they thought these reporters were carrying guns and so they just opened fire on them and gunned him down including lunch you know yeah I forget what it was called I forget but that that's sort of like they they felt like they had some information that people weren't aware of they weren't allowed to see photos of caskets they weren't allowed to get the full I they weren't allowed to have a really informed opinion and what exactly is happening there and when they see the horrors of war in that regard like we see people like sort of casually talking about gunning down some people and I think there are kids in their car well this shouldn't brought kids you know that was like one of the things they had said like that whole thing was like whoa we we are better off knowing that this is what can happen if you just allow people to just go to war and especially some really ambiguous war on terror that's what WikiLeaks stood for right thank you leaked stood for Chelsea Manning aka Bradley Manning you know releasing this information someone who is under a lot of people's eyes a patriot right a whistleblower see something gets a hold of some stuff and it's like look you guys got to see this and gives it out to WikiLeaks but try to give it out to other people right didn't didn't he try or she tried new york times and i believe so and then did the same thing huh and and then uh you know chelsea manning bradley manning at the time paid quite a price for it i think we have two hundred days in solitary this is a really brutal price yeah and yeah and exposed a ton of really interesting stuff i mean we what we learned from the bradley manning dump what's you know like all this crazy shit about war crimes and then like we learned about how there were like uh like US officials trying to like influence the british parliament trying to influence like reporters and just all this shady shit that came out and then again it's cut it becomes this kind of like integrity test for the mainstream media or they just have no interest in it I mean if they talk about it they'll talk about Chelsea Manning but that's the the story the same it Snowden's the story remote if it's ever like oh shit we learned some crazy shit that's going on well that's what we are we're a nation of gossip Kaepernick's of story not Puerto Rico you know a guy not standing up with his hand in the correct position that lets us know that we are all on one mindset right right that God is more important and even within that context and a lot of people like and this is where there's this we or disconnect between like there's like the mainstream media and then all of the alternative internet media right there certainly as a ton of bullshit in the alternative internet media world and a lot of just straight-up false stories sure but then there are people also talking about the truth there whereas none of that seems to enter the mainstream media so what doesn't what gets brought up online and in the alternative media which should be at the center of this story is that like like the the players didn't used to be on the field for the national anthem for like the vast majority n the Defense Department cuts these huge checks to the NFL and then all of a sudden they get the players out on the field so we can do this whole tribute thing and the military-industrial complex has been like working on taking this like pastime the number one sport in America which is already pretty like boring and and making sure we can use this as propaganda to get Americans you know into this nationalistic Pro military mindset and like no are you a journalist like how are you not interested in that right how was it how can Obama sign into the National Defense Authorization Act that he the right to detain American citizens with no charges and it's like okay like Alex Jones is over here and like yeah I know he says some some wild stuff but he is making a big deal about this like this is crazy and then the mainstream media just doesn't think it's a big story how is it possible that you're a journalist in honest journalist with integrity and you don't think it's a big story you don't look at that and go well that's the story of my lifetime Obama just repealed habeas corpus don't you think it's the exact same thing as what we were talking about with people in academia and on the left that don't look at things that are in opposition to the group think of their ideology I think it's a lot of that and it's like this thing where it's like there's this it's almost like unspoken unwritten pressure where you just kind of know it's like right you have this herd mentality and you know if I step out here I get bashed right and most people don't want to get bashed right like you know you were talking about the people who are professors mm-hmm and and there's certainly very very smart people lots of very very smart people but it is a certain personality type you know it's like that that that person who like that you go to school your whole life then you go to college then you go to grad school then you teach and you've basically just been in college your whole life did you see that video that woman at the Berkeley protests where she's screaming at the cops yes yes screaming the cop yeah see if you can find her because that is a social retard that's what she's asking them to go arrest people and arrest people they're Nazis and these are the type of people who never got into into like look how they're socially retarded yes I mean that's really literally what it is they never competed in the real world they didn't formulate a normal psychological outlook yeah but it was okay so there is that that woman who you're talking about and her and and oh yeah she's whatever whatever the Scientology whatever the top level is like I'm sorry that's it's left-wing level five you've achieved the height of those people are literally mentally disturbed yeah like these are woman with videos gone or not find it impossible will just want to stay go to 4chan find if I don't believe those geniuses at 4chan haven't kept this Jane she's at level 5 with liked Wrigley puffs and like those that one you like yelled out for more muscle at Missouri State yes these are like the the maximum level and most of those people are made up like genuinely disturbed people here she goes here give me something on this crazy bitch okay wasn't that at Milo's rally which is hilarious fuck I think this was Gavin yeah it was yeah cuz you say Crowd boys's get your proud boys uh she might work for his marketing too far as I know that's like the best branding she's still going we shut it off but she's still going I'm a fucking professor how dare are you so much to make a t-shirt from my perspective looking professor how dare you I'm a professor was not what you expected the next line to be a fucking professor how dare you so there's well you know but also from my perspective like as a libertarian you just look at that and you're like wow what a naked like example up you're just calling the state calling the authority of the state because you believe this ridiculous microaggression like but you know whatever her the way she's behaving and that's not a balanced healthy person what I was describing with the college professor I wasn't talking about those people like that's level five disturbed that top people change here like my choral belt in jujitsu yes that's that's like it's not even like that not even black belt that's like next next level like cool yeah you tap out black belt coral and then red belt is like noam chomsky red belt right red Chomsky's a red bow yeah but noam chomsky is actually like an intellectual I don't want to lump it with these but any chain left-wing ideologies but this is like some Hicks and Gracie shit these these people she's more retarded she's like more of a kung fu person she's got ineffective martial arts she's trying to get people with that cheat touch like a guy with like just an overhand right could probably take you like you'd like to see her like in an MMA fight with cyborg there's still the mean nothing better I know you've you've got over a bunch of your show before but there's nothing better to me than someone really believing in a martial art that doesn't work and finding out in a fight doesn't know it was amazing through the early UFC is when it used to happen it'll still you'll find internet videos that have is still going on 2016 and 17 there's been some of the best videos ever especially out of China or they had that one guy had to go into hiding he brained some fucking poor slob too thought he knew kung fu you know some dude really thought he was gonna cheat touch this guy and he got he this Chinese kid who knows MMA fucked this guy up and had to go into hiding because so many people are mad at him for using martial arts techniques that did not originate in China to sort of denigrate Chinese martial arts and yeah myth versus reality oh it's interesting they are fighting against the exposing of their bullshit nonsensical fucking Tiger Claw and you've got an entire identity associated with this being real I mean while the guy who did is also Chinese so China is apparently like Asia in particulars where a lot of the martial arts techniques that people use today originated and they were sort of adapted and they were changed and they evolved particularly in Thailand they really started understanding how to kick the legs and they became masters that using the elbows and the knees more so than and they did it through competition which is really quite fascinating they did it through gambling and by having these competition on a regular basis where people were like 9 10 years old they start fighting and they fight they might have hundreds and hundreds of fights in their career by the time they retire they developed a real acute understanding of what actually works or what doesn't work whereas in these other worlds they didn't do that they didn't have they weren't like this small island is filled with hedonists that are gambling kicking each other in the legs and betting on the guy kicking the guy that's really what developed that art but then there's other ones that sort of stayed in this non evolved state and then as the material sort of got out to all of the world and people started evolving the techniques it all coalesced together in the Ultimate Fighting Championship and then we realized ok it's a combination of these things doesn't necessarily always work on every individual and styles sort of style sort of determined interactions and athletes determine whether or not something is effective or ineffective as much as the technique itself the athleticism speed and power of the practitioner is very important but all told these are the things that we think are pretty effective yeah like these are the standard techniques yeah new information but you figure out pretty quickly like ok like wrestling and you know crane kicks are not the same thing right one one guy used Western boxing techniques and Muay Thai and wrestling and jiu-jitsu and just beat the holy fuck of this poor I mean did it like 10 seconds beat the holy fuck out of this poor kung fu guy and then he had to go into hiding people didn't want to know they didn't want to know this is white power white power the white power guy goes in there and gets fucking murk by Anthony Joshua like shit how is this possible right well of course it happened did you not know who you were do you not know who he is you know you're in denial of this and so if they all came after Anthony Joshua because he beat the shit out of the white power boxer that's exactly what's going on in China watch it here so you this guy wears poor fucking do it you could just already yeah he's got some crane technique going on and the kid just fucking starts beating the shit out of a boom boom boom boom just fucking pummel him unconscious knuckles to the temple literally it happens all in like 10-15 seconds this kid just kicks his shit out of them and then after this happens I mean a guy who doesn't get hit like he's never been hit before you know yeah you know he's not like used to even like being in this situation but he must have believed that it was gonna work he must have believed that he was capable of fending off attacks I'm I don't and he's doing that crazy shit with her like trying to you know it's I don't remember in hmmm it was a guy I can't remember his name is like some really really Asian name but the dude of thought Nick Diaz you called the fight it was like back then old Nick Diaz fight before he let the UFC and the guy tried this crazy technique he tried like hands out here I'm gonna like blockier punches with punches there is like a short asian dude you know of Tony Ferguson I think you know know Kuno it's 100 percent of Nick Nick and my pupil yes kikuno you called it and I remember you being I remember you saying during the thing you were like you say before the fight you go this is really weird he was doing this stuff before like in the Octagon warm-up mm-hm and he comes out like doing it and you're like okay he's gonna try to fight Nick Diaz with this weird style like where he's trying to whatever it's doing like this kind of like like style of trying to block by like hitting their hands with your hands way out pull up Nick Diaz is a record I'm remembering Tony Ferguson fighting this guy who's a bad motherfucker and pride and his name's kikuno and he used to fight like that pull-up twenty Ferguson's record see if you could find that video Tony Ferguson versus cuckoo knows yeah it's not I don't think it's heady though that fight I don't remember I don't remember Tony Ferguson he's been around for a while Tony lit him up so what it was was that kikuno was a guy that had this crazy kick that he would throw to the body and fuck a lot of people up with it and it was kind of a hybrid between a front kick and a roundhouse kick like some people would call it a 45 yeah Katsunori kikuno and he kod him yeah I think that's the fight you're thinking of man no I'm telling you like this he pull up Nick Diaz what Nick Diaz it's a different guy I think yeah but it's the guy I was like that it was a similar type of style but the guy was saying I was like real short too and I mean Nick Diaz just it was like the worst guy to fight with that style cuz he's got like real Chris boxing right so he just came at me and just lit him up like next a lot of guys last fight in his first run UFC so its up way before this no no does I'm sorry down down from this yes was down so it's before yes it's his first run in the UFC so it's uh it may be before the losses claisen gender right there before Diego Sanchez that's it oh that guy koji click on it kouji kishi mmm no there's no ass there oh yeah Oh II she is that I said I think you're right koji Oishi yeah maybe oh okay and Nick Diaz I remember his kid I remember saying this kid looks like he's on heroin like he walked in like like almost like in a zombie state as he walked into the Octagon it was really strange just click on that right there yeah that's Nate this is a different is it Nate yeah and then knew this was in the UFC but and that's it's the vine of it is there I don't know I guess they both thought yeah this is the fight I'm talking about he's like trying to do this open-handed weird thing I mean I'm sure it's on the UFC see if you can find Tony Ferguson versus kikuno that's a weird one cuz kikuno he had this weird style like almost like like well you would think of as a guy who knows karate like move forward like you know like standing like totally square not sideways like moving full rights weird way and he would throw this kick and it wasn't a front kick up the middle it was like an angled front kick so he'd hit you with the ball with his foot but he would throw it like a roundhouse kick which was one of the ways that they used to do that in the old Taekwondo way too they would make impact with the ball the foot with a roundhouse kick like they would throw a kick like I got a book when I was a kid about Taekwondo techniques and this one old dude would practice in the park by kicking trees and the way he would kick trees is with the ball of his foot you throw a roundhouse kick and kick the ball of his foot into the tree and it was what it was really funny book because in one one of the things where he described all various self-defense techniques he described what to do if you ever threatened by someone and one things you should do is kick a tree so show them like if you kick a tree what you could do to them try in the actually bad advice it's just break your leg just kick it trick no but I'm saying like if you've not used together he hits see if you gain back data who see if you back it up but that's it it's only a 10-second video okay kikuno was uh he this is also another one of those guys where let that play play out a little video you were just showing he was one of those guys that was in a shit ton of fights so see that was that was back when he was competing in karate I think that's killke yeah kioku shin and so they fought with kyo kitchen outfits on but they had an MMA fight and the guy who was the referee was dressed up in a fucking weird sort of geisha outfit like what the fuck's that guy wearing but kikuno was uh like sort of a classic japanese martial art striker that's that's him right there okay and you got to think by the time these guys got to the UFC they had been brained so many fuckin times especially fighting in Pride and k1 oh yeah shit boom front kick to the body right hand that's a wrap oh this dude is fucked check this out again man watch how he do this just stuff it was a different fight yeah oh tournament probably which is really crazy that these guys would do this more than one time in a day but that was what they did in Pride a lot oh he just threw him off the top of the mat in Pride they would fight several times a day yeah early ufc's as well and then it like eventually I think they started realizing like a lot of guys get injured doing this the craziest ideas like that stupid movie warrior when they fought more than one time in a week like they fought once and they fought again the next day that's got to be worse than the same day probably because you're like yeah all the soreness that like comes in two days later your fucking face is all swollen you can't see if two sunglasses everywhere and you definitely can't take a punch like the whole idea is so stupid and they don't do that I mean maybe they've done that a couple of times throughout history but that's not a standard thing in this movie warrior they just added their own Hollywood jizz to the soup like let me just change it you're gonna fight for the face brother in an image grab my balls that's what they did they added their own stupidity to it just didn't even make any sense and it was totally unnecessary like that that's you can't you're changing what martial arts are just to fit your narrative yeah because you're not a good writer like if you if you were a good writer you would write about how it actually happens and you'd make a story about how it actually happens you wouldn't create some fake thing that you can do something that could be real yeah several times in a day twice two days in a row you'd be fucking me well it's like just just give him like superpowers at this point just give him like ha dude games and stuff if you're gonna decide what you are are you an excellent dramatic movie with Nick Nolte and Tom what the fuck's his name who's the other guy the fuck his name no no no no how dare you the young guy who's Bane Tom Hardy Tom Hardy that motherfucker is amazing right it's him and Nick Nolte I mean they're amazing but yet they put in this stupid plot idea where they have to fight in two days oh yeah I'm on just come on it's like I it's annoying because it's like you're making this world real and then you're doing something that's like just my little ridiculous yeah and it makes it impossible for someone like you to enjoy it's like if anyone who knows fighting Canada which by the way I will say and I do even when we talk about old-school UFC there's something like that like I'm nostalgic for it I know you can't have it now it has to be the sport it is now and it's evolved way past there but there was just something so cool about the old UFC right and there was something about the Conor verse fight that almost gave you that feeling again yeah like these two guys from different worlds going in there and like how does this look like how does the guy he was doing MMA striking and fucking doing like a plate of stuff on the side how does he go in there and box and then it turned out Conor actually was just like I know you got a box can't do any of that stuff you get destroyed so I just went out there and boxed and but it wasn't interesting like I came out of it I was arguing a lot of friends of mine who were like big boxing fans and nothing against you guys god bless boxing I'm not like as big a fan as I used to be I'm a huge MMA fan but I just can't like when you look at MMA the way you look at MMA is like the sport of fighting and and the original thing was always figuring out who's better at fighting and having these it was just hard for me to not look at the fight with Conor and and and Floyd and go like you know it's like when there was the first clinch at Lewis J Gomez said this to me is the first clinch of the fight he goes well that's where Connor would destroy him yeah and then you just sit there watching ten rounds of a referee saving Floyd Mayweather's life like every few seconds the referee comes in and goes oh let me save your life no let me save your life I don't you're the greatest ever at this but you need even under your rules with your gloves and your this you need a ref to keep coming in and saving your life every few seconds and you'd see it like every time they they clinch like Connor would immediately almost just instinctually just like kind of take his back and like step over here you know cuz right here is where I can hit you and you can't avoid would just cover up and bend over yep like literally bend over like a guy come save my life buddy yeah and it's just hard like to not watch letting go oh if he wanted to he would jump on his back and choke him to death and even even in your sport like he went ten rounds and okay I know Mayweather I know what Mayweather did was brilliant and he dragged a man he played it safe and perfectly but it wasn't a part of the plan to eat that uppercut on the chin that definitely wasn't a part of the plan and and and also I think there's boxers punch a lot harder than MMA guys do and there's there's truth to that too so Conor's power didn't translate in the way that MMA fans thought it would he's just not quite as fluid and also I think he's probably very nervous I mean he's fighting literally the greatest fighter of all time in his first professional boxing session it's so crazy and yet he still got it through the 10th round if Floyd I mean I this is why I said I said I gave Conor of winning a boxing match very small so I thought it was like 94% that Floyd would beat the shit out of Conor the way he did and that Conor would eventually like get tired like the guy who did the best assessment of it in my opinion was John Danaher John Danaher who's a brilliant jiu-jitsu coach is also a brilliant MMA coach kids get a deep understanding of it he basically spelled out exactly what's gonna happen because of all the times he's seen a boxers sparring with elite martial artists that the mixed martial arts does well for a few rounds because it takes a while for the boxer to figure out the timing and then the efficiency and fluidity of the boxer starts to take over the reign generalship the understanding of this one isolated particular discipline and then they dominate and that's exactly what happened to a tee what I said is I think there's a 94% chance that Floyd Mayweather just boxes the shit out of Conor McGregor there is a four percent chance that Conor catches him with like an uppercut like he did in the first round and actually stuns him and hurts them and then swarms on him and takes him out Conor's got ferocious power it's whether or not he executed that power like he has an MMA whether he felt he could drain his gas tank like that especially with two months worth of training not enough not enough to get in shape for a 12-round boxing match against the greatest of all time but there was a 100% chance that Conor nukes him in a fucking MMA fight nukes him like I would yeah I'd be willing literally 100 I cuz Floyd's not gonna knock him out with one punch and Conor could kick his fucking legs out from under him before he got even close enough to punch him and if they did get to a clinch which they absolutely would Connor would ragdoll him to the ground and beat his fucking brains in before he strangled them on 1% like 100 percent even if you just look if you just take out even grappling I agree with you that I just thought as a master of range and he's got excellent kicks and he can kick the shit out of him and stay out of the area where he's you know just stay out of his punching range and kick him in the legs on the body you can clinch if you don't break him up when he doesn't get oh nice the body done fucked yeah you're fucked in elbows to the head he's gonna tie you up the back of the head and smash you does that ever happened no never you don't know what the fuck to do when the guys doing that you don't know how to deal with those knees to the face like when Anderson Silva fucked up Rich Franklin to win the title when he just plumb the back of his head and just start smashing knees in his face and he was clear that rich really didn't know he didn't have an answer to that yeah which was an amazing thing because that was one of those moments like everyone in the MMA world thought rich was the best or not MMA world everyone in the UFC world kind of like thought was the best but I mean because your that's why I correct myself because people who knew the MMA scene better and pride and that stuff knew what Anderson Silva was but like the average fan of the UFC had just been we hadn't really seen Anderson Silva I had seen one or two tapes of him pride and I'd say I saw him like maybe dump rats on the one where he got ankle ankle locked real quick so I don't really know how good Anderson Silva was I saw I'd seen him beat Carlos Newton and that was like all I had on him I was like I'm Rich Franklin I'll probably well the pride fights the thing was when he out of pride and then fighting in cage wars for cage warrior what the fuck was that English I remember the one you're talking about no that's an English organization god damn it I want to say cage wars but it's not that cage warrior hmm the fuck do they call anyway he went over there and just started fucking Buchan people so like I didn't seen any of that yeah I'd seen any of that and I think I guess most UFC fans hadn't seen that either and they saw Rich Franklin is the champ yeah I'd beat up a bunch of guys the odds were actually in Anderson's favor though Oh were they yeah it's one of the weird ones where the oddsmakers when he fought Chris Leben he was a slight favorite his first UFC fight and I was like get ready for some crazy shit because this motherfuckers on a totally different level I'm like I knew him I'd seen him fight Jorge Rivera and leemarie I saw him hit Tony Ferguson with a step in upper cut elbow that his Brown he'd practice on a pillow at home he made his wife hold a pillow and practice his technique because he wanted to use it in his fights and his coaches wouldn't hold the pads for him because they thought it was ridiculous and they said is this true I think I remember hearing this but I think it was like in between rounds he said to one of his coach he goes I think it's open I think it's them they're like forget about the stupid technique dammit like it's not gonna be there I don't know if that's the case might be wrong about that I fucked up Tony Ferguson before that the reason why I was able to get that off is because he wasn't turned 21st excuse me um Tony Frick 'ln Tony Frick lanai yes yes my apologies 21st he fought Tony freaking he hit him with the standing stepping in uppercut with the elbow and he was like another level maybe three four five levels above fricking at the time yeah just so in fricking was a real veteran Brooklyn was in one of the first ufc's that I ever worked in 1997 he was there and so that was like his debut in the UFC I was there when he had his debut so Anderson was just lighting him on fire before he decided step in an uppercut him but I just knew he was on it's just such a different level but that was a really important learning moment for MMA cuz people knew like okay if you get in a fight and a guy is a more Thai practitioner on the level of Anderson Silva you better learn how to deal with this goddamn clinch here's Anderson versus Tony Franklin and this is Anderson in my opinion maybe his prime ever because he hadn't taken on all the damage and all the crazy fights that he had in the UFC and but by the time he got to Chris Weidman I mean he was in his 30s he's getting older or his body was starting to not perform the way it used to and then obviously he fucked up and stood in front of Y being got left hooked in the head Y was clowning him and then it slots over to come back when you're 40 now yeah I've taken these losses but it's my time back then was so fuckin tight and it was just so levels above what everyone else was doing oh yeah they just didn't belong in there with him like look how he's moving around just sort of like feeling out Tony trying to find out what Tony's capable of trying to decide when to move I mean he really is like a spider because he's setting up the web and he's moving around eventually he's gonna sting you and you know it's come in and you know by the time you're moving at him look at that boom one two starts kicking you and now he's coming after you oh shit bitch now you know there's a big difference between the two of you and it just feels like like even if you don't know anything about fighting you just know there's levels here like you can just see it everything he does in this fight it's like fucking pretty perfect he steps in look at this beautiful type on his control the neck and head was spectacular look at that boom and he's bigger than all these guys stronger than them like knees to the body man and Frick land it's fucking throwing down man he's doing his best he was a warrior but you'd see it when he would be when he went up and fought at 205 and he'd be in the clinch with like dawn or and forest I felt like these guys couldn't do anything to him so these guys are likes just he's already fucked here because he's eating a bunch of really hard shots to the body and even though he's moving okay he's like really compromised here look at that beautiful right hook and then left kick left low kick and Anderson fought a lot from the southpaw stance he could fight from any position he wanted to but he fought a lot from the southpaw stance which is also an advantage to a lot of people it's amazing about MMA guys make it look like Sun means easily his arms gone limp I mean that was this boom boom wow dude it's nuts it's nuts just the way he moves watch him step in here though man is so crazy why this step in my elbow first time ever at MMA that was Anderson in his prime and the cool and it was one of those moments where particularly you have like I've had a lot in watching MMA where it when someone comes in and beats someone else at their strength right and then you have to like reorganize your mind we were like oh I thought that guy was like because fried like this guy's like got really great hands he's a really good striker and then like a guy like that lets you know like oh there's like another world we know it's like levels you got these guys like the Chinese kung-fu guy and then you have all these different levels these like steps along the way in the spectrum and then you've got like Muay Thai of Anderson but then you've got like Muay Thai of sanchow in Thailand it's like several levels past Anderson cow and Rob deck Ramon Ramon Decker's and Rob came in and other the greats you know Ernesto who's these guys are like even further past that you know there's all these crazy crazy crazy levels to this thing and you know when you see a guy like Anderson you see just like for the first time it was in the UFC where you have like legitimate world class maybe not the best ever and more time but legitimate world class Muay Thai skills watching them fight that's like a professional Muay Thai fighter and it seems to me like for whatever reason I think because in its on its own it works better in a real fight so the grappling stuff in MMA like pretty quickly we got very high-level grapplers pretty quickly like I mean from the first UFC you've got the best Jiu Jitsu guys at the time or at least one of a representative of the Gracie's and then uh you know you got Olympic level wrestlers in there pretty quickly like I mean it was it wasn't too long before like Dan Severn and Mark Coleman and guys like that who had like legit wrestling credits came in but it took a long time before you got like really really high-level strikers so I get Maurice Smith was the guy who's really the flirt was the first yeah go back to that go back to that fight again here's something that's interesting to point at is bas Rutten was one of the early guys to Victor Maurice there weren't too many besides that like it those guys were like a few who actually because it took so much to learn all the other shit right the difference team boss and Maurice was that Maurice is more of a tactician and boss was a destroyer he was like an intelligent animal he would just like attack like vicious ferocious striking you know but real aggressive but also very technical as well whereas Maurice is much more clever like leg kick dependent like Maurice is actually on a higher level in terms of like professional kickboxing than boss bas didn't have like a lot of kickboxing fights Maurice was a world champion okay boss had that Holland style and as an MMA fighter he was like one of the first guys we ever saw that could kick so fucking hard but if you if you watch this fight what you learn is like what Conor McGregor figured out what Conor McGregor figured out is that what holds a lot of these guys back is movement and see if you look at Tony fricken as he's moving towards Anderson his movement he's very limited like he can't he can't cover distance quick enough he has to make these little hop steps hop steps right just slide in and blast things Conor is fluid with his movement in and out to the point where he can step forward and obviously wouldn't be able to do that with Anderson Silva but he can step forward and step in and step out like when he fought Jose Aldo one of the most important parts of that fight was that Aldo was trying to figure out the movement of Conor like go to go to that fight Jose Aldo vs Conor McGregor and what what Conor was doing so good was sliding forward and sliding back there's like that one moment it cuz it's a very short fight but there's the one moment where he like faints a thing and jumps back right here see yeah yeah see how happy but look how like he's in and out he's moving a lot and it's it's a different thing boom slides back and drops the fucking left hammer on his chin and it's that movement that's so critical in a really high level look how fluid its back and launches that punch at the same time it's very interesting to me too because it was a different intensity in his movement than like when he fought other guys like Chad Mendes another because he respected what Aldo throws Aldo throws heat and especially in that first round when Aldo's furious at you for disrespecting him out like he knows he's coming with like a bomb but yeah just but it's superior movement it's also new unorthodox movement boom I mean a lot of ways they've been doing that shit karate tournaments forever right but people hadn't figured it out in MMA yet I mean if you look at a lot of what Connor had done with his stance and his movement a lot of it resembles what you see in the karate point tournaments when they would leap in and drop a shot on you and leap out but they weren't fighting stationary people like although they just charge forward but although got used to fighting in that man yeah fighting more time yeah isn't that kind of MMA look at the wrestling look you know it's really fascinating to me just aren't this kind of evolution was a god what's his name us so who know the the guy fought to mitra fights like him yeah now suddenly adopted this style and you're like holy shit this style gives people real problems I'm a man and it's like I get I mean maybe I'm wrong about this but it reminds me a little bit of almost like Machida type thing like but it's like this it's this weird karate kind of thing that it's like this weird evolution wake once you have all the other shit and what Connor does is he's also got really good traditional boxing so like like not a lot of MMA guys couldn't do 10 rounds with Mayweather there yeah you know like it's he's also got boxing so he can kind of mix it up with like traditional boxing attacks and this crazy other shit so it's crazy about him as he'll be like throwing like like these crazy spinning like cartwheel kicks and then he'll just have like a one-two that was like perfect mm-hmm which that's new to MMA we haven't seen a lot of that in the past then you know it's those kicks are longer too you're dealing with something that reaches much further than the traditional Muay Thai techniques or or straight boxing techniques he's throwing sidekicks he's his head is so far away from you when he's thrown a sidekick if he lands if he's touching you in the chest a sidekick there's no opportunity for you to counter punch she's way over there he's bent sideways his head is way out of reach you might be able to catch him with a kick if he comes forward after he drops the sidekick if you're in range but you might get pushed back there's a lot of factors involved to fighting a guy who fights like that and so who does figure that out and then he just dropped some bombs on Wilson Hayes that is which is you know I mean obviously like you know Demetrius Johnson is like head and shoulders above above everybody everybody else and he made quick work of him yeah but that was like at least to me like a little like glimpse of like oh well maybe if this guy is this good a grappler and is figuring striking out like that maybe he's the guy who could you know like be a good a good contender it may may happen very well I mean he might challenge him one day but what Henry cejudo represents is like extreme talent a real sponge for knowledge and information and he's got a guy that's in his division that's the King that's in my opinion the greatest martial artists of all time I don't think there's anybody that's been a better representation of what's possible in modern martial arts better than Mighty Mouse because he just doesn't get hit and he fucks everybody up and you can't hit him man he's coming at you and they're all sudden he's over here and then you got an E in your body and then you got punched in our face and you're trying to figure out what the fuck's happening all sudden you're on your back and he's dropping hammer fists on you and you by the time you're reacting to that he's got you in an armbar you're like what the fuck just happened to me yeah it's hard to argue enrolled he fights like he's a specialist at every discipline yeah like it's like he's like like you feel like he could beat all the specialists at their discipline I mean it's like what George st. Pierre used to kind of do but uh yeah I didn't modern MMA and more dominant not going to decisions destroying everybody he's about to break the record if hard to argue about to you know who knows rebirth you're right you're right I shouldn't grant him evicting Weidman knock-down Anderson Silva nobody saw that coming this is a crazy sport oh it's not it is a crazy sport and it's like it seems like nobody can escape it right like it's like it takes the toughest most invincible person you can think of and like Anderson Silva with a ninja and untouchable ninja and then you see him crying in the center of the ring with like a shadow I'm not shattered but whatever you know split up shinbo I mean it's like it's Chuck Liddell like all these guys came you know saw Junior dos Santos drop a bomb on Cain Velasquez and Kane collapsed you like Wow and then can he get chaos and then Junior dos Santos yeah at that point then I was like well after that you're like I guess we're living in Junior dos Santos his world I mean those guys destroyed everyone and then to watch him get nuked by Kane and the rematch just came back and beat the fuck out of him but Kane the first fight really probably should have been fighting but it was the first big fight on Fox and he had a fucked up name it didn't move right and he's the only it out of the way his only two losses were when he was coming off an injury I believe he was coming off an injury against Fabricio Werdum as well well he was always coming off injuries by that as a problem but the real problem the Fabricio Werdum fight was that he didn't prepare in Mex city goes Mexico cities at 7500 feet above sea level which is where I was in Utah last week I couldn't imagine if you didn't train there that you could be adapted to it the way Fabricio was cuz Fabrizio was smart he was there for like I think a couple months yeah sea level training doing his entire camp in Mexico like way even above 7500 I think he got up to the eight thousands yeah it seemed in the fight like that made a big difference pretty hard to argue because Cain is known as being the cardio King Fabrizio no knock on his cardio but that's not what he's known for he's not known for being like the card and and to see him outlast him it was like oh yeah that's uh that's um well it's almost like Cain had so much confidence in his cardio because this is what he's been no enforcement's like before he got in the UFC yeah it's like he's got this unbelievable tank that he was like now I'll be fine with that and it didn't work out okay but I'll say and I know he's an injury case but like the Cain Velasquez that showed up to UFC 200 that fought Travis Browne yeah I don't see any heavyweight beating that guy well I don't know Fabricio beat him I mean I don't know if he would be able to beat him again but see the things Fabrizio his striking improved radically and he's got long reach he's a big tall guy and he strongest fuck and if you take him down good god everybody found if there's another argument for anybody being the greatest heavyweight of all time besides Kane its Fabrizio and Fabrizio might have a better argument because Fabrizio submitted all the greats he submitted fedor emelianenko submitted Minotauro Nogueira submitted Cain Velasquez I mean Fabrizio submitted fucking everybody he's got some amazing wins amazing runs yeah if he didn't get Kayode by steep a and fighting out of composure he was fighting very emotionally he's creating steep a I mean just got wild he was in Brazil he wanted to fucking get after it you know he's pumped up there in Brazil he's the heavyweight champ he's fired up but I think he might have underestimated what a bad motherfucker stipa Miocic is and how the steep eight could do the same thing connor did slide away and drop that right hand like steep a he's a fucking elite he pays a monster he's a monster I think I I slept on him a little bit too much for a long time but no you see it you know he's he's proved it like his last fight I mean but I was blown away how reckless is Ottoman I think he just charged him like straight on charge them that's a dangerous way to fight any MMA fighter yeah it was like modern day he made a mistake and I think he made that mistake because he got caught before that I think he got clipped before that he got emotional because he got clipped and he tried to just like really ramp it up and overcompensate like if you watched that fight before steep ain't knocks him out he catches him a couple of times yes he pays a sharp boxer very very sharp hands and he catches you on the chin oh we could put people away obviously he's putting everybody away now put away Alistair Overeem arguably the greatest striker who ever fought in MMA you know k1 grand prix champion strike four shot drums really dropped and got right back up and rock them out you know that's like yeah that's pretty impressed fucking animal yeah and when I was talking to him after the fight he thought he got kicked I can't remember he got punched yeah it was all he was like what the fuck happened usually wasn't sure he's like all I know is i won yeah well both of them thought they want he's at highest level so far you know steep a in his athleticism his ability to move his ability to overcome obstacles like junior had kicked the shit out of his leg to the point we had this giant hematoma on his shin they still knocked him out yeah that was that was a very interesting fight I mean it was super quick but it was like a lot of action super quick now I do the more I'd love to see a healthy cane come back and fight I just think yeah I don't know what the extent of his injuries are and why he's been sidelined so long and you'd have to talk to him personally but what I'm hoping is that I know a lot of it was back issues and shoulder issues he had shoulder surgery knee surgery back surgery and he had several surgeries so it's just that style is so aggressive and so physically dependent I mean he's just so fucking overwhelming that a lot of it is like mental toughness the mental toughness to push past everybody right sometimes your body just can't keep up right and so like right in general probably every high level MMA UFC fighter at this point I mean what they're doing to their body what they're putting their body through is and a lot you know I mean it's like it's like really pushing yourself to the absolute limit constantly then as you mentioned his style is particularly you know like kind of physical physical and he comes from a camp that's notoriously a very very tough those guys are like known for like getting in Wars and like really really training hard yes oh I'm sure all of that shit doesn't it's too bad because if cain't caned had such amazing cardio and great footwork and beautiful striking technique as well as like real elite wrestling technique if Kane fought more in a Mighty Mouse sense it's just one of the reasons what made Mighty Mouse so good is that like if Kane used his cardio not in like a blunt way but more in a surgical way right you know if Kane like in the Junior dos Santos fight in particular he caught him like real early in the second fight and clipped him in the right hand and hurt him rocked him and just decided to maul him just got all over him a Malda but he took a lot of damage in the process they both did they both hit each other and he came overwhelmingly dominated the fight but he wasn't it wasn't the way Mighty Mouse does my house doesn't get hit yes there and then he's here and then you're getting hit you know and then he's on your clinch and then boom you get a need in the chin and then boom you're getting elbowed and then boom you're getting tripped and then he's just doing things he's got this repertoire of possibilities that no one else has whereas Cain just had this ferocious attitude powerful striking an ungodly cardio just coming at you bitch here we go yeah it's kind of like women things Mayweather was talking about I see him like in a few different interviews leading up to the Conor fight but just talking about the fact like it's a crazy thing that like it does almost seem like fans like the guy who takes a lot of head damage more yeah like they don't like the guy who avoids those wars and avoids that strength yeah but it's like you sit there and look at the way Muhammad Ali left and the way Floyd Mayweather is leaving oh yeah and it's like okay I get it the fans love rope-a-dope more but like I don't know yeah Floyd going out beating Conor is really the perfect way to do it too because you know he really didn't take much damage in that fight I took one good solid uppercut in the first round and then kind of like took over so he gets his big 50th win and then really gets the show that it's really about boxing it's not about slugging and standing there but when people talk about him they don't talk about him with the same reverence that they talk about like Arturo Gatti and Micky Ward because they weren't more entertaining like the people that get entertained you know by the style the fight are the wild crazy slugger love those guys you know I mean we all love those guys like I mean who doesn't love you know Travis Brown vs. Andre Arlovski like a fight like that I mean it's it's like the grass and to see things like to see somebody come back yeah after getting like like there's something incredible about that it's like it's it's an amazing thing that mm8 like when you were talking about steeping not knowing whether it was a kick or a punch it's this amazing thing that MMA does where you find out like someone's true character when they're in a storm you know I'm like how they come and that's amazing but if you are that person you know it's just a little bit different like there's human elements involved too and like you got a family you got kit you want to think for the rest of your life you want to like and how can you argue with Floyd I mean the guy made the most money and took the least damage yeah and as the best record I mean you argue with that and figured out a way to neutralize really dangerous people like Canelo Alvarez I mean forget about the Conor fight he was out you know Connors obviously outmatched but if you look at his fights with really elite knockout artist like Manny Pacquiao neutralized him Canelo Alvarez neutralized him I mean pretty much everybody he fought you just thought of a style that was more entertaining because you wanted him to lose right you know his like his his brilliance was that he got you to hate him so that you would buy a fight hoping that the guy was gonna kick his ass so real I remember doing this thing I was on I was on a radio show that Brian Stann called into there's like it's an MMA radio show on Sirius radio that they used to use me on sometimes and Brian Stann called in he was just talking about like I forget what the topic at first it was like Joe Silva had just left and he wasn't matchmaking anymore and he just started talking about how like how tough the job is imagine making and how much it fucks with you when someone gets knocked out real bad and then you're like oh maybe I should have made that match you know what I mean like you kind of like oh maybe I threw someone in the wrong time and I was kind of like oh man that's a human element I really never think about yeah in that job and then he we were talking about GSP coming back and he was like yeah you know I just don't think Gia's peach come back like what's he got to prove and what's it gonna do you know why risk the the brain damage you know and then it's like this weird thing like you never think about that as a fan but when you start meeting the guys and they actually become people like I met Michael Bisbing and Lois doesn't show with him they do a podcast believe I believe you may really great podcast uh how did they do it through Skype yeah they Skype I believe yeah so he's in LA and Louis is in New York they Skype it and then like when they're on the coast we'll do it together but uh but so you know like you get to know I'm like hang a few times and like your friends in line and you're kind of like oh yeah no I don't want to see you go fight one of these killers right they just fight GSP and then retire after that dude like what are you doing yeah you've had a great career you're the champ you get a huge money fight now you're great at that commentating thing it's like when you know someone personally it's a little bit more like ah not dude just uh but when you're just a fan it's like alright I want to see you fight you all Romero and then we're the car and then this guy and that but like when you know somebody like monster I don't know hopefully yes that's it might makes my job way harder if I like the guy I imagine and I know it's gonna be a mismatch like you find out somebody you really care for he's gonna fight somebody that is just gonna light him up and you're like how you gonna win this you know that very public moment with Brendan Shaw but it was a very interesting compelling moment because it's like a thing where it's like yeah you're like you're talking to your friend you're also a yeah I talking to a good friend who I knew as a good friend was already one foot out the door and had a bunch of other things that were going on and was one of the rare guys that has massive potential to do things outside the sport yeah he's killing it right yeah and I was right look I mean he's smashing it with his podcast smashing it with the fighter in the kid podcast he doesn't count there's a match in it with his live touring it was amazing to see him he did a fucking great job on all the stuff leading up to Conor Conor Brides like he was excellent he was like the only MMA analyst who was in there kind of break and shit down right no yeah it's like it's like why so all that to just have one or two more fights and maybe take some real bad really AC one thing if he really wanted to do that like if he was obsessed and that's what he wanted to do he wanted to win the heavyweight title and that was what 100% of his focus was and but he wasn't there I mean maybe he was when he first started his career and oftentimes your motivation shifts you get knocked out a few times and he had been knocked out several times by then he got knocked out by Minotauro he got knocked out by Big Ben Rothwell he got smashed by Travis Browne he got knocked out by Roy Nelson in either out cold knockouts so like there was so many of them and I was seeing it so often and then towards the end I was noticing just a lack of enthusiasm it wasn't the same those it wasn't the same fire that allowed him like knock out Mirko Cro Cop there wasn't the same sort of intensity you you told me last time I was on the show that you've experienced that smart guys have a tougher time yeah coming back from getting knocked out cuz I found that really interesting maybe that's part of the case with him it's like it's hard to avoid knowing the information yeah well certainly I mean if you're a person who being you could be a smart person just compartmentalize things and figure out how to control the variables in your mind and just be refocused on what you're doing it's not to say that people who come back aren't smart but I think I mean people it's not to say also the people who don't who fight aren't smart because a lot of people think of fighters is not being smart I think that's not true at all I think there's a lot of people who fight who aren't smart but I think the people who excel have exceptional mind power as well as physical power I think some of them are very very various you only like like a guy like a dominant Cruz it's like a very sad guy I mean those guys like that very intelligent guy and then when you go to champions like Mighty Mouse is super smart he's a very very articulate guy and doesn't show any damage at all yeah I mean I'm sure there are some meatheads also out there but you know it's it's certainly like a mix it's a yeah yeah Carlos Condit he's another one there's a lot of guys who fight that just aren't like that though a lot of guys who are just like super aggressive and they just do well and they kick ass and you know the guys who know that they're experiencing traumatic brain injury they they understand the consequences are you they're unavoidable unless there's some new medical breakthrough that allows you to heal CTE which is super possible yeah absolutely I mean if you described the medical breakthroughs we have now 50 years ago you'd be talking about you know magic so yeah my good buddy Steve Graham was on the US Ski Team like in the 1980s and he had scars when I first met him he had already had like I mean in his life I want to say he's had more than 20 knee surgeries and I think I'm being super conservative because I think it's way more than that I think he literally had he's had 50 surgeries including eye surgeries he's had shoulder surgery everything but when I met him his knees were so fucked up he had these big slices up and down the side of his knees so they had opened him up and tried to screw things back together again from skiing just mangling his knees in the old days of skiing and those same operations today I have one on this knee you can't even see the scar it's little tiny dots because they did it arthroscopically and they put in a cadaver unit and in the heel in six months I was doing jujitsu again no pain there's no loss of range of motion everything feels stronger than it felt before so like that's just the medical science that occurred in 20 years we have 20 years from his operation to my operation what's it gonna be 20 years from now it's totally possible they'll develop some sort of stem-cell technique to regenerate brain tissue yeah well this is why I think it's so it's so crazy the both human history we're at where were like guys if we can just not kill each other yeah for like another couple years we might do some really beautiful amazing shit right like we really might we might you know really why it's crazy that one of our big threats is North Korea yeah because that represents like one of the oldest styles of running a country ever yeah and it's really um I do I do I think Trump's been really bad on that issue and like that's fucking that is terrifying I was really happy when you had Michael malleus on because I've learned a lot about North Korea from that he's great yeah he knows so much about it his book dear readers excellent it's an s it's an excellent book and he's just a fascinating human being yeah guy but it's you know it's like you have as we were saying before like it's like a hostage situation but the guy holding the hostages has nukes which makes that like a very different type of hostage situation and he's shooting them in the sky yeah but also duds over Japan yes yes but there also is like people because again the media which just absolutely has a blind spot for like the military-industrial complex and the horror of American wars so you get you don't get the full picture I think like it to me it's very logical why he's shooting off rockets left and right like he I mean self-preservation is a pretty obvious motivator and people like Gaddafi who come say oh okay you international community you said you don't want us to have nuclear arms so then we'll disarm we'll end our nuclear program they do that we move in there and throw them out and and Gaddafi ends up getting sodomized to death you know so that's like if you're this guy you're like well that I'm gonna not go that route right so I'm now I'm gonna show you and basically he's showing you I can fucking nuke South Korea I can't nuke these fucking places if you come at me that being said you know he's a madman he's a man who's holding his people you know hostage and it's horrific but there are like certain okay if you have a hostage situation there are some reasonable ways to handle that and some ridiculous ways to handle that so like when you have a hostage situation I think it's reasonable to negotiate what the guy I I think it's reasonable to take him out if you have a shot you know what I'm saying if someone has a shot and like too many like like people won't be hurt we can take him out take the shot what you don't do is stand outside and start talking shit so the guy who's got the hostages yeah no Trump's not thinking it's anything other than like a Rosie O'Donnell yes like you talk shit about Rosie O'Donnell he's calling this guy Rocket Man which I kind of like with Rosie O'Donnell the you know there's a there's a thing about Trump I'm no fan of his but there's something I kind of get a thrill I got a kick out of how he'd you know piss off people who I'm not a huge fan of right and I love Ted I tell you though I love Z Hillary when she did the 30 Bernie yes all the Hillary I like I love the nicknames until it was rocket man I was really into the nicknames like hey buddy this isn't funny anymore this guy's got nukes but there's the UM well look when he it was a Morning Joe the co-host Mika Brzezinski yeah so she made a thing in a on the show where they there was a picture on Time magazine with Trump with like this with his hands under his arms and she made a joke on the show and she goes oh how come he doesn't want to show his hands maybe because they're teeny okay that was a joke she made the sense it's a little dick joke I mean that's what she was making shot so Donald Trump like immediately tweets out I think about heard he goes when she was at my uh when she was at my party she had she had you know scars from the facelift know he still believes you stopped bleeding from the Facebook's right from that they asked me to sit with her did not go yes yes this thing now then of course that the media goes right into the mode of like how could you insult a woman's you know let like it's like I don't know man like if you can't take the heat get out of the fucking joke and the people were like actual journalists like grown-up people who consider themselves journalists I saw reporting a week later it's been confirmed that Mika Brzezinski wasn't even at that and fanon didn't even yeah you fucking idiots this isn't a real thing he's just getting her back like she hit him and he's hitting her back like yes if you're if you're vain enough to be having plastic surgery probably you're not going out while you're still bleeding yeah from the plastic surgery but like it's the point is and I kind of like that about Trump it's like Oh finally someone being unapologetic and being like okay well this is what I disagree with you hardcore cuz I think it's stupid and childish and like and um it's beneath being the President of the United States and this idea that you're gonna make up a story about a woman bleeding from plastic surgery to get over because she said you have little hands that's some weak bitch shit okay as you repeat it back to me it does sound like some weak it's weak shit if that was your friend hold on a second look if that was your friend and one of your friends was making fun of the fact that you you had small hands and so you went on a radio show our podcast and made up a whole story about him that's the bitch okay okay so I'll agree with you on that you're right it is kind of a bitch move no it's a hundred percent agree with you really happen even so I could get where you could say it's kind of a bitch move like you should be above this but I get what I enjoy about it is if then everybody out like like 95% of the mainstream media's reaction is how could you attack a woman's looks that you're like hey you dummies maybe you'll think next time about I just I hate the thing that Mika feels entitled to make a small dick joke and then feels entitled the next day to play the are you insulting a woman's looks it's like because she's not it's actually worse right if he was telling the truth because what she's saying he has no control over here's no control over her with the size of his hands he was born with but she does have control of the whether or not she's so vain she lets a doctor stick a tube down her throat and right cut her half a live body and stitch it tighter to give the lucien of youth now i don't think that really happened at least that's what i promised or happen but if it did happen and he was talking about that after she was talking shit then it makes sense what doesn't make sense is it's not true yeah so i get i guess what i do agree with you the point you made so i will walk back that a little bit you're right it's kind of a shitty move but there's just something i like the fact that he's willing like someone's like fighting back against the pc authoritarianism which i do see is a really big fucking problem i don't see this is like a little problem that's annoying like i think it's a really big problem and i don't care about the dignity of the president i like that being undermined as much as possible i i don't think the whole idea that there's dignity to this bullshit job that shouldn't even exist i hate so i like that being i like that aspect of trump dude what do you would you think about when Bourdain got shit because they asked him at the airport just one of them TMZ things you walking through the airport they go if you had to cook for kim jong hoon and donald trump what would you serve he goes hemlock and leaves that's a fuckin Bourdain throwaway funny punchline that's just good that's just good chef humor right there goddamn dude I was looking at all the comments and so many of them were using hashtag POTUS to talk about POTUS that way and to talk they were talking about like he's the king like these sheep but they also switch sides it's like the Obama people in the Trump people are so happy to just just literally one day know you take that position and I'll take this position now no problem no feeling of like oh this is a little bit weird I was literally three days ago lecturing people about how he's our president and now I'm like not my president like you don't feel any any you know and and there's this thing that I go you know I remember you said this and I've quoted this many times on my show part of the problem my podcast there get a plug in oh the problem powerful part of the problem no more alliteration but yeah I don't know if you were quoting someone or this was years originally but you were describing the Occupy Wall Street movement and you used the white blood cells yes the way to describe them I you might have been quoting someone else when you said it but it or maybe it was yours originally but I remember hearing you say this I think it was mine what I was saying is it's obviously there's a disease and they don't know exactly what it is but the white blood cells are moving in and they're surrounding this infection that's right I'm trying to figure out what it is I thought it was like such a perfect analogy and it applies to Occupy Wall Street it also applied to like the Tea Party movement and some other way and right the point of being like look a white blood cell does not understand the complexity of a virus it doesn't have the cure for a virus it doesn't have like that but it knows corruption rush yeah like that's the thing it's like corrupt and rush and I think that a lot of the Trump thing is that too it's like white blood cells and they know that this PC authoritarian thing then Trump fights that right they know that's the virus and this is to them the most anti neither audit report he has half fake people you know I did that to me today and I posted it on Instagram I'm very happy with the results you're doing way better than Trump's way better than not motherfucker I don't have any fake people on Twitter because first of all I'm not the president I think we need the president you automatically get like a shit ton of fake people billionaire GOP patron behind Trump social media bot armory yeah of course he has a media pot of course why would he not use that I mean it's just like to him that's like a tool like what it's like when the samurais refused to adopt gun pile gunfire they refused to adopt firearms fuck that shit we're using bows and arrows and swords like men and they got gunned down at the end of the Japanese Empire as we knew it at the time just ancient version of what Kodak did all right Kodak was like when digital came out they were like yeah we don't really like digital will be the film guys no cameras but then this cameras run phones great bitch you missed the whole thing you were an industry leader yeah you went way behind the curve but you're the number one typewriter distributor now yeah if you run it for president Dave Smith and you don't use a bot army I'll be very disappointed in you I'd be like how can I give you my support if you're not even willing to use a bot army woodbox we're talking about Smith 24 now yes so give me much 24 I think bots are like old technology your point dude I'm not gonna get elected with that crap how short-sighted of me dude that's that's 20/20 thing that's bullshit thank you yeah yeah the new stuff is all you got to figure out a hack into neural implants that's right I'm also a lot of my campaign is going to be running against the previous four years of the Kanye West administration and everything that they did right and be like look Trump didn't solve the problem Kanye didn't solve the problem now let's take a nice libertarian yeah Kanye will have established a colony in Africa and he will have redesigned Calabasas in Africa and they'll all be just driving around and Bentley's and shit and duck and lions it's like it really is though like it's it's almost like seems anything seems plausible show reality but it is a thing that it is like like Andrew Breitbart said this is what I've realized over the last year is that politics is downstream from culture yeah that was the truth I completely missed this or maybe not completely but I definitely underestimated the minimum wage law like things would be okay it's like it's like it's there's a cultural element that you have to account for also and the Donald Trump thing it's just kind of like you know what's so interesting to me is it's like okay so it's like Trump's a buffoon and he's a cartoon I mean literally a cartoon right like he's got the is the color of him the cover of his skin the color of his hair like you watch the only fitting suit yes overweight body he's like crazy hair you're watching the news and then a cartoon character comes on but in this weird way he's had this ability to like hold up a mirror to the rest of American society also a billionaire so he's undeniably a winner as far as we'd decide hard to argue then on top of that he's unapologetic and that's something we all admire because we all wish we could do that because we can't and that's something that pisses off the left yeah much like that's that I think is right at the heart of why they hate Trump which is something I'm fascinated by and I think it is I really think being an unapologetic white man rubs the Left wrong like look you can be a white man and you can be an ally but you gotta be you gotta be down here you know you can't be like up here you can't be like hey I have an opinion and this is how I feel you got to be down here like I have an opinion and I know my opinions been over-represented on his Jaime kill scenes taken enough heat you don't have to go after him again he's a great guy on this podcast like you just did I saw you did know I welcome Jaime back I will too I will yes welcome back he did some he did some silly things a little carried away exactly people make bad decisions he got he got influenced by a silly ideology yeah and you know and it came out but and he did some great work for those people like there's a fucking speech that he did in front of this giant thing in Brooklyn I forget what it was about but he was doing this speech about about Donald Trump and about black lives matter it was like really well worded stuff whether you agree with it or not like he did good work inside that that little sort of paradigm yeah I I'm Jamie kill scene when I was like a brand new comedian like just starting stand-up comedy and he was you know to me like doing things that were really cool he was on the road with Stanhope and like to me that was like oh you're like you made it like that's amazing like you're doing the thing that we all want to do and he was just super kind and helpful to me yeah I was a young comic and so I always just have like a as a person I like Jamie right and all the things I don't like about Jamie were me like seeing him on your show or seeing something he tweeted or something like that so it's like as a person I always liked him and then the public persona like he owes a few people apologies but I'd be happy to yeah I mean I think we're all vulnerable to a certain extent and we're vulnerable to like if you tap into a vein and you have success with a certain way of behaving and thinking and you you know you put blinders on because this is benefiting you yeah I mean we see that financially with people we were talking about before you see that culturally socially and I think Jamie tapped into like the social vein of success in this in very extreme ideology the extreme feminist male feminist Ally ideology the denial of you know the differences between the men the women and and it's like he's a cliche in a lot of ways right because he's a small guy and you know he's very slight and you always see a small guy was a vegan and a feminist you like oh it's just he's one of those guys you know to me it's like you fall into these weird sort of predetermined patterns of behavior these categories and he just was a black belt at that you know but also banging chicks so is that you can't you can't be in that world and also like pussy as it turns out it's so crazy reason that the ultimate feminist to me loves women top to bottom I don't know what the actual issue that they had with him I don't really know I don't either but I will say this okay that he hangs out in that social justice warrior crowd that he was hanging out with they will throw out the rape word for everything you can look at someone the wrong way and they'll call that rape and what they accused Jamie of was inappropriate and manipulative behavior toward women no pussy I mean literally means trying to get passe like it's not even you're not even exaggerating if you go like to them to this in this social justice warrior world if you were to be like hey why don't we like get out of here and go back to my place and you're like now we can't go come on yeah well she said no and then you said come on that is that is like you know inappropriate manipulative behavior it was a skeptics conference and a man in an elevator asked a woman if she wanted to come to his room and have some coffee and she did a whole speech the next day about how men should not if they're with a woman alone and it's late at night do not ask them to coffee because you're gonna you know imply that this woman is in danger and make her feel uncomfortable and all the seven crazy shit like oh so a guy was trying to fuck you doesn't that happen all the time like you're making a speech about this trying to control the behavior of men to the point where they're not man anymore yes and kind of his shape them and form them into some weird sort of PC version if you would like this no biological difference between the men and the women men being only you know allies and like what it's so strange the whole thing is so weird and like you know it's always these people who you know seem to be so resentful and angry at the male/female relationship and interplay and like ankle fuck you is so horrible coincidentally almost always not attractive it's you don't see a lot of tends walking around going like oh it's so unfair there's a few that's done a few you don't see a ton of them Republicans well here's here's the thing is like the shit Clark's that's right and they put them right up front they put them right up front like see we gotta look at their tits you got giant tits in a little waist she's a fucking feminist well the truth is if you want to get into a conversation a real honest conversation about privilege right and who has privilege and who doesn't have village I mean hot chick privilege it's pretty shiz something pretty strong I mean you know hot chicks walk around in a different world than regular women and men you do I mean it's just a different thing and that's part of the nature of but you know whatever I mean that's like who human beings are but it's like you don't hear her complaining about it as much because she's winning right this at this exchange you know and women have to like sort of keep their mouths shut about that shit you don't have to like kind of you know I I saw this tweet this woman put out that said pro tip if you don't ever date a man who doesn't identify himself as a feminist and I'm like that is so crazy that's such a crazy thing to say yeah like first of all pro tip is one of the douchiest things you could ever say and not say something funny if you say pro tip what you say after that better be preposterous yeah see pro tip and you're serious I just you're a fucking condescending angry person from the jump I feel like it's very rarely a very successful Pro who's given me this pro tip second of all the idea of every man that you date should be a feminist well every man you date shouldn't be a person who discriminates yeah I agree with that they should be open-minded it should be egalitarian but the idea that they have to subscribe to a feminist ideology this can't just be fair and honest and curious and have real conversations with you open and objective that's not good enough no they have to identify with this ideology that the only way you could ever have equality true equality within the sexes of the man identifies as being a feminist like that's what feminism is feminism is not supportive women no feminism is total uniformity and there's no discrimination whatsoever and until that happens you have to be a feminist yeah and feminism to me is like like modern-day feminism at least it's just like a hate group I just don't know how else to describe them they're just a hate group it's like they if you take them at their word you know the way you could take any hate group at their word you know when they'd be like oh you know we're not a hate group we just care about white people white people's rights and the white children bother and then you're kind of like oh okay well let me come to a meeting and then by like that meeting you're like you sure do seem to hate black people hate group we just think that all straight white men are trash until proven otherwise exactly exactly and if you want to be there and you're of that group you better first you know like confess to your original sin for being and then and be guilty the whole time and be constantly you know kind of like repenting right and then you can be there but even with them there's a giant spectrum right there's a lot of women that are just what they don't want is some fucking creepy boss to talk you know crazy creepy sexual shit to them and they have to absorb it because they want to move up the corporate ladder and they're discriminated sexually in the office space they're discriminated when it comes to you know promotions and raises and you know the position in the company that's yeah yeah gross yeah be a woman working in an office filled with fucking men think about trying to have sex with you all the time absolutely absolutely and there are certain struggles that like guys are unaware of the or maybe not on a way are completely cuz like you're bringing it up right now but we don't experience certainly right like you don't know what it's like to walk around life as like a tiny hot chick that men just constantly want to fuck I mean that's I'm sure that yes and I'm sure like being catcalled you know when they first came out that video that the one that went viral of the champion cat called around New York City my first reaction was I thought it was very interesting and I said because you go if you're a guy who doesn't cat call checks which is like the category I fall into that's just not my style of getting laid I've never thought of just being like let me get that ass ma like his you walk by me but I mean you know that did roll off the tongue kind of naturally so maybe I should try try that I made me get nervous so it's interesting to see that because you're like oh I don't do that so as a guy who doesn't do that I'm the only category of people who's like unaware of it like let me women are away I don't know how they made that video I found out later yeah I did find out later please tell everybody like hours and hours of footage they basically went all day long and disproportionately took footage of black neighborhoods they went around in circles in this black neighborhood in Harlem and in Times Square in these two areas and they basically got a lot of black guys you know talking you know to a very track very attractive white but yes you know a crime of the century yeah but it's like look I do think there's something to be said for like oh okay look I don't know what the experience of getting catcalled is right this might be pissing off some women so okay like let's let's look at that but then there's also like lots of struggles of men that women don't necessarily know about and the problem with feminists is that and modern feminists is that they're not going like hey we both have struggles here let's have a conversation we're not like we're humanists we're Equalists let's have a government like we're feminists right we're on this team and we're gonna talk about our struggles and lecture you about it and you can never discuss the opposite learn the truth and the past gets so perverted like they'd speak like the past was all just a price of gender roles toward women it's like actually in reality there were a price of gender roles for everybody in the past and it's very debatable who they were more oppressive for like in my grandmother's and grandfathers day oppressive gender roles landed my grandfather in combat fighting and war like it wasn't that you know it wasn't like oh the men didn't have any struggles that the women didn't know about like again we technologically advanced we don't need those gender roles which we did need for lots of years before technology there's no way for humans to survive I mean go you know go 400 years ago and say let's abolish gender roles it's like right like you're gonna have a kids until you know three of them died from polio I mean that's what was the point of the Google memo there's still things that people gravitate towards that are male with more frequency than they do with our female and then you have these aberrations these women that want to be MMA fighters and these men that want to be florists and you have all these all the different people in between and to try to get equality and that was like one of the things that was so frustrating about people is that we're not saying that women shouldn't be equal they can't be equal we're saying they're not equal they're not equally represented in this particular field this particular discipline now let's look explore why other things that I thought was so crazy about the Google memo is that the guy had like a page and a half of like dedicated to what would be a way to get women more interested in tech and he had all these citations for all these different studies that he was quoting and they were when they reprinted it in several sources they removed the citations and they you know they would put like the they take these quotes out of context and highlight them and make the larger and it's like which I find strange to be like uh-uh yeah I read part of that thing and it seemed fairly reasonable to me and I saw it very misrepresented the way it was talking about it on the news and like it's just this weird thing where you're like okay look if you do like like equality is what exactly do we even mean but it's like yeah the equality under the law or something like that like okay sure but like no like men and women are different well men are different like you and I are different yes you know way more about politics than I do and you know way more about hunting elk and shit like that well that's always gonna be the case it's not an equal thing because we're not mathematic I've got a huge gap to close on your elk hunting knowledge I gotta get it on a dime that's that's a weird one that I'm probably shitting that down dipped my toes into it so it's absorbed know what you're absolutely right and the case with all here work it's where it is like snowflakes I mean working a completely different and have different and the idea that equality I mean you'll never have that of any true sense and then the thing was like okay with women it seems like feminists basically like they almost walk bashing men and bashing the traditional kind of masculine gender role they also seem to embrace it and and want that for women so like if men are they really want it for transgender people that's where it gets super slippery because the left wants really classic feminine like transgender people like when Bruce Jenner became Caitlyn Jenner he's paint his toes wearing high heels and short skirts and it gets a tit job gets his jaw sawed down like you can't just be a woman you got an looking woman you got to be a woman with a fucking facial surgery you got to be beautiful yeah and we go yes you you're amazing you go that's right if a girl embraces those classic gender roles like wearing high heels and short skirts and a you know our tits are pushed together and like oh god you're falling into this classic gender trap that's right or or if a woman said like oh I want to be a housewife and like raise my kids and live a traditional lifestyle you know like that's or if I'm gonna move for my husband or something like that you know like that's why you're a gay man you say that don't fall for you girl and you see the same thing happen way they literally the same thing they'll hate if a man does the lot so if you had read a you know a feminist article about MMA seven years ago it'd have been all about like toxic masculinity and male aggression and all this stuff but as soon as Ronda Rousey was doing it it's like that's our girl let's go do it if dirty comedy offensive comedy they're like no fuck that that's your male prep but as soon as Amy Schumer's doing it it's like let's go that's like they love for a woman to do all the things that they always said they hate right and the crazy thing is like they'll say these things where it's like you know like women whatever it is like women are you know whatever percentage like 51% of the population and they're only like 10% of Congress or something I'm just making these numbers that's something like in that ballpark and they'll be like well this is a problem and you're like we'll wait a minute I mean I'm all for freedom so if there's any barrier in someone's way get that out of there if people are free and like men choose to go be politicians and women more choose to go into like you know like nursing and like these other like kind of like maternal istic fields that women go into a lot and you're like okay so like are you sure the answer is just that they should be more like men like maybe this is like saying something better about women like men are going are like going into ruling over other people and women are going into like a nurturing field like maybe the fact that women prioritize family over money is not a bad thing that needs to be reorganized well it's a great thing there's gonna be some women that choose to pursue a career at the very highest levels of capitalism and there's going to be some that have zero interest in doing that and that's the same with men as well it's just we can't deny the patterns that we say well we should figure out is like are there barriers if there's barriers unjust barriers to keep women from things I'm sure there are those things we should concentrate on yes but concentrating on leveling the number of people in Congress and that's essentially sexual affirmative action yeah I want to get more women in those positions because you think that well how many women do you have right that's when you get to Hillary Clinton I mean like we want a woman to be present okay how about a lying old lady who faints a lot is that one okay you like no well that's ridiculous well that's what you got when you want to get only women you got that one okay so what the fuck do you want to do now because what you're doing is you you can't just decide that you only want you know you want 50% man 50% women in all what about coal mining you want to have 50% of women and die and fucking coal mining accents you know the disproportionate number of men who die on the job it's it's staggering but that's my point with the feminist thing yeah it's kind of this this is why it's not they'll be like well we're just for equality it's like okay well if you're just for equality how come I never hear about how the death at the workplace death rate is like disproportionately men I don't mean disproportionately a little bit it's like over 90 percent men well how about prison sentencing differences these are major major things where people die or get thrown in a cage but you know that doesn't come up at all because it's like if it's black men they look well that's right and okay because but then of course it's also got to be like the breezes droga light races and white male race and that's linked with the the feet of the woman's struggle like the black struggle like they kind of piggybacked on to that we should really get on to lbgtq w that's what well they kind of are I mean I hear that all the time I actually I heard one person on MSNBC and they were like we just care about the rights of of women and minorities and LGBT people and immigrants in like something else and I was like just say not white man like did I just save you some time say not straights this white men that's here we don't everyone else your name of them all in groups so just say yeah like just cut to the chase just for time and they're doing it to align themselves they're doing it to align themselves with other people are gonna have their back and agree with them and they go to war with it that way yeah behind them like what you said before that where you go if there's any barriers let's remove that but then you get to a certain point where you're just like if we're being honest there are no real barriers there are no real Barratt to escape okay and if there are let's go after them but just on the big picture like talking about things if you're like a woman who really wants to do something in 2017 in a first world country like the United States of America I don't see I mean there are laws against paying a woman less than a man at the same job there are all these rules there are lots of people who will like like actually bend over backward cuz they're really looking to have like a you know diversity like corporations really love diversity right everyone in show business knows that's true yeah so it's like okay I don't see a real barrier but then when you do when they can't find one they'll they'll kind of create this barrier that you can't say so if we give people a bunch of freedom and then women make certain choices and men make certain choices and this leads to on average men making twenty-three percent more than women then they go well and I go well there's no barrier it's just women making choices they go well well there's this this barrier called patriarchy that's now somehow you know and we've got like it's because these women have been socialized into thinking that they're so then they'll find this thing that you can't prove or disprove you can't test it's just kind of like but we live in a rape culture right it's like fighting terrorism the war on terror the same shit it's like well if it's just an idea I guess we're always fighting that idea yeah and until women assume the power position and there's a disproportion of number of women in Congress and disproportionate number of women who are police officers and women who are judges and women her lawyers and when they were in all positions of power if men feel the heavy boot of the oppressive woman until then they fuck up and it's so it's all so ridiculous it's just all so silly it's like what what area of life is there where things are proportionally representative well black people in basketball no not proportionate level I'm saying proportionately so they don't make a 13 percent of basket yeah yeah like baby they make up I mean it's like wit where do you find it's racist there we need to even that out yes absolutely at more white people and more Asians and way a little bit make it easier to follow yeah more black people in hockey that's a mess but it's all just so it's all so fuckin like we should celebrate the differences we have and just don't be a cunt don't be racist that's it no that's it don't be sexist don't be racist but you don't get brownie points just cuz you're a chick you don't know when you shouldn't and you shouldn't get into this thing where it's like and I know it's like I've heard like people particularly like left-wing leaning feminists or like so female comics who are feminists who I know several of how dare you and I've yes I name but but I've heard I know they'll get very through and and one of them said to me once they go you know Dave your whole thing is just that you hate women oh but it's like hate women like what do you know I saw a woman said to Brian Posehn and you know what he said it was hilarious he goes you know what I've heard that before and every woman that said that I hated response because it was a stupid argument it is she was just like saying like in a blanket statement you hate women no no you but I just go I I and I challenge a lot of people on on the Left who talk about race or sexism and these things I just challenge you to to just entertain the possibility for like one second entertain the possibility that you're not right about all of this stuff and that the correct position is to treat everybody equal now I know that sounds really really wild and out there and I'm not taking into account my white privilege in the history but just entertain for one second the possibility that the correct answer is to treat everybody equal and not judge them based on their race and then you if you entertain that for one second you'll start realizing like oh holy shit if that's true I'm really the one being the bigot here I've seen this so like a if you know the roast battle shows they have down at the Comedy Store here shows up and they started doing them in New York too now they're really popular there are like these group of female comics that will come out and I don't even begin for this but they'll come out and just hardcore like root for the female comic okay they're they'll post about like just want to see more women succeed at roast battle coming out tonight to cheer on my girl blah blah and there'll be this dynamic where like their first two jokes you know they'll just get this like it's just like you know female voices from the corner where the comics hang like super super loud for the chick comic and like whatever I don't begrudge them anything about fine come do that but it's just like those same people who will be like you're like against women like I would never in a million years go out to a show and be like I'm just rooting for the men today like I don't think I'm not like on team man but you are on Team women like it's just it just seems to me that there's a lot of that going on you know what I mean a lot of that shit where it's like you kind of projected this thing that you see racism everywhere or you see sexism everywhere but all I really see is you fucking lecturing people based on race in their mind they're allowed to do it the same way Cain Velasquez allowed to have brown pride in this chest yeah kind of the same thing like you're you're disenfranchised or you're marginalized so you're allowed to stay and if you're not you playing that victim card as a woman and you're allowed to say I'm here to support my girl like I was talking about this on stage the other day I saw a bumper sticker on a car it said girls kick ass and I was like some of them yeah some of them are lazy slobs like what are you gonna line yourself with 150 million women just in this country alone that's ridiculous I'm saying if a guy had a bumper sticker I said boys kick ass he'd be like follow that guy and find out where he's been fucking these kids cuz he first of all you'd never say boys boys kick ass you put that on your bumper stay with a fuck are you you pull him over let me see your license where do you live man what do you do for a living what's that bumper sticker about what the fuck do you mean by that yes and I don't need like I almost feel like an asshole sometimes where I preface everything with a disclaimer like and I'm not saying this I'm not but I just want to be clear I'm not saying there aren't exceptions to the rule but it's also kind of strange to me that like if you want to celebrate women why are you celebrating such a masculine quality like it's kind of like it's like look there are white players who are great basketball players right there are white Dirk Nowitzki was an amazing basketball player but if I just wrote somewhere like white people kick ass at basketball it's like well actually moving in general women don't kick ass in general and generally speaking that's a male thing to do right I'm not saying there's not exceptions to that but you're like you're writing white people kick ass at basketball it's kind of misleading right well there's that thing that's coming out that movie with Steve Carell where he plays that man who had a basketball tennis match against Billie Jean King and he was like barely ranked he was a terrible tennis player and he fucked Billie Jean King up and it was and he was like sort of mocking her the whole way and it was like a real hallmark I don't know about that we would say he just he just played a professional tennis player but he wasn't the best and Billie Jean King was the best woman in the world and they played and the Steve Carell character beat her is now wasn't that what happened I believe that's what happened I'm getting them conflated with renee Richards the guy who used to be a man and then became a transgender woman and started stomping everybody in tennis he was a terrible as a man and then it became a woman who's owned the best the world and like there's no biological difference even without a penis he's still stomping them it again is like so funny because once you it's so funny like how much this stuff starts undermining their own arguments Billie Jean King one okay so I got wrong the they Richard one yeah that's what I confused so what was this and he was like particularly gross right and Steve Carrell plays him really well in the movie same Steve Carell who played that crazy guy in that wrestling he did a really great job what a creepy story what a crazy story spm thirty four thirty on this good man yeah you know not a good in the sense that the stories are word but such a compelling unbelievable story oh my god yeah so when Steve Carell played that character and then you watch the video the actual character like whoa like he just nailed that guy Steve Carell is an incredible talent oh it's such a good fucking act to be that funny of a comedian and that good of a dramatic actor he's fucking pretty incredible I guess it's comedy though is always kind of his acting you know it's like that's his strength and comedy like he'd own that character right you know well Roger Federer said that recently and got in trouble right that the the best women know what was McEnroe yeah and Rowe said that and they led us they let him into it he said he started by saying Serena was the best female player right and then they go why female Wow and he was like well what do you mean I because I think she's the best female player because well why female why not say male he goes because the men are way better like he was literally just answering the question lady now I started off giving this woman an extraordinary compliment that was the story I remember didn't Serena play against an unranked male player yeah they used to play when they were younger I think she pulled boys she played against some guy that was the story and the guy kicked her ass and everybody was like what it just seems to me to be this thing where I kind of look at obviously like we're talking at generalizations here and there are exceptions like you know what I'm saying like there are like you know Ronda Rousey could beat the shit out of me well you're not I stated use her as an example and it's about a fighter no but I'm just making the point that like if you have this stereotype that men are stronger than women or something like that there are exceptions to the rule if you get and there are there are and I still use Ronda Rousey even though she's not champ anymore she's just got that ring to it but I'm saying there are exceptions to the rule there are exceptions and and to treat someone based on a group dynamic is is ignorant like to but if you're going to like I do think there are differences between men and women generally speaking and if you believe that it's like if we're gonna celebrate women I just think it's kind of odd that we have to celebrate the most masculine achievements of women it's like celebrating them kicking ass there are these things that I feel like women are superior to men in that I'm very impressed by them like I just think wait a minute hold on let me stop you because you think that running a corporation is masculine like do you think that being involved in any creative endeavors masculine I think that being involved in anything in tech is no no that's what they're talking about well I was more responding to the women kick ass that's just stupid bumper sticker no you're right it is really this group think if if you see things like well I just but the element I'm responding to is that kick-ass it just seems to be kind of like a masculine thing I'm just writing that as masculine yeah I was just one silly stupid bumper sure sure like to say those things yes yes but I just think there's something about it seems to me like the nurturing element of femininity is almost like denigrated and then ask kisi ask icky element is like it is praised it's like if I'm talking kicking ass and nurture and I'm talking men versus women in general it just brought speaking right like I tend to think of one being male and one being female right to wrap this all up and bring something that I think we'd all be better off mail women white black Asian whatever if we just reasonable nice people you know and that's the real problem is that we lock off as we've been discussing all all day into these camps yeah and we are on camp white male and we are on camp black male or camp gay or camp transgender or camp woman and we just lock into these ideologies and we hate anybody else different and we have these divisive things that we say like all white men are trash unless proven otherwise you know it's that kind of crazy shit like you're you're setting it up so the guys like sorry sorry like you come in sorry so show me they do it I didn't do it instead of just being a reasonable normal person but there's not enough reasonable normal people so women are constantly dealing with assholes so they develop these kind of be Hatter patterns of behavior they think about men as being these intrusive shitty people who just want to get in your pants and really don't care about you and they're manipulative and they just want to fuck you which is how you say it I mean that it's somewhat true that's as much a described and men think of women as being manipulative too always looking for the bigger better deal you know well they're gonna fuck their personal trainer while you're at work and I'm thinking about getting divorced and losing all your money because you were too stupid you didn't sign a prenuptial agreement she has some kick-ass attorney and then you're fucked we all know guys who've experienced that before too they she lies about you beating the kids and then she's full custody like that's all real but then the good stuff is all real - I know what I mean it's like well real and that does happen but then there's also like the chick who just like gives a guy like you know like the security and confidence he never had to go be great there's the guy like does support his chick through like her endeavors and like you know it's so it's like you got it you know it's like it's like that shitting in the the hurricane in Houston kind of put some perspective on that for me where it's like you know it's like you see just like all these people it's like an Tifa verse Nazis is the state of the country and then you see like this this horrible hurricane happen and just the acts of kindness after where you see these people like like young guys like like these group of like 20 year olds maybe they were I saw who took they're like they're like motor boats down to Houston and are pulling old people out of like their homes and you're like god damn it motherfucker like that's our country - yeah you know when like it like it's all really like the Nazis are our country - but that guy's our country - that is also as people responding to a very real problem where it really unites people they feel like they have to help each other because a real problem you know most of the time we're separated from each other by buildings and cars and there's weird alienation we have with one another it's one of the reasons why places of high density you get much more liberal ideologies or liberal in terms of like accepting I should say not necessarily conservative but there's a lot of that - Democratic versus conservative or left-wing versus conservative but you these big population cultures people interact with each other more you know you don't get the same kind of racism you know you get less and it's less accepting I think in like maybe say New York City then probably anywhere because in New York City especially in Manhattan everybody's got to interact not saying you don't encounter it you certainly do sure besides white racism black racism you're gonna encounter racism it's a flaw in human nature that's the same thing that we're talking about with the assholes of the tiki torches yeah that's a flaw everyone likes to feel like they're the best and my team is the best and my local bar is the best and my aunt makes the best chili it's like no your aunt does not make the world's best chili that's fucking it's it's you know the odds are very against it let's just say it's a very very low chance to prove it but people right but people want to feel that way right and so everybody will always be these certain kind of in-group preference things where there's but like you said there are I do think like growing up in New York City you also just see and this is the beautiful thing that we fuckin lost in America that sucks but it's like freedom does fucking bring people together and capitalism even though it's become a dirty word like all that shit brings people together man like I'm a Jew and I can go on a New York City Street and put my hand out and like a Muslim guy comes and picks me up and drops me off at home I mean to be honest I really do use uber but it's the I I was doing lyft and now I just switched over to do you feel bad that you bruised getting locked out of London like I'm gonna step up and help out over I I don't know about that I knew they're locked out of Austin I think Austin Austin Texas they left there I think they're locked out of London now I think the mayor just said the way they operate sucks fuck off well I don't love it-- I love anything that undermines government monopoly so I thought it was great that they undermined that whole medallion thing I think it's like I think technology that undermines the government is the most beautiful thing ever as I that you know that Waze app they have that now in New York City they'll tell you if there's a camera on the next red light they'll tell you if there's a cop on the highway waiting to check you know like they'll be like police ahead right so there's literally the system where the cops cops will sit there and wait for someone to come you know speeding so they can come you know extort you for some money understand how that works the Waze thing that it's just people calling in so stop calling fake cars I did not know that but I know that I knew that it was other people calling yeah I'm very upset because the police officers actually call in fake cop on the side of the road calls but so what is that doing making people drive the speed limit fucks it up it's a car it's crying wolf so you basically just don't believe it as much anymore it's interesting I thought there was something really beautiful about the server protect I get token no I mean that's that's the third thing it serve protect and rule juking you I thought when they first did it what a beautiful thing that you're going like cuz look if you if you uh if you tell them there's a cop ahead what you're gonna do is make sure you're not speeding I mean that's the only trick so essentially it's doing what you would claim the law wants you to do is doing it in a way where the state doesn't fucking extort you yeah you know of course oh then they'll start going out we'd better fuck with that I don't not let that work yeah they'll eventually figure out a way around that or we're gonna get to a point I think in our lifetimes where it's impossible Ally I think that's where it's headed and I think that's gonna solve a lot of our issues socially a lot of our issues politically we're gonna understand motivations behind things in a way like maybe motivations will seem color-coded that is been someone's obvious you literally see green with some new programming I think I think what you're set like we've already started to see it and it's like it's much much harder I think that it's much much harder for people to pull off lying it was much harder for Hillary Clinton to pull off than for traditional politics in the past because they're leaking everything online now and it's just harder for the government or the big corporations or the media to convince you of this narrative it's getting harder and harder like we haven't figured out exactly how to move it in a good direction but like it is you see the control that they have being undermined the control of the mainstream media is being undermined the control that's our universities what's already gone the the Internet has sort of eroded all the control of mainstream media CNN is now called fake news a million times a day all throughout the country and you look at these people constantly scholars right the president calls it fake that's fuckin CNN oh that's right and then you say like when you said it earlier in the show about you know Fox News had had a monopoly on right-wing news well that's fuckin over I mean look at the like what ben shapiro comes on your shows look at the numbers that thing does I mean it's like oh yeah Fox News is a big competitor on their on their hands now and all these other guys at Crowder and all these guys are like huge and all of if you look at like and Jordan who's more you know like he calls himself a classic British liberal and he looks at it that way which is like a sort of a different definition more of a pragmatic sort of more conservative pragmatic probably closest to what is called libertarian and American school of thought like that is the classical liberal position oh and disingenuously call him alright it's just so frickin ridiculous it's look this is the thing where it's like everyone to the right of Bernie Sanders is a Nazi it's like there's these words don't even mean anything and he just it's also it's like people shout on your face it's like lyin Hillary like that kind of thing right but you take the most fucked up word you can think of to justify the legal position and then culturally you say oh by the way that word applies to everything so you know it's like it's like women are getting we've done college campus so we get the law passed well that's one of the real problems with a guy like Donald Trump's and when he boils things down to these slogans then they boil things down to slogans in return and we just have a fuckin fight where you throwing rocks at each other that was one of the amazing things about Trump and the moment is that Trump comes out he's like this simplistic buffoon and in every in the normal mind you're like well at some point he's gonna meet a professional who won't embarrass him and then you start to realize after a while is like oh there's just no professional it's like no friends neither did Hillary Clinton we're all amped they're all completely empty the difference between him versus Hillary versus what we just had with Mitt Romney versus Obama to really reasonable well-spoken people who are accomplished and quite intelligent more than one of them believes in nonsense I don't know which one they both believe in nonsense right believe in the islands but but one of them believes in like a magical underway yeah he has to or it goes straight to like a cabin in hell you have to stay there with no I don't know what the rule is but you only get two of your wives I just know that we sling back I hope we have this blowback this way and I hope I don't mean I don't know who's gonna emerge between now and 2020 but it's gonna have to be someone that's interesting right it's gonna be out to be someone that we look at and go okay this is a viable alternative to what we're currently dealing with and they probably shouldn't say shit for a long time they should probably just like build up and prepare and just constantly say I'm not running I'm not running I don't know man I don't know if there's any bringing this thing back together the United States of America really I think we might be going our separate ways in the future I just think we might be headed toward some type of like Soviet style breakup what like like where some of the countries still exist but we're not all a part of the same thing I just I look I look at these two trends that I see happening right and one is that contend this to me is the biggest moral issue of our time but the continued growth of the state which is just like gets bit like we live under joeys happens just like a corporation Universal growth they want to get bigger and stronger every year yeah pretty much always seems to happen I mean and a government unlike like corporations always want to grow a lot of them go out of business but they always want to get bigger governments they can force you to pay them so it's a lot easier for them to grow and this is most of advanced societies start as you know a constitution with a somewhat limited government and then it grows over that was the big appeal of Trump the only repeal drain the swamp this is right and a lot of it was uh you know some of it was was good the idea of draining the swamp is good and not fighting these wars anymore I think is really great and that but you know you have this thing where we have we live under the biggest government most powerful government in the history of the world I mean it's there's never been a government that spends four trillion dollars that can drone bahama anyone on the planet that's it you know we have bases all over the world we were hundreds of different countries or at least well over a hundred and everything is going up I mean every budget you know Bush spent the most ever then Obama spent the most ever Trump will out spend Obama no question about it and all of the major major problems that I see are direct result of this like the longest wars in American history the mass incarceration rate spying on all of our citizens record debt you know like all of these things are a result of government being way too big and way too out of control and then at the same time while we're like spending ourselves too far into debt way too extended militarily the culture is also completely decaying and we're more at war with each other than we've ever been and like I said before we go from like you know a Buckley Vidal debate to Trump Clinton like this we've had a Jerry Springer culture and now we got a Jerry Springer president to go with it and I just see this culture breaking up the government getting too big I don't know how this all works out so that like we're all friends again but I've learned for someone too it may be the end away spoken like a true white man great privilege okay we gotta wrap this up thank you very much man so I put a new comedy special so I just wanted to mention that II just put out my
