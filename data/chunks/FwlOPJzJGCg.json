five four three two one boom and would live Marc de la grotta what up most the time if you and I are talking on a microphone that's when you're in the truck and I'm talking to you and you know like right before a big fight people don't realize like you're the guy I talked to yeah man a lot of shit talking come do a lot of shit talking are things we probably shouldn't say luckily it doesn't make the broadcast well when that one got leaked when Aldo was about to fight Conor and I said he does not look good I said he looks nervous as fuck everyone's body looks flat often flat yeah and then he got flatlined yeah well yeah you were right I was right in that regard that didn't make program didn't it well people what happened was somebody recorded it as I was talking to you I think and I was talking to Bruce and it just somebody just decided to be a little twat dude cher annoyed in that truck sometimes have to be wrong fucking button and I'm gonna be talking shit to you or Maron or something well that was one where was it was interesting I was like oh okay well somebody's a fucking asshole like you're you're privy to this sort of inside banter to like to release that like and make it public I would never say that publicly so I was very upset that they did that yeah but it was honest no you're right it was honest he did look like shit but damn he looked good last weekend he looked unbelievable yeah crazy man I liked asking for I love Jeremy Stephens great guy I mean you know what we're cool with everybody yeah work for the company or gotta get to know everybody you got to be cool to everybody but it was good to see Jose Aldo back on top man he needed that bad well when someone ever I'm always happy when someone live wins with a liver shot oh because it's such it's one of those weird punches like you'll see someone will see two guys and they exchange good shots to the body and they seem like they have no effect you know obviously they hurt but they'll deal with it and keep fighting and then every now and then you see whap you see that liver shot where the legs go out the body gives in is like man that is crazy that we have the one area that sometimes works you know cuz sometimes doesn't work right that's right Olivia shots weird man and it's delayed that's the funniest part about it there's like a split second delay way like I got this just fold over if you saw that too like there was a body shot that that he threw he threw like a rewrite hand to the body and then the left leg was shot so I think it's kind of like you know you take the first punch and then you brace and you got it and then you relax for a second and that's when I'm gonna hang my diaphragm and you live this that's a vibrating I wish it made sense well I heard is right here I could see it again great video yeah well she throws the right hand to the body first double body shot yeah in Jeremy's a bang a two man that's a tough dude man to get dropped from a body shot and to make that face do you mean it so bad well Kevin Ross is the only guy that I've ever seen hide it Kevin Ross got he was fighting in Bellator not his last fight but maybe the previous fight and he got hit in the first round with a spinning back kick right in the liver and he just probably goes yeah see just kept moving and he said he was in ultimate agony absolutely but he didn't show shit and his opponent didn't know I mean he really pulled it off you've really pulled it off he figured out how to just he's so mentally strong though that guy he just figured out how to suck it up and just deal with a bitch tough to do in kickboxing in boxing too because it's not like you can jump God or stall a crime like yeah you can't hide that you know you get you get hit like that and you got to keep fighting actually kickboxing as opposed to muy Thai you can't even really clinch right exactly especially with these new rules do you like that do you like oh I lied you answer I don't like that it's not the art you know I think everything that's going on you know with you know these new rules Katie even when k1 first came out and all that's kind of like what I consider like a take off of Muay Thai it's not my time but they call it more time yeah I mean it's not only that you know it's not the real art k1 was like the Japanese said not enough brain damage yeah not enough and I think they just sucked at the cleanse which because the ties are so good at it and they wanted to give himself a chance to actually compete with like some of the best in the world so they said alright let's limit their weapons list isn't that interesting cuz wouldn't you think that they would just learn the clinch man I wish they would you know that's one of the most intricate parts of Muay Thai it's one of that's where all the gambling goes that's where all the points come from you can punch the shit out of somebody and you get nowhere and then you start clinching and then these stock coming and the little turnovers and trips Thais love that shit man that's that that's the real art there's so much crap lling involved in Thai boxing that's overlooked you know and to have rules that take away grappling and take away clinch work makes no sense man it's half the art at that point it's also a really underappreciated thing in terms of like how they score it like we don't we don't score the same way like if you're watching a Thai fight and if you were an American you've got a bunch of huginn yeah you got off a couple of knees but the other guy hit him with some good right hands and a good jab so it's funny you say that just I just had this lesson with my students the other night you know doing a let's talk about the rules how to how to win the judges so to say you know and yeah the Dutch rules different than the Thai rules and America is kind of fucked up and lost in between all of it you know like the the Dutch consider like a hand block like if you block with your hands like this it's a block in Holland the ties that's not a block that's a point like you get the point you know really yeah man it's different you have to block with your legs and tie box in order to show that you've blocked and nullified the attack really in the points like the punches score big in Holland low kick score big and they mean shit to the Thais you could punch the shit out of somebody for a full round and then just get to clean body kicks off and it all the Thais like oh you got that again once that's going so a lot of these foreigners go to Thailand and they think they're doing well and then they lose decisions and they wonder why it's because they don't understand the judging they don't understand the rules in vice verse and the Thais go to Holland and you know they they think they're doing well and the guys punching the shit out of them and they kind of block in partially and then they lose decisions as well so it's very different between the the judging and the scoring between Dutch kickboxing in real Moyne Thai very different yeah I remember when Ramon Decker was fighting over in Thailand and one of the things that he shocked a lot of those guys was with his his hand techniques and he was able to close the distance and just unleash a barrage of explosive knockout punches and and take guys out where I think they'd become more accustomed to that not happening very true no it also become accustomed to not being assaulted in the first round very much so I remember one of the fights I had early in my career in Thailand I was so excited to be fighting at a big fair big festival fighting this big-name Thai and I threw an elbow in the first round you know and I could I had the opportunity to throw the elbow through the elbow and you know I landed and the guy wiped his you know put his glove up to his head to see if he was bleeding and he gave me that mean look and nodded and it was game on from there and I went back to the corner my Thai trainers were yelling at me like the fuck are you doing you throw elbows like elbows illegal right yeah but not first round now he angry you angry you high glish haft I have bad dude it was apparently I was just excited to be fighting in Thailand using elbows because a lot of times in the states you know we can't use them and the rules are limited and I was in Thailand and it was a festival at night and a fucking lights are on and the Thais abettin and I was like game on let's go trainers were mad at me but throw in the elbow and then there was other fights or I had where they're like Oh be careful for elbow this festival fight no doctor here Hospital far away fuck in my head doctor remember my trainer say he's like be careful for elbow I was like thanks fucking tips like I know watch over elbows he said yeah but no doctor here not Stadium this festival hospital long pier ban oh really far such a good fight a glish is on point bro don't even go there don't go there yes yeah be a stitch Doran speak tied stitch did some R&R and are in the service like you know in Thailand and man like you know you see likes technique how that's like the properties like man so what do cup be like speaks like a Thai si it's the funniest thing and how do you say thank you again cup corn cup Kop kun crab yeah if you roll the arse it's like real like almost like a ristic rattle like you just you stick out like a sore thumb if you're a white dude don't say that they say cop Khun kha kha a car is like the feminine polite particle-like so to say so cop like crop it looks like ke RUP but it's actually the cup that's the the Male Playback Aloha and then and everybody stretch everything out everything is like oh I go with you nah yeah it's just like I don't know it's the twang I guess yeah is that tight Wang the nicest people on earth this week a sweet are so nice man it's the Land of Smiles but you'll find some fucking frowns here and there I'll tell you how of course especially in the fight game yeah there's no getting around the fight game no you're gonna have some mean motherfuckers very true but the the the fight is a cool though man I remember my first one of my first fights in Thailand well at least my Raja Tom nerd fight in 2003 I had breakfast with my opponent and it was like yeah super chill like we weighed in but naked next to each other which was awkward as fuck but we really have to be naked and the Thais like yeah you got to get down bro and I'll say I don't want to get naked I'm on weight don't worry like no underwear off that's how we do it at Raja down and sadya when I was like shit butt naked way to my opponent went next door and had breakfast with him shooting the shit it's kind of big but it is it is a cool placement I remember the first time I went to Thailand I came home and I was homesick it was fucked up dude it felt weird I was like I felt like lonely and lost and I had family here like you know I was I was with my currently like my wife now I was with her at the time we weren't married at the time but you know I was I had family had friends I was very much connected you know it's old-school Sicilian family Boston base you know deep roots and I just felt awkward and weird I was like away from home I was like homesick you miss Thailand I miss Thailand my very first trip I remember leaving the airport and I was driving and I had nothing but smiles for like a month and a half straight and I was leaving Logan Airport in Boston and some truck driver cut me off and stuck his head out the was like fuck you man gave me the finger to chill like wanted to go and fight nothing for I'll snap your neck but I don't want to fight nobody like I'm Buddha now like I like I like this vibe I'll go back to Thailand like it was weird man it was definitely trippy though but something brought me something very deep like in spiritual brought me to Thailand brought me to the guys though the opposite way I feel about Boston when I go back to Boston I see hostility I smile my right and people copy bluff you fucking quit something there's something unique about Boston people I mean not on you man I've told this to people like you know when you got to get up at fucking 6:00 in the morning to shovel 17 inches of snow off you fucking frozen windshield and go to work and sit in traffic and beep and be angry at each other like just makes a different person you know what definitely makes a different sense of humor but you know like there's a certain connection that I have to those northeast comedians yeah guys like Bill burr like we bill an hour I did a show Wednesday night and it's like whenever I'm around a guy from Boston it's like it's so obvious it's like there's a certain and there's also a certain respect for people's attention span very much this is one of the good things about starting out in Boston was like people didn't give a fuck like they don't have any time for your dilly-dallying up there you better come with the jokes cazzo true man first trip to take LA I know it was a la San Francisco I think at the time when I was younger when it's like some random sandwich shop I was like I'm hobby I was like give me one of those joints right there and the guy like was taking his time and I was like bro I'm in a fucking rush and like and my buddy was like dude watch the f-bomb sounds like what do you mean he's like just watch you have fun so the guy comes out with the sandwich he knows this little fucking peanut half-sandwich what the fuck am I gonna do with that and he's like I'm sorry like come on I was like where's the other half and he's like that's it's Aaron all like bro I need another fucking sandwich he's like I'm gonna have to charge you for it and I was like charge me do it if you gotta do bro I'm fuckin hungry like literally everybody behind me in line just out of dis person and like left the store my buddy was like bro I can't take you anywhere around here it was probably maybe 20 20 years old maybe yes see that's a different mark telegraphy and a different San Francisco very true San Francisco was like super calm aft back then now San Francisco's different San Francisco is homeless people projectile shitting into the streets yeah again that kind of the expensive real estate and tech tech torts whoo speaking they have a specific language in San Francisco yeah it's called up speak is that a fact yeah this is how I describe it as a language but tech people in San Francisco and if you're a tech person in San Francisco and you do this stop it as they do this no like here's the deal like what we're trying to do the end of all you know the car at the car yeah San Francisco San Francisco's version of that is ups block do everything at the end goes so we're trying it and what it is is like they're faking it they're trying to like when you want to pretend to be intelligent or tech savvy or in and it's a very left-wing thing to it so it's only people who are super liberal and super progressive like you can't say you couldn't talk like that go Donald Trump although he's problematic has some really good points in regards to the business I could say that bro please stop a lot of good combat sports come out of San Francisco think about like the the history of like you got the Graci Graci baja contingent up there you know half Gracie is got one of the the like Northern California they have an area is just areas killers Dave Terrell hope the Diaz brothers obviously Cesar Gracie you know and then you had Alex Gong used to be as I was just gonna say the FEA tech screw that was mafia Tech's were Alex Kong Johnson on the attacks did they ever catch the guy who killed him I don't yeah I think he killed himself actually I thank you no Alex GaN got killed in someone someone did something and he went out like someone would fuck with his car sometimes somebody who decide and and someone murdered him the way I heard it was he was training in the gym and somebody sideswipe don't hit his car sometimes something like that he ran down the street after him in a pair of fucking boxing gloves which probably wasn't you know I mean obviously you see some fucking savage running up to you when doing some gloves on so the guy shot him yeah but I think the guy had some mental history and he was like you know he was unstable or something like that and from what I understood I thought the guy actually committed suicide is suspect yep you're right lots of shooting killed himself yeah yeah that was fucked up man what up what a waste Oh huh yeah guy crashed into his parked car seat shaved out there it is yeah I was making shit up for a minute there nah man that's sad man he was a great fighter man I remember watching like member like isk like King box and back in the day when like the FairTax crew from Chandler Arizona you know who's the big guy Gallo Johnson FairTax and fair Tex was the other guy I was the smaller guy - I forget his name during a plank but that whole fairtex crew man back in the day man they just they came from Thailand and just fucking threw up like this aluminum building in Chandler Arizona in the desert and just started fucking you know fly-in people in if I can learn Muay Thai and they were kicking ass dude they kicked everybody's ass back in the day that is K kickboxing scene well when you started fighting there were very few people that were like formally trained in Muay Thai in our area in the Boston area like we we knew rich vasa Poli oh man what a name he died in the triathlon - yeah kicked in the head while he was swimming and during that crazy his crazy man him all the shit you did in your life he fucking got kicked by a swimmer and drowned yeah and he was like you know all he was done fighting young as for exactly he was chillin at the time so why do you say that man because back in the day I thought about this coming out here you know I remember the the first pair of Muay Thai shorts I saw like dude that's funky those those weird letters on the front leg and it was a knife you remember a guy named Edie baffle lock I think his name was chemicai he's in Australia he was a city of tongue guy - he remember that name yeah man he was like and I remember back in the day he was one of the first guys in the area to have a pair of muy Thai shorts and he was training with Dana Rosenblatt Jo Lake yeah remember that whole crew it's funny because we have similar backgrounds in martial arts in terms of Boston it was eating into each other back then but I think we were a little ahead of me at the time probably on my way out to when I was starting to train with Joe Lake I started train with Joe Lake when I was teaching in Revere I was teaching at Nautilus yes only on that joint yeah teaching Taekwondo there i Joe Lake was lifting weights over there and Joe Lake came in he saw we had heavy bags and the whole setup and then he started talking to me and asking me questions and we made a deal where he would teach me how to box and I would teach him how to kick and so he came over and we started doing some you know submit work and doing some things then I started working with him and Dana Rosenblatt right and Dana was only he was in high school at the time yeah I went to Malden Catholic with yeah I think I was 20 and I think Dana was 18 yeah 17 18 someone he began his career as a kickboxer as a kickboxer and there was no money in it he was doing well with his hands so Jill against him to stop kickboxing and he convinced me to stop fighting and he went on to sell real estate a really successful boxing career - he stopped Terry Norris that's right he who's the guy who used to be the boxing coach Howard Davis jr. he stopped him remember him yes the boxing coach at ATT yep I know exactly he beats some good guys he beats him real good far as a southpaw - it wasn't hmm yeah there's a tough kid but he also came up you know one of the things that I've said about one of the things that I learned for my kickboxing training was how dangerous it is to meathead spar and all we did meet heads back then that's we I mean it started off with like you know me and my brother would like you know hockey helmets and hockey gloves and trying that out and then little by little it was like I will you know get into a gym and stop box in and yeah man I remember the first time I went to a boxing gym and like the Boston area man I was on back then you went to a boxing gym and I remember literally like my coach sitting on me set me up a spar on it like a boxing club he's like all right you realize like you're the new guy I was like yeah they all know each other they don't know you like you got a big target on your back and I remember like the night before like I would go spar it like felt like a fight no yeah I mean a fight and I'd get to the gym and it was on dude back then it was like it was extremely unintelligent you know but that's we were cavemen at the time that's all we knew I remember you know there were holes in the walls that like rich vassilisa from people get knocked back in the sheetrock sheetrock you're easy man we didn't know any better though at the time well I started and I knew rich Vasa Poli from Dana I became friends with Dana and we started training together and then we would sometimes train over at Rich's place and that was when I got introduced into Muay Thai because one of Dana's friends had gone to Thailand and he had done some training over there and come back and and that's when I realized like how effective leg kicks were I've never been leg kick before except by accident yeah and then once I realized like shins to thigh like what how much damage that does and how he there was two revolutions that happened to me one was how easy it was for me to get punched in the face that was when I first from a traditional martial arts background bike window Taekwondo is so delusional because I feel outed often Taekwondo swelter you couldn't punch to the face so you had a very distorted perception of what you could get away with in a fight where there was no rules you just had this real and so one of the same reality check yeah so boxing alone was not good kickboxing was better because I could create some distance but it was still way easier than I liked to get punched in the face but then MoIT I was a big one because the moment you take that first leg kick and you feel that thud like oh shit this is that easy it's that easy to diminish me like almost instantaneously you're diminished I feel it as you're talking about it I took a low kick from Peter Arts in Tahlia No and oddly enough another trip was uh was a Tom he throw his oh oh no bro he might be the world who I thought my femur fucking cracked and a half never felt pain like that from the pay peter or from Paige or wolf at different times Pedro is the scariest guy I've ever seen kick a bat oh I've never seen anybody kick about so hard I agree man i trained with him a little bit in thailand back in the day we used to train at a gym called ISS which was like a take-off of like sigit on like a we sold some fighters and some trainers to a friend of korea tongs and i we would train on the roof of this building on like sukham vut highway in like the sun with like a canopy like above us it was pretty pretty uh pretty rough but Peter Aerts was there training at the time and Pedro his old came through there and I mean I was a lot smaller than them obviously but Jude why did this why'd you spar with them there anyways because I'm retarded the opportunity man they're like oh we need guys no I was actually helping someone else another one of my stable mates get ready and he just happened to be there and he's like ha man let's move around a little bit no this is probably not a good idea but it's an honor you know I mean so I'm partially proud of getting kicked in the leg by those guys but I I probably should have done that dude what's worse though nowadays that you see is the calf kicks more damage from those man yeah I'll meet down dude I'll take the kicks all day long on the thigh now man those tend at tender area like I remember losing a fight in Thailand I didn't really have an extensive career as a fighter but I did have some quality fights and that will vary that there were valuable lessons to me and I remember I was blocking wrong you know the whole thing every time Hilo kicked I would block and I would take it right with a calf kick goes like on the low part of the shin and I was pointing my toes down that's always controversial toes down toes up I always teach toes up to flex the shin muscle to flex the muscle around the shin bone and I was blocking wrong and I'll never forget that man I was bedridden from blocking kicks the wrong way and it was that same area with his like you said this no how long were you better before two weeks probably I'm a bit like trying to go to Lake it was in Thailand I came back from Thailand do it was a rough flight like I was awesome great lots of pain medication for that flight but I remember literally like after some of the fights like that I've had you know I was literally bedridden I couldn't go to like family barbecues and shit like just like dude I can't get hopping it's one of those kicks in the UFC that we've seen emerge over the last few years and I always give credit to Benson Henderson silver being the first guy to start doing it it's funny you say that because I threw a layup to an ik like the last show and I was like but maybe we might and it's like yeah I'm not mentioned in that name I mean you know it's over and belt correct I mean it is what it is that's crazy dude I said it I said man you know just a quick tip like a little fun fact you know Benson Henderson is a guy that really kicked that off you know in the lack of a better term and he's like yeah copy that exactly we got to eat you know he was the first though but he wasn't have the same effectiveness for whatever reason that these guys do now yeah there's there's guys now that are doing it where you see like one kick in the guy's fuck yep absolutely yeah and it's such a lower risk for the takedown too because you just do not travel in that far you know the high you kick them all risk for the takedown it just seems awful you know like the legs just to immediately stop working right I've had a few of my athletes suffer some serious trauma from those kicks and fights man it's not and you can't really prep for those you really can't like it's just all about managing distance you know controlling the range because you you can't really check it it's too low to check but you just need condition that no I'm not at all there's nothing to really do with it other than just like I said you got to manage distance properly so you just either way in no way out but in that middle weight like you get kicked like that man out chief what are you thoughts on this Robert Whittaker kick I mean a call to Robert Whittaker kick because uol Romero fucked him up with it in their first fight that side kick to the knee Oh referred to as team John John Jones one of the first school gym son it's actually illegal in some commissions right is it legal and I think it's illegal it's illegal in some some commissions don't allow it because the danger of like attacking the joint I have a hard time accepting that because it's okay to attack your fucking face why is it okay for me to kick you in the face but it's not okay for me to kick exactly any simple they say that you know and even in Thai boxing too you're not supposed to deliberately attack the joint yeah John yeah it's actually in cheek window on the out philosophy of Bruce Lee they believe they call like a it's a kung fu kick it's called the dumb tech I believe well the way Winkeljohn started teaching it you know we his students start doing it was the oblique style yes and but then they started doing that sidekick style to like that oblique style is very interesting yeah yeah I think that in my opinion it's it's it's a super super effective technique and take it out doesn't make any sense to me if you still allow he hooks yeah and he still allow I mean especially since he allowed kicks to the fucking head yeah true I'm a fan of the kick you know I'm not against it i I appreciate it I've one of the things I tell fighters all the time is that if you're gonna do anything if you're gonna kick me if you're gonna punch me if you're gonna try to take me down anything the first thing you need to do is take that step with that lead leg so if you and this is something Bruce Lee talked about in his art and philosophy but it's always disruption disrupting that lead leg stopping that lead leg and the ties use at all time a lot of times you know that teep the front kick they tape the leg a lot it's not always taught like a lot of a lot of people overlook it but I'm a huge fan of attacking that front leg like keeping the front leg it's not kicking the front leg so the first thing they need to do to close distances take that step well anything also to create another variable that the fighter has to think about as they're moving in you know thing just stops them like the worst thing you could ever do with a fighter is give them something that's real clear and easy to plan for yeah you do the same technique over and over again he can time it you know the same predictable series of movements you can't I meant that's why I guy like Dominick Cruz is so difficult to deal with because Dominick like good just shuffling his lefty righty swinging from the hips that's actually good that he is meant but he makes it work for fun yeah then the key thing with him to that and that is difficult to do that oblique kick oh that that front stop kick is is the lateral movement and if you're going straight in all the time and you're walking straight into that you're gonna be susceptible Dominic's always stepping off to the side yeah but there's a lefty or righty he's always creating an angle which is huge in combat you know who does that oblique kick fucking better than anybody lorenz larkin yes lorenz larkin throws that shit to another gaudi like a sidekick it sends dudes flying every when he fought Neil Magny yes I do I was like dude he's a stud that guy he's he's clean I watched him warm up I think he fought the Austen show I think at the time I was training yeah see how he throws that shit to the body dude he's a stud man you know I don't know why he wasn't as successful as he could have been on should Wow here's what happened he went over to Bellator and he immediately fought Leah okay Leamas a fucking monster he loses a decision to Lima then he gets into a slugfest with Paul motherfucking Daley might have the best left hook the world's ever known for MMA you know what take my boxers based but that fucking left hook he's got it's just insane dude I met him back in the day we used to die first time I went over to London we did a show called Cage Rage and I took Jorge or very the fights we played that the other day did you really Cory was just teeing off on him from the clinch Anderson was just taking one on the chin want to hear a funny story yeah I see Anderson and all I can see is like Georges got his back to me Jorge's got his back to me so he they're pummeling and they're in the center of the cage and they're kind of in a Thai clinch and George is throwing vicious uppercuts vicious uppercuts and over hands and uppercuts and he dirty bombs knock he was thundering his hands and he's throwing like these big bombs over the top everything and all I can see because George's backs to me I can't see Anderson's face all I can see is his head bobbing you know taking the hits I'm like yeah and then over George's shoulder I see Anderson's face and he's laughing at George I'm like fuck and then he just blitz don't he do that did he roll with them slightly like what did he do do it I think it's all a matter of like you know using your shoulders to protect impact you know shrugging and so to say the first first thing is bite first line of defense bite down second line of defense brace your neck you know and he just dude he's gonna fucking pumpkin head he's got a big dog dude well I mean but you stop and think about later in his career he couldn't take those kind of shots yeah they add up after a while I just put back in the day man I remember coming into that you know I had followed moat I had followed chute box I'd follow you know Pele those guys who I knew Anderson so a lot of people like I was this guy Anderson so he's coming over a lot of people didn't know him so I knew what we were getting into I knew what type of fight it was but though the funny thing is when he came to the UFC remember he debuted I was there at the Hard Rock against Chris even it was like ah dude the BET's lake I was like I saw the odds I'd like the mandala and I was like dude I'm all over this well the bet was it was just some crazy I forget at the time but like it was they had Leoben like like being like the favor okay I was like dude nobody knows in the promo one of that I said is you got to be ready for this guy this is this is a different animal yells Baron it's the same with Rich Franklin man I breeches my boy love you rich but you know I bet the fucking house on that and I did really well because the odds would just everybody thought rich was just gonna steamroll me no one particularly because rich was a stand-up fighter right primarily right and he had a ground game and he was on top of the time I mean he yes he was way on top but Anderson was just on a whole different level coming into the mixed martial arts coming into the UFC is just on a whole different level especially the style that Chris Leben had his style was so perfectly tailored exactly exactly walk forward throw bombs Anderson's like a smooth retreating defensive fighter these came from Thailand pretty cool shipped over pretty dope right yeah they're Chinese I believe yeah they're not tire thing they get more and more of a change or of a Chinese influence now the adult man Thailand was sick huh I love it cage cage rage was an interesting place because there was a that was a Wild West of fights yeah ever when leemarie fought Anderson Silva yep I do you know he almost got into a brawl twins who'd leave Maria for apparently like when I started going over there like leave my house like everybody's a gangster I raised a fucking motherfucker used to deliver like ticket sales like money from ticket sales and like I'm black like leather like duffle bag just stacked with fucking pounds look just like who is this guy and the promoters Dave and Andy I think at the time well like know my easily Jake Hanks time I was like whoa do you remember when he got stabbed in the heart in a knife fight and then was training six weeks later I do I do remember that I don't recall details but I do remember something to the London shoot fighters our good buddy Marius was training a 10th planet jiu-jitsu he came to LA to learn jujitsu and he was one of the head guys over at London Chu fighter so I got to get in with those guys yep I'm filling or before all that shit was going on and he was telling me about Lee Marie like way early like back in 2000 yeah you know so was it was way early way back in the early days it's so funny too because I that somebody brought it to my attention I do did you see Lee Marie's fucking Palace in Morocco he took the money and ran we made posters listen it's a mural beside it's like a 30 by 30 foot mural something like on his wall and and he's putting the Ambar on Jorge Rivera yeah and on the back of Jorge's shorts there's a big CEO Tong fuck the only time I want the plug was it a triangle a triangle around him you know that came on that was unexpected you know but you know it's tough man you know George was a very emotional fighter you know he was he had a rough upbringing with his family you know he's very connected to his to his family and you know it was it was a roller coaster working with that dude man but he was my first man you never forget your first fight yeah he's a great dude man yeah I'm talent that's he sure he did well man if you go back and look like he fought like the who's who's of like the UFC like that everybody he fought was legit he had he had there was never a dull moment of any fights that George had you know the other good run for a while there it was the early days to die remember we were in a know when we first [Laughter] there's another there's another it's a weird mural though because this guy like good go large on that against the portions are off yeah so whoever did it was gonna pull out a sign of a shit artist he might actually done that himself he might actually fucking had someone come in and put some numbers up paint-by-numbers the old UFC logo he's got a Mandalay Bay logos hilarious he's got him getting him in the Triangle but look like it the one when he's flexing like that's not even the same dude like look they added all this extra meat his lats and his lower jaw barrier I've seen another one too he might have a few in his fucking house the hook of him murals of himself looking so ridiculous what is the why why one image of the two of them clinching like what look at that how bizarre like why put that picture in this is some odds a yoke tough though rocking dude yes my big fan of clean we put the bleach in I want the Mandalay Bay scale if you I make your arms bigger and then when you get him in a triangle which make you tan just gonna say he's not even the same tan he's a different guy that's hilarious yeah is that is that his place so he's still in the pokey for people who don't know Lee Murray was a part of the one of the biggest armed robberies I think the biggest in the history of the UK huge money they made away with millions and millions of dollars yeah and some of it's still millions of pounds I think it do the trend did you know yeah you go out with a fucking mask on like Hannibal Lecter yeah yeah but that million pounds 53 what's the conversion on that achievement that's ridiculous money yeah that's crazy yeah it's hard to tell like at the time we would have to go back yeah yeah what it was but a lot of money yeah I think a lot of it is still missing but yeah they had like ninja masks on they were dressed like they're in that movie heat how did they I thought there was no extradition like from Morocco that's why he fled they ended up after I don't know what happened but yeah I thought that too wasn't that where Badr Hari went - yeah I was like fuck this come catch me now I always want to wind up leaving so they you know Badr Hari he did his time he went over came back and he got Badr Hari got arrested for stomping a man's shin in half yeah there was some sort of a dispute in a nightclub and Badr Hari does not play there's a video of him walking into a hotel and the hotel guy says something stupid to him so he goes behind the counter and smacks him in the face that guy it's my hotel he's a fucking giant - there's like 65 a world heavyweight kickboxing champion and a ferocious terrifying man who fucks up grown-ass people yeah here's a video yeah I don't know what the guy said but Badr Hari is like what excuse me what the fuck you say it just goes we probably said some shit like welcome to the Marriott [Laughter] the way this like super dangerous super scary looking to he like stock some walks him down standard a smacked him very dismissive Lee it wasn't like worried about the count exactly like smack them with a little kid in the back of the head you gotta pick and choose your battles wisely man if I saw a bottle how are you walking towards me and like hello sir yeah how can I help you yeah what may I do for you sweet is ready your bags yeah champagne will be brought to the room he's Muslim he probably doesn't drink right now probably he's a beast man you know he's supposed to be on his way back right he he fought Rico Verhoeven and he broke his arm and like some freak incident in the first round it's breaking shinbones break mom's I think he means he's broke no he broke his arm like he fought Rico and I think he's blocking a kick and his arm just broke and he realized it's somewhere in the middle of the round he's like we got a stop like a just like this is broken who just broke them around recently and during the fight was it um that's a Paul Felder yeah I saw a common man yeah that fucking spin do you always read the spin kick so no matter how many angles I have in that fucking truck no matter what I'm looking at as much experiences is you know I have like you read the spin shit like you see it coming a mile away is it's because you have so much experience like with this penalty my shit dude that was shit but you see it like a lot of times you're like he's setting up that's been he said I'm like their hips yeah I mean that was my number one technique from when I was fighting was spinning back kick to the body yeah I just knew that it was such a short amount of time that I needed to deliver it and if you were in range and I hate you your fucks ville cuz I knew there was just like this we've we've laughed about this before because I tell you like I've never held for a kick as hard as oh isn't it like don't honey dick maybe bullshit mean bro it's not fun holding pads for you there's times like when you texted me and I'm just like fuck fuck don't return the text don't go don't go to syndicate I don't go to performance since dude hold pads for Joe dude I remember one time I helped pass you and I remember literally like I couldn't grip a coffee mug till I drank my forearms was so traps remember that night pushing talkback buttons on the truck at the truck and I was like fatigued just my fingers wouldn't function bro I'm telling you no bullshit I've held for a lot of guys I've held for a lot of fighters a lot of big guys small guys I've never held even that's a round kick that's not even some spin shit that you do like just the basic tie round kick bro nasty nasty nasty you did it on that machine too didn't you well the numbers on it something silly like well there's a guy's figured out how to beat my number he yeah yeah guy at the Performance Institute I got a hundred and fifty two thousand and the dude got a hundred and eighty-eight thousand and what he realizes if you hit it with the in see the numbers larger with the shin I got to hit it with the instep I'm healing a slight meniscus tear that I got when I was doing it with chillin with no warm-up wearing jean that was fucking asshole at 50 years old full blast kick no one yeah that's that dick measuring testosterone like what hanging out we're having a good time with Joe shillings here and he's kicking that thing came on yeah and he got some pretty good numbers you know he was smashing it so he's a narc he's a mean dude I love that dude I love that he's a sweetheart though man you know he's such a cool guy dude yes it's fucking terrifying well I was I was talking to someone about him and they were saying that he's like one of the most risk-taking elite fighters he'll ever see like he's a real elite kickboxer but he's been knocked out before and stopped before just because he's so yeah he's not risk-averse yeah he'll he'll take big risks yeah but it's one of the reasons why he's so fucking exciting yep exactly was just gonna say the same thing that's what they've that's what the fans want to see you man yeah I want to see conservatives you know he's a fan favorite for sure you can't stop crazy the whole way of looking at things so true his whole motto that's why I like the you know the bone the bonuses with the UFC and all that you know Dana putting that together you know I remember back in the day like one of the early fighter meetings they're like you know and we do the weigh-ins and then Dana would be like all right fighters only backstage you know they do fighters only no Coaches no corners and Dana's like yeah you know gameplan you know strategy fuck all that just go for it like you want to get paid go and one of the examples he would use is Chris Lytle then but Chris Lytle letting him like a losing record in the UFC but he was just went for it every time and would use all the time you know so I wouldn't give that speech yeah very different what would y'all speech can says to fight your best fight right the way you're supposed to fight that was the message but the idea was don't don't you know leave it out there don't be conservative you can leave it out there if you want yeah your opponent might not you know this is the thing I don't think I don't fighting is very important to me it means a lot it means a lot because I used to do it it means a lot because I love to watch it it means a lot because I'm very deeply entrenched in the history and the significance of it what it means and for me fighting should always be done at its best and what that means is you should always do what's the right thing to do in the situation like if you are you know you could break it down with individual arts right if you're if you're doing jiu-jitsu there's a there's a correct way to do an armbar counter right don't do the incorrect way because the fans want to see it that doesn't make any sense to me if there's an exciting way to get out of an armbar that's not the right way to do nothing things like a slam them but it might well pick them up and slam them works if you have to but I'm saying it like just as a rough example if if you if there was a way to defend an armbar that wasn't the correct way to do it but the fans liked it more don't do that don't do that you want to fight like a maestro you want to fight like like a virtuoso yeah you want to fight like Mighty Mouse there you go exactly what I tell everybody you look at my Mighty Mouse has had moments in his career like the ian mccall fight is a good example where he was he also had a full time job wasn't dedicated the way should be and got into a brawl and Ian took his back wanna pound it him and Mighty Mouse had vertigo after that fight he was really fucked up and and then quit his job I realized like I have to go full-time I have to dedicate myself to this full-time you know and when he did that then under the tutelage of Matt Hume he became the Mighty Mouse we see now but in my opinion one of the things that sets him apart from everybody else is that he he's not running away from you and not getting hit he's running at you and not getting hit I mean he's coming straight forward and then cutting angles and doing things to you that you didn't anticipate and he's not there for the counters yeah so he's fighting correctly seamless - yeah and it's incredibly exciting and that was one of the the criticisms of him really early on in his reign was that he wasn't finishing guys and then he knocked out Joseph Benavidez then he started finishing guys in the final seconds of the round right you know I mean he's he's just a monster man he's man he's a fucking monster but he fights correctly I would say don't find oh no disrespect to Chris Lytle who I love he's a great fighter I was just watching his fight against Brian Foster he's so skilled like people forgot how good Chris Lytle was won that fight with a leg lock you know and he's known as a brawler and people forget he fucking spun around got that leg and snatched it out and extended and really fucked Brian's leg up yeah crafty veteran he was a crafty guy but brawled a lot yeah I'm not a fan of I'm a fan of watching brawls when they take place I'm not a fan as well either you know I'm more of a fan of and I train a lot of my guys like almost offensively like backing up like Retreat fighting you know constantly trying to jockey for position I call like the right place right time all the time and that line of fire you know we're we're jockeying for that position you know and it's a lot of times it's easier just to take a step back if we're fighting each other we're standing in front of each other I take a step back what do you naturally do you walk to me right so it's the timing of catching them on the way in and guys like you know great fighters in my opinion are more like defensive fight us like you like you said earlier Chris Leben coming in with Anderson Silva Forrest Griffin sure I know attack like you're more vulnerable like recklessly like you said like brawling recklessly coming in against somebody skilled as Anderson Silva at Demetrius Johnson you know so I'm a fan of the retreating attack I call it Anderson was such a retreating attacker then he had a problem when guys didn't come forward right exotic the stinkers they have like my late Alice Lee that's so painful to watch those folks that's your Cote Patrick Cote Chakotay was very smart when he fought him yes I camped him that whole fight I trained him that whole fight I had the experience from or hey I knew Anderson Silva you know he spent that entire camp in Boston with me he did have a knee injury going into the fight we knew like it was gonna be an issue but you know I said I actually said this to him part of the game plan and strategy it's funny you say that was to let him come to you like everybody when because Patrick was the type of fighter that was a go-getter he had that big overhand right you know he would he would put change yeah he would put pressure on you and I said Patrick I'm telling you you can't fight the way you normally fight against Anderson Silva even if you hear boos we're following the game plan you know if you hit if you hear the boos from the crowd like we're doing doing the right thing don't fall victim to it don't try to lunge at him don't throw big power punches let him come to you and we did and that was actually the first time we took Anderson past the third round I think was he the third of the three actually going into the fourth I think he was stepping in to throw a kick in his leg yellow exactly yeah you know like no no that was in Chicago a corner did you get an MRI before that fight I think if I remember correctly he had an issue we knew going into it we didn't want to pull out of the fight you know how bad was the issue it was it was pretty severe and after it I think that was just the icing on the cake it blew out completely during the fight so he had a partial tear or something like that something to that effect bring up that fight Jamie I'm curious now it was weird it was a weird blowout because there was almost like ins but yeah I was just gonna say there was like it wasn't during an exchange I think like you said he went to push off his back foot I don't be curious to see that's been a while since I visited that yeah I just remember not knowing what happened and he fell down yeah you called that fight yeah that was before what's that was it was Patrick Cote and so from probably 2000 what was that 9 maybe a little later yeah maybe 9 or 10 yeah just blur at this point I know 400 shows it doesn't 8 yeah that makes sense yeah see house a while ago huh wow man that was the rain that was Anderson he had he was he was the king but people didn't appreciate him the way they appreciated him after he knocked out Forrest Griffin Stephan Bonnar after Vitor Belfort that front kick to the face yeah that's when he became the goat dude he was he was like like literally feared like I think Allah yeah a lot of fighters just like that call came and it was like Anderson so he like fuck well he was also so calm yeah you know there was something about him in those days he was I used to always say this and I told Jorge this said his cage rage fight with him I said do it he beats people at the weigh-ins he's like what do you mean everything what do you mean he has this thing it's funny like we need goes to weigh-in with you like you know normally like people go like face to face they get real close I mean yeah he would walk up to you as if you got and then he would thrust his neck forward like his head would like fucking gadget head like would come out and he would just be all up in your face and it would like surprise you like you know and I told Jorge that I said Jorge be ready to weigh in like he's gonna put his face like he's gonna cover distance quickly like he moves his head like oh she naynay like he's like I don't know you did puts his head like way out and he did it and I was like man there it is well that was one of the ways that Chris Leben overcame him psychologically at the weigh-ins I remember Chris saying I'm not afraid I'm not afraid of you yeah he was looking right at him he said I'm not afraid of you and he probably wasn't man wasn't afraid of him he wasn't afraid of no that was Chris when he was in his prime and that's when they were kissing at the weigh-in when they understand right so close that's right there was no really lip-to-lip yeah encrusted Asajj somebody just spoke of something about him fighting in that bare-knuckle league of something against Phil Baroni or something like that who Chris Leben verse Phil burns Chris Leben yeah yeah I said Chris Weidman oh why minute Weidman I did say Weidman right no leader and I thought did I say Whedon said Weidman I've combined each man did I say why leader Leoben Leoben okay I might have fucked up Chris Weidman when Weidman beat all Heath yeah he beat him at the way they got faced up yeah yeah yeah and he said yeah I'm not afraid he said I'm not afraid of you yeah and when he was looking at right I was I'm not afraid of you bro and then you could tell a nurses like oh shit he's not afraid yeah that didn't see what happened that night man well what's interesting in that fight - was that a nursin could I mean he was he was cool nearly scoring with heavy leg kicks and putting Leoben in jeopardy I mean he was damaging that leg say Leoben I said it again said it again what's wrong with me why am i confusing those two that both Chris fuck it they talk without him I should just say Chris you say Chris Chris Chris when Weidman Wyden got him down the first round almost got him in a leg lock and then they got back up two feet and Anderson started fucking him up with leg kicks and Anderson was hitting him with some nasty nasty leg kicks and he was he was saying in between rounds like it was weird it was weird that he was doing that like he was it was totally out of character yeah he said he had some funky moments in the Octagon every time the fucking Umbach moving his hands off immediately again the feet or before he Frank dancin and shit like I remember there was a couple fights well the fight with Damian mind I was just that's the one oh that's the one I'm referring to you psychologically fell apart in that fight yeah he was screaming at Demian Maia and yelling things at him Damian Myers is still plugging away yeah he took a lot of shots in that fight but then was there third fourth and fifth when Anderson wasn't doing shit yeah Anderson was just like Zane was that the fighter there's a there was one flight to where he was like in the center of the Octagon control unbeaten are striking and like I forget who wasn't might've been the day might've been somebody else but he he actually stopped and step back and put his back to the fence and say come on come on let's fight on the fence now and he like backed his cell Oh Stefan bomb that's right and that's we got caught with the spinning elbow was it uh no Stephan Bonnar tried to spinning back-kick him and he just slid out of the way and they went right back to the fence and went come on yeah that was exactly fucked him up yeah I think he hit him with the need of the body and then dropped him and then and then beat the shit out of him yeah that was just he was just so calm and relaxed in there and Bonner was so stiff and I think that was it yeah I worked with Stefan for a bunch of fights I didn't work with F I don't recall but that was also fight where I think Bonner pissed hot I think he had an opportunity yeah I think he's just like listen I got some injuries I'm just gonna juice it up dude pissed hot is better than shit hot because when he fought Sam hoger at the Thomas Mac arena you fuckin shit himself during the fight Sam Sam ho guy was like bro it's like on top and they grab when he's like probably fuckin stink you shoot yourself he's like yes I did the worst pot about as we come backstage you know the tie cups they like the string up the crab the butt crack he's like coach get my cup and I was like bro you're on your own cut it off dude I'm good hilarious dude I got the corner I think for that fight with the great collison crazy at the time several times dude when we went when we went to the went to the Reebok uniforms and dudes were wearing white no white shorts like stay away from white shorts like Brown I think you all dude you well Bert Merida Denisha yeah I think he shouted one of his fights to one time michael Chiesa when he fought by neil darish right before the fight start he leans over to me goes dude I remember that before the walk dude they almost had to postpone the walk yeah man he was gonna run to remember UFC Stan fight started yeah UFC staff he was in the tunnel getting ready to walk he's like bro I got to go the bathroom it like no no you're good you can use like why didn't I let him go Ron how long did it take 30 seconds we'll cover what the guy take a dump right behind in production time the format fucking schedule whatever it is but do when a man's got shit he's got a shit here's Anderson and Patrick yes on fight back yeah this is the first round so it didn't happen till third or fourth or whatever it was yeah it was I I think it was a third but see Jesse Anderson was just moving around real relaxed didn't do much yeah it was an interesting fight because Cote didn't fight his normal style yep he stayed real like boxed up I forgot this that Anderson had him down at one point um Anderson scrapland Thunder a tattoo of an he's a good grapple he's just long as fuck he's built to grapple to it even when he was kicking it was like no no no no no I think this is his knee was already I think we knew at this point he's like my knees jacked dude my knees jacked up I remember him talking to me during the fight in between rounds but uh he definitely uh he definitely put up a fight at least and at the time nobody was even close to putting up a fight well they're right they'll mycelia so it's right before the Patrick was super fucking dangerous see this is where we set out the way the first one to take him to the third round because nobody had passed the second round with him well not only that it was a totally uneventful three rounds there wasn't even a moment where Patrick was in trouble you know and he was fighting for the title yep yeah I was the main event title for Patrick was always dangerous he always had that one bomb that could put you out and Anderson knew that you know so he was he was fighting a smart strategy but it was interesting because it kind of showed a hole in his style that his style was so counter-attacking yeah he did not oh it's you know d-did he tried to lift his front foot up almost like to fake like a front kick bring that back to me I think he tried he tried to pick up his front leg to fake like a tee but a fake like a front leg attack and then he hopped on his back leg yeah that's rough man weird yeah see right there there it is right there yeah yeah he's in a lot of pain too Cote is a tough do to a man to see him wince and go down like that I mean so was the issue was it a meniscus issue was it all I'd be lying if I made some shit up right now but I think it was some something like that that's why I fight for call dude I think he had issues too like he had a staph infection in his knee like repeatedly like I remember he had staff and his knee like a bunch of times so I don't know man but he uh you know his best punch too was not only his overhand right but his rear uppercut yes he nasty yes take me up a bunch of times it's it was weird his power you know yeah it's not like he didn't look like a strong guy yeah his power was weird yeah see watching hops up on that front leg and boom you see just a that Tom loss yeah yikes dude knees back nasty injuries all those leglock motherfuckers fucked up knees dude Eddie just had to get his meniscus fixed too yeah meniscus operation pretty recently yeah yet shoulder surgery recently he had back surgery recently yeah a back surgery a little over a year ago knee surgery recently he's not doing that stem-cell shit you're talking about huh no he hasn't I think he did something but he do it with the place that I go to but it's just you know years and years of jiu-jitsu not good for your body everybody that I know as much as I love you too bro I'm telling you I sustained most of my injuries and rollin like yeah it's like almost like I can't get out of a jujitsu session like Gyo noogie without getting something tweaked or something you know well I was talking the other night with some guys from Team Alpha male and we're talking about guys who have fake discs how many guys have had artificial discs put in their necks and in their back since it's a fucking terrifying number you keep going on and not used to yeah like he got one too yeah he's got two in his neck like what lower back what god damn he's 30 this guy's like 30 years old with fake backs combat sports a rough man yeah particularly wrestling you know and particularly jiu-jitsu wrestling it seems to be a lot of the neck and jiu-jitsu it's neck and lower back the lower back seems to get jacked almost everybody I've been lucky knock on wood and I've been lucky I haven't really suffered any serious injuries in my training career I wonder - how much tight raining and throwing kicks because it's so core intensive kicking it so much so much I think it protects you because like a lot of my like that my lower back it's very heavily muscled yeah the lower back in the mid it's one of the first things like I actually look at when I'm like studying like a fighter as I look to see his back oh yeah sounds like this guy's gonna be strong yeah what makes you say that like dude look at his lower and lower backs but yes I say that I'm like look at his lower back you see guys with like jacked up like lower back muscles you know that core strength is just off the chain do you have a reverse hyper in your gym do you have one of those no dude that should be standard in any gym with a wrestle really is that the inversion that's the one where you lie down on the table with your upper body and your lower body hangs down okay and hooks into this yes I've seen thing and it was created by Louis Simmons that guy from West Side barbell the powerlifting monster and when you lift your legs up it strengthens your back there it is right there okay and on the way down it decompresses the spine really was almost like compresses see there's a video if you show them the video he'll get a chance see what it is and the video Louie's explaining it but we have one back here and I've had one for a couple years now and it's it's just go forward just go forward you don't need to see the vault here the volume see as she's going up it's strengthening her back and then on the down it extends and it lengthens the back and decompresses it it's active decompression it's one of the rare things that provides active decompression in contrast with strengthening so it strengthens it on the way up and then loosens it on the way back and that activating the muscles and the strengthening portion portion of it and then the decompression portion together it's uniquely good for a uniquely effective for strengthening and rehabilitating lower back issues interesting going Hayes oh yeah he developed it because they were trying to give him surgery they were trying to they were trying to fuse his discs together because he had a bulging disc so you tried to figure out how to fix a bulging disc and that's how I figured it out but it's now like universally praised it's been one of the as being one of the best exercises to prevent injury but more importantly to rehabilitate you if you have something like that going on I gotta check that out for sure how it should be standard for every gym it's one of those pieces of equipment that I think like but one of the big things that happens with guys is compression and very few fighters in particular spend time doing spinal decompression like on those inversion tables gonna say inversion to those are great and they're great just just chillin one of those those teeters chillin one of those for ten minutes a day just put the boots on and kick back and just and and then tighten your back up and then let it loose and tighten your back up and let it I've used them if and you could push on the handles you have to give yourself some separation you're just you have to do something to to compensate for all the pressure right so there's all this compression and you've got to do something to decompress I've seen something too like with a like a band around your neck you lay on the floor and almost like put it on a doorknob almost like an eye pulls your head up you ever seen something like that I have one that's it's a thing that you put on your chin strap yeah and I put it on a unit like a barbell yeah so I get up to the barbell I'm gonna sit underneath it with a chair yeah say my neck yeah that's like two inches talking yeah like you said to wrestling is the worst man just like that always shootin that single shravan grabbing your head yeah it's rough well tied to right oh my god I remember the first one of the first experiences I had clinching wit guys in Thailand you know cuz I was one of the bigger guys they were like oh I need you need you to clinch you know and he's tied you just hanging on my neck hanging on my neck you know over you know for an hour straight and I've never felt anything like that man my neck was completely locked up I couldn't turn I had to actually get one of those uh the neck braces there the collars really yeah I had to get like maybe massage like every day I literally I was out of training probably for four or five days I couldn't even I couldn't has almost like having a stiff neck but it was yeah well you gotta think those muscles don't get used that much or I'm not doing that correct yeah if you're not doing well neck extensions yeah and then I went to my trainer and I was like I don't like make my next stronger and he took me over this coffee can filled with cement and a rope coming out of it and he said you bite the rope and you go in a member of ringside had like a thing like nothing they put that like thing like a strap around your head with the chains real weight yeah yeah like this but fighting it seems better to yes because you're working the mandible as well the problem was is everybody fucking bit on the thing and I remember being in a bank in in Thailand in patio onsen like there was like a water like thing but there was there was no plastic cups there was no like cups like disposable cups there was a plastic cup with a string tied to it Oh people would just go and fill it and just lip on it and put it down like bro this is rough dude well I figured like I'm not that thirsty those moist environments like there's so much bacteria in the air and how common is uh how come his staff dude it's so funny you say that because you would think it would run rampant like ringworm like I remember one of the first times I got ringworm in Thailand and I like had a bandaid on it I was clinching one might rain upon his Thai guy and the band-aid came off I was like hold on them to go chat he's like whoa don't worry about it I was like no like let me like cover this up and he's like he touched it he like was rubbing it like dude don't worry about that sir and I was like dude no no no it's like it's ringworm Pro and like it's like bit like Thai leather skin is like immune to it they don't fucking get ringworm they don't get stuff like it's weird like you don't don't care it's not calm and no it's weird I'm sure they do get it but it's funny like it doesn't like run rampant in the gyms like you would think like a bunch of sweaty Thai dudes training with no shirts on clinching hanging all over each other you know and they you know they lain on the ground doing sit-ups and push-ups and all that bullshit and is it's not common like there's not a lot of ringworm in the gyms is not a lot a lot of staph infections I don't know if just the their body builds immunity to it I don't know it's just not common it's common American gyms oh my god I remember being on The Ultimate Fighter season when I coached a season for the comeback with Jorge Patrick Cote oh that's how I met all those guys Chris Lytle etc said I'm Matt Serra was on that show who was it that got it uh Edwin Dewey's I think got a staph infection and nobody everybody's like what the hell's wrong with just and I was like bro that's like that's like the heebie-jeebies that's like the Matt's Gabby's like that staff and everybody was like what's that and I was like bro that staph infection like when was a lion I went to the UFC the production team and I said when was the last time like you guys wiped clean the mats like ah like we clean them like once once a week when I was like whoa bro you got to clean these mats with like disinfectant every single training session and they're like alright that's calling us a couple at that wall like the padded wall like oh no we never clean that like bro they're bit they have no shirts on they're grappling you know with their backs on the wall sweating all over the wall and they I brought them brought it to their attention that listen everything needs to be cleaned in the gym Billy's Derby's bro Dana literally said you go back and you watch like the boxer he said I still got those like DVD series like and it's like literally Dana said like delle grazie pretty much saved the show the whole the whole almost the whole both teams got staph I was like get the Vans detail like get the Vans detail clean the mats clean instability balls I made everybody get tea tree and eucalyptus so you know it just nobody was educated at the time about it and it just it's a plague man it's yeah I I if I see anybody would ringworm or a staff I literally light fucking bombs in the gym and burn the fucking place down or the new mats from zebra and Rev gear it's so common I was just reading one of Gordon Ryan's posts on Instagram that he got Mercer for the second time yeah and that medication resistant staph infection that scares the shit out of me I had staff I can't really clean Cote I'm not gonna blame you bro but it was oddly enough right around the time where Cote had staff and his knee and I was camping him and I was very active at the time training with these guys and I got staph under my armpit both fucking armpits I literally had I was had to walk around like with my arms up like this I had wicks coming out of them like nasty dude staff has no tricks they put wicks what they do is they actually they make an incision they drain the abscess because it's an abscess essentially right they drain the abscess and then in a packet with like it literally looks like a wick from like a lantern it's like hollow in the middle cloth and they pack it in and they leave just a little tip out and as the wound drains and heals the wick comes out so he's two-inch like I kept on strength basically and was it medicated no they just they cleaned it out they make an incision they clean it all out they flush it with saline and they they pack it with a wick and they dope you up with quell flecks usually is the weapon of choice for antibiotics I think believe it's called Cal flicks and they are I had walking upstairs like everything that we see when guys fight on them remember what's his name Luke Rockhold against Chris Weidman Kevin Lee recently to remember we noticed it during the broadcast so heaven didn't take any medication specifically because he knew it would zap his cardio yeah well I'm sure the staff zapped him too period yeah but the antibiotics on top of it I remember when we called that fight you call that fight and I was like dude that's staff on us and we were talking about it and it's almost like the guys in the truck like don't mention it don't worry that they told Daniel Cormier not to say anything I brought it up the core mats right so does that look my staff to you and they're like don't bring that in yeah that's definitely staff Joe you don't give a single fuck yeah you got it was it was blatantly obvious it was so obvious how could anyone say to not talk about it's funny too because I don't think the Commission is supposed to allow you to fight in a fig if you got like a herpe on your lip or something fun no you got staff they like about scratch like so I was shocked because it was so blatant yeah exactly oh and he and I think make up on it on the way yeah that's right that's right yeah Suzie touched it up a little bit which is hilarious that's he's complicit everyone's involved Suzie's awesome I've had times I've had times they're like I've had fighters like oh my god they took a cut during the camp like you're trying to kind of hide it yeah airbrush yeah Kevin Lee that was a really unfortunate timing because I wanted to see what would happen in that fight I mean that was a you saw Kevin get Tony down he's beating him up I was just gonna say who was he fighting on um yeah he got his back you know fucking huge for his five penis you know I when he first emerged like and I was watching I was like I wasn't like I don't say I wasn't impressed but I had no idea like what is his capabilities we're like and I saw to watch him fight and I was like dude this guy's legit he's the man is prime yeah exactly he's 26 I think 26 is these very young Wow yeah find out how old Kevin Lee is I think I think he's a few you I think he's a few years from his problem 25 25 25 20 bucks young dude young how does a young young young as fuck smartest fuck to in a month you 20 seconds for he's a cool dude too he's a very cool guy I had him on my podcast and I think it really changed people's perceptions of him you realize how honesty is open intelligent and just really considerate and thinking about all the various aspects of his career and even when he was talking about like other fighters he wasn't shit talking necessarily was like really just talking about his own skills versus their skills and and even Ferguson when he's talking about Tony he was saying man this injury is a real bummer because it's gonna impede what he does like his whole thing is that he can do anything right he's like loose and he takes chances like if he's got this knee that's fucked up that he doesn't trust like that could really get I'm like oh that's a good point yeah he's got a knee that he doesn't trust it's gonna keep him from being as like freewheeling you know yeah one things about Tony is he's so unpredictable like how do you prepare for a guy that just moves crazy and as knockout power and nutty young parents yeah he trained with Eddy still holding with yes yes with Eddy what a freak accident man imagine yeah on your way to a fight you're doing press and you you're going to talk to some of you trip over some wires is that what it was a production why is like a momentum yeah and UFC tonight yeah and blew the fucking the the ligament off the bone you see this scar and I haven't no oh my god it's like a Haley it's like a 12-inch scar there was no previous injury or anything so that literally just came out of nowhere like fucking a white wires and fell sideways literally - which is how does a guy like that fall down even you would have he's so athletic because I was a warden at in the day we had remember when you used to do the UFC workout rooms and there is they would put man scar like 80 staples yeah it's nuts it's one of the bigger nice cars I've ever seen in my life that is nasty scar yeah but now he's he's running around he's moving yeah he's a freak man they were doing some UV light or something like that on it but you know he's starting to hit the bag again he throws kicks and punches on the bag we've we've lost fights in the past for those of you know like I was just gonna say we had those stuff you know the foldout maths like the bifold maths I remember like somebody got their foot caught in it rolled their ankle it was like one show a long time ago and you know we started talking about it I think it was uh Jimmy Gifford who works for Lorenzo back at the time I was like man you need those Dahmer of those rollout mats these seems to no good man people are tweaking their ankles left and right man we like we'd lose a fight occasionally in like backstage just I'm like somebody rolling their ankle in the cracks of the mats or something stupid like that but what a freak accident sad to think like and how close he was really close to that fight wasn't he there's a couple days out yeah do you remember when Kevin Randleman was backstage and he stepped on some pipes and flew through the air and landed on his head and knocked himself out backstage scrapping for the main event of a fiery it was like UFC 13 or 14 or some shit they lost the main of it lost the main of night I don't remember who he was supposed to be fighting I do not remember but I remember Kevin Randleman stepped on some pipes and fell and hit his fucking head yeah I remember thinking what yeah what are the odds maybe you're supposed to be fighting Pedro his oh I do not remember let's go on with Randleman days ago yeah was it Pedro his oh yeah what what when did you come on like 12 12 1997 was it Zuffa at the time it was it s e-g I see it was a lob meyerwitz that's right camera McLaren hired me no she was Tony blower did it before me I think we needed a new backstage interviewer guy and so UFC 12 yeah it's Dothan Alabama son we're supposed to be in Buffalo supposed to fly to Buffalo New York in or Albany somewhere in New York but New York State made it illegal like right before yeah so they had to change all the flights move the Octagon flying down to Dothan Alabama yeah Puddle Jumper plane yeah yeah I remember those days I was not involved with the company at the time I got I think the first fight I cornered was like UFC 36 or something like that but that was it that's early in the day too yeah you have seen 35 and a half it was when I came back yeah that's when I did my first what summit was it huh who's the first versus Vitor okay what I did who's the owner that sounds it Hart Davey it was like I'm thinking art Davies is one of the original guys yeah he was a part of s e-g it was art Davies Bob Meyerowitz yeah and I guess Corinne Gracie was involved in the very very beginning for 20 years whatever like a rib backstage will coming into the to the MGM in the back of the arena and you know uh you know everybody's pulling up you know but got the Ferraris Lambo is coming up and our Davey pulls up in a fucking Saturn and I was like oh boy I have time times have changed it's like like a busted like Nevada plate like fuck times have definitely changed Lambos Ferraris like blacked-out SUVs and then a Saturn lady rocky come see boy dude though I like a Zuffa bought the UFC for two million dollars right and I think of that yeah and they what four billion was the sale price talk about profit on return return of investment but it's a long time and then they bought it in 2001 right and you can imagine how much money the Fortius learns on Frank and day another how much money they put in to you know also yeah it's not like they bought it for a clean two mil and had smooth sailin and then sold out you know well they were in the hole for forty million dollars by the time 2005 rolled along so 2005 was the first season of The Ultimate Fighter and they were in the hole forty million dollars while they were doing while they're in production and they were trying to sell the they were trying to sell the UFC and and Lorenzo called Dana the next day and said fuck it let's just keep going yeah like he was saying like see if anybody wants to buy it and the other side fuck it let's just keep going yeah you know glad II did here we are yeah yeah but you got to think that the number the amount of money they have to make every month just to make the nut on four billion exactly yeah it's not an easy company in a runner yeah yeah I mean I don't really talk to Ari much when he's back there I just say how I shake his hand I don't never met a man I don't know yeah how well it's Dylan I've never met him I just missed them actually in Dubai I was on with Lorenzo threw me a fucking big layup and sent me over to Dubai to train uh Prince Tiger Noonan you've trained him several times right I had one trip I spent about a month there but I ended up just instead of teaching a Muay Thai just ended up doing jujitsu at my cellar guys here every day which was fucking awesome I show up at Dubai like

passport passport you just have to say it I just say it you it's literally like you almost like mocking them like in but you're not like they get it right away oh that's so strange weird like I've had like literally people like do it like don't hit you're like fucking ranked another guy that no I'm not doing went to places they they all spoke English everybody for the most part now yeah yeah nowadays for the most part yeah it was more it was more difficult to communicate well there was less tourists you know right and now you know it's over it's plagued with like Germans and Russians as like everybody's going to Thailand there was ice are Ferrari driving down the street for the first time ever like a couple years ago in town I was like a Ferrari in patia City Thailand it's all Russian money like a lot of big Russian money you know yeah there's a lot of like gangster activity tahadia specifically like Russian like Dutch Russian yeah what are they doing over there I don't know don't ask I don't know someone selling people I don't fucking know can buy a liver for fucking 500 baht in the street click I don't know bro I don't know but I definitely know that there was a time when I was going to Thailand and it felt like Thailand and then I went back once and it was like like everybody was speaking Russian and there was like white dudes everywhere like alpha wrong like all foreigners oh how do you think Russian why do you think I don't know well it's a lot of a lot of Europeans vacation in Thailand too you know it's like we go to like in America we go to like Aruba Bahamas Jamaica like that's how vacation like the Brits like from the UK they like let's go holiday in Thailand you know they go to Thailand Australians they go to Thailand like they go to Southeast Asia so it's just I don't know just it's a big tourist attraction in Thailand for Europeans and for now Russians I saw a lot of older European or American looking men with hot young Thai chicks yep absolutely I was like look at the taupe Mok really cheap you get a you get a fucking great deal over there yeah they run specials like yeah now you see it all the time the worst is like the the fat German guy in the fucking man thong walking down the street it would have fucking little boy like a 14 year old boy oh dude seems weird shit entirely oh man yeah as I said early man's Land of Smiles but this does not always smiles why is it worse if it's a fourteen-year-old boy versus a fortunate girl is it it's all the same at that point I don't know man I don't think I don't know worse I think the fourteen-year-old boy probably take it better I never thought of that and I don't want to that's what he's into yeah so you don't see a lot of that shit up in Chiangmai like it's not like no you know you know you were more like the elephant country and like yeah that's real Thailand to me yeah like that that Chiang Mai that northern Thailand is like the real Thai culture you know and then you as you go down south you get more touristy you get more freak shows you get elephants where everywhere like art young elephant are huge prevalent that's very insulting it's the Southeast Asia that's that's the the the fucking animal God like that's it like the elephant's everything to them the tie box inside well at first it was what they call crabby crab on which is known as uh and Thailand is offend AB which means like long short and that's the old depiction you see of swordplay like the Thais using swords and they dressed up these elephants in like armor and like rode baskets and just shot arrows from from from the top of the elephant so the elephant has always been a huge part of that even in warfare yeah they used the elephants in combat yeah yeah so they would like put these armor plates on the trunks of the elephants in the body of the elephant and they would put baskets on them and they would just go off in a battlefield and just be plucking people with arrows and just drop in Spears on them so the elephant was always prevalent to the success of of Thai culture that's great how'd you go on a battle riding a fucking LT get something up there in the internet what fucking three hundred something like that yeah yeah the ties were doing that shit against the burmese like back in the day and they dress match and you're in a fucking war with somebody you see a bunch of come towards you on elephants do a giant fucking horse like coming at me is one thing but an elephant like haha little bit here we got to fight them there's so big yeah I was so nervous around them big time it's weird we went to a place that rehabilitates them and they reintroduce him back into the wild yeah yeah it's you didn't ride it though I think yes you did I didn't like it though yeah I just didn't think it was necessary alright it's like this thing doesn't want me to ride it Lincoln rejects the King of Siam offer of elephants this is in 1862 Civil War Abraham Wow when the camp of war yeah that Camel thing the other day and I was like I wonder if they used them here camels I just yeah I found something the other day when we were talking about something and I stumbled across another article that said there were camels in the West and they used them to travel you know carry things to help develop the West yeah at some point they abandoned them and there was like a they called him the red ghost it was like a myth of this mythical animal that was 30 feet tall supposedly eight grizzly bears like I told you and like that was a camel it'll be in a camel yeah people were just shooting him on site because I didn't know what it was that's Lincoln pointed out that steam power had already taken in yeah for heavy animal power yeah I was just gonna say the Train that's the railroad system coming into play right there they like Lincoln was like fuck you and your elephants maybe we got trains dude yeah I guess but once the battle actually starts a bunch of when you hear them trumpet like we were pretty close to one when it let out like maybe within like 15 yards serious animal real life that is so loud yeah they're majestic um they have like such a presence it was raining out constantly there you know it's during the rainy season so this elephant was moving through this unbelievably beautiful lush green landscape with like fog and mist was fun and then he's beautiful huge tusks and he lets out that trumpet you're like whoa man it's got a serious presence being around for these dudes you just walk right up to him Pat it and touch it like they were really well cared for yeah but we went to a tiger so I was just gonna say did you do the tiger that was the opposite of the Tigers that was no I didn't like that they were drugged up Holly Michael got Isis that was disturb they gotta be man yeah yeah see their war yeah well guys got a can that's a legit cannon there's a civil war cannon on the top of he's got a machine gun look he's got a 50 Cal and what year is this this is a picture that shows up with that yeah Wow trippy dude fucking elephants man a 50 Cal look at this thing see all the guns Spears there you go that's what I was talking about is the shittiest way to see an army coming towards it's like brave I like do not retreat hold your ground and fuck you there's such a peaceful animals - yeah it's such a they eat so much you can't believe how much the thing do they walk around in the streets of patia like a handle will walk them up and down like the city streets just for like then they give you like fruit to feed them like papaya like a you want to feed the elephant you like tip the guy and they're like you see like an elephant like walking down the street through traffic and potty it's fucking weird huh it's cool though but every now and then you see them just get pissed oh yeah did you ever see like the elephant's gone wild videos tipping over cars like a cardboard I've seen that stampede and they stomp in their trainers all pissed off apparently they have Tigers or wild in Thailand as well they really do have Tigers yeah you know yeah you know the tiger is another another one of Italian do you think that it's maybe something in their diet that protects them from staff and from ringworm well that job in terms of the fighters yeah perhaps because they eat such spicy food is that was one may be related yeah cuz these when I tell you in Thai spice like some of the kids from the camp would literally be like dripping sweat like eating the spicy I wasn't like sweating like drippin perfuse Lee like sweating eating food I was yeah yeah I love seafood and I told them to go hard yeah I said do it like you would do it yeah how you like fuckin juice it up baby yeah and they didn't Dave fucking babe they still remember I remember one of the first trips we had to Thailand I was with one of my buddies and that went over and um he ordered some dish in the Thais lake no that's that's hot let spicy and he's like nah I'm talking like like no no no that's really spicy like he's like wow that's good I like spicy food I'll just drink a lot of water at ever he goes even hot for Thai people and I was like bro are you listening to what he's saying like I'm leaving - but he didn't know any better and he went for it and I'm telling you bro there was three of us in a hotel room in Pattaya Thailand and I woke up in the middle of night with him fucking shooting ass piss off his ass soaked the mattress the bed the sheets he's found him in a ball in the bathroom before do we have to take this kid to the nearest hospital he couldn't he we had a ride him on the bike we had to ride three people one driving the kid in the middle and me behind holding him up because he was like out of it from spicy food he got so like his food poison no no it was just the spices just kicked his ass so so bad he probably burnt a whole like an ulcer in his stomach dude he was in the hospital for like three days on an IV got a bill for like fucking nine bucks and we were out that was a wrap but he never ate the fucking same dish again though spicy yeah I don't fuck with the spices too much I love Thai food now like I'll experiment with it but I'm not like if my mouth is so hot and I can't taste the food I don't enjoy it I'm just like Ozzy seem right to me that seems like you would be more of a food poisoning issue it could have been but all I know is that I'll never forget the smell of that hotel room you know it's bad when it soaks through the mattress you know the Thais do they fucking flip it over next I remember buddy rented a house like a little like village house behind the camp and this Australian guy was like hey you mates fucking pretty scrappy huh and I was like what you mean is like hey he lives rough man I know but like you like to do a Thai thing and you know but you know he's got fucking money you don't have to live like a fucking bum you know and I was like I was amazing man the fucking how is he living in maan a fucking woman died of a fucking snakebite died in her fucking bed got bit by a snake I'm like what so I told my buddy bro he flipped the mattress over it was fucking soaked in blood they flipped the mattress and they fucking rented to the next floor until a coming in yeah yeah and I remember like literally like like literally like going to visit him and like you know put taking his shoes off going in his little fucking one-room Hut and then going to put my shoes on back and he's like shaky sneakers shake him out like shake a fucking tarantula out of my sneakers you got a shaky sneakers you've got a shake your sneakers before you go around and in the morning that was one of the first things I learned in Thailand dude out the first time I went to town like I was jumping on the tires you know I didn't with you for me what they have like a truck tire they lay down and they bounce on them so yeah it's great what's that for it's literally like jumping rope calf strength it's like jumping rope but it's awesome because it's not pounding on your joints so you get the bounce of the tire and they just kind of alternate stance and you bounce on the tire and it's like you know you're warm up out of your warm up so I'm bouncing on the tires and this jacked Thai guy that comes walking out of the room and he grabs a pair of gloves and I usually put the laces over the ropes they hang the gloves to dry over the ropes and he he's like meanest fuck like and he puts his hand in the glove he goes pretty he goes and he pulls his hand out in a fucking tarantula hit the ground literally you could hear the weight of the spider like boom kneeling I heard it hit the cement like the weight of the spider and this fucking thing moved so fast about covered about 12 feet in jumped up four feet into a heavy bag and crawled in between the crack of the leather of the heavy bag oh that's a bird eating spider and I was like a bird eating's why do they call it up wait a minute it can fucking catch Birds I was like what the fuck is this like and then literally every time I put my gloves on I was like peek in him and like tap on it like walk away and like look at the glove like kick the glove a little bit like one's good let's try the other one on like every morning just like shaking scorpions Audia daddy of sneakers and stuff or something crazy we never had a rat problem here at all we had nothing and then my dog was here one day I brought the dog by and then all of a sudden we started having rat problem weird and then Jamie looked it up and rats are attracted to dog Cesar yes yes I thought the main thing that rats eat dog shit yep you know I was just gonna say he's gotta be the feces so we literally didn't have any problem and then Jamie was like dude this rat shit here we found ratchet and then Jeff the other guy works here found a rat and killed it yeah he big rats by the tail who doesn't smack that motherfucker how gangsters that that he grabbed it by the tail tail poking out from behind a box and he grabbed it and soft and I killed it I'm good with rats but it was because Marshall was running around here yeah that the rats smelled that the dog is in there they go in there do this crazy dog don't attracts rats because they like to eat it plain and simple in fact dog poo is said to be the number one food source for rats in developed areas Wow meanwhile Marshall is even shit in here just the smell they might go yeah I smell like piss he pissed outside and he accidentally pissed in my Jim lifted his leg to hang on the rogue box the the you know step up by us and I go hey cut the shit we're inside and then I took him outside then he finished his piss so maybe the rat could smell or just say yeah the rat smells it that's fucked up though man that is fucked up we never had a problem I wonder how it works unlike those rat terriers they have dogs for that shit oh yeah right those little things never shut up ah yep yep yeah there go go go my friend vicki lewis from Newsradio one actress of Newsradio she had a Jack Russell yeah there you go great great dog it's a big dog in a little dog's body like a huge attitude like they step up to like big Mastiffs and fucking Punk only cool their Rat Terriers like that terriers did you ever see that documentary on Netflix about rats horrific really horrifically just with in terms of infestation disgusting how many of them there are in big cities you realize like how what what a real issue is my wife my wife freaks the fuck out if she sees a fucking rat she's smart she smiled we had like a little incident we will fucking parked at a parking garage on the 4th July we parked the car my walking down to walk to watch the fireworks and she's standing there and she fucking felt something on her foot and she looked it's a giant fucking rat chewing on her fucking nail polish freaked the fuck out and never been the same you literally like Mike my son Dante always fucks with her he's like mom look a rat and she's fucking freaks the fuck out right that's not funny stop that shit we all laugh at it it's fucking hilarious so deathly afraid of rats a nasty dude they're so gross that's a nasty in the dogs don't they control something in terms of population they have like benefits they're good at keeping rat populations high that's about it they're good for cleaning up dog shit it's gross what the fuck man they must have horrible breath yeah creepy little survivor but the the documentary on Netflix is brilliant really I gotta check it up good and one of one of the scenes they have these rat terriers tearing them apart yeah when they're digging into these holes on the rats come the dogs just grab them and Mangalam that's what they're for do you think they're like it's I'm just I just read something quickly and it doesn't really say much you think they just like today eat trash and they help us no yeah no they do they control some population they do good they gotta be good for fucking something oh there's an ecosystem right exactly every animal has its little spot then we get the big Boston rats they literally like they fucking punk cats they look like they're like the size of like a possum you're like certainly bigger than like any jacked-up squirrel or anything like that they're just big big the triangle tails like nasty they're survivor cat of rats rather they're out yeah cold winter and you know figure out a way to get em up in Boston rats I get accents and shit they like fucking running around eating dog shit when do you ever think about bailing the fucking winters there and everything does it get to you all the time all the time yeah I mean my parents are elderly like I got to keep an eye on them and I'm all my family's in Boston and my business is in Boston but you know that it luckily I travel a lot so it's kind of like the the vent you know I mean I get away I know if I can do like a day or two on a beach somewhere at a UFC event like and and that'll be like a little recharge but man I'm as I get older I never really it was like you know overwhelmed winters until I started getting older and now I'm like dude my body hurts my muscles ache my joints ache the colds nasty especially that New England cold man was like wet cold so you got the fuck out and I meant we talked about this you're like fuck went too far snow like fuck that well here's the thing I like some places where it gets cold like I love Colorado I remember you loved it you know I'd I'd move back there yeah if we Jamie and I have talked about it like that shit gets too crazy for cold though it's like the fine yeah it's not as bad as like the New England winters looks like wet nasty four-wheel drive snow tires warm clothes fireplace good Archery's to it it's just it Colorado it's sunny yeah that's the other thing good point Colorado sunny like 300 plus days a year Austin yeah go through months with that ray shit in the sky we don't see past the clouds never see nothing just just a dull gray blanket hanging over your head follows you around and the women you wonder why they're like that fucking misery sing yeah but I'll tell you what they'll Boston in the summer I love Boston to summer oh this one is like the sun's out guns out everybody's running around girls a dress and half dressed everybody looks happy exactly like everybody's happy everybody's chilling Boston and the Sun was cool I like Boston and my mama I'm a Boston native I always will be you know true and true but definitely not a fan of the windows and I've you know Bale someday I'll probably yeah we're gonna go let's come out question possibly hmm you're looking for work you hired I was gonna hire my coach so you go start up a gym I like it we located a few times they could use one out here yeah there's not like a real dedicated moita gym anywhere near me yeah I got offers you know obviously like work and you know for the company why not you know some offers to move to Vegas and whatnot at first like fuck Vegas but then I started hanging around with like the right people and like Henderson ah dude Summerlin like yeah like Lorenzo it was like hanging out going to like football games at Lorenzo and a family - there's like families little kids riding bikes down the street it's normal it felt normal like Summerlin someone in Vegas felt normal to me like I felt like I could actually live in Summerlin like you know the thing about it is I need to be near the ocean all connected to the the evil dick of Vegas you know it's all like all the jizz comes out the casino you're absolutely right man the worst is seeing like the locals like get their check on Fridays and they go right to the fucking casino and they just blow through it's fucking sad to see you man Vegas is a fucking weird place to it I'm I'm Way over Vegas people like oh you don't have Vegas it's fucking awesome dude I never never like dude it's not an awesome about fucking well parts are really good like the restaurants really absolutely saying Vegas has some of the best restaurants yeah yeah they still have 24-hour pol Hall I was just gonna say that's one thing that I like about Vegas it's not nothing's ever closed you want to fuckin burger its fuckin four o'clock and go fucking get a burger some way you want to go all you wanna have a drink you want to play pool like we've done many times like late at night middle of night that's what I love but I'm a night owl for sure like I I don't sleep like well at night like if if I were to choose like just to like operate like from from the sunset like sundown like to sunup like and then sleep all day like I would like other than laying in the Sun like I'm a night owl for sure but that's the one thing I do like about Vegas oh it's nothing nothing's ever close it makes you feel weird like why can't I buy a drink at 3:00 a.m. yeah exactly why do you why how come I can't have a beer why don't want to have a beer like my a grown man yeah except like after to everybody gets crazy tell you look you gotta go to bed yeah it's over as if it's gonna like give us structure and like teach us lessons and but I guess yes does it does like the gambling thing you know the thing about gambling is if gambling was everywhere then it would normalize right but it's not everywhere it's just in a couple spots so when you get to it that's when people are like up playing cards if morning Leary I'd bet in their mortgage yeah pumping oxygen into because so many people go there and lose everything everything they have I can't even fathom that like it happens I can see it now not really and I mean I'll entertain and play like some blackjack or something like that if like my buddies a plan but I'm not really like I don't I don't go out of my way to gamble I was just gonna say the same thing I like betting fights I like doing stuff like that I just whatever bets with friends whatever but then fights just makes it more interesting like you know like yeah give me 50 bucks on this and then while you're watching it you like come on exactly yes and then you always feel real sneaky when you get a shit decision you a rule we won that one my buddy one of my guys I trained Rico to shoe low he bets fights and he is fucking spot-on man he doesn't miss he's dude he can I literally I consult him between cuz i you know Maron in the truck I'm always betting what Maron or I was just like betting on fights and I just I go right to my buddy Rico I'm like Rico he got you like did she's consult talking about this weekend yes and he was spot-on with every fight except for one I think Nicola Mateus Niccolo who got caught by Dustin Ortiz I think that was the only fight he missed that was a crazy head kick it was man and he set it up nice - he set it up real nice because you know he it almost looked it was like delayed mm-hmm like it's almost like one speed and then it and then it changed direction it changed speed and it and he went high with it he set it up good that was done yeah almost like not a question mark kick but it looked like the exact one to the middle bring that and he went up high to get that because it's like he was establishing like a low kick at first and then it's almost like he went to look like it was gonna throw a head a low kick and then he changed the speed of the kick I called them to like the delay if you delay the kick and you changed the timing of the of the kick it's hard to read that's how he caught him you actually had a glove up - oddly enough but it went right through the glove yeah it was a dusting look good dough man he looked good yeah yeah he's a stud you know yeah he really is well they need people at that weight class you know who the fuck is there yeah - this weekend you know who's who's there you know good question I mean unless TJ comes down or Kody comes down depending upon who wins this fight yeah apparently they can both make the weight and that's nothing - wasn't Demetrius concern with that he's gonna commit to having a fight with one of them and then go through a full camp and then they miss weight and yeah so he said like yes take a fight agree with that 100% yeah I do but I don't think they would miss weight those guys are super professional both of them are and and TJ had already said he'd made the weight before he asked yeah he's tried it yeah he's got interesting well he seems smaller than he was just gonna say yeah he's definitely a lot leaner than he used to be you know is this it here well part of the fight to me get to they have these little things just to knock out itself to finish the Dustin Ortiz finish against the Mateus Nicola wasn't this is a chick fight dude you don't know what you're doing that kid uh Mateus though and Niccolo he trained he came through the gym through a couple of my Brazilian students Sowell and Rodrigo here it is he likes this kids tough man so Dustin it was an impressive win you know yeah I mean dear literally our see how it kind of delayed do you see that yeah you kind of play that back again he change his speed in the kick I notice that in the replay when we were calling him I was like look at this how he does this I'm soo here yeah that's right watch he's watch the speed change yeah yeah that's what made it difficult to read as I came out a weird angle yeah I did yep he came up I got a 45-degree angle yeah he won't let go no did he bonus for this fight oh I think I do not like bonuses I do not like win bonuses and don't like them I don't think cuz I don't think you should be paid more to win everyone's trying to win I don't think you should lose because a fucking judge who has no idea what they're talking about look II be blocked up fairly decent the glove uphill and still got K out right through it just got rocked I don't I don't think especially since they haven't dealt well at all with the judging issue I mean they really have done a terrible job with judging yeah these state Commission's yeah there's so much bad judging okay so if you have three people are they I think the system sucks I think the judging system itself the 10-point must system is outdated it's not right for MMA it's great for boxing it's not good for MMA yeah I think it needs to be revamped and restructured and I think it should be a completely different system yeah and then I think on top of that the judges are incompetent there's so much incompetent I was just going to say it has those factors and then you have win bonuses yeah so you have bad decisions all the time and normal with these bad decisions you give a win bonus to the wrong person in the wrong or so you gets fucked over you know and the swing is half the pay yeah and and at their level the pay scale it's just like they're already making fucking peanuts yeah if you're not making peanuts it cost you more it cost you 100 grand cause even more than that if you make 150 in 1/5 and then you should have won a fight and you lost you lost $150,000 because those three people are incompetent right exactly because they did a fucking eight-hour course on a Saturday never fucking put a glove on I don't care this is the thing they're not they're not fans yeah they just do that because that's their job and it's a cool job yeah means to tell their voice it's a cool job there are some judges that that do know what they're doing so they know it's a small hand yeah there is there is a helicopter the minute it's pretty much it's a crazy system the system badly needs to be updated I don't understand why they haven't yeah it just doesn't make any sense to me how much you owe me but I don't like the wind bonus thing that I just think you should get paid you should be a flat-rate like it isn't boxing mmm you know I just I don't think it incentivizes people to fight harder I don't believe that I think the winners are always gonna try to win you know I don't and and I think and it's I said like I said about fighting like don't don't fight technical you go out there and you let it all hang out yeah don't do that you know do you gonna have a nice short career if you do that true and that's what happens to those guys at those who it's good for the business it's good for the company it's good for the the that night the views the way the people are watching it would be a little bit more entertaining but you're not gonna make it you're gonna you're gonna leave half your brain in that octagon - another thing - man we talk about that all the time - is that seeing that these guys take trauma the way you man it's hard to watch man as much as we've spoke about this briefly in the past but uh you know as much as a fan as I am and as involved as I am in the sport man it's hard to watch sometimes man seeing these guys take the damage they do you know I remember I'm like I told you I think I told you a story before Marcus Davis after his fight coincidentally enough I believe a Chris Lytle he lost his sense of smell for like seven months he couldn't he couldn't Smita memory I told you about this but you know he couldn't smell like anything which means you can't taste so like he would he'd be like bro I'd smell like shit and like people would have to tell me like bro you fucking stink and then he'd be like I put on too much cologne and be like bro easy on the Cologne like he had no clue like you know he couldn't taste like lemonade tastes like fucking fruit punch he had no fucking clue he had no sense of smell Watase seven months imagine that he came back hit lit thank god it did yeah but he even said I was like would you would you miss the mostly and he's like the smell of my daughter's hair and I was like wow that's fucking trippy dude check please like I'm all set and he kept fighting - that was that was on I want to say early in his career but maybe halfway through well he again came from that school of hard knocks in Boston Jolie yeah exactly hard sparring you know hard training and I was sort of saying about Jeremy Stephens earlier to bring it all back around Jeremy sparse hard you know I was talking to Jocko about it yes like you know Jeremy's an animal yes I remember discussing that with Lorenzo back in the day as uh he went to Brazil when they were doing the aldo pieces and whatnot he went to Noven down he said man these fucking guys kill each other in the gym yeah he's like there's it's like literally like they're a hundred percent headhunting trying to kill each other I don't agree with that at all obviously you know it's horrible and there's so many guys that get really badly rocked on their way to fight yeah oh yeah and then all the time if he it's like sometimes like if a guy takes a big punch like and he gets a flash KO like and in in the gym like if we got to pull him from a fight because that because he's affected at that point it's like still you know this residual like they're you know it's still lingering no way around no way around it man I even had like a a student of mine but my guy Tommy ended up he had got no car accident you know like a week before his fight and this kid's got a granite chin and he got he got caught like and we attributed to the impact of the car crash like we said it had to have been like you suffered some head trauma because he hit his head in the car crash and he was susceptible he was vulnerable to the ko because of the trauma that he took so you takin big punches in the gym like that and then you go on on Fight Night it's that much easier for you to get in lights though and yeah percent but it's it's so hard to make a tough elite fighter without subjecting them to exactly well you see like Robbie Lawler like like he's talking about he doesn't spire anymore well he didn't for a long did it for what he did when he went to ATT ok but he for a long time he didn't yeah yeah like all through his Strikeforce career guidance bar which seems crazy like already know how to okay that boy can't fight you can't of my fucking fight that guy no he's had a lot of fight a lot of tough fights that's why I was so impressive with how failed dos Anjos did to him hmm dos Anjos just sort of dismantled I didn't see that coming and then Colby Covington this Mandal dos Anjos was like what in the hell he took him apart dude gas tank four days relentless fucking pressure I'm not tired watching the fight I was gassed in the truck like meanwhile dos Anjos known for his cardio he's one of Nickerson's pupils so he's like you know trains in that marble Marinovich I honestly like around the second round I was like there's no way he can keep this pace up he's got a fade and he never made it he never faded do you see him that's crazy it said something like an MMA jockey like he comes through with his as as a as stated he comes through Donald Trump with a strap and sold it and you got to remember early in Colby's career he wasn't like that yeah he wasn't come from I know he's at a champion but wait where was he training before a PT that's a good question I do not know because he kind of allowed Mon as he came out of nowhere like he earned his way in but he really liked it was like it's so funny that a red hat with white letters can get you punched now I mean it could say anything what this girl had a hat on it said make Bitcoin great again they fucking they what's that happy what's that make America great yeah but a red hat with white letters is racist now be a Nazi flag to some people it is crazy this topsy-turvy world we're living burning flags and shits ridiculous well listen brother we got to get out of here yeah we can go to weigh-ins been to the weigh-ins is a three o'clock today
