pack coats are supposed to be he's like yeah out with you yeah five four three two Ben Greenfield ladies and gentlemen and Robo hey yo so it's been a lot of fun hanging out with you for the last forty four minutes that's a sick game you know yeah it's pretty fun right I need to build a really really big like 67 yard long living room to put my big screen in now yeah that thing is crazy this we're talking about this game called techno hunt that we're just so dude you you are an interesting fucking guy you do a lot of weird shit I wouldn't know thank you I think yeah no it's good yes it's a compliment I like it yeah interesting is a good thing but your um like your background you were just telling me this is very fascinating like you you live way the fuck out in the middle of nowhere well it's caught it's kind of I mean it's Spokane right Spokane I mean we have like a theater off the grid and we have restaurants there are actual people that new restaurant yeah there's a theater there's a little five-and-dime store at a general store Spokane's a normal place it's pretty no you're you're totally off the grid well up at our house we are you know we're solar panels and well and the way I have it set up is we eased in power from the local municipal power but if that goes out then it hits the solar inverters and we're full solar so then there's like a battery panel in the garage that stores the solar because we're on like a north-facing slope so you get Sun from 10:00 to 2:00 so we can't collect a lot of solar but you store it in the battery so it's it's there so you got to be very judicious with yeah your laptop is yeah well it's a stupid home so there's there's no Wi-Fi there's no Bluetooth so everything's like it's it's hardwired metal shielded Ethernet cable let's do the whole house because I don't like to have like Wi-Fi signals bouncing around it's really I don't feel good what is that doing to us well actually just read there's a really good new book that came out is called like that the non tinfoil hat guide to EMF I think he's a full time of the book but it goes into this idea of what are called voltage-gated calcium channels on your cell membrane and those actually get affected by Wi-Fi and apparently you see like a like a change in the electrochemical balance across the actual membrane in response to things like Wi-Fi apparently Bluetooth affects red blood cells and I haven't seen I haven't seen a lot of like actual you know in vivo research on that but I know that I feel better when I don't have like the Wi-Fi router going or you know I off on my everything at night there's kill switches and all the bedrooms so it's big you walk into the house and it's just super clean no everything's HEPA air filters negative ion generators no Wi-Fi no Bluetooth we we structure all the water that comes in from the well so it's the same it's got like that have you heard of structured water Bravo just got that installed in his Jenn it's kind of cool I mean the idea behind it there's this this Caterpie university of washington named dr. Gerald Pollack and he has done this research that shows like in plants or vessels like blood vessels for example there is an exclusion zone of water I mean there's like a positive charge on the inside and a negative charge on the outside that might be backwards it might be positive on the outside negative on the inside but either either way it causes fluid to move through vessels in a way that allows it to move more easily like like the water is actually charged so apparently when you drink structured water it hydrates the cell a little bit better huh yeah sounds like guns apparently how water moves through plants that's one of those things that you hear and then like you talk to a scientist and they go no yeah and they get mad so I interviewed that guy Gerald Pollack and he has compared it basically he's compares like how it moves in in glass tubes and how if you structure it and you watch it like the water moves up through the glass tube way way better and then I interviewed this guy Thomas Cowan and he talks about how the heart is not really a pump or doesn't act as much like a pump as we're led to believe and so if you if you drink structured water apparently the blood moves better through the vessels I haven't seen a ton of research on it but I structure my water just in cuz it's cheap it's like a it's like this tiny little like plastic piece that you put on on your on your water what exactly is it doing so the water passes through a series of glass beads like it vortexes it so after it so it comes out of my well and I've got I tested my water and I've got like a bacteria based iron and high levels of manganese like I thought well water was just all like pristine clear like you know like if you drink out of a spring on top of a mountain but apparently there's there's crap in the well water so I filter it and then after it all filters it passes through the structured water filter I would imagine that you would get some stuff in the water cuz if somewhere along the line there's like a dead animal or beaver fever yeah yeah there's dead animals all over my just piled everywhere carcasses I mean no but well then the other thing is like what I get concerned about is you know you see like glyphosate and herbicides and pesticides they get sprayed all over the crops and I live in farmland territory right so I'm on this North facing slope and there's all like these forms above me so I figure if that's dropping down from the ground into that water I might be getting some of it so I filter yeah that totally makes sense I know a guy who got bone cancer because he lived off of a golf course and the golf course is constantly spraying stuff on the golf course and it got into the water supply and a bunch of it happened to more people ton of people the neighborhood got cancer Wow yeah you know what I tell people is um like people who don't have a well and you just live off the municipal water supplies you use a reverse osmosis water filter because it's a really really fine filtration but it takes everything out like it takes the bad stuff and the good stuff out so you want to add minerals back in after you filtered the water so you get a reverse and you could buy these on like Amazon so like a reverse osmosis filter with what's called remineralization or you can just use reverse osmosis and then use like trace liquid minerals or you know sea salt or anything else yeah electrolytes back no like a pinch of Himalayan salt I go through so much salt I use this stuff called the Mexican salt kolima salt I haven't I was actually a steakhouse last night people make fun of me because I pull out my big white bag of salt and I just sprinkle it on everything but I'm gonna I'm a fiend for salt I love salt it's very good for you and unfortunately there's been a terrible myth that's been perpetrated along oh that salt gives you high blood pressure kills you and yeah that's a that's a real tragedy because that's one of those ones that it was it was spread in like probably what was it the 60s or the 70s when they started telling people that salt causes high blood pressure no clue people still repeat it today and they don't understand it it's an essential mineral well there's a new book out about this I forget the name of the book about what it depends too because I used to do racing for Team Timex OU's do these Ironman triathlons and they'd bring people in to test us and they would do sweat sodium analyses where you actually get a patch put on your skin and it measures the amount of sodium released over X surface area of skin and then there's an algorithm that determines like how much total sweat you lose say per hour during exercise and and some people lose a copious amount of sodium in their sweat and some lose barely any at all so you have like a sodium conservation mechanism that differs from person to person so there might be some people who store salt really well who might actually get higher blood pressure if they if they consume a lot of salt so if you know and the massive excess of salt in your tongue yeah my numbers are off the charts though in terms of how much sodium oh I was losing which is probably why I feel so good you're sweating so much right I mean it's just going right through your body now tastes amazing yeah my blood pressure just because I love kosher songs too these two paid and they pay like Roman soldiers and Jordan and salt I went to war for salt yeah yeah he's scary good I take salt I mean it's really kind of amazing then it was just less than a two hundred years ago they figured out how to like make refrigerators you know I mean it was refrigerator from the 1930s I think it was when they first invent those things and then before that they had ice boxes you'd have to get a chunk of ice from somewhere right to store stuff before that they just use salt and I've heard I don't know if this is true but I heard that if you come from an area like if your ancestry is from an area where they did a lot of that fermenting pickling curing salting that you have more robust sodium loss mechanisms like which would make sense for me like I'm nerve in European heritage I did a lot of like pickling salty and curing so I would lose more salt than somebody who might come from let's say like sub-saharan African or Southeast Asian or somewhere they might not have been using so much salt yeah that totally makes sense yeah so with this Wi-Fi thing I want to go back to that because I've always wondered there's there's not a long history of use of human use of Wi-Fi and one of the things sounds a lot of studies on that 90 year old dudes running around they've been doing so for exactly yeah but the Wi-Fi like when it sounds hippie dippie but if you go somewhere like Prince of Wales Alaska and you're on a mountaintop it feels different Oh totally there's no radio there's no Wi-Fi there's no direct TVs getting to you there's nothing and that it feels different up there yeah you're also I mean like your grounding and everything right you're you're breathing a lot more negative ions because you're outside in the fresh air and all the emails jumping out from your inbox there's a lot of confounding variables but I mean all I know and I test your you were tested heart rate variability no like it's the you know what that is HRV a lot of athletes use it I've heard it but I don't know is that enter beat individuality like the variation in the amount of time in between each beat of your heart so it's not like how fast your heart is beating it's how much time is in between each heart beat so you can measure that and you're supposed to have like slight beat to beat variation in how much time is between each heart beat and if you have that that's high heart rate variability so you can use that to track your readiness to train your recovery right so I use you know I use like a ring like this or I'll do like a heart rate in the morning so aura or a ring actually my cracker jack box so it's a power it's a power ring it's a mood ring I have seen one of those someone someone sent me some plate they don't just use rings right just like other methods of measuring it as well like you can use a Bluetooth enabled heart rate monitors okay that's what that's what I used to do is you wake up in the morning put on the strap you test your heart rate variability and it tells you you know if it's low you might say okay well today is gonna be like a yoga day or an easy swim or a walk in the sunshine and if it's high then that would be a day where you'll do like kettlebell training or a WOD or whatever is it you're gonna really and then the other thing you could use it for is if you still sometimes purposefully get it low like I have some athletes that I train where we'll work them into a state where they've got really low heart rate variability and then what happens is you taper right like you recover you rest you super compensate so you see a bounce back of nervous system recovery and you can use that to purposefully adjust the training huh yeah and if you train through a low HRV for too long you can predict illness you can predict injury so it's a cool way to track training and you can even you can look at on there's a high frequency and a low frequency when you're saying you could predict illness and injury meaning like my HRV is low but screw up I'm gonna go train anyways you do that day after day you get injured and the weird thing is that you can have no musculoskeletal soreness right because a lot of time that's subside you know plate onset muscle soreness you see that disappear after like 48 hours and if you've crushed yourself like I we can talk about this later if you want but I've been doing single set to failure right single set to failure exercises where it's just like a 15 minute long workout but it's just full-on isometrics as hard as you can go for 60 seconds to tetrax isometric so you're pushing against it's it's like this force plate machine mm-hmm that you push against and you just generate as much force as you can and it ties to your iPhone and it alerts you when you've dropped off 60 percent of what you're originally producing at the beginning of the set and then that's it that's done game over so you might do in deadlift squat press overhead press pull down and that's the whole workout and then you're just recovering in between each of those sets so this plate I mean how are you doing a deadlift with a plate it's a force plate so for example you're standing like a bar okay that you're holding on to and the bar is attached to the force plate via two stands on either like two pillars on either side of the bar and you pull the bar and then the force plate detects how much force you're pulling and what positions what's a lift you're standing on top of the force plate you're supposed to choose the hardest position of each exercise so I can have some fun if I'm bench pressing it's like my elbows are slightly bent as the line just near the top or squatting it's like the knees are bent at about 30 40 degrees so you get into that position then you generate as much force as possible for 60 seconds or not when I first did I was at 30 seconds now I can go a little bit over a minute where I can continue to generate as much force as possible before it drops off to just 60 percent of what I was originally produced it's a it's a cool efficient way to train but you don't get that sore afterwards all right so musculoskeletal soreness is not a good indicator of recovery in many cases and that's where this HRV thing comes in is your nervous system right your central nervous system your neuromuscular system can be really beat up after a workout even if the soreness has subsided so that's where you use something like HRV and you can say okay well I'm not sore but my HRV is too low so this is gonna be an easy day for me I'm sorry but explain that if you're if your body is not sore but your HRV is low it's what is it showing what's an indication of so if your body is not sore but your HRV is low HRV is measuring your nervous system recovery right so so you might not be fully recovered so what I'm saying is like musculoskeletal soreness or discomfort is not necessarily the best indicator of whether you're fully recovered you have to test the nervous system to measurement comes in in coming full circle I've noticed when I do those morning measurements and I'm traveling or I've got the Wi-Fi enabled at my house my HRV is lower so it's affecting my nervous system somehow is why do you think the Wi-Fi is a mindfuck do you think it's really doing something - I think it's doing something but then there's in this room there's a fancy bow effect I feel it I feel really say that's that's why you're a moron right now you've got the Apple watch test you're HRV so it's been doing by the whole time I've had it on but it's paradoxical because the Apple watch is making Wi-Fi that's why I was talking about this this ring I bought this in Finland like three years ago because I wanted like a body tracking device I want to track my HRV and I want to track my sleep cycles but I don't like sleeping all night cuz like I sleep with my kind of my hand tucked down by my deck you know like him by my cry I don't want something just like sleep like this I kind of I sleep on my side my hands touched like underneath me and there and literally like my right hand is right down around my balls basically while I'm sleeping and I didn't want something just like blasting me that makes I'm sleeping so yeah so cuz if it was on my wrist or on my finger or wherever so this has like a built-in computer and you could put it in airplane mode and it'll still collect all the HRV data and everything else then when you want to take it out of airplane mode and sync it to your phone and upload all your sleep data or your HRV dad or anything else you can do it oh so so that's that's why I wear this ring so like a Fitbit or a jawbone or or or Jaime's stupid Apple watch I never know whether or not I'm being ridiculous with this stuff like with worrying about phones being on me I yeah but cancer you know cuz it's someone some dude told me that once that he got cancer I think was testicle cancer side and the the guy was saying do you keep your phone in your right pocket he's like yes I do and the doctor was telling him that I'll say how the fuck does the doctor know like this is not proven stuff this is all real speculation right I mean it's tricky because I mean you could say about the bone cancer on the golf course right but but a lot of people dad I think there's a class-action lawsuit there because I think they tested the water and it was whatever the fuck the stuff that they used for fertilizer or pesticides so I was telling me I was concerned about the the dick cancer thing because those stem cells like right will you shot can you stem cells into your dick well for the past three million so men's health magazine just had me write this article called new year new dick I'm serious you get them it's got a issue with Marky Mark Wahlberg on the huns on the cover appropriate yeah yeah like how to make a small dick bigger right Nicola Marky Mark on that on the cover and now he can he can beat me with his with his four foot tall fisticuffs anyways though so they had me go around doing everything that a guy could do to enhance sexual performance or increase the size your dick or increased blood flow or increase orgasm quality or you know they just wanted to find out where everything from like freaking gas station dick pills to which by the way those things do not have in them what they say they have in them what do you think so so they you know they say like epimysium and your okema long jack it's basically for concealed NFL right after in cialis or viagra and then ephedra and copious amounts of caffeine so I'm gonna take these things I just literally feel like my head was gonna explode I mean it's it's like drinking ten cups of coffee yeah we have a friend of ours who predicted accurately that John Jones was taking those things when he pissed hot seems like those things have everything in them and he's like John Jones does coke he goes I guarantee he's taking dick pills they're actually pretty entertaining to read like because it's all like the you know like it's like Corina Chinese fortune cookie that's like maximum potency veigue aura and everything spelled wrong but the so they had me doing that they just the ingredients did you actually get it tested no no we we went to all these labs it wouldn't let us actually test but apparently the FDA has tested them and if you go to the fda.gov website they have like these these warnings out about the actual erase we took the five that they had warnings about and tested them and they yeah you don't feel well you feel like your heads gonna explode you can just get all cold and clammy and some of them say that I don't know why but they say to take them in the morning all right which doesn't to me make sense but you take them in the morning so you just feel completely screwed a hot like all morning it's like you're just mainlining coffee so they did that they did on that have you heard of this like acoustic sound wave therapy for your dick clinic in Florida that's called Gaines wave and you go down there and and I walk in and the first thing they do is they hand me this like syringe full of numbing cream I'm supposed to just like put it everywhere and so I I smeared it you know my balls might like I just went everywhere cuz I don't really know what they were what they were gonna do and I wanted I wanted all all shields activated going into this thing so I walk into the room and and my dicks all numb had me lay down and so my legs are splayed I'm on this exam room table and this gal comes in and she's got like this giant wand attached to a machine and they do this for women too by the way they put like a condom on the end of it and and she just basically goes to town for like 20 minutes like a jackhammer like supposedly supposedly it breaks open old blood vessels and builds new blood vessels and once the numbing cream wears off you're supposed to perform a lot better and then they combined this you know we're talking about like with your shoulder if you inject it you should do like electro stem or vibration or something - to get the injection deeper into the tissue - same thing like this they do the PRP so they do PRP into your deck and then they follow it up and you get you get a nerve block first my axe I thought I don't know why I thought they put the needle just like right in the pee hole which to me made sense but but it doesn't really I mean you want to in the actual tit so they actually go like up where the dick attaches like the tissue at the top we do two nerve blocks on either side and then the PRP and later on like a couple months later they have new stem cells actually extracted a couple months later from my back and we did a stem cell injection but this acoustic sound wave therapy with the PRP like it wears off and you literally just like get boners all the time like all night long for like a month so the acoustic sound therapy supposed to be breaking up blood vessel breaks open old vessels means wave procedure breaks up plaque formation in blood vessels and stimulates the growth of new blood vessels in the penis low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave therapy mmm that's gonna sell a lot of procedures before and after yeah before it looks like a like an old hunched over man then all of a sudden bigger yeah I used to do bodybuilding so is that horrible sport do you think it's real do you think that's really doing something I work for me okay work for me in the so yeah the gas station dick pills they did the acoustic sound wave therapy sessions they had me do like the no stem cells with stem cells stem cells but that mean that not everybody's gonna be able to do that but that was the best bar none like they so I went down to Florida and course again Florida I don't know what I think is because all the old people live in Florida all the people like hunched over the steering motor but all the guys have great dicks I can't drive they have their plate garage for like two miles before they turn but their dicks are primed so the stem cell thing was at the u.s. stem cell clinic in Florida and I went in there and they extract all the fat for me they took the fat on my back and what they do is they they have um it's called an enzymatic process where they use something that breaks down the collagen in the fat and then they have the stem cells that get separated from the fat and apparently it's very very high in these angiogenic like like vascular vessel building compounds and so then you get that re-injected it's high in the MS and camel the MSC the MSC cells which which are supposedly the very good ones to inject in so i injected those or i had a doctor in spokane so they shipped into spokane on ice and they show up at my house like 7:00 a.m. right cuz you got to get them delivered same day and then i had my appointment at the doctor at 9:00 a.m. and i went to the doctor and you know very it was like deja vu from Florida where like I go in do that do the numbing yeah I think there's a picture of him in the medics they put all sorts of crazy pictures in the magazine because I had me doing like infrared light on my balls and this big thing called the Juve light that they had me standing in front of every day like like I'll tell you about the stem cells crazy so the the stem cells I went to this doctor in Spokane and he injected these these stem cells from my fat after they'd grown for like several in this case I think they were down there for like eight weeks but yeah I mean they can do same-day injections but for me I didn't have enough fat because for me it was right in the middle of I raced professionally inaudible course racing so I'm just like lean as hell as I go in there so they could they could barely get enough fat so they did grow them for a longer period of time a lot of times they can inject same day so I went into Spokane at this clinic in Spokane the new integrative clinic it's like this osteopathic medical clinic with all these you know nice receptionist when you walk in the door and this this this doctor who he's done stem cell injections before but he never actually injected them into someone's dick so I was kinda like the guinea pig for do you have to explain to him what areas you're supposed to know he researched it and I think he actually talked to the folks at the stem cell clinic beforehand to make sure that they were on that on the same page okay my fly all the way back down to Florida right that's super inconvenient and it's just a dick they'll make more some day they're growing kidneys and ears grow dicks someday so um so I got it injected and that was um first of all it looked like he got like run over by a semi-truck for like two days it was like all black and blue or the injection infected it could have gotten infected cancer I've had MRSA and I would not wish MRSA on your dick Mercer a triathlon oh I got it this was that though at the Wildflower triathlon like coming back my flight got delayed and I was covered in all these because like an off-road triathlon and I had all these scrapes and wounds and I think I think my layover was in Vegas I don't remember where but I had to check in to hotel flight got delayed and I slept in this hotel room that I swear like there must have been something on the bed because within a few days like it was all you know it gets all nasty and cakey and then it was eating a hole I wrote a whole blog post about this on my website and they say you can see yeah pull up the hole in the back of my leg is nasty Marcus gives a shit just just search for like Ben Greenfield staff and you'll see the pictures but it was eating a hole in the back of my leg and my kids roll now once a week and I buy on I get the the defense soap from on it as soon as they don't as soon as they come back in the door I have them go into the shower upstairs defense so yeah a bunch of different wipes and stuff for people that train in a place that doesn't have a shower mm-hmm yeah you gotta be careful that in a thieves essential oil it's like kind of like it's a whole bunch of companies make this version of essential oil mom Pheebs it's like clove and roids named after Steve's who apparently never yeah clove cinnamon eucalyptus we just really give their staff and Roseman it's actually named that there's like this story of like these four thieves that apparently traveled around the world and they would Rob homes and and and they never got sick like that's basically the story I'm sure this would this was some board table at a multi-level marketing essential oils company somebody came up with this story or it could be true I don't know but the UM yeah the the stem cells under the dick that was an interesting but it did I think from what I can tell looking in the mirror it got bigger I'm pretty sure how much so half-inch I like maybe that much like enough to tell and my erections got bigger and my orgasms got a lot better for how long they they're still like that still yeah so I think the stem cell is kind of like stick with you well well last week I got them I told you I'm training for the are Casey kettlebell sir and I was doing the the hundred reps in five minutes snatch test with it with a one and a half pooed and I felt something just go I was at eighty four reps and I felt something go in my back and I got stem cells injected all up and down my QL my multifidus my rector spinae into my so ass but then they also sent them to mate to my house and I did that same fat cell the stuff that's rich in the Meza and Kamal stem cells in his bloodstream so I did a push IV into the bloodstream that's the one that you would have to go out of the country to do you're not supposed to do that like that's tech it's definitely not legal for someone to inject you with your own stem cells into your bloodstream but if you get your stem cells extracted and they're stored and they send them to you you can technically inject them if you do it yourself or you like to have a friend who's a nurse or whatever and you it's literally just like a push IV it's like thirty seconds we caught it on video for men's health films so they'll publish a video at some point but I was super nervous because it's like a few thousand dollars worth of stem cells that you know I'm trying to hit the vein and make sure that they go in the right way yeah inject it's a very very small amount what you had to be the most nervous getting him shot in your dick though no I was kind of nervous yeah yeah that's not me like super experimental it I do a lot of that yeah I know you like that that's kind of my stick yeah like I do a lot of immersive journalism a lot of self experimentation a lot of a lot of guinea pig type stuff yeah I'm not dead yet and I sold my deck so you look great happy yeah thank you look very healthy 22 that's is that yeah that's that's one of them that is yeah that's an image for my website that's not as deep as it got I don't think that's the worst photo the worst one I've ever seen stuff it with iodine like they have you know they have like these long iodine strips when you get the MRSA and it's like it's flesh-eating bacteria yeah there's that's me too and they stuff see that hole in the middle yeah they stuff like a iodine it's like a stick in there like a strip that has but they literally stuff it in there and you can feel it you got you were telling me you got dry needling done you know like that weird pressure it's not like pain but it's like a weird pressure from dry needling this is like that except pain right like it's both the pain and the pressure was horrible horrible like yeah I've had some from my staff in their leg where they've like a small golf ball-sized hole in their leg and they literally had a packet full of that kind of gauze covered know like how you said small golf golf balls a big hole for the back of the leg smaller than a golf ball that go large marble any hole in the back of the leg in my opinion is too big the worst I've ever seen is Kevin Randleman see if he could find Kevin Randleman staff he had open holes we could see his muscle structure under his armpit it was horrific gosh he never really recovered he was dying he died he died young from that who knows what he died from but look at the hole I think I still have it oh my gosh yeah that's that's his muscle what body part is that that's his underarm oh my god yeah look at that oh my goodness yeah that's how bad it was that looks like he got shot he does yeah he was rotting away and I don't know if he didn't treat it quick enough or I don't know if it was just really aggressive but it's a real common thing in gyms and once you get it it stays with you like it stays in your bloodstream like I still like I have an essential oil diffuser on my desk and I put thieves in it every day and I just diffuse essential oils in the air while I'm working into the air yeah it's like a nebulizing essential oil diffuser and I just just to play it safe right I just want to be breathing that in today just in case fuck that's some and that's the other thing as I stand in front of this light this infrared light and this is that dick light yeah it's called a jhooth and um so it they've done these studies on testicular and sperm production and they've found that there's a wavelength it's like 600 to 800 nanometers wavelength of light that if you exposed the testicles to that for five to twenty minutes a day it's based on this concept of photobiomodulation so I originally got into this whole photobiomodulation thing when this company because I because I blog and people just send me these weird things to my doorstep to try and they sent me this like nasal probe you put up your nose and it's got like a helmet on it you could you could look it up Jamie if you want it's called a violet and it produces this light that supposedly activates a part of your my tokus oh you have like your electron transport chain in your mitochondria and there's a part of that call to cytochrome C oxidase and it apparently activates more activity in the cytochrome C oxidase you produce more ATP in this case in neural tissue because you have it on your head and they were using this in dementia and in Alzheimer's patients but it turns out it's almost like a like a neutral pick for you yes that's me at my desk was a young Chinese woman I like how that guy's just like looking pensively off its cause really well she's reading a book she's reading twice see that's what I originally did they sent me just the nose one and I felt shorted because I they had like the full head so I asked them for the full head one whole thing and and what's um it was I think it was MPR it was either radio lab or the other science one I think I think it might be radio lab they did a study on my or a story unlike this ten to forty Hertz frequency that's tDCS I have one of those too the trans direct cranial stimulation their halo device that you wear before workout so this photobiomodulation I'm putting this thing you know the probe in my ear thing and you're not even supposed to use it too much because it produces so much ATP that if you amp up cellular activity and neural tissue too much you produce too many reactive species like that's a byproduct of cellular metabolism it's just like if you eat too much you produce a lot of byproduct of making energy and that's why it's one of the reasons why fasting is good for you it cleans up the system and you don't make as many free radicals the same reason like ketosis is good for you right you're not burning as much glucose you don't produce as many free radicals same concept with this you don't want use it all the time because you get too much activity you produce too many free radicals or too many reactive oxygen species but every other day use it so do your new new deck how often did use it well this is from my head and this was like a couple years it's the same couple years and it was like a cup of coffee for my brain like every time I wake up I put this thing I'm working on my desk so then this company that makes these lights that are very similar activates cytochrome C oxidase activates release of nitric oxide but if you do it on your testicle specifically the cell that it works on is the Ladak cells in the testes which are responsible for producing testosterone so you're basically stimulating the Ladak cells and the testes the same way that you'd stimulate like neural tissue using this one for your head so I'd had success with the thing for my head so I tried this one for the balls and the dick and what I did was I would just Jack my pants down for 5 to 20 minutes a day one said oh yeah I'm diffusing my essential oils that I got to sit on my head and and it works like you actually get more blood flow I mean I didn't do a control study just pulling my pants down and standing there for without the light on I should I should do that at some point because maybe it's just like the whole you know it's like supposedly going combat-style supposed to be good for your dick to just combat style so there's you yeah that's me I'm standing my wobble board I got my ball light and that's actually not my office I was at one of my friends houses cuz he had one and anyways and I'm obviously I'm not naked but normally I would I would be nude and yeah he's just balls and just basically nuke your balls yeah and it's like it's like a warm teddy bear increased vascularity better size better orgasms I mean like like all this stuff seemed to have a so all the stuff seems to me they had some kind of an effect yes so PRP injections acoustic sound wave therapy stem cells the infrared light gas station dick pills and that's the one I would not repeat and then they had me do some Ayurvedic stuff like the no ejaculation thing like we're Tantra have sex but you pull out like the book it's called the multi-orgasmic man so I read that and and learn how to like you know pull back like like not actually orgasm right and you like pull it inside then you finish up and you're just like pissed off the rest of the day there's any telling can't sleep at night cuz you're all you saw what so you could see how it would work but for me it's like I got kids and my wife and I sneaked away to get it on like I want to I want the full meal deal so I didn't like that the the no ejaculation reverse orgasm thing but what's it supposed to do like when you internalize the orgasm when you keep it inside so this is all based on Chinese medicine principles like your I think it's called your Jin or your Jing or something like that you have this this energy you know your your Qi or your prana your chakra your lifeforce and apparently orgasming is and coming like ejaculating is supposedly one of the ways that you give some of that lifeforce away like you release some of your vitality and by having sex but then not coming you're actually creating that same hormonal response of oxytocin and testosterone and all these things that we release when we're having sex when we ejaculate but without actually giving up that that vitality my force that was even like I thought I found like tables or like based on your age there's a certain frequency with which you're supposed to ejaculate like like so younger you are it's like every two days every three days and the older you get like it gets to a certain point where like 70 years old it's like every every month or something like that and so it's it's it's kind of interested but again I don't I don't like that like I want I want to finish yeah wonderful preconceived prejudice that you have though like a wonder if you just went into it like completely objectively would have some sort of a benefit or maybe you just get like mineral depleted and you lose all your zinc and everything else you need to make sperm and you start to cramp I don't know to me you'd have to be ejaculating a lot I think so when you were doing all these different things how much of a time like how much of a buffer did you give yourself in between each things it was not a well controlled experiment at all hey the articles coming out soon we should toss this in there too so they probably found it was not a well controlled experiment and I did a lot over three months like it would have been a lot better just try one thing at a time but I but I would be so nervous but I am well hung and very vascular now I'm gradual experiment so so there's that well so yeah it's called new year so new year new deck and it really did make your dick bigger mm-hmm so do you think there's any hope out there asking for a friend guys who have micro dicks Micro what's a micro dick there's really small penises I would imagine there's super they could be like great politicians or fluence there's got to be some kind of trade-off right it's like if you if you have sickle cell anemia apparently it keep protect you from malaria so I mean if you have a small dick it protects you from some kind of horrible accident later on in life so I just wonder like if there's a way to fix that in people maybe this is the way the voice that's gotta be one of the saddest things yeah Dom again like you never know there could be a bunch of 90 year old man walking around with dick cancer 60 years from now who you know heard this and all Wayne got injected so I will not attest to the safety of it so I can't test the efficacy of it so that's crazy some of those things would work for them for all those people walking around there all of you listeners are small dicks hmm fellas there's hope so so yeah that song is that you know you know like you're saying it still works like it's - how long ago did you do this experiment oh I mean like this the magazine is still in the shelves like okay sits but it was like this was like starting I got the stem cells extracted in August okay of 2017 so this is it's like January I'm sure weeks later I got those shot into the deck so a couple six months later after they really grown a lot of these immense iqbal mesenchymal stem cells I got them injected into my bloodstream and into like that injury that I'm fighting in my back right now mm-hmm and I'd done some other things before for for the back and for tissue like peptides like BP c 157 that we were just talking about before yeah yeah which is really interesting stuff I mean it's not intended for human consumption but it's also not banned by wada I mean it's it's actually it's legal to use and it's a peptide it's called body protection compound BPC 157 and the 157 refers to like the sequence of amino acids that makes up the actual compound but you can buy it and reconstitute it and then if you inject it into an area and it doesn't have to be like a painful intramuscular injection it can be like a subcutaneous injection bpc supposedly stimulates angiogenesis and it's a it's a natural company find it in the human gut so they took this same thing that helps to heal the human gut which is why if you were to consume this in drinking water it and supposedly and this is in rodent models it apparently works to like heal up and inflamed gut you know colitis IBD IBS stuff like that but you can inject it into a joint or subcutaneously into an area around a joint and it supposedly stimulates the I feel like this is a repetitive phrase on this show the growth of new blood vessels hmm so angio angiogenesis and then there's another one called TB 500 that they use in racehorses the thymus and beta that one is banned by wada but saying similar principle except that one acts on the actin and myosin fibers and actually causes regeneration of those so you could do both and you get angiogenesis and then also fiber regrowth now that's that's a strategy that would be like pennies on the dollar compared to stem cells and also you know a far less on a far less intensive procedure in terms like collecting your stem cells right yeah and then there's um so there's a fad for the stem cells I'm from what I understand if you're going after the anti-aging effect like the bone is better like the marrow like a bone marrow so I had mine I had my bone marrow extracted at this place called forever labs in Berkeley California and they store that and then what I can do is I can just inject the 35 year old me into my body every year or every five years or whenever I want to put that back in so I've got bone marrow fat marrow stored so they take the bone marrow and how do they have enough to just keep going I don't know the the protocol that used to grow this net like I know the fat one they use like a collagenase procedure that enzymatically breaks down a collagen from the fat and somehow concentrates the stem cells and you can actually grow them like you can actually multiply them I'm assuming it's something similar for bone and the bone would be more for like longevity and anti-aging and then the fat would be more for four joints I know a lot of people got the bone marrow done for injuries yeah not compared to the dick injections course racing and I was I was triathlete before that I did body built so I've always done all this you know masochistic shit so getting I think my pain tolerance is is high don't sure the bone marrow didn't hurt that much no they numb it they go in um the dick one was where there was like that weird pressure a little bit pain I would say that the iodine packing into the staph infection they were talking about that was I was up there with Daniel Cormier UFC light heavyweight champion had it done with the bone marrow and he was telling me was painful as hell he's about his time getting distracted so I mean it's it's a big needle for a while when I did the stem cell injections that was cool because they used a digital thermometer sound it's like what you would used to look at a baby yeah but you can you can see the tissue you can see the areas where they're swelling or there's like a black area where where the tissue is torn up or whether there's edema or inflammation and you can and and he showed me the video after he did all the injections you can see them needle like going into the you can you can micro target exactly exactly where you want to put the cells yeah I've done it's very very cool thermography yeah yeah it's a cool procedure have you ever done rogem akeem no you aware of it it's it's one of the things a lot of pro athletes we're going to Germany need to get done it's a it's a form of platelet-rich plasma where they heat it up and by heating up the the plasma it produces this radical anti-inflammatory property it's like they extract into this yellow serum they spin in a centrifuge so if you're gonna get it done I've had it done on how is that different than just normal PRP more powerful more pearly because it's heated up yeah because I'm PRP before yeah I have as well yeah it's I mean obviously not doctor but according to these doctors that do it and there's a place in Santa Monica that does it called lifespan medicine I've had it done really yeah that for the longest time you had to go to Germany like Dana White flew to Germany to get it done I'm going over to to Venice Beach I'm going to be done by there I'm going to these cats at the place I was talking bout the human garage that's really want to talk to the guy who does it my friend dr. Ben Drew he is the guy who it performs the procedures down there it's great he would love to talk to you too yeah sure cool you day I'll run out of stuff to inject into joints but for me it really helped me heal a bulging disc in my neck really they go right into the spinal cord it's great for people that have pretty serious neck injuries and back injuries have you tried this thing I think it's it's Petach on is the company that makes it but it's like a neck traction device yeah one hanging in my so I have that in a yoga trapeze I do this when I get up right get up and I put like a bunch of magnesium on my neck and my back to relax all the tissue and once you get really relaxed and have this uh this this vibrator it's a it's like a car buffer for your body so you can vibrate your neck and your back and then you get really really relaxed and it's it's perfect for you know for like doing your own deep tissue there but it but it vibrates so I'll do that on my body then you'll hang from this neck thing yeah then you get all these pops up and down your neck and it apparently realizes the Atlas and the axis and some of the cervical vertebra and there's probably a chiropractic Doc's who are who are really pissed off right now because I'm describing this incorrectly but it it feels amazing like it just adjusts everything and then I hang from the yoga trapeze well it definitely seems like modern press yeah definitely decompress is your I don't know about all that other nonsense but it definitely it's stretching out those muscles and alleviating some of the stress that comes from bad posture and for me it was a lot of grappling well getting your neck cranked and squished and yeah resisting thing it's like gum it's kind of similar to traction and I really been getting into that have you heard of al-dawa eld Oh a no it's like a form of stretching where I actually had a guy come to my house for two days and he stayed in my basement and we wait we wake up I've done this a few times I'll have people come over to me and just like teach there's there's another guy who mashes it like use a walker and just like mash up and down your body and but this is El Doha so aldo uh you'll like push a joint out this way and then out this way and then your feet will be splayed in both directions there's like 20 different poses that you do but it's a form of self traction hmm right so it's like um it's similar like if you were to use a monster band to traction a joint you ever done that like traction your hip with a real tie a monster band around your hip and then attach it to yeah that's old oh uh was that is that Adam from mine pump that is that the mine pump video I think that's my buddy Adam it says LOD yeah yeah that's one of the ones I do in the morning that's l5 s1 so they so they all work on a specific like part of the back the party say let me say it again eld Oh a five or five I forget what it stands for is invented by this guy named gya a French guy and dude you feel amazing you hold these poses for like a minute and it introduces a bunch of new blood flow to the joint they see how he's doing that he'll like put his hand up and traction the fashio and so he's getting this intense pole if you were to do this you get this intense pole on your back I do this one looks like it I could show it to you after but you feel amazing I do this when I wake up now and stretching this goes back this is like some some French guy invented it and I don't remember how I heard about it by invitar I interview this guy named Jacob Sean on my podcast and he taught me all these moves and came to my house and it's it's another one of those really cool forms of stretching it's like how often do you do yoga I have a sauna I mean you do like an infrared sauna no we have a regular sauna I use a like a like a near far infrared sauna and I go in there because your your tissue is very pliable and hot so I had a had a crane drop a 19-foot endless pool out in the forest back behind my house in Spokane and I keep this thing just like SuperDuper cold right so it's like 4550 degrees so that's like my mic cryotherapy water gin well during the during the winter and the fire stays that cold I just keep the lid off and then during the summer when I'm coming back home and I'm going by the gas station up the up the hill before my house I stopping about ice bag I just dump them in there so it stays relatively cold and what I do in the morning is when I'm home as I do this sauna and you guys about yoga I go in there and I'll this is when I do a lot of this stuff right I'll do some of my yoga moves some of my elbow uh there's another really good form of stretching called core foundation doc named Erica Goodman and it's like a form of decompression for the spine and he works with a lot of athletes it kind of like turns on your glutes decompresses your spine so I just use a mash-up of all these little moves and I'll be in my sauna for like 30 minutes so I'm producing all the heat shock proteins I'm getting the nitric oxide getting the blood flow and you just feel you feel good my sauna so I get all sweaty and I get kind of we will sprinkle essential oils in there and I'll burn like Palo Santo incense and you know put on during the song beats yeah it smells really nice and you put on gates yeah like binaural beats so there's this this guy named Michael Tyrell and he makes these these CDs and these tracks that you said his name you lowered your voice and there they they vibrate at specific Hertz frequencies right there's what there's this whole idea that like your root chakra like your fourth chalk your heart chakra vibrates at 528 Hertz and there's there's different Hertz frequencies associated with different positive aspects of your you know it's it's this like a chalk or a like right but is that bullshit I mean if you try to debunk me I feel really good if I feel good I'm gonna try to know that sauna has like surround speakers and so I just I play that through the speakers no Bluetooth and no Wi-Fi Jamie just like it's just like my little shitty little hi pod shuffle that I plug in and play and so I play that well I'm in the sauna and I'm doing all my moves and then I walk out of my house go through my office walk through the forest and I go and jump in the pool swim in there for like fights like 50 yards and know it's a it's too much go back and try to just I got to keep things somewhat because this is getting kind of complex between like the light on the balls and the essential oils like yeah yeah sometimes all the friends over and and will vapor will smoke in the sauna and then we'll go out to the pool and then go roll around in the snow then get back in the pool then go back in the sauna and might I do this and my wife is inside making dinner and we just feel amazing I we got the hot we got the cold right then we go in and we eat dinner it's it's amazing it's my favorite thing to do with my friends Wow but in the morning I do the sauna and then the ice and then or the cold pool and then I finished with a quick dip in the hot tub out in the trees because I put a hot tub next to the cold pool and everything's like super clean you know it's clean with ozone and minerals instead of chlorine and so you just feel really really clean and I walk in to start my day so I do yoga yeah it's in it it's in the song well it sounds like you're just stretching you're not doing like the strengthening not I do actual like like you know what do you mean like stiff like warrior one where two or three like like standing bow pose head Nev pose like strenuous I'm not doing like old person yoga questioning like I do a headstand I'm just wondering what you're doing actually in the sauna hmm yeah I make it up as I go I don't know like um I was basically how you feel while I was speaking in code that's why I'm down here speaking Costa Mesa a couple days ago and there was like this this banquet dinner as part of the event hosted next this guy Michael what do you do for your fitness routine etc he does Bikram yoga every day but like the Bikram yoga like all of the poses that are part of Bikram because it's a set series of routines you've done Bikram before yeah that's like 90 minutes he does that every single day nine days in a row yeah like years everyday I'm impressed we did it we did sober October we had to do 15 in a month I mean a bunch of my friends yeah I wanted to burn it out so the last nine days well I had a few days to go but for nine days I just said let me just get these out of the way and yeah every day I did 90 minutes and it was like wow but interesting because you realize the body can do that I don't like to overdo it though because it's static stretching and we know that can decrease in force potential like it can decrease power production to come to pliable is flexible isn't that the case though pre-workout workout but chronically if you elongate tissue and I don't know if they've actually done any Studies on people who have done yoga for a really long time and compared like their their vertical jump right before and under but I just feel almost too stretchy if I get too into it like I feel like when I run it's a little bit more like Gumby running hmm versus not limiting that's not weird that's interesting that's definitely definitely static stretching prior to force production yeah is not a good idea right like prior to things like squats or some right it was like when when the lights went out during the Super Bowl a few years ago you remember that and you could see on TV both teams were just like standing on the sidelines or sitting on the sidelines doing these long hamstring static stretches and and I wondered why they were doing that because they were about to get back in run and engage in a very powerful explosive sport so yeah it's it's a dynamic stretching definitely prior to force production activities yeah yeah I'm wondering why they're do maybe they just have really old school trainers or something like that are not aware yeah or maybe they just do it on their own before I do that isometric training for for power production I've got two things I bought this stuff called nose torque on Amazon like smelling salts on steroids No so yeah powerlifter told me about it and he would sniff it before he'll go like you know Ripa 700 pound bar off the ground and you snort that you open up the cap on this stuff and it's just like releasing a wild animal into the room and we release the kappa it's like smelling salt on steroids and you smell and you just want to go kill somebody or yeah it's called nose nose torque or nose Turk it's something like that like no nose torque yeah okay T oh okay yeah oh yeah and so I do that and then the other one that I just made this you can buy this for like pennies on the dollar on Amazon yeah you can get these essential oil inhalers so some guy just smelled it here we go yeah oh he can't even get it near his face like it packs of blood what did he just do it or is he getting ready to do it it's open to that it's like smelling so it's ammonia so it I don't know chemically like I would imagine just put your sympathetic nervous system into overdrive when when you sniff all that ammonia so he's been really ginger he's policy some of my friends at restaurants I carried around sometimes Jesus I have some out my bow case actually I was in the car it's an you know okay it would be boring podcasting plus if people really want to try it they can just buy it on Amazon so they should be on the field doing that before they I don't know if I would recommend that you guys like nosebleeds and heart attack the other one is peppermint have you ever use like peppermint oil and they've done Studies on this on peppermint oil and athletic performance and what I have is this little it looks like a little tampon you can buy these on Amazon they're called aromatherapy inhalers hmm and it's like this little cotton wick and you put it you put essential oil on the cotton wick right so it absorbs into the wick and then you put the cap on and you can carry this around in the gym in your pocket or I play tennis on Wednesday night so I bring it to my tennis matches and while I'm playing tennis I'll stop sometimes and sniff this thing I say like awake and alert and do like it is just peppermint it's just peppermint but it has this amazing effect it's like this wakefulness promoting effect Wow peppermints amazing I put like if you get bloating or gas you can smear that around your stomach and it makes it go away it goes from my favorite oils to use yeah through the skin wait you know this the skin is skin as a mouse internal organs I don't know if it actually goes into the actual stomach like in like like through that through that epithelial lining and into the into the actual intestine but like it it has an effect for sure you know what I just started using recently is topical CBD I got some topical CBD and like a roll-on almost a deodorant roll-on it's amazing CBD there's a there's one I use this stuff called bio CBD and it's tumeric or curcumin with CBD and and yeah it's same thing it's like a topical they also do th see like THC roll-ons yeah they do that another thing speaking of the sexual performance thing you can actually buy like THC sex lube well and I mean it's like a high for your crotch literally you apply it locally and it's like your crotch gets a high I think you can do the same thing with these little coconut oil THC suppository not suppository they're meant for swallowing in the mouth that's that's a normal route of delivery but you can shove them up your butt like 30 or 40 minutes before you have sex and you actually get like this amazing high for your crotch is just like these THC coconut oil actual salts not bath salts like the drug but yeah stuff that you put in the bath down this THC early yeah they're doing everything out here now it's crazy they've gotten hog-wild I mean like California the guy that I get my stuff from in California just sort of giving me this stuff to put in the bath yeah he's like you got to be careful though cuz yeah way too high in your bath I believe it your skin absorption yeah you're literally like just like bathing in it like people bathing in wine and these things expose ya what they bathe in why they've wine baths yeah there's this place I go to in New York City it's called are a spa a re and they have like one of the options to go there's you can take like a bath and want that sounds so like Caligula like the wine and a few virgins it's um it's kinda cheesy though she looks like a news anchor yeah yeah this is like for ya oh my gosh rips and there we go I called it the grapes you could say yeah that it's actually a cool spa I've never done the one that sounds it's not a leaf I don't know if you'd get drunk from the wine oh I don't know if it would actually wind up in your intersect but they use antioxidant-rich Tempranillo grapes well how did you not get some sort of absorption I'm sure you would get something the sensory deprivation tank is that through the Epsom salts your body absorbs a lot of magnesium right I like the magnesium chloride like using actual magnesium and said and I like that because you can get it for I mean that's what they used to melt ice like you can just buy this don't like rocks aw yeah I know you guys don't melt a lot of ice in California but like in Washington State you buy magnesium chloride about like a frickin like concrete sighs bang a concrete mixer sighs bag of it and it's the same stuff that they sell in these expensive websites does like magnesium salts it's just magnesium chloride really and you can dump that in your way more magnesium then you get from epsom salts well that's really what you want is the magnesium like that that's displacing the calcium that's producing the relaxing effect that's you know it's maybe I should add that's my tank magnesium yeah to make sure it's not gonna mess up the is there like a filtration mechanism on the time yeah there's some pretty heavy filtration system but it filters out the absence I have an idea for float tanks idea of course because I hear I get really bored in flow tanks so yeah I just and I know that's them now going to Venables you and I've only done it three times every time in Austin Texas and it's always been like yeah a lot people with ketamine don't they John Lily's method yeah I have an edible that I make at home with with kratom which is an opioid like painkiller let's freaking amazing it induces this euphoria like high and I add CBD THC copaiba oil if you remember this no copaiba oil acts on the endocannabinoid receptors very similarly to THC and CBD but it has what's called like an entourage effect meaning it enhances the effects of CBD and THC so like if you're if you're vaping you can add like a couple drops of oil over the top of the herb or you can mix it into like an edible sleep cakes that you make mmm Wow my sister accidentally took one last week and said she had the best night of sleep of her life really and I don't travel with them because they just smell like you just open up a what bask and full weed so you know what you want those in the boat case when you're traveling dogs through the airport run like oj simpson anyways though the mix i use coconut oil and ghee and dark chocolate and a little bit of stevia like I have this butterscotch toffee stevia it's amazing I travel everywhere I put in sparkling water I put it in coffee well it's like an organic butterscotch toffee stevia where you get addicted to it it's a it's a company called Oh Micah organics I suppose you get it I get a 3-pack om I see I get off Amazon this is vanilla butterscotch toffee and plain like if you just don't want if you want to sweeten something but you don't want those extra flavors best best stevia ever so I'll put all this in the edible and I have this countertop immersion blender called it a magical butter machine and you blend this and it blends on top of the counter for like eight hours and all this stuff mixes together and then you pour it into molds and you can just put it in the in the freezer and then I keep it in these like a little mirror on glass jars so it doesn't degrade and that's just like the best best edible so I should try something the four float tanks um oh yeah yeah return to my float tank idea okay so I get these ideas when I'm in the flow tank and I want to and usually it's like five or ten minutes in so I spend the next 50 minutes trying to remit like don't forget this don't forget and I try like these little pneumonic techniques where you imagine like it you know that like an image of what you remembered is waiting for you outside the door as soon as you open the float tank so it might work for you to remit and but basically it just kind of screws up my whole to be able to just like let thoughts come and go and relax so my idea is this why not have some kind of a recorder move to the wall no so so like a voice activator yeah and do you I never did because and then you walk out and use get an mp3 playback yeah I been trying to figure out what a good one would be and how to set it up in there with all the salt and not have it degrade mmm but I think you figure it out I mean there's my thoughts and I thought is a Velcro like a velcro patch slap it in when you go in there and then activate it you ever see those voice-activated ones with a red light beam voice-activated recorders yeah I don't see yeah well they make these LED um you know they're they're like you know cuz I when I travel I don't like to get all the blue light in the hotel rooms and I'll unplug things try to make the hotel room dark right because when you flip off the lights in a hotel room is just like freaking Vegas right there's blue lights on the TV and stuff flashing you know all over the place so they make these and I had it for a while I don't travel with anymore butts like a black tape you can put over over things that light up in a room it's like it's like a you can they're like LED light blockers it's like tape basically but you just put it over the cover of anything that lights up you can use something like that on the digital recorder Wow could sell this from millions of dollars well I think the digital quarter thing is a really good idea and someone needs to I need to thank you my idea it's not your idea I'm sure I thought at first when did you first start doing it I thought it was like two years ago I've had a tank since 2002 early yeah yeah I rate I raced Ironman Triathlon for eight years and just got tons of sensory DEP in the water just staring at that black line at the bottom of the pool it's hard for me just like get in water and relax and I feel like you have to swimmer I just I've never been able to get that relax that's interesting so you associate like water with the movement because I see a water with swimming I don't like I get in water and I love water guys freedive and I spear fish I read this book deep by James nest or amazing book about all these cool things that going when you go down deep and he talks about how Olympic athletes are using this now to enhance their performance because your spleen compresses and you produce more erythropoietin or red blood cells same thing you produce actually if you sauna like if you do a workout and get really hot and then you go in the sauna after they've done Studies on this and they found that 30 minutes of heat therapy after you've already gotten the body hot you produce Ipoh the same as if you were to use the performance-enhancing drug just came out about cryotherapy and this is this echo something that Rhonda Patrick was saying that if you do cryo her advice was you should wait at least an hour after a workout before you do it and allow your body to have some sort of effect from from the exercise but sauna they're saying you should do almost immediately after so the idea with this there was a brand new study just came out like three days ago where they showed that heat post exercise enhanced the effects of exercise whereas cold blunted the hormetic response to exercise which makes sense it's the same thing the side of a window though it's it's a window of time so the deal is you don't want to blunt the Hermetic response to exercise high dose antioxidants cryotherapy cold immersion all of that can do this that's a problem with with fighters because a lot of fighters are getting into cold immersion like immediately absolutely exactly so wait wait till later on in the day there's no research on the amount of time for me what I do same thing when I do like a hard afternoon workout I wait a couple hours afterwards because you get a bigger testosterone and growth hormone response when you wait right after workout to eat I was actually mark Sisson was the first guy told me about this and it turns out that there actually is a better hormonal response when you fast post exercise same thing with antioxidants and there are a couple exceptions I can tell you about same thing with cryotherapy not at the same time if you finish up a hard afternoon or especially like an early evening workout you have a very high body temperature so my theory is that a brief dose of cold like I'll jump in the cold pool and get out not a phone call just enough to decrease the core body temperature which is one of the ways that you enhance deep sleep cycles so I also sleep on this thing called the chilli pad that circulates like cold water underneath my body yeah and the cool thing is like your partner can put their temperature on and I can put my temperature on and you can you can sleep out ever temp you want so I sleep with this thing boys 55 degrees yeah but it's not it's like background noise I sleep with all these everything anyway I use this from hoes called sleep stream it's like a DJ for sleep so I put my phone in airplane mode and then I have these these noise blocking headphones and if you're a side sleeper you can use these things called sleep phones which is like a headband that goes around your head anyways though back to the to the not doing the cold air exercise so you wait a little while but I think decrease in the body's core temperature is good so like a cold shower cold water immersion also beats out cryotherapy because yeah it's actually more and there was a study they did last month on this that cold water immersion was very effective in reducing post-workout muscle soreness and that inflammatory response to exercise compared to cryotherapy but again you should wait a little bit before you do it you should wait a little bit before you do it but I think part of that is due to you get like this hydrostatic pressure of water against the skin right so it kind of pushes the cold against the skin a little bit better and then the other reason is that when your head gets wet when your head goes under you know same thing as you'd get with a cold shower you get like this mammalian dive reflex right like that sharp intake of breath and that activates your vagus nerve so we talked about HRV and heart rate variability tracking anytime you do something like that that improves the tone of the vagus nerve you would actually improve your ability to recover the strength of your of your nervous system and they sell like vagal nerve stimulators and they've looked into like chanting humming singing JA they call it JA realignment therapy fairly removes the pressure that the trigeminal nerve can place on the vagus nerve there's all these things you can do to enhance the health of your vagus nerve and that's one of the things that improves your HRV or your heart rate variability allows your sympathetic and your parasympathetic nervous system when you're saying this tone like what do you mean by that the tone of the it would basically be synonymous with like the the health of the nerve I don't know what what's actually I don't know if it's if it's changing like the you know what do you call them the myelin sheath of the nerve or something like that when when you're increasing the tone of the nerve but more or less it's healthy for the vagus nerve when you get when you get your head wet or underwater so when I go in my cold pool after workout I put my head under and then come up like five or ten times just to go up and down and up and down then I get out and if I'm gonna do a longer cold soak it's not right after a workout the the two studies I found on antioxidant use after workout right high dose antioxidant like vitamin C vitamin E etc that supposedly blunts the Hermetic response to exercise but there is one study that shows that green tea polyphenols don't do that so green tea will allow you to fight off the inflammatory effects of exercise without blunting for example satellite cell proliferation or building of new mitochondria or all of the things that you want to happen and the other one was and this is this is a new thing like not a lot of people are talking about this now but it's like hydrogen rich compounds like they call it hydrogen rich water and there's these companies now there's like four or five and they sell like these tablets that you can dissolve in water and there's a the molecular hydrogen foundation they do research on this hydrogen and they're not they don't have a financial affiliation with any of these companies so I respect some of the research that they do and they found that it actually blunts the or it allows for anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects to shut down like the inflammatory response to exercise without blunting the hormetic response would be like green tea and molecular hydrogen would be the two things that I know of that you could do post-workout to blunt that inflammatory response without actually wanting the hormetic response to exercise so it'll enhance without diminish exactly exactly have your cake and eat it too one of the things I think that's probably really good about cold immersion therapy also I think there's a meditative aspect of getting into that incredible cold and just relaxing and calming and I think it does something for your mind it does and it's the nervous system right like what I tell people is you have a strong and I take my kids out there right now I've trained them since up very early I usually go out there they jump in the cold pool but they'll stand in front of the cold pool and calm their nervous system call them their heart rate I'll have them visit like one of them visualizes a sea otter right and the other one does a polar bear so they so they'll visualize these animals that are just like impervious to cold right and then they get in the water and they know there's no sharp intake of breath there's no like like people do when they take a cold shower a lot of the time if you can get your body at that point I think that it probably has a pretty it's a good indicator that you're building that nervous system resilience like if you can just get in cold and not freak out right so that's what I think people who do cold should train themselves to be able to do I've heard that argument about the sauna as well that it also builds like a mental toughness to be able to just sit in there and calm yourself and get used to the adverse get to the point where you want to bang down the door yeah and climb out and yeah that's what I like to get myself to in the song because obviously a bigger expression of heat shock protein and one flow when you get really hot but yeah there's a mental effects whoo same thing with the water song about that book the book deep and how I got into like free diving spearfishing I think you would love you I told you I'm gonna go it's like hunting underwater yeah actually yeah Aubrey and I are very nice spear fished in in Kona last year he and Whitney and I went down there and we were just using like the little three pawn guns it wasn't fall I'm like 80 feet deep you know big-ass guns were coming after tuna Jesus people go out there like dee I've I've never done do I'm not good enough underwater I'll attach to a tuna well what you do is you have a reel and the reel is attached to a float right and so after you shoot a new spear Oh big fish like a tuna it's not dragging you it's dragging the float so all you have to do is wait for that float to pop back up wherever it's gonna pop up and that's how but I haven't done that but that's like on my bucket list big Tom going back to I'm going back to Kona in April and that's gonna be more shallow water spearfishing we're gonna hunt for a scrub cattle sheep goat you know the pig there's a maze they have scrub cattle in here yeah and the pig feet on like macadamia nuts and avocado scrub scrub callus but apparently tastes amazing what scrub bulls are they're essentially domestic cattle that have gone feral so some time in the past whether it's 10 20 generations back whatever it was they busted through some fences now they're wild and in Australia they hunt them and they're very dangerous apparently they are the most aggressive Bulls bring it on I can't wait to be real careful buddy's got gored real bad and he had to be medevacked out of there he was in the northern country I'm just gonna play a shitload of techno hunt so it so the book I read this book by James Nestor and and I had him on my podcast and like dude I want to learn how to do this I want I want to learn how to like compress the spleen and go under and learn how to hold my breath and get all these nervous spleen the spleen just gets compiled on I learned how to get deep enough because I couldn't even as an Ironman triathlete I couldn't go deeper than 15 feet without freaking out cause like my my ears would get the pressure in them and I could do the what do you call it the arm when you equalize not the Frenzel technique but the it's the you know when you when you go yeah yeah I'm forgetting the name of pops your ears yeah the pop your ears technique that most people do when they get into the water but there's another technique called the Frenzel technique where you'll you'll pull the it's like mm-hmm and you see do you see like your nose go see how my nose goes out like that mm-hmm if you do that you can equalize it like 20 feet 30 feet 40 feet so I said who can I go learn from me it's like you got to go see this cat down in Fort Lauderdale named Ted hardcourts Florida dick Shox do those stem cells gotta learn how to do the spleen thing so I go to uh fortunately my grandmother lives in Florida so I I have a place to stay when I go there so there's that at least and I take this free diving course and he gets me from holding my breath for about a minute and 45 seconds he got me up to four 45 four minutes 45 seconds took me from 15 feet over five days down to 80 feet where you're like trout you you actually they put a rope in the water and you go vertical and you have like your bit you know the big fins like you have the big fins and you have class that I've seen those on people but they're they're like half as long as that flag what's that like like three or four feet but yeah they're like these big carbon fins and I said dude just tell me all the best things to buy and I contacted the editor so your Arbonne so they're stiff and their car and they're stiff and you just swim so fast in them and I contacted the editor of spearing magazine and asked me what's the best gun to buy or the best fins but so I I got outfitted with all this stuff and then I went down there learned how to hold my breath or now to equalize and now when I spear fish and I still again I haven't got to the point where I've gone it like I go after the grouper and the parrotfish like the the little ones I haven't gone to the point now I'm hunting the big fish groupers fucking but very similar to I know the first time I went after my I got to at once - groupers at once and apparently it wasn't grouper season so they had me put him put him back yeah it's it's not as big of a deal is like if you shoot an elk and you know I'm a tag I mean like but but yeah let me not put him back I didn't like take them down to their little grouper nest and well I mean it didn't want to get fine they didn't want you in trouble all right so so Somaly is no spearfishing amazing and this whole like free diving you know we got on this topic from the float tanks similar experience like you're just at peace under the water you're not wearing all the scuba equipment so fish swim up to and you can kind of like lay on the bottom of the water and you know shoot something as it comes and I go with my kids and they like sit on the shore with like buckets and and knives and you know help help brain the fish and then we take it back and you have like fish cook-offs and that's it's amazing I use very similar to but very similar field of bow hunting except it's like that peaceful setting in the water it's probably intensely physical do right well it's a great workout because you're not oh no you're cold you're getting all the benefits of cold thermogenesis you know like the white adipose - brown fat conversion and the shivering and then the calorie burning and you know the angiogenesis and all the stuff you get from cold but then you're also you're freaking hunting right you're not sitting on the edge like with a with a fishing pole over a boat which I found intense boring you're actually in there and you're doing all while you're holding my breath doing small while you're holding your breath no scuba equipment and people will do like like I do breath hold walks alright well go on a walk and every time I pass a telephone pole I'll just like take a breath and hold my breath as long as possible and a pasta tell it when I pass a telephone pole and they'll breathe through my nose to recover and then when I get to the next telephone pole I'll hold my breath probably I'd die someday like stuff like buy a car blue in the face but yeah spear feet like you'd like it I'm sure I would think you dig it yeah it seems like an interesting mental exercise today is you have to keep your shit together while you're in the water and you want to take a breath you do and people die people do shallow water blackout and this is what I learned what that's why I this guy sent me down to Fort Lauderdale cuz this guy he teaches safety right you don't do like the wim HOF breathing and blow off all the carbon dioxide so you can hold your breath longer which is great for holding your breath longer but carbon dioxide is your body's signal to take a breath right so if you breathe I'll haul your carbon dioxide then you walk out teknoaxe so for example you're floating on the water before you're gonna take a dive down so you kind of like watching the water you're watching the fish and you might do like a two count breath in to count hold and then ten count breath out to count hold and you're just like getting the heart rate down you're getting the nervous system calm you're not even supposed to do like a lot of caffeine which jacks up the system and causes you to not be able to hold your breath as long dairy makes the mucus more thick and so you can't hold your breath as long as you live dairy so you don't do a lot of dairy don't do a lot of caffeine and then you just dive down and I did I brought ketones down because a lot of like Dominique D'Agostino has you know he's done research on like divers and reducing a lot of the effects of like reduced reduced flow of oxygen to the brain that apparently these Navy SEAL divers get and he does research on on the use of ketosis and ketones and one of the days that we were out there I actually took ketones and they increased my breath hold time just using like these these exogenous ketones really apparently they have an effect as well because the brain is using more more of the ketones and the glucose but they increase breath the whole time yeah they came up with that for rebreathers right like that's when they started getting people Navy SEAL divers when they're using rebreathers apparently a certain percentage of them susceptible to CMS yeah and they use a you know well two things you know ketosis and and CBD or two things that are used for the for like epilepsy and seizures yeah yeah ketosis supposedly has an amazing effect with kids kids I did 12 months of like strict ketosis really for study for a lab study in Florida I'm just kidding University of Connecticut this guy named um Jeff Volek he does a lot of like ketone research and he had one group of athletes follow just a normal endurance athlete diet for 12 months and another group follow like a high fat low carb ketogenic diet for 12 months because he wanted to see if you would maintain your glycogen levels and if you would if your performance would be synonymous to the group that did not eat the high fat low carb diet what would happen to inflammatory markers what would happen to the gut microbiome so buddy wanted like a lot of these studies on high fat low carb diets they'll follow people for like two weeks or three days and have me like high fat low carb and then see what happens when they go jam on a bike for 30 minutes or exercise but they wanted to do like a long term study to see if the body can adapt to burning fats as a fuel with long term utilization of a high fat diet which I don't do anymore by the way I I save all my carbohydrates for the evening then I eat a bunch of carbohydrates in the evening what kind of carbs you eat oh like red wine dark chocolate tubers starches yams sweet potatoes you my wife's a cook so she does like this is amazing like slow fermented sourdough bread which link pre digests all the gluten you know where's the glycemic index it's a like pretty much quinoa amaranth no I don't follow a specific diet in terms of like restricting certain food groups my philosophy is you just make them digestible eating carbs at night that it's a good thing to relax you as well technically you're more insulin sensitive in the morning but you can make yourself more insulin sensitive in the evening and the advantage of that is if you consume a bunch of your carbohydrates in the morning when you're in an insulin sensitive state what are you gonna rely upon is your primary fuel during the rest of the day right instead of teaching your body how to be a fat-burning machine and tapping the fats and generate ketones so you save your carbohydrate intake for the end of the day but I also save my hard work out for the end of the day which is when your body temperature peaks and your grip strength Peaks and you you you you can do a hard workout anybody which rolls out of bed and tries to do a CrossFit WOD versus doing it you know the 5:00 p.m. in the afternoon knows this like you can do a pretty good hard workout like in the later afternoon in the evening when you're warmed up but that also up regulates insulin sensitivity and the activity of these glute 4 transporters that can you know shove glucose in a muscle tissue for example and so then you can have your cake and eat it too right you you create your own insulin sensitive state and then you go off and typically I'll finish that workout around like 6:00 6:30 right and like I mentioned I don't need dinner for a couple hours after the workouts like 8:30 we sit down to a family dinner and I'll just eat as many carbohydrates as I want because I'm in an insulin sensitive state by the next morning and I tested this for a while I did like the blood ketone and the breath ketone testing I'm back in a fat-burning state by the next morning so with the bread I've also replenished my glycogen stores in my liver and my muscle to be able to do the next day's hard workout right so I like this strategy for athletes because they can get all the benefits of a fat-burning state the reduced free radical production from excess glucose intake the reduced UIC McVerry ability which is honestly it's it's a pretty big marker for in my opinion like like your risk factor for a host of chronic diseases like spiking your blood glucose multiple times during the day so instead you just don't eat carbohydrates all day do a hard workout at the end of the day and then have your carbohydrates to replenish all your energy levels then you go into the next day and then what's the primary food source during the day like what do you do you have like standards you arms that you I do we we have a lot of like really good wild plants that grow up in our land so I have 10 acres up there in Washington State and we've got like wildin that all mint and plantain and Oregon grapefruits and comfrey all these amazing plants so we also have 8 raised garden beds where we grow kale bok choy and you know Swiss chard and so you raise them so they don't they're not as obsessed able to ground frost when you raise a garden bed you can just add whatever type of soil that you want to purses digging down because my wife does a lot of composting so we have chickens and goats so she use a lot of a lot of the dung from the chickens and the goats and the leftover food from inside and does composting and so we use a lot of this in the raised garden beds I started gardening this year indoors I'm growing something called split auntie's which I can tell you about later it's amazing mmm I found it in kawaii but the what I do during the day is eat a lot of wild plants right so so I'll come in when I'm coming in from like that cool pool in the morning I like gather some plants and I throw those in a blender with like some some fats like coconut milk or coconut oil I'll do like some bone broth and some lemon because when you mix the vitamin C with collagen you make the college and a lot more absorbable so I'll mix the vitamin C with bone broth I'll put that into the blender a whole bunch of superfoods don't blend it for like two minutes if you blend it for a long time it gets like a texture like a Wendy's frosty so it's a and you can like eat it with with you know one of those long you've had a Wendy's frost sure all right yeah you look confused no no no I said Wendy's fried like it's strangely what kind of horrible life have you what did your parents do to you you never had a Wendy's frosty so so it gets like this Wendy's frosty like consistency it's just a bunch of wild plants and fats and I put like that stevia in there I put a little bit of cacao in there sometimes like a little bit of whey protein like a good like grass-fed whey or some kind of protein source and then I put like crunchy things in so I put it all in a bowl with a spatula crunchy yeah like coconut flakes and cacao nibs and like I use like these little spirulina and chlorella tablets and so it's like eating a it's like when you go to a yogurt store and you get the yogurt and get the toppings on top of it mm-hmm but it's like this amazing ketogenic superfood rich meal and by blending it all together and blending the fats with all the all the ingredients you're actually enhancing the absorption and so so that's what I have for breakfast you should open a cafe sometimes good well I'm trying to like I'm trying to make it into like a like a drinkable a drinkable form yeah I'm going over to see Rick Rubin after this over in Malibu and he does the same thing for breakfast and that's actually one of things were talking about how we can make this know so random like we go sauna together over there in Malibu and we were we both do the same thing like his is his is a little bit different like you put some different things in it the same thing and it's an amazing breakfast because you can sit there and like I did a lot of dictation on my computer so I'll sit there and I'll dictate emails a bit but while I'm eating my my smoothie with a spoon that's amazing and then I do a salad for breakfast or for lunch a big-ass salad again a whole bunch of wild plants I'll put like sardines seeds nuts you know just just good good fats on them and then I have like these nori wraps which is like a seaweed wrap really good an iodine really nutrient dense and then I use miracle noodles have you had miracle noodles no so they're made out of Japanese yam they call them shirataki noodles it's and my kids make a pad thai out of this they they have like a cooking podcast where they do all these crazy crazy meals and one of the things they use a lot of are these shirataki noodles so I make these Japanese yam noodles I'll put them on top of the salad and then I roll that up and like annoyed burrito wrap and I eat that like a burrito lunch and then dinner like I mention it's just you know whatever my wife happens cuz dinner isn't like my free meal right it's just whatever I want to have but for this study for Jeff Volvox lab is 12 months strick Ito Sethe and they brought us in a lab at me and the in the group of ketogenic athletes and also the whole group of endurance athletes following a traditional carbohydrate rich diet do a vo2 max test the night that we got there and then the next morning they punched a bunch of holes in our thighs with needles and did a biopsy of the muscle to see how much glycogen was in the muscle and then with these big holes and in our muscles we had to go run on a treadmill for three hours so I ran 22 miles so what you're saying punch a hole like we wanted to see how much do you want to see how much glycogen sleep or by ups it's like a little bleak guillotine that's a big deal yeah we need to go pound on the treadmill after you've had these these needle biopsies in your thighs and then they did fat biopsy because they want to look at fat content up on either side of the hips and then I ran for three hours on this tread it was horrible there was like no TV there's no okay there's a white wall on the treadmill but they would end and I was hooked up to like a you know like like a blood collection device because [Music] my aerobic socks on back in the day exactly yeah and my running see just were running a sentry hours here at the walls run for three hours Scott's got to be the worst part of it it's horrible yeah I didn't know going in I walked in the room and like I'll shit because I would have brought you know yeah something to watch but I ran and they were testing fat oxidation rates at rest and it exercise so I'm wearing this this mask it's it does what's called indirect calorimetry where based on the carbon dioxide that you breathe out and the oxygen that you consume it approximates your carbohydrate and your fat burning rate it's kinda like the gold standard of metabolic testing and laboratory testing situations like in an exercise physiology lab and so you're testing how much fat you're burning during exercise how much carbohydrate you're burning during exercise something called your respiratory exchange ratio is what it's called and the prevailing research and the literature suggests that you can burn about 1.0 grams of fat per minute during exercise like that would be about how much fat you would burn 1.0 grams of fat per minute when they test this is called the faster study FAS ter they found that the folks who followed a high-fat diet like me and and these other people who are eating a high-fat diet we were burning 1.5 to 1.7 grams of fat per minute during exercise during this three hours read more on we had no deficit in performance our vo2 maxes were just as high and we we maintained our levels of muscle glycogen and so basically there was no we didn't go any faster I'm not saying like like the ketogenic diet is gonna keep better at endurance sports because I've never seen any evidence that that's going to happen but we did go just as fast and we actually burnt we turned our bodies into fat-burning machines over the course of 12 months it was actually a really cool study so the benefits would not be necessarily performance but the benefits are more you know a lot of people like they get got raw and fermentation from eating a lot of fermentable carbohydrates some people get a small intestine vector all growth some people get blood glucose fluctuations you see you see it drop in what's called the first phase insulin response like normally you're supposed to produce a lot of insulin when you eat a meal or at least enough to be able to shove that substrate into storage tissue and normally you'd be able to produce this and by getting a lot of glycemic variability during the day you eventually produce insulin and sensitivity right like you don't have that normal first phase insulin response and you can become restore with you can use things like bitters and chew your food a lot and you know strength train before you eat a carbohydrate rich meal you know things like that but ultimately yeah it's more of like a health among everything it's not like a like eating low carbohydrate makes you faster it's just that you avoid a lot of the potential issues the potential health issues that would come with a large amount of glucose fluctuations but there's exceptions to that rule right like you could go get your genetics tested and you might find out you have let's say familial hypercholesterolemia in which case if you eat like katatak diet you'll produce a lot of like oxidized clean you'll see people with cholesterol like four hundred five hundred and really high LP little-a and all these issues with a high amount of fat consumption because their bodies are unable to deal with that amount of cholesterol that's a big point that's a big point I can't stress that enough is that human beings very so wide in the huge huge amount life so there's a great book that Bryan Callen turned me on to that I'm reading right now called sapiens the the origins of human beings it's completely fascinating it's it's great there's another book called biochemical individuality it's like an old book but I was looking through it's fascinating like it like there's like 12 different shapes of the stomach like seven different ways that the heart is shaped and certain people will excrete copious amounts of vitamin D and need a lot more vitamin D intake and other people develop vitamin D toxicity in response like the 2,000 or 4,000 international units that a lot of people are popping these days certain people develop high cholesterol and high triglycerides and high inflammation in response to it to a ketogenic diet and some people don't and so like we live in an era where it's like it's cheap to get your genes tested and that's only gonna get cheaper well it's also there's you'd have to really find a good expert that really understands what the difference and the genetic variability czar yeah I mean like otherwise you're just testing like you're trying a ketogenic diet testing out your blood work and trying to figure it out it's it's very complicated to the for the layperson it is but I mean like in very simplistic terms I've told some people this well you could at least test your genetics and there's actually a really good book about this called the jungle effect by dr. Daphne Miller and she goes into how like she'll put like her her Hispanic clients unlike a traditional Mexican diet comprised of like you know soaked and sprouted legumes and low glycemic index you know tortillas a non-gmo corn and take them back to what their ancestors would've eaten like she'll literally take like what the Torah mehar Indian tribe is eating in South America and put her Hispanic clients on that or she'll put like her african-american clients on a fiber rich fermented like Cambodian diet right and and you could easily do it like it's not rocket science right you go your genetics tested you see your ancestors came from and you try to approximate what and obviously we're a genetic melting pot in America and there's gonna be some people who are just like oh crap I came from I come from Japan and Europe and Ethiopia you know like there's some people who come from all over the place in which case you would have to take a deeper dive right you can get blood work you can get what I tell people is gay genes tested like a comprehensive blood analysis get your gut tested right so you could look at your bacterial balance presence of parasites yeast fungus all those kind of little things that that effect got health and personality and everything else that the microbiome affects and then like a like a urine test for hormones which is more accurate than a blood test isn't it and that's a lot of testing but I mean if you really really truly want to dial things in it's genetic testing it's blood testing urinary testing for hormones there's a test called a Dutch test it tests like your testosterone all throughout the day the metabolites of testosterone and your cortisol all throughout the day the metabolites of cortisol so you could actually see like you know do I really have high cortisol or am I just not breaking it down quickly enough for example I just wish there was a place that you could go that was very comprehensive that the average person could go to where they could do all this stuff for you and break it down for you there like there's more and more marketed every thousand dollars it's the hue there is a place light it's like the human there's you know some of these guys who like trying to live forever like I think one of them is Peter Diamandis crazy center I think is another guy where are these like the human human longevity Institute Oh gets cold yeah like some of these some of these rich dudes right right like a lot of these billionaires they're going to this places and getting like the comprehensive blood testing done I'd I do a lot of that myself just by ordering it you know from like direct labs or these injecting stem cells and yeah but I think for the average person that's listening to this it's it's a little confusing and maybe a little frustrating because it would be nice if there was a place you go that's like the dentist right so pretty straight exactly or not that will there's companies working on that right now like an actual dashboard where you get a home test kit done and and they're like there are actually like micro needles now that you can attach to the skin that you patch it on yourself you send off a tiny tiny amount of blood and you get a host of blood values back and then you would be able to see like what you have deficits in and I could totally see them pairing that with like food delivery companies or like you know even just like print out so like here's your protein carb fat ratio it'll happen now when we were on the strict ketogenic diet for 12 months what was your diet like what did you basically eat no Italian I was like my bodybuilding days where like you go weigh-in like in the morning before the show and then the rest of the day you eat like freaking ice cream and bread and you look like just like a Olympic God when you get up on stage cuz everything's poppin right like all that glycogen gets restored after about eight hours my first meal well you when you don't eat many carbohydrates you upregulate levels with something called the glycogen synthase which is an enzyme responsible for helping to get glycogen in the muscle tissue so this would be a process these abortion mikage and depletion followed by glycogen restoration causes this big surge in glycogen plus going into a show you're restricting carbohydrates anyways because it's hard to get very very low body fat that's why you see bodybuilders eating freakin like chicken and broccoli right so the same thing is something I did when I did triathlon right you'll like carbohydrate deplete the weekend before a race and then I used to do this you'd be like no carbohydrates on Saturday and Sunday for a race that follows the next Sunday and then Monday you'd start to eat more carbohydrates Tuesday even more and by like Saturday before the race you're eating like 90 percent carbohydrate there's white before I can't train my body to like you know ketosis and function well on a low carb diet but you're just I mean you're jacked up chock full of glycogen because you up regulate that enzyme it's it's called what's it called carbohydrate it's just basically carbohydrate depletion carbohydrate loading so no was there any benefit of that performance-wise versus what you're doing now mmm there's there's not necessarily a benefit in that you you go faster if you've trained your body how to operate well on a low carbohydrate diet I've never like I said seen any evidence that like a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet makes you go faster than if you were eating like a regular like carbohydrate rich diet but I also haven't seen that if you do like I did and follow it strict for a long time there's not a lot of evidence that makes you go slower either so it's kind of like it's like right so it's just a health longevity bents more of like hey if I can live a longer time and feel better and produce less reactive oxygen species by doing this versus the high carbohydrate intake then why not do it and I mean when you look at like the Nike project and how they were trying to break the marathon record and in Italy they were using like these crazy engineered forms of carbohydrate where they went way above like these malted extra and fructose blends that a lot of companies like you know like Gatorade use and they were using these super engineered carbs it's possible that some of these newer carbohydrates that are engineered for extremely high absorption could could beat out like if we were to study those in like a you know a high fat low carb athlete who'd followed that diet for a long period of time versus like a traditionally fueled athlete who is eating these newfangled engineered carbohydrates it's possible the newfangled engineered carbohydrates could make you go faster but unless your paycheck is on the line and you're a pro I still say you know why not get that balance between health and longevity and speed my thyroid though did not like that high fat ketogenic diet I rarely paired with high levels of physical activity my testosterone went down right like there were some issues that's fast increase usually you hear the opposite people with thyroid disease they recommend a ketogenic diet to those people yeah but look at it this way and I explained this to to a lot of athletes who I work with who want to do the ketogenic diet thing you read a you know you read a book like you know there's some fantastic ketogenic diets out there that are plant rich which a lot of ketogenic diets are right like you they'll be like coconut oil and butter and that actually creates a lot of gastric inflammation in the absence of like you know high amount of polyphenols and flavonoids and high-fiber and plant Eyck like you want both I wrote an article about this called the dark side of coconut oil that gets into the fact that if you're gonna do like a high fat low carb ketogenic type of diet you would want to include a lot of plants and like dr. Terry walls was a book called the Wallace protocol that's got a plant rich ketogenic version in it Stephen Gundry has his book to plant paradox and he has like he has like a ketogenic version in that book that's like very plant rich so if if you're eating like a like a plant rich ketogenic diet and you're following what a lot of these people have written you generally be advised to eat like 30 to 50 grams of carbohydrates per day which is fine if you have thyroid disease or you have some other issue you know pre-diabetes whatever and you're trying to control with a ketogenic diet but then once you throw copious amounts of physical activity into the mix right your CrossFit or your an Ironman triathlete and you go reading one of these books and you read they're supposed to be 50 grams of carbohydrates well you know the authors of those books to my knowledge or not out racing Ironman triathlons and you know doing marathons and rye and copious amounts of physical activity so you have to up the carbohydrate intake so it's all about you know so for me personally only like a hundred to 200 grams of carbohydrate it's still hydrate feed at the end of the day I'll still maintain ketosis and so you you again you have your cake and eat it too that's a radical output exactly so if you have like a thyroid issue and you're highly active and you want to follow a ketogenic diet then you need to include more carbohydrate than would be recommended and let's say like a more sedentary type of ketogenic diets because you're always reading these diets based on just the average person and the average person is just not gonna put out that kind of value you want to include a lot of the things that you tend to build up deficits in like you know potassium and magnesium are two Biggie's and you dump a lot of glycogen and glycogen stores a bunch of water and it stores a bunch of electrolytes you have to figure out how to replace that and now people are using you know these exogenous ketones yeah like the ketone salts right or the ketone esters and the danger with those is now you can like get into ketosis but still also have high blood glucose and that's something that we don't really study like that's not like our ancestors out hunting right for that like it's not like they were in ketosis because they were burning a lot of their own body fat and generating ketones as a by-product and they were they were in just like a natural state because they weren't eating a lot of food sometimes just you know not stuffing their face with carbohydrates and glucose but now people are able to eat a normal Western diet and I'm like buy one of these ketone supplements and also be in ketosis so you're hypoglycemic and hyper katatak and I've rate like I did that before a race and I felt like I was on steroids like it was able to rocket fuel because my blood glucose was jacked through the roof but so I did a bunch of like fructose maltodextrin energy based gels and then I drank a bottle of these ketone esters which basically I mean they have if you measure your ketones you'll you'll know that this is high but within 10 minutes my values were above seven millimolar which is just off the charts for ketones but my blood glucose was also off the charts and I felt like my cells had like both forms of fuel they'd ever need both ketones and glucose and I felt amazing but I'll bet I mean that's similar like diabetic ketoacidosis like if you're in that state all the time and you're using all these ketone supplements and just eating your diet and using these because you're quote in ketosis unquote I don't think it's healthy I wonder if it would be great though performance wise like for a fight it's something is that it's amazing you unstoppable I would think that I wonder if athletes have tried and as long as you use that it's like it's like use it as a it's like I heard somebody say it's like sugars are sometimes drug right because it like you can feel and can give you especially if you're if you're not fat adapted I mean carbohydrates give you a pretty big boost in performance and energy versus not having them on board when you're exercising in a special or exercising hard and this would be like that right appear to use that as a sometimes drug and be careful with it I could see that being a huge weekend like I didn't quantify it was a tough mudder in Vegas and all I know is I felt way way more dot like like I had the cognitive high that you get from ketones which was the original reason that I started doing like I started doing this ketosis thing like seven years ago when I was getting ready to race Ironman Canada and I wanted to see what it would feel like to have those readily available fuel sources for the liver and a diaphragm and the heart and kind of the focus that comes with high levels of ketones when you had a bike for five hours and I had that when I took these exogenous ketones but then I also had all the energy that you get when you know like after you've had like a yeah a candy bar right so yeah your high blood sugar and high blood ketones so you just feel focused but you also have high levels of energy that sounds amazing I just like the stem cells like it's amazing I hope it's good I hope I don't die yeah yeah that sounds like though if you were doing a big event and if you didn't do it up to like I like what you're doing is in terms of diet wise it seems like it makes sense they've got a great really good balance but for a big event that sounds like gonna be a really good thing to do load up on carbohydrates load up on the ketone esters right ketone acid ketone esters are expensive yeah these ketone Solon's about the ketone salts too is I haven't seen a lot of research that the ketone esters are necessarily that much better than the ketone salts you got electrolytes with them too right that's one of the things you get depleted on know what what brand you're using dude I told you I'm like as a blogger I get these packages sent to my house every day just like you probably the same things that cardboard boxes like okay so a little paper bag of something somebody in their kitchen that I said yeah that's that's somebody gave me somebody gave me when I was this was I think it was an Asheville doing a race and of course one of my clients took me to this place called karate' it's like a charcuterie a like a fine charcuterie restaurant amazing me that's amazing apparently like President President Obama's like favorite restaurant was in Asheville and he'd go there and and like you go up and down the street just I went there during the yoga festival there's like people sitting up in trees playing banjos like that's crazy it's amazing wanna go back there yeah the International yoga festival and in Asheville but the Nashville baby hashtag Asheville somebody gave me like wine that they infuse of cannabis I get like this big like cannabis infused wine but it was nothing like one of those old school like kombucha bottles like the glass you're just like I don't know where this is busy sitting I don't know what's in here no it was a cool idea but no offense to whoever gave me that but I didn't actually consume that but the ketone salts and the ketone esters honestly dude I've tried like all of them you know ki genex and keto I forget open throat keto something keep my friend dr. Jennings and went to school in Nashville and he said that they started giving the cows a certain diet to kill the psilocybin mushrooms that grow in their shit because too many kids were climbing fences and and plucking mushrooms out of the cow shit you ever do that you ever do like the psilocybin micro dosing thing that people are doing for for cognition I have psilocybin microdose I've taken and it gives you a nice feeling I like it gives you I have a friend who is a world champion kickboxer who micro doses every day and he says it makes him almost telepathic he says it makes his response time to sparring he said he sees things before they happened your sensory perception especially in nature settings right like there's this there's like the synthetic chemical Ella chemical LSD RP LSD is like the one a lot of people are using now because you get it for a lot less expensive and it has the same effect as LSD it's just it's a lot cheaper you get both in like these websites where you use crypto currency to purchase the compound but the FBI sent it to you exactly yeah dun dun dun duh you it's very synthetic and there's like a merging of the left and right hemispheres of the brain and you get very creative and focused simultaneously doses for LSD you you want a volumetric Lee dose which means like if you get a blotter of LSD it's like 100 micrograms I'm like a square and a lot of people cut that into like 10 pieces so that one piece would be ten micrograms but you don't know if that piece has like 20 or five on it right so you take a hundred a hundred micro gram tab and you put that in like a little like a like a glass dropper bottle and then you would add like 10 milliliters of Everclear or vodka or some kind of alcohol to it and then you know that for every one milliliter of alcohol in that little dropper bottle that you consume you're getting exactly 10 micrograms of LSD and about 10 to 20 micrograms like one to two dropper bottles full that would be considered a micro dose for most people but you don't like returning to psilocybin psilocybin produces like this sensory perception very natural feeling improvement in your in your cognition and in your senses that that it just feels more natural rights like you you take it before you go on a hike or you would take it when you're like a very very natural like a nature setting like you know for something like you know day at the office like it seems like LSD is like a more natural choice but suicide is really interesting for a nature-based setting thinking well the thing about it is you feel like you you're getting readings from trees and plants yeah get a weird feeling from you don't normally get like oh now I'm tuned into whatever frequency you guys are operating yeah and they they feel alive yeah whereas trees just feel like trees normally I walk by like they look beautiful and but I don't feel them we're the same sense right exactly and I mean you don't want it you don't want to make yourself dependent on finding a tree beautiful by whether or not you have so it's not even blood strokes like it's communicating with you know exactly like they're giving you information you save it for those settings when you want nature to be really special yeah because my wife gives me a hard time sometimes she's like you know why you gotta take psilocybin before you gotta go on a hike like why don't you just go on a hike you know sometimes it's more interesting sometimes you see things you wouldn't normally otherwise see so but you know I go to bed and I've got like my binaural beats in my sleep mask and you know I've got like that little grounding or thing device under my body and my chilli pad and you know blue light blocking glasses and you know I get in bed with all these wires sticking up out of my head my wife just gets in bed and just like sleeps she's got nothing on her side so we're very yin and yang yeah well you're so involved like everything you're doing you're very involved does it ever feel overwhelming that you have all this stuff I mean obviously it's what you know because you you systematize it right like when I walk into my office it's not like I'm spend in 20 minutes like turning on the turning on the lju voting on the essential oil diffuser and you know I've got like this this device that creates like special water that you breathe well you know humidifies the water that you breathe while you're working and I've got like you know blue light generating devices on the ceiling and all this stuff in my office but when I walk in there's just like click click click and I go to work mmm right with the thing on my head or whatever so it's once you systematize it it's not exhausting it's not like you're doing a lot to actually improve your body or you don't say biohack your body while you're while you're at work doing a lot of stuff just become systematized right it's like putting on your pants in the morning that byword is about done about done with that word biohack work it's it's beaten up that word now what I would consider be biohacking is you know these dudes that like inject chlorella into their eyes so that they could get a night vision or like Kevin work like he was like the original cyborg guy who got like a chip implanted underneath the skin or the people who will inject like magnets and their fingertips to be able to interact with devices so they would use the human body is what they call wet wear and then install hardware and like to me that's a true bio hacker for me to blend like curcumin with olive oil and bone broth and vitamin C and my smoothie sound like a biohack this is the health just like making a meal right yeah yeah I think there are trending through bio hackers out there who have actually hacked their biology by injecting chlorella into your eyes yeah it seems super risky actually you know I think it's chlorophyll just which is the green active component that you would find something like chlorella but his eyes are all black you should pull it up James River I'm assuming I don't think you could suck the chlorophyll back out but he has night vision now but or the guy who is goatman did you hear about gulp man no hold on what's one once every time you're almost manic so this guy has permanent black in his eyes and he can seed like sort of like a deer like nocturnal oh yeah that's him to the public have been testing noxious chemicals that allows humans to see in the dark and it works that's a true bio hat like that's a correct use of the term by in my opinion some other people and you can get like a what's this on Nerdist yeah nerdist.com on there he goes straight into the eye I'm not gonna do that I'll stop at the stem cells under my dick I'm not gonna know things the speculum holding my eyes open was by far the worst part even the effects themselves were very subtle it wasn't like oh my god I have predator vision nothing like that you don't get superpowers this is a tweak not an overhaul it's kind of disappointing that you go through all that for just the tweak yeah well your whole fucking eyes Occident do that shit I want predator vision yeah I want the full meal deal I want to be able to hunt animals in the darkness works by binding to ops and proteins in your retina where it's excited by light transformational process to occur in the protein segments see there you go huh yeah so you could get the blue light blocking glasses or you could just inject everything into your eyes allowed him pick to pick up figures in the dark with a hundred percent accuracy where non-treated test subjects can only make out to about 30 but that's pretty significant well that would be really good I like I like how the author doesn't know which percentage sign to use the actual percentage sign or the percent right mixes it up they got to work on their on their editing fifty meters go back to that Jamie we're talking 50 meters over 160 feet apart oh wow that's actually really significant the following warning his eyes returned to normal oh all right where does it right there the eyes returned to no apparent side effects oh wow so it's not like that they're dropping they're using drops so this would be like we're talking about bow hunting about elk hunting like like when you're in sort of no light uh-huh that might be the moon could pack your speculum entir intermode case yeah drop them in there make sure that you have a hunting buddy who is well versed in the addition of chlorophyll Robert loves new speculum yeah bring the rubber gloves you've got all that stuff to field-dress anyways and just go to town on your eyes how did you get into boning my buddy Kenton Clermont up in Washington State he was running these trained to hunt competitions which are really bad it's like obstacle course racing with a weapon that's tahno and you could do it out here and yeah because you have it like you could carry sandbags do like cones and suicides prints and all sorts of stuff with this technolon setup that you have but that training to hunt like the the first competition that I did you show up and it starts off with like a four or five hour traditional 3d shoot and for people who don't know what a 3d shoot is it's a bunch of targets you know like Reinhard targets or whatever that are set up they look like animals are gonna be a fox or an or an elk or you know whatever you know a bedded animal or a standing animal and they're spread throughout this course that you're walking you can think of it almost like golfing you know for people who don't bow hunt and you'll you know one shot might just be like a simple 25-yard shot a fox where if you get vitals you'll get five points and if you hit a body shot then it might be three points and if you miss it's zero and if you get like a wound it's actually a negative score which it should be like it's like a net because if you wounded animal that's that's really much much worse than missing an animal right so some of the shots are pretty complex it might be you got to get off two shots in ten seconds which is actually kind of hard to do you know two shots in 10 seconds and one animals at 20 and one animals at 40 all right which is why I use like a three pin side on my bow because you don't even have time to adjust the dial after you've taken one shot to yardage for the second shot you might have a shot that's like run up this hill there is a target up there we won't tell you the distance but you have 30 seconds to make it the 25 yards up that of that goalie and then you're gonna have a shot at the top and you got to run up the goalie site and get your shot off in those 30 seconds all right so so it's not like a traditional 3d shoot it's very active you know and some shots are are you draw lunging and then you stand and then you got to walk around the tree and then take your shot so it's actually pretty fun it's it's way different than just like standing out of the range shooting at targets and you get a certain score coming out of that right like you might have a masked X number of points or lost X number of points and then you go into may actually this year they've kind of like changed it because a lot of people like getting hurt and blowing up their knees with this next part but you do what's called like a meet pact which is a hundred pounds in your pack and it's a two to four mile course that you got a bogey across as fast as possible people were running right and the problem with it was people like when you pack out like you take a long time yeah like racing your body but this and it was like the most painful thing I've really ever done in terms of like how high my heart rate God and the amount of lactic acid like just try to go two miles faster you can with a hundred pounds in your pack sounds very not only you got a spend like I would spend copious amounts of times to make sure the pack was adjusted properly and I'll put like the bubble wrap in the bottom of the pack so it moves the weight that you're using which are typically sandbags up to the center of the pack and I worked with this company called Cafaro that makes like these yeah exactly Aaron exactly and you know he did some Skype sessions with me where he taught me exactly because you don't set it up the way that you would if you're just gonna pack out an animal yeah but super duper tight up in the shoulder so it's not bouncing around and then you put the weight down in the hips so it works for running two miles really hard but it's super uncomfortable and it's not mechanically favorable sucks but running yeah so they call that the meat pack and you have to do it that way or is it just a matter of how much weight you have on your back like if you could you use one of those Atlas packs have you seen those Atlas things from outdoorsman's it's essentially it's a pack frame with a traditional Olympic bolt on the end of it where you put the plates on it what are those things called the end of a weight bar where the white weights slide on them what would you call that the end of a way power that looks like they have one of those a post I guess you had a post yeah yeah they have one of those that's hanging out of the back see we can find it it's called the Atlas trainer Jamie outdoorsman's calm as a pack yeah it's a pack from with I hike with it on this is it's pretty dope whoa as long as everybody use a standard weight so you have to use the sandbag that they issued to you used the same object so everybody's using a sandbag just you don't come in with your own right you know what I was saying that you painted a 45-pound logo on anyways those who do the meat pack and any give certain my time for that and then you do the obstacle course which is the real hoot in which they still do which is because I think got rid of the meat pack but the obstacle course in fact well it's not it doesn't make sense right they designed this whole competition to simulate hunting to prepare a hunter to hunt and to train a hunter to hunt properly and it just flew in the face of everything that is hunting which is you know jacked up nervous system you know rushing through the woods with a giant package you just you don't pack out an animal like that right and they'd have to figure out a way to put like a speed limiter on like oh hey you're not allowed to run oh so so yeah but people were getting her and it just didn't didn't make sense jacked in my back and I get it's cool like I get it I kind of wish they still had it because I was good at that part cuz like I'm an endurance athlete I'm kind of strong so for me it worked out pretty well and then they have the obstacle course which is like crawling under barbed wire stand shoot and then you're doing like um you know like sandbag over the shoulder 20 reps shoot 30 burpees and and for the opposite of course you have a 50 pound pack or a 40 pound pack on your back they kind of adjust the pack weight based off which division that you're in but so you're using a smaller pack so I use the Kefauver packet ink again they just had like a smaller pack same thing got a sandbag it's a lighter sandbag so you carrying that through the whole course but you're stopping and shooting along the way so it's like you're you're learning how to just imagine if you if you're like rushing up a hill and you got to the top of the hill and you got a calm your heart where calm your nervous system very quickly and get your shot off and granted you're not necessarily gonna be hauling a sandbag up that hill and doing a bunch of burpees but it's kind of simulating yeah of shooting with your heart rate elevated and it's it's a hard course I mean like there are like legitimate you know hardcore CrossFitters and athletes that do this but it's a combination of being able to shoot well and being able to to fitness well that's the interesting thing about bow hunting is that bow hunting really does require Fitness well when I ditch that high country yeah I was I was wearing this this ring we were talking about I didn't know why and I did it like 46 miles over the course of five days just like crawling and walking and hiking and sprinting and I mean that's that's why I like bow hunting is it's a challenge and the trained to hunt guy Kenton he told me about these competitions and I was watching them and I'm like I really want to try this because at that point I'd fire armed hunted for two years I didn't grow up hunting I grew up you know homeschooled playing chess and playing the violin reading books and playing World of Warcraft like I was I was not like a hunter kid growing up and neither were my parents right we'd occasionally go fishing for trout that was about it in that in the stocked pond so hunting was new for me I had been hunting for two years it's totally self-taught like I felt dressed my first animal with the little you know YouTube video on the iPhone got my knife and I'm watching the video because that's the way I'm being homeschooled like I'd like to teach myself things I just grew up as a very independent learner so all of my hunting that's a great benefit yeah it there's there are drawbacks to being very resistant to learning from others or having Mentors I think that you also don't play well with others right like I grew up as when I got to college I was very poor like the team activities you didn't weren't social I was very good at creating at leading at thinking outside the box you know kind of kind of being a lot more independent that's fascinating because that's what you wound up doing that's what you did it is what I wound up doing and also I read a copious amount I wrote a copious amount and that's still what I do because that's what I looks like kind of grew up doing homeschooled and it was really tennis that got me into fitness like I played tennis in college and I got big into tennis in high school and in in Idaho where I was at the time there's a rule that homeschooled kids could play sports at the local public school so I played tennis not really got me into sports and then I studied exercise physiology and biomechanics in college and Here I am but it's like going from being homeschooled to hanging out with public school kids really awkward like I because you're not you're not in class with them you know at the prom you're not yeah you're not doing any of the social things that they're doing but then you might show up it like you know tennis practice or whatever and same thing we get to college you're just not used to I mean like dude I went off the deep end in college cuz I graduated I was 15 and I didn't do like a gap year or anything like I just started college when I was 16 and I did not have good self control around alcohol and drugs and all these things that were sudden I was immersed in in college so no one was there to tell you no yeah the way I raise my kids is they for example there are there are really no rules in our house right like they can try Roman scotch and whiskey and they can take a hit off the vape pen they're nine but they also have been educated about what that might do to their liver or to the gray matter in their brain or we don't say no gluten I tell them you know gluten is going to affect your test or scores creates a neural inflammation can create some gastric inflammation you get to choose when you go to the birthday party where you're gonna have the gluten and sometimes it comes back to bite me so go out to a restaurant and they'll bring the bread out to the restaurant my boys a black no no we don't want the we want the bread and I'm like but I kind of wanted little piece of bread here so that I think that's a better way to raise a child right you Kate them about the consequences of their decision and then you let them make the decision ourselves you equip them rather than creating a bunch of forbidden fruit which is the way that I was kind of raised right so so yeah it was a little tricky the whole College thing mom but back to back to bowhunting it was this training hunting and Kenton came over to my house and I asked him about like kind of like the spearfishing like what's what's the bow what release do I get um what errors do I get how did I do this I went to the my local bow shop I took some lessons in shooting um and then I my first hunt was my first hunt aside from my property some 110 acres maybe a copious amount of whitetail so I shot my first animal out there my first major hunt was high country Colorado we did like a horseback hunt with a guide there you know in that would you help me hooked if this was uh this was elk came back after seven days with nothing that was my very first hunt so and then my first actual kill was I hunted access deer down in Texas amazing amazing Texas is crazy I was telling me they have like freaking zebras and African animals and my wife bought us a sausage maker I mean my boys made made axes deer sausage the back strap and it was amazing and now now they're little they're little chefs like they uh that's cool they made like bone broth cake made baked doughnuts out of bread fruit flour and they use bone broth and colostrum and they made like a cream cheese ginger frosting and a dark chocolate Cal frosting and it actually tastes like real doughnuts what was this recipe yeah from rest and they're like don't they find this residue bake them bone colostrum doughnut recipe we made it up yeah and they use bread fruit flour forever they did they do pad thai but they used those shirataki noodles I was talking about and they use organic roasted crickets like instead of shrimp or chicken and the crickets actually tastes really good the other thing I think they yeah they're not raising the crickets they're not I think it's called meketa is the company that they get the crate and they're really good they like send you these little crickets are good man thanks crickets yeah Mexico though and yeah crickets are they're actually really tasty yeah there's a place I go to Mexico and they they give them to you like it's a little appetizer to leave in your room early yeah it's like a fried cricket appetizer it's like it's like the resort you go to with the apples and the mango covered nacelles crickets well they have that time they have crickets - Wow and they it's very tasty there Derek and yeah there's somehow another sustainable source of protein yeah yeah see the thing about most people that are like they don't want animals to die they don't usually give a shit about bugs yeah not a lot of people find like a June bug super cute and cry when it when it gets killer mosquitoes on their arms yeah I read a study this morning of gene-editing mosquitoes now yeah if they're using CRISPR technology to make the mosquitoes less likely to bite you I saw that crazy yeah and if you there's a little cool little anecdote from that study too where they found that mosquitoes actually have like like they learn if you swat at the mosquito it actually learns to avoid you and so if if you you know normally I just like put some on my skin like cinnamon essential oil or something that drives a mosquito away it's not work but yeah it does you you want it you want to dilute it because it's like a very it's a burning oil but cinnamon works amazingly you ever tried it in like Alaska where they have like really aggressive mosquitoes why there's a lot of mosquitoes different animal work for me and they swarm you like a Alaska doesn't seem like a place I would envision having these like special snow no very long so they're incredibly aggressive I mean I'm telling you it's the weirdest thing I've ever seen we went salmon fishing there me and my friend Ari and we opened up the car door to get out and then time we take to open the car door a swarm of mosquitoes was inside the car and I'm not exaggerating several hundred mosquitoes oh my goodness show that video that you pulled up once we were talking about this the clouds of mosquitoes in Alaska fucking crazy sounds like the grat like when I grew up I grew up in Lewiston Idaho and we would get these grasshopper infestations like each year yeah locusts and they apparently they plant our eggs in the ground and then like in the spring or the summer they hatch through that yeah that's mosquitos in Alaska Wow dude I'm telling you it's the crazy fuck it's like a bird get burned by mosquitoes Oh birdie oh my goodness dude I'm telling you I never seen anything like it and we were covered with DDT and all that shit but yeah the terrible the the DEET do you know about thermistor sticks I do now I think I've been using them because my kids camp outside sometimes you know that in the forest and I set one of those little thermos all things in front of there they're amazing yes Wow yeah well is that why here the firs like that I've known that caribou yeah the grasshoppers at our house and Lewiston we would actually go sell them to pet stores like that's how we make money in the summers because it'd be so many of them me and my brothers would walk around with cages catch these grasshoppers and ringing the pet stores we'll use him for like tarantulas and stuff like that and then this army guy he was in the military came to our house he showed us how they eat grasshoppers so we started eating grasshoppers and we liked everything right like we'd microwave grasshoppers just figure out every way to kill a grasshopper and the way that we got rid of them was we introduced praying mantis and chicken to our property bunch of chickens and then we have chickens out our property up in Spokane now to have a chicken yeah Icelandic chickens they're very very Hardy oh and then the goats that we have our Nigerian Dwarf goats and I say Maria Nigerian Dwarf goats they're very small goat and they produce a lot of milk for their actual size and they're very Hardy and even there and they're small and they're cute and we haven't milked them yet because they need to be that they have to be pregnant to produce the milk and we've had some issues with like the babies dying and like we're learning our goat came however we did I rubber bands around a bunch of their testicles recently to neuter some of the males like training we train the males to be Pat goats yeah neuter him so you're killing their balls with rubber bands right exactly yeah we have like little tires go there little tires that they play on over each other they named them after candy bars like Eminem and caramel and Milky Way and toffee do you buy them just for pets or did you buy we bought them originally for milk cuz you know goat milk it's very yeah the protein is smaller it's very thermodynamically compatible yeah apparently the only one that's better is camel milk the company out of California was sending me camel's milk to my house for a while and apparently it's SuperDuper healthy for you and it's and the protein is smaller more absorbable and and it's less hypoallergenic and from there to your immune systems well was young she could not digest actual cow milk it just really didn't agree with her but goat milk was fine we found an I started drinking goat milk I just yeah tastes better like is the colostrum your reviews colostrum OJ's basically just like playing this goat yoga yeah people do yoga with goats they apparently find it relaxing it's really popular man I think I would distract you this looks like something people have never been in a farm with deer they're like yoga yes exactly yeah Starbucks with their Frappuccino and they go out there good set up and then I have an obstacle I built an obstacle course because I do all this also of course race all right and you know what's cool is you can take all these little little bow targets and you set them up around the obstacle course so you'll like climb the rope and come down right and you shoot your bow and then you do you practice like standing still though and working on you before and doing that as well we got tired yeah exactly it's it's meditative I was very relaxed sit down with you and go over this I did cuz you you also trigger shoot you're not you're not using a surprise release haven't I haven't I took one class at my bow shop on surprise release and I like it and I get it and frankly I feel like there's a lot less strain in the shoulder when you pull back because for a while I was getting like some of the shoulder like some of the brachialis issues from from pulling back why would it be different you know how when you do a lap hold down and if you grip thumbs off use more of the lats and if you grip thumbs on you use more the more of the biceps and forearm muscles right I felt like it was similar to that I felt like with the with the surprise release I was using more of my back and less of my forearm and biceps if there's something to that it doesn't make sense because the draw is exactly the same way the only difference is to release yeah yeah I felt a lot different the thing about archery is it's like martial arts in that if you learn the wrong way it's very difficult to unlearn mm-hmm like when I was teaching martial arts it was way better to get someone who is open-minded who had never had any martial arts experience versus someone who had many many years in a shitty martial art because those people had these deeply ingrained pathways that were whenever the shit we get weird or they would get uncomfortable or that gets nervous they would go back to their old technique yeah yeah it makes sense yeah with our treats it's very there's also a series of instructional that can show you about surprise releases that Jon Dudley's done put online and there's a guy named joel turner that has this whole dedicated thing to avoiding target panic in high-pressure situations he's got a website used to be called iron mine hunting but now he calls it shot IQ I think there's an iron mind people who sell the captains of crush handgrip strengtheners I think that's a hundred ninety seven pounds I don't know my I think mine might be like 150 I have two things I travel with one it was like those power lungs you breathe in and out of to strengthen the expert or inspiratory muscles in the diaphragm hmm and then a captain czuv crush and so if I'm on like a long road trip and I got to drive a long time I go back and forth between the hand grip strengthener and then the the long strength just like work out for like two hours while you're driving that's awesome that's amazing you put put on a good book and work the grip and work the lungs yeah I'm a big believer in those grip things I mean it just makes your hands so much stronger captain czuv crush I mean they don't fuck around those are really hard you combine that with the apnea so you pass out a few times you're blue in the face you can't even grip the steering wheel because your grips gone yeah well do short on time here but I feel like we could probably talk for about six days and you would never run out of things to talk about it's fun yeah how often you around here man we got to do this again [Music] what I do is when I travel like batch stuff here like I'm just like back to bed I got shot for documentaries yesterday and then you know talked the day before like I died batch a lot of meetings go home so I'll go I'll go out to Malibu tonight and then I'm gonna go to that human garage treatment on on the 31st because I've been following those guys online the human garage and it seems really fucking interested like I've had some people tell me like that's like cult ish right that yes because you go in there and you got to be like a member of their tribe and they but I have never I've never experienced anything like that and I'm not quite sure what people mean when they say that big profile you're famous Fitness no I might be they let you know but I enjoy it they like fill you full of like high-dose curcumin before you go in so your muscles just like melt and then they have like four massage therapists working on you at the same time and they taught me this how like if one's like rubbing your head in a clockwise direction but the other guy's mashing on your adductor with their elbow you don't feel the mashing on the adductor as much because like the the movement on your head is distracting you from that and then somebody else is working on your leg and they have like all these essential oils that they they fill the air with they're like special oils that that call you to relax and be a little bit more open to the deep tissue work and everybody there like goes through a special tree I mean I liked it so much I actually I flew one of their guys up to my house to work on me at my house they do me what is that that's it is that there yeah that's there that's there yeah exactly Gary and he he like put on the first time I was there he was like working on my back and he worked on my back by putting on a rubber glove and I actually have had that intra intra butt massage okay they work on it they know they work on your on your pelvic floor its pelvic floor therapy inside your gets tight just like anything else so they go through your asshole no I had a girl down in quite do it I was a Gabi Reese's trainer like she actually she does like dry needling intra but yeah and she also she had me by like this glass tool so I could do it myself so I go in through my butt and I do massage it sounds weird but I don't know the fuck putting glass in your asshole the you seen one of those faces of death videos isn't that like what are those my roommates in college used to rent those so horrible someone would die no there's a there's a video of a guy who stuck a bottle up his ass and the bottle breaks it's one of those no I stopped at THC suppositories and actually tissue devices yeah glass rods anyways the yeah the human guards they went in through my mouth to work on my back actually your mouth going through your mouth like like a big old rubber glove and they're like working on different areas you know how to like if you work on like your your infraspinatus or your Teri's minor in your shoulder it can actually get rid of pain on the front of your shoulder there are certain trigger points yes and it's very similar like there are certain trigger points on the head that refer to like the back or the so ass it's really interesting if this whole idea behind yeah Tasha and trigger points and now when you're working on one area it actually affects another area well I got Rolfing done a few times when I had some pretty bad back injuries and I found that to be pretty interesting yeah very painful yeah I I haven't had any Rolfing done that it from a giant dude to have I've ever had I've ever had ralphing I use a lot of those vibrating foam rollers and vibrating deep tissue devices though yeah one big time you're not going somewhere to get deep tissue yeah most of the time I do my own and I just started to begin to have a massage therapist come to my house once a week mmm because I think like there there's a certain amount of relaxation that you get when somebody else is working on you and you're laying down a table and I have like this this you've used like a biomat yeah a biomat like produces a bunch of heat so I lay down on the biomat and I put on my michael tyrell needs and diffuse essential oil and have her work on me for a couple hours usually I'll have her come over after dinner like around you know 7:30 8 o'clock and you know like after the family's kind of wrapped up and and she'll just work on me at night and I go to bed some really cool that's a sick techno hunt setup yeah it was a lot of fun too thank you very much appreciate it any two people can find you on your website or ever [Music] [Music] [Music]
