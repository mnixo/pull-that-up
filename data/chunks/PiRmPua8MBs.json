the Joe Rogan experience did you hear about the new electron are age of a cow tipping that's going on in San Francisco and stuff like that people are flipping those little baby electrodes smart card tipping yeah that's what Wow Matt if you went outside and you you're a girl and you weigh a hundred pounds yeah that's a dick move I also think I so I grew up in the suburbs I did not see a lot of cows I guess your time to time but like you can't even actually typical Columbus Ohio me and my friends did it twice you've done it was it like a calf was veal calves to just me so weak what happens is that when the cows and the cows are in the fields they they pretty much lock their legs and sleep standing a lot that's how I sleep and so you just go next time and push them and they just fall heavy no they they just tip right over I think out tipping sighs this was stuff that suburban kids like or that like urban lore because none of us ever hung out with cows yeah you ever want to go cow-tipping I'll take it they would really like that yet no they don't I wouldn't like it yeah believe it yeah me and to my friends okay and I want to see one of those where those night vision like the Paris Hilton videos I wanted to be one of those night vision videos of the cow all right do you have an Instagram I do it's it's my name just at Alexis Ohanian or Ohanyan okay that's another thing that's annoying about these things is that they insist on trying to change what you wrote like they're like my creative the ethnic yeah they're like it's like it personally it's just that they're their autocorrect is like really aggressive in goofy they're awake yeah well then good luck they're gonna kill you I see no house to look at these videos before you put them online bro seriously find something real you can do that right yeah you might thought you on mushrooms tripping balls off to the tip-cat cows but we never left the house man what are you talking about we were in the field you know remember I was there I was tipping cows yeah I bet if we Snopes tipping cows Snopes Snopes cow tip I feel I should have wrote my laptop also side note and I've been I've enjoyed your podcast I love how I love the real-time with the laptops I wish I wish every show basically had someone in real-time just calling out shit here we go out ready all right let's get this out of the way cow tipping at least as popular imagine does not exist drunk men do not on any regular basis needing the cow masters and put a hard shoulder - a cow taking a standing snooze dust tipping the poor animal over while in the history of the world there have surely been a few unlucky cows shoved to their side by boozed up morons we feel confident in saying that this happens at a rate roughly equivalent to the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series okay this is no gum gots nope cows cows like sit down in like on their legs and just sit there and you can go right up to them and tip them right over this is from modern farmer calm well I'm convinced article on cow tipping I've subscribed modern farmer for a decade now and I they have never led me astray YouTube the largest clearinghouse of human stupidity the world has ever known you can watch hours of kids taking the cinnamon challenge teens jumping off route to rooftops on the trampolines and the explosive results of fireworks set off indoors fails to deliver one single actual cow tipping video the one exception is a Russian dashcam video which shows a semi-truck full of cattle overturning but that's really you need to watch your house shaking themselves off and walking away house not giving a fuck yeah this is a spectacular - so this uh this article is called bullshit on you Brian when I was younger we would go to these farms in Plains plain city Ohio and they would have tons of cows and we would break into the cows smoke weed and there'd be cows that would break into the cows no break into the the fence and there would be cows that would sit there like on there like perched up like on their like legs like it's just sitting there sleeping we would come over just push him right over I don't know if that's the Calla tipping that you heard everybody doing like people saying that the cows tip over but that's what we used to do because that's what we thought you were supposed to do I don't understand what you just said this cows are standing upright because they stand up when they sleep right no not all the time there's cows that like like Nathan okay I thought cows always stood up horses always stand up right III have no idea I'm like my guts telling me horses are the ones your horses I think always stand up right yeah and if they're down they're hurt we have the Google yeah but I'm really scared of this cow tipping sorry we have brown cows that's how we roll the cow would be like that and you just push it yeah but there'd be tons of cows it'll be night at time when we'll be drunk and that's what we's well but exactly that seems to be cow tipping technically that's cow tipping they're just lying down cows so you're gonna send the email to Snopes saying well actually you're wrong well I am feeling the problem with calling bullshit if you didn't grow up in that environment you might truly believe that it is bullshit but then when I like Brian actually grew up there and actually pushed over some cows we take this to your fan base they would sit like this and then you just like set go over there and just push them over and they would roll over and wake up and freak out and it would be scary and you would run away now cow tipping what I think they're saying is not true is actually tipping over a cow it's Ling completely standing out well maybe that's what people have in their head but what it really is is what you're talking about that's when we did it we just did cuz we heard people did it and then we were like let's do it Brian Redman move I heard of the people are doing it and I'm like well they're still alive okay fuck it so then cow tipping is real I guess I would say oh yeah a cow rolling I'm gonna call it cal rolling yeah well then cow tipping as an account standing up and you pushing it over that doesn't exist but that's probably not what cow tipping ever was unless they do sleep standing up the cows sleep standing up yeah but do they also sleep standing up or should I say let me just say how much I appreciate you guys get into the bottom of this we should worst case how far away from some cows not that far we get to learn in an hour okay does a cow sleep standing common misconception that Kyle's don't lie down mmm why cows may doze off for a few minutes at a time while standing up they typically lie down to sleep or simply to rest okay I'm bullshit on the people calling bullshit I think Brian's right I think Brian is right he went cow tipping and that's how you really count him because what everybody says is that cows are sleeping and you go up and push them well obviously if that's not true if they only take a little nap standing up and usually they sleep on the bottom then their whole premise sucks because they don't understand what cow tipping is mmm cow tipping starts from the knees like jujitsu class like if you take wrestling class you start standing up for the most part a roomful of 50 dudes trying to double leg each other that shit gets really dangerous so jujitsu classes all start from the knees so real cow tipping like the idea of it doesn't exist because that's like wrestling style everybody starts from their feet but jujitsu style when you're already on the ground that's real this is great now whenever I Drive past a bunch of cows will be thinking about jujitsu that's what I do that's the vision it's my gift you should um you should totally that's enough to go fuck themselves up the craziest thing is the modern farmer incorporate or whatever how scary it was I just remembered is this no because I'd be scared we did I remember twice but we only remembers twice first I'm scared the fuck out of you and then you like listen I did it wrong yeah the reason why is because one of the we used to hang out this bridge where we would drink an underage and it was just like everyone would go to this bridge in the middle of nowhere and there was all these farms around it and that's why we'd go there cuz there was no police or no one could even know you were there so you got bonfires and all this shit like that so then after you got wasted every kind of move laid around in all the fields in one of the fields place cows and it was pitch black because it was in the middle of the country so it's just stars and you see shadows of cows and so you would like sneak up going up to these cows you didn't have cell phones for lights or anything like that so it was literally just lighters and shit and you just go up and just push it real fast and it will go and let you just run away and it was the scariest shit ever Wow and you'd be stoned already did you ever find mushrooms on those cow patties yeah but back then you just didn't think about that like I didn't get into mushrooms till I was in college well Duncan went to school in Asheville North Carolina and when I went up there I understand Duncan so much more after visiting Asheville because it's just a hippie mecca and they were getting sand there's apparently the mushroom flora or whatever it is the spores are so healthy up there this because it rains a lot and there's so many of them that they had to start giving the cows some sort of an anti fungal diet to kill the mushrooms because so many people are harvesting meanwhile probably makes the kids sick because a few mushrooms probably grow on at some poor poisoned psilocybin I mean you want to talk about missing the fucking point right poisoning cow shit so that the most beautiful thing that God ever created can't grow there you fucking dummies but he said that they would constantly go there and just pluck them off and just eat them they were everywhere and just trip balls the whole town is so psychedelic like partially because of that the whole town is like it's a Asheville North Carolina is it trippy fucking place I feel like I need to visit now you got a visit it's awesome it's really cool everybody's walking around like they have a main area where like bars and restaurants are and people just walking around like everybody's walking around it's like a small town that exists in a giant world but they're modern since it's a I fucked up I shouldn't have told you guys about it it's gonna row Nashville yeah but I kind of understand Duncan way more now after going to this town's like oh I see like you you were spawned in one of the most awesome environments on earth like this place is fucking sweet what what did they call it when they went out on an expedition I wonder this you wanna go Tippin no want to go like candy room harvesting and some kind of thing that's so dangerous because I remember even that's a kid just going up and eating berries because I was like oh look berries I Wow you know and then you find out those kids hundred years ago you would never survive huh there's no way you would have been dead before we was fire yeah fuck it was a honeysuckle shit like I used to eat a lot of look was that purple stuff where you pull it out just suck on it was nothing to do yeah so we just eat grass yeah I would eat a few things you know what I found out - tastes good actually is dandelions like dandelion greens huh makes salads at a dandelion greens my grandmother used to make them and I went over the house once and she had this dandelion salad I was like what is that and so the garden dandelions and they were like it's really good for you it's edible - my aunt my uncle tell me it was good for me I think it's were convinced me but then I found out that it's like a common vegetable that a lot of people he did you make me tea and my already makes you out of it I believe you can yeah but it's it's actually good like as a salad it's a good tasting green and pretty fucking good for you - hmm what's not to like I don't know how we got a dandelion business I know how we got out to the dead we've covered a lot of Grimm on this yeah I'm doing free eco friendly makes the world around my friend
