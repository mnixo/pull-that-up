hello freak bitches you should step back and this is a narrative that gets repeated over and over again in the social justice warrior culture this idea that you should just step back and let these others talk because they understand is long yeah and the others are always other group mates right and somehow their their discourse is to be privileged in reverse because hypothetically they're a member of an oppressed class right course and you can multiply the numbers of oppressed classes at nauseam which is another part of the problem yeah like the idea is that in giving them privilege because they have been marginalized you will balance things out you'll somehow another reverse this yeah yeah but and that's another example of the class-based guilt idea you know it's it doesn't seem to me self-evident that I'm to blame for slavery for example I mean being a Canadian it's a slightly different situation I suppose but the the idea that as the member as a member of a culture that you're somehow responsible for the past sins of that culture let's say it it's a very very anti Western ethos it goes along with this idea of class guilt because your group membership is the most important thing if your group at some point in the past did something reprehensible which of course every group has done that's for sure then you are de facto responsible in the present for that how do you think we got to this point where people are repeating these patterns that were ultimately incredibly unsuccessful and dangerous and deadly in the past like Marxism for example like people proudly proclaim themselves as having Marxist ideology one five one in five social scientists claims to be a Marxist kind of owner I understand the history what would once you fill people in on how that went bad well the estimates vary but in the Soviet Union between 1919 and 1959 somewhere between thirty and fifty million people were killed in internal repression alone so that's pretty bad and then and in China which was operating under exactly the same principles might have been up to a hundred million killed during Mao's time and of course Mao was still revered in China appallingly enough and Vietnam in Cambodia and wherever these ideas were implemented Cuba wherever these ideas were implemented the result was absolute mayhem absolute mayhem and I think what happened is that the Marxist ideas are actually quite attractive if you're an intellectual and if you're I would say if you're tilted towards compassion from a personality perspective because they're based on doctrines like from from each according to his ability to each according to his need and the idea that you should fulfill people's needs or that society should fulfill people's needs is on the surface of it an attractive idea of course the problem is who gets to define the needs and who gets to define the abilities and that really is a big problem and well and then those ideas were put into practice first in the Soviet Union and Alexander Solzhenitsyn who wrote the Gulag Archipelago did a very lovely job of detailing in in horrifying detail how those initial doctrines were transformed into legislation and then how those legislation was transformed into endless genocide essentially and almost destroyed the world let's not forget that partly with partly with the help of Castro who just died the the doctrines when when put into proxy in into into actual practice where murderous instantaneously now what happened there were always apologists for the left in the West especially in France especially among the French intellectuals especially in the late 1960s and then when all of the information about what was happening is in the Soviet Union came flooding forward and that culminated say in 19 Boat 1973 when Solzhenitsyn's book was published the French intellectuals changed their tune instead of agitating on a part of the working class which was which allied them with murderous Marxists they switched and and started to talk about power and and talk about a group identity it was like a sleight of hand the underlying pathological philosophy remained exactly the same but the surface nomenclature changed and that became very attractive and at the same time the Soviet Union dissolved and so one of the problems I think we have now a perverse problem is that these Marxist ideas are very attractive to compassionate intellectuals and we don't have good bad examples like the Soviet Union around that everybody can point to and go yeah yeah well that sounds good but you know what about the murderous death camps and the millions of people who are suffering we still have North Korea but you know people treat North Korea like it's a joke instead of like it's an exemplar of a pathological system and people have no historical memory like my students and that's partly because they're taught so badly in schools is they have no idea what happened in the Soviet Union they have absolutely no idea they know a little bit about the second world war maybe and of course people generally know about the Holocaust but they have no idea what happened in the Soviet Union so they have no idea where these ideas could lead and and as and the universities and the high schools are so full of people who are radically left-leaning that they're never taught any the students are never taught any proper history you know they're taught about the evils of capitalism and you know I mean it's not like it's not like any system is perfect but there's difference between imperfect and and consciously murderous I think one of the things that you just said that's very important is that it's attractive to compassionate intellectuals people that without really looking at what the potential for these these laws and regulations what the negative potential for them is that the the underlying inclination to lean towards that is that you you you care about people and then you you want people to be okay and yeah well you're kind of treating them like they're your children and and I don't mean that in an entirely sarcastic manner it's reasonable in some sense to treat other people like people that you love although it's not reasonable in in very many other ways which is why you don't invite every stranger on the street to come and live with you in your house I mean everybody puts up boundaries and you have to do that but and people tend more than we ever expected and I've done a lot of research and this in my lab people do tend to vote and think their temperament a lot more than than anyone really realizes and and if you're kind and that's your highest virtue then you tend to treat people like their kin because that's what kind means right it's it's an extension of the word and but that doesn't work well in large groups you need other principles and so you look at something like the idea of equity which is equality of outcome rather than equality of opportunity on the surface of it it seems perfectly reasonable to say well if every resource isn't distributed absolutely equally to every group then the system is unfair and on the face of it that's a reasonable proposition but it falls apart under minimal examination so here's something to think about for for everyone who thinks that equality of an outcome is a good idea it's like why the hell are you striving for anything then because the reason anyone strives to better themselves or to develop a skill or to move forward in life at all is to produce inequality you're trying to rise above the mediocre masses every time you make an effort at anything and so everything that we associate positive movement forward to your positive motivation is actually an attempt to render the world more unequal now you're rendering it on we equal in a just way right because we might say well if you work really hard you deserve an unequal outcome well yeah unless you want people to stop working hard and that was the old joke in the Soviet Union you know they pretend to pay us we pretend to work so it's so it's it's it's so thoughtless that that's that's the problem well it's also extremely annoying for people who've worked really hard and who've made the requisite sacrifices to become successful along some dimension to have that immediately attributed to their oppression yes and it's not it's not obvious that that's something we want to do it's like for the social justice warrior types out there who might be listening it's like do are you really willing to say that every single person who's accomplished something has done that as a consequence of oppression that's again with the Soviets claimed with regards to the to the successful peasants in the nineteen in the just before the 1920s it's like well the peasants weren't emancipated they were serfs until about thirty years before that they were serfs they were basically slaves and some of them had clambered up to the point where maybe they owned their Hut and a cow when could you don't employ someone well the Soviet claim was well that's all theft you got that all because you're an oppressor and so then the Soviet intellectuals went into the villages and just imagine how this happened so imagine a village a small town where everyone knows everybody and there's maybe 1020 people there who are moderately successful ok and so you can imagine that those 20 people have like a hundred enemies at the bottom of the socio-economic distribution useless horrible people who are jealous and resentful about the fact that these people have been successful ok so now the intellectuals come in and say property is theft success is oppression and then they looked for the people in the village who are willing to move against those 20 successful people while those guys at the bottom those hundred resentful jealous murderous people at the bottom they're just waiting for an opportunity to go kick down some doors and that's exactly what they did in the 1920s and as I said they wiped out all their productive peasants and then six million Ukrainians starved to death they had posters the Soviets produced posters in the 1930s that said essentially don't forget it's wrong to eat your children so whoa yeah whoa there's nothing about the Soviet there's nothing that you can imagine that's horrible enough so that it matched the reality of what happened in the Soviet Union between 1919 and 1959 and you know the West knew about this too early Malcolm Muggeridge in the 30s was documenting for England for the very English newspapers exactly what was going on in the Soviet Union bloody intellectuals didn't admit it to the mid-70s you know with the exception of people like George Orwell [Music]
