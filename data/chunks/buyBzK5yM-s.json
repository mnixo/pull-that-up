we got to figure out a way to make it so we just hold like a one button thing where everything syncs up with one button - it's a possible one day maybe we're live right now we're live live live how are you sir yeah I'm not too bad welcome thanks for coming man I appreciate it yeah no worries thanks so much for having Sam Harris gonna be with us but he flaked out last minute he's busy man he's a busy man so I'm interested to talk to you about a bunch of things but one of the big ones is this idea of effective altruism and this is something that you really promote to the point I don't know if this is true but I read this about you that everything that you make over $36,000 a year you donate yeah that's right so yeah so everything above technically it's everything above 20,000 pounds from 2009 Oxford so in just for inflation cost-of-living changes and stuff but that's about $36,000 so you've just sort of decided that which is by the way the 1% for the whole world yeah not quite not 2% yeah I'll be in the top still be in the top 2% even despite thought it was 34,000 I think 34,000 puts you in the top 1% I think it's $55,000 I was it changed maybe since Trump's been in office yeah that's right but it's a it's you know what you're doing is uh if that's really the case that's a that's a very charitable thing yeah and it's also I mean it's most of my income over the course of my life like especially as an academic you're not going to earn tons though since the effect of alters and blew up you end up getting things like speaking fees and writers that I give all that away as well well it's gonna end up probably being like the large majority of income over the course of my life do you ever like wanna buy something and be like shit if I wasn't so goddamn generous I'd be able to get this you know I never do and basically never think that yeah I think like this like I feel like in contemporary society we just get bombarded with marketing stuff all the time saying like oh you really need this thing if you're gonna have a good life and I think like an almost every case that's just not - I think the psychological evidence just shows that once you'll above a certain level of income additional money just has a very small impact on your happiness and in my own case like the things that make me happier like being surrounded by friends that's for a gym membership that's like 40 dollars a month or something it's not very much I can afford that being able to work and you know what I really am passionate about and I already have that so my life is are so good in so many ways and I feel like there's so much of a focus on money and how money is the key to happiness and it's just I think it's just all bullshit basically what's definitely some bullshit in it and I I see that a lot in my neighborhood because I live where white people go to breed and they they they go to breed and they they sit down and they just talk about things they talk about Range Rovers and certain watches and certain purses and shoes and it becomes as constant the amazing thing is just how you adapt know the hedonic treadmill the richer you are ever richer you need to be oh yeah so I was once part of a conversation I was going to give a talk and I was going to like a family and I was on the kind of that on a private jet in fact and the conversation was discussion of different private jets and which private jets are better than so on this other person has this really nice favorite jet it just means that like at no stage do you ever lose the like oh it could just have this nicer thing no because you can get to the point where you want a jumbo jet like one of those Qantas air buses and yeah like the house yeah yeah I mean I'm sure that one of those Richard Branson type characters probably has something like that yeah well it's it seems to get to this you you hit this critical mass stage where you you know like these billionaire characters where they start buying 100 million-dollar yards four hundred million dollar yachts and what is the most expensive yacht I believe it's a half a billion dollars or more yeah and you'd have a staff - oh yeah take care of it the whole time and if I ever the thing is I think if I had a yacht that would make my life worse because I might be stressing about this yacht like now it gets damaged like I feel bad that I'm not using it mmm yeah yeah I would imagine unless well I guess not though because if you can't look at this oh Jesus Christ it's a billion billion dollars the streets of Monaco is what it's called and it is 1 billion dollars go to that thing oh that's it oh my god it's a it's a neighborhood I think some floating neighborhood I think I know all of these things you should replace the cost with how many bed nets you could buy for children in sub-saharan Africa oh well that's just ridiculous hold on go up one did one say 1.2 billion scroll up estimated price oh my god the Eclipse Oh 450 million to 1.2 billion that's like when you go to get it made and you go like how much it's gonna cost me like between 450 million and one point two billion you're like ah you know normal money that is fucking insane look at that goddamn thing I mean it's the rats of replica of the Monaco Grand Prix track oh my god that's insane so you can drive around on your yacht at a ridiculous rate of speed so this guy probably has like a Ferrari they go bomb all over the surface of his crazy yacht okay but it's got a fake beach that it hasn't been sold yet oh oh interesting who buys that they're gonna get a lot of attention well there are enough people there's there's a bunch of those people yeah you mean I don't know how many point two billion that's probably there's only a couple of thousand people in the world they're worth that much really yeah Eve how many willing to sink the whole fortune how many billionaires do you think there are worldwide let's guess and a half thousand billion is three and a half thousand sound very confident I think it's about that yeah oh that's that's a large number that is kind of crazy three and a half thousand people that have more than one thousand million dollars yeah and there's no will McAskill I know thirty five thousand cuts it off then half that 1800 you're happy well no I'm just happy we've got a fact checker on ethics well that's a lot of money man but it is one of those weird things where I do not think that money equates to habits one of the things that money does do is it alleviates the stress of bills but of those stress of bills can be alleviated by not buying as many things right it's like a lot of the stress of bills that people have is sort of self-imposed stress like you get a mortgage for a very large house you have car payments you have all these different things you're paying for so that kind of money stress that some people put themselves under is actually not really necessary right absolutely so if you broke it down to what do you actually need just need a nice place to live where it's not crime ridden and it's safe well you need a bed what else do you had food yeah you need food exercise you one of those no TV dudes do you know well I watch you know Netflix all right just finished veep which I love is it good yeah again matter the first seasons aren't so good don't have that kind of patience yeah acting not so good seasons oh yeah I just get addicted even if I watch something and I think it's awful I still just I will get addicted right away to watch all of it yeah I've liked the most compulsive personnel have you seen house of cards I've not seen a deliberately not stuff that's a good show yeah that's a good show like Dean yeah like Game of Thrones makes my life worse I like hate it really I think it's amazing television but I find it too so distressing because it'll have to watch it all the time why do you find it distressing just like you know the violence yeah the violence people's getting the heads popped and stone oh that's rough yeah I'm I'm gives me a lot of anxiety because I know there's only two seasons left and the next season this one coming up is only seven episodes and the final season there's only six I'm so happy about that it's like it's not making me happy will I'm not very happy about that at all it's like someone saying they're gonna stop selling heroin I'm gonna have to get a hooked on oxycontin that's what I feel it's I just I'm gonna have to watch the whole season all over again or the whole series so you have a television you have a computer I'm sure yeah yeah I like moving around a ton so I normally like I don't have a house but it wouldn't be convenient to have a house because I'm traveling so much to rent an apartment or something you have an apartment you live in England I live in Oxford most of the time I spend a quite a chunk of my time out in the Bay Area like significant part of our staff and the nonprofits out there I've got lots of contacts without that so most of your time you it seems like you're spending working for charitable organizations or yeah so I have kind of three hats so one is an academic so I'm professor Oxford's second is this comb or public figure where I'm talking about these ideas through books or on this podcast and so on and then third is I run a nonprofit called the center for the fact of altruism which is more about like finding the best charities the ones that doing the most goods going to help other people the most and sign up promote them and try and get people to give more and to give more effectively yeah we've gone over ineffective charities or oceans ineffective but charities that are the way they're structured when you look at how much money is actually going towards the charity itself and how much is going towards the structure of the organization it's kind of crazy yeah I mean I think so that's normally the focus of in effective charities is on like yeah how much you spent on overheads right but I actually think that's not the most important thing the most important thing is what's the charity actually doing like what's the actual program so one charity for example that I'm sure like you'll find funny is the charity called homeopaths Without Borders and it goes to Haiti in particular and distributes like homeopathic remedies you know which don't work they don't provide any health benefit and even if it had a 0% overhead cost so apps like spent nothing everyone's volunteers it would still be bad charity you still shouldn't be giving to that charity right well there is one I didn't know that that one existed yeah yeah it's kind of small but thankfully homeopathy Without Borders but then there's some super effective charities like you know program that's you know saving a life with everything a half thousand dollars like the against malaria foundation even if they were spending a bunch on you know investigating what the best areas to focus on or like paying their staff more if what you should just care about is how much money you're putting in and what you getting is an outcome right well I think it's impossible for everyone to it's impossible for you to give ten dollars and all ten dollars is gonna go directly to the charity because there's got to be overhead there's got to be infrastructure there's got to be a bunch of people working there rent this is theirs costs but the question is like at what point does it become kind of a scam because there are most certainly some organizations that appear to be charitable organizations but a really kind of a scam yeah there's definitely some so like the kids wish network for example kind of like the make-a-wish Foundation similar idea and they spent 99 percent of their budget on fund raising so they would just like this kind of charitable Ponzi scheme basically so they spend all their money on fund raising itself yeah to then invest in more fund raising and 1% somehow or another gets out there yeah what does that maybe it's not as high as 99 percent it was above 90 bit something crazy so what what does that money get to like what do they do with the actual money itself and then the idea behind that was granting wishes for Sick Children mm-hmm so do you remember the San Francisco thing with batkid it was like a bit like there was a big event lots of publicity around it batkid a child that had some strange disorder yeah so the child I don't know the details I think the child had leukemia their wish was they wanted to be Batman for the day okay there's a different thing yeah okay cool so they like the make-a-wish Foundation set up this you know amazing story where they gotta kind of drive in a Batmobile and like have this a fantastic day with their basically Batman for the day kids knit which network is doing basically the same thing they find seriously sick kids often terminally ill kids say what one thing would you want and we'll make it happen hmm but I think the but there is a lot of focus on like particularly bad charities you know the ones that just really come up to a completely dysfunctional I think that's not actually the most important message what's most important is just even among the charities that are kind of good even the ones that are making a difference there's still a vast difference in the impact you have difference of hundreds of thousands of times between the charities that are merely good and there's ones that are really the very best and that's primarily dependent on what program are they focusing on hmm so what is there any charity that people should avoid spending their money on like are there other charities that you feel like are just so ridiculously ineffective like yeah I mean like the ones we mentioned of kids wish network or homeopathy Without Borders the homeopathic our porridge is ridiculous like voodoo on parade just stop yeah I mean there's another one I can't remember if it does stralla G without limits and solitude without limits no it does um dolphin therapy for autistic children which has no evidence of working but does actually just have some like risk of the children drowning oh yeah so you can like cherry-pick these examples but the thing is that these aren't just like not really about the sensitive in general I think charity's doing good but the question is just like in the same way as if you're buying a product for yourself you don't just want to get like you know a laptop as long as it's works you want to find like what's the best laptop I can get with my money right or if you're investing you want to not just get like an okay of a turn you want to see well what's the best of the turn I can get right so in that sense I think like the number of charities that you think just yeah this is really competing for being the most effective charity in the world that's actually very small so give well for examples evaluator looks all sorts of different global health and global development charities and its list of charities looks like yeah this is just super good you should really be donating to them it's only 7 charities long at the moment - up the last year when it was only for charity for Wow seven charities out of ham I mean what is the overall total of active charities it's gotta be in the thousands hundreds of thousands yeah I'm sure what got you involved in this so you're a young guy you seem like you should be playing video games and you know skateboarding or something I spend a lot of my teenage years playing video games yeah yeah it was again compulsive personality yeah I need to ban myself from doing it so your compulsive personality is now going towards good thing went yeah I managed the key was managing my life so that the things I get really focused on addicted addicted to good things rather than bad so yeah it all started back in so I was back in high school kind of undergraduate of being very convinced by the arguments of this philosopher Peter Singer oh I know Peter Singer he's like a radical animal rights activist yes he has a yeah he has a few things and he had this argument is that you know the way I tell the story is imagine someone walks is walking past a shallow pond and they see a child drowning in that shallow pond and they could run in and they could save the child but they're wearing a really nice suit a suit that costs like over three thousand dollars and so they say no I'm not gonna save that child I'm just gonna walk by and let it fan because I don't want to lose the cost of this suit and normally say look in model philosophy we have a technical term for people like that they called assholes uh-huh and they're this is how I convey it in my same verse and obviously we all agree like yeah come on if it's just you could clearly save this child that's right in front of you you know you ought to do that the cost of $3,000 does not count but then what Peter singers insight is he says well what's the difference between that child that's right there in front of you and that child that's in sub-saharan Africa who you could save you'll never meet them for sure but you could still save their life with just a few thousand dollars if you donate it to a really effective nonprofit and he considers all different ways in which these cases might be dis analogous but decides ultimately like no there's actually just no morally relevant difference and so yeah we do just have an obligation to give away at least a very significant proportion of our income and I was really convinced by this kind of on an intellectual level for many years but I never really did anything about it and not until I went to Oxford to do a postgraduate degree in philosophy and in the summer between there I needed some money I worked as a fund raiser for Kiev International a global development charity so as one of those annoying people in the street who had kind of pesty like to thank getting your way and then ask you to donate ten dollars a month and it meant that all day every day I was talking about like look this is the conditions of people in poverty we can do so much to help people at such low cost to ourselves you know why are we not doing this and I was just over and over the game kind of getting these apathetic responses and I was just getting so frustrated because I just thought look these people's is not living up to their own values people clearly Duclair care but the some sort of block going on and then I thought well I'm going to do philosophy and at the time I was planning to do like philosophy of language logic very esoteric stuff and so I thought well I'm not living up to my own values I should really try and make a change and so I went to Oxford and I started asking a whole bunch of different kind of academics well what's the impact of your work what kind of a difference have you made and normally they were like I'm not really in it to make an impact and just kind of interested in these ideas and I was bit disheartening but I kept persisting until I met another postgraduate student called Toby ort and he just blew me away because he had also been convinced by these ideas but he'd gone one step further and he'd said yep I've made a commitment to give away almost all of my income of the course of my life at million pounds at the time he was living on nine thousand pounds saving two thousand pounds and donating two thousand pounds he was like really hard core the thing as well as like actually taking these ideas and putting into practice what really blew me away was just how positive he was and he was it was not that he was kind of wearing his hair shirt fragile ating instead he was saying look this is an amazing way to live we have this amazing opportunity to do a huge amount of good to help so many other people thousands of people was actually a very low cost to ourselves and me having that one person who also kind of shared my worldview shared my ambitions just meant kind of gave that little psychological block was lifted and it meant that I was like okay cool I'm on board first I can a committed 10% then I was like no actually I think I can do this further pledge and then that meant I had this question of while I'm planning to give awake and like million pounds over the course of my life where should that money go you know I want to make sure it has as big an impact as possible and that meant I started digging into well how can we compare that between different charities I found there was a ton of work from health and development economics that could help us to answer this and what began is this kind of side project between these two you know ivory tower of academics me and Toby we found that loads of people just really taken by this idea both of giving more but in particular of giving more effectively and over time the can a global movement called effective altruism start to form around these ideas and start to broaden in a couple of ways so one is little and away from just charitable donations to also thinking about well what should I think about with respect to my personal consumption what should I think about with respect to my career if I'm really aiming to do as much good as possible what should I do and then secondly also starting to think about cause areas other than just global poverty as well and it tends to be the case that within the community at the moment the cause areas that people think are the very most pressing our global health and development still for sure but then also factory farming where again there's such a vast amount of suffering which is completely unnecessary and then also preservation of the long-run future of humanity and worrying about risks of you know global catastrophe things that may be fairly unlikely but would be very very bad and if they did happen especially relating to new technology like you know novel pathogens sort of viruses you could design a more lab and so on well you were also very concerned with AI as well right artificial intelligence yeah that's exactly right and that's I think in this category of if you look at the history of human progress technological change just creates these huge step changes and just how humanity progresses so it was only 12 years in 1990 1933 to then 1945 between Leo szilard's first coming up with the idea of the nuclear chain reaction and that was just a purely conceptual idea in a bit of paper 12 years from that then the deployment of the first nuclear bomb and think how radical a change that is having suddenly being a nuclear age that was only 12 years yeah we went over the the invention of the airplane to dropping an atomic bomb out of the airplane I believe it was 50 years right yeah more in the neighborhood of 50 years yeah isn't that take a few yeah so technological progress can suddenly go in these huge leaps that were not prepared for the well often very not prepared for and I think artificial intelligence is in this category you where we're really making a radical progress on our in AI especially over the last five years it's really one of the fastest developing technologies I think and yet has huge potential in so many different ways and as with any new technology huge positive potential really if you get AI right you can solve almost any other problem but also potential risks as well where there's risk that might be more familiar you know what is about automation unemployment and what is about autonomous weapons which I think should be taken seriously and then also just worries about well what if we could really do manage to make human level artificial intelligence it's very good argument that would then quickly move to super human level artificial intelligence and what then are we now in a situation like the Neanderthals versus Homo sapiens where we've suddenly created this intelligence that is greater than our own I'll be able to control that are we able to ensure that transition is positive rather than negative have you ever considered the possibility when you look at all the impoverished people in the world all the cruelty all the people that were so just concerned with material possessions and shallow thinking and war and just the evil that men do is it possible that we are sort of an outdated concept than what we are as these biological organisms that are still slaves to the whole Darwinian evolutionary survival of the fittest natural selection sort of paradigm that we've operated under for all these many thousands and hundreds of thousands of years as humans is it possible that we're giving birth to the next thing that just like we don't long for the days when we used to be monkeys throwing shit at each other from the trees one day we will be something different whether it would be a combination of us and these machines or whether we're going to augment our own intelligence with some sort of artificial whether it's some sort of an EXO brain or something that's going to take us to the or it's going to be simply that we create artificial artificial intelligence no longer has use for us because we're illogical and then that becomes the new life-form yeah then we're law hide in the cave somewhere hoping the terminators don't get us yeah I mean I think like over the long term I mean with all of these things the question of kind of timelines is very hard and sometimes people want to reject this sort of discussion because oh this is so far in the future whereas I think like if something sufficiently important we should be talking about it even if maybe it's you know decades of generations hence I mean it might not be that far away but who knows like with the atomic bomb that was hugely fast progress just you know 12 years so we want to be prepared but then has four like yeah is it gonna be homosapiens around for the next you know in the thousand years time i think that would just be extremely unlikely that will be around you think we're not gonna be around anymore yeah I mean I think if intelligent creatures are still around it's gonna be some in a thousand years time it's gonna be something that's not Homo sapiens like you said there's kind of free oh it's like not what we would consult consider kind of typical humans now well we're obviously severely flawed right I mean if we like if you ask people if you ask the average person do you think that in your lifetime you can imagine a world without war most people say no like the vast majority of people say no the war a world without crime a world without violence a world without theft most people say no that's that just shows you how inherently flawed most people view the human species you know we know that we can do it in small groups mm-hm you know like if the three of us were on an island I'm pretty sure we wouldn't be stealing from each other and murdering each other right yeah it's just a few of us but when you get to large-scale humanity comes very easy to disassociate or create this diffusion of responsibility where there's you know enough people so you don't really value them as much and you're allowed to get away with some pretty heinous stuff especially when you consider drone warfare things that were able to do long distance where we're not seeing the person that we're having the effect on yeah it's it's a very flawed thing the human species wouldn't it be better if something better came along I mean I think this yeah sorta yeah I think that I though not well we'd be obsolete yeah I mean well we're we're gonna be obsolete in a hundred years anyway I mean as in we'll be dead right so what the question is just we'll all kind of you know generations hence well you know it's not the questions not really about us it's about our grandchildren list what really forces the idea to be considered like what is valuable about life like is it the experience is it happiness is it shared fun is it love like what is what's valuable about being a person and how much of that is going to change if we're made out of something that people have created or or maybe we're made out of something artificial intelligence has created because we've created something that's far superior to us so yeah I mean I have a view and this as you might expect yeah I mean in my view the thing that's valuable and the only thing out that's valuable ultimately is conscious experience so that's good positive like red conscious experience is happy happiness joy and so on that's positive that's good for the world how negative conscious experience is suffering pain distress those are bad for the world and so that's why you know it's a good thing for me to do some service to you to benefit you but I can't do anything good to benefit this bottle of water right and so then the key question in terms of what should we think about supposing is the case that you know thousand years time it's now synthetic life it's artificial intelligence or something that's the people like the in charge and they're no longer any humans would this be good or bad the question for me is you know are they having conscious experiences and others conscious experiences good or bad so that's it just conscious experience yeah so it's a customer so selfish it's a controversial view there's a thought experiment which is often used to challenge this view do you want to hear that yes so it's called the experience machine and the idea is supposing that tomorrow you could plug into this machine it's like the most amazing you could ever have and in this machine you will live let's say you live 200 years and you'll be in the most amazing bliss you'll have the most amazing experiences of you know and your experiences will involve incredible relationships incredible creative achievement and so on and it'll just be like the perfect life that you could live experientially for the next 200 years and the question is insofar as you are self-interested so put aside considerations you might have about wanting to make the world a better place but just insofar as you care about yourself would you plug into this thing bearing in mind that in a certain sense all of these experiences are going to be fake you're going to have experiences of having amazing friendships wearing great works of art and you think the works of art and so on but they're they're not going to be real it's just sensory inputs provided by a computer right so the question is would you or ought you insofar as you're self-interested plug into this machine what would you answer it's a very good question I might already be plugged into it right I mean you know so this is this is a great question right and I think it's a good argument against is the question well supposing you were already plugged in would you unplug supposing I told you that actually you're a banker than Monaco and fuck Monaco I just I'm not interested in that no I want to stay right here yeah so I stay plugged in please do I have to pay more what have to do you would have to do nothing but it's interesting man if people think so most people and it seemed like maybe yourself would intuitively you'd say no I wouldn't plug into this machine I don't know if I would say that I would have to really deeply consider because right now it's just so it's so abstract this idea that that could be possible so it's it's fantasy we're having fun but when you talk to the leading minds when it comes to virtual reality or artificial reality or simulation theory you know when they start talking about what will be possible one day they're gonna without a doubt within a hundred years or five hundred years or whatever the numbers they're going to be able to create an artificial reality that's indiscernible from this reality you're gonna be able to feel things there's going to be emotions that come to you you're going they're going to be able to recreate every single aspect of an everyday life it's just a matter of time I mean they're really close now and not not really close in terms of like they don't give you emotions and they don't give you feeling but if you put on an HTC vive and go through some of those virtual reality games I mean it's bizarre how real it feels yeah and when you go back to like playing pong did you ever play pong yeah you know it's such a weird thing that that happened inside about when I was a kid pong came along we were blown away we couldn't believe that we could actually do something on the television you could see it move it was so fantastic and if you gave that to one of my kids they'd spit on it they'd be like what kind of pizza shit video game is this like they would think it's just so ridiculous but to me at the time it was amazing you go from that to one of these HTC vive games which is all taking place within on my lifetime and you go well a lifetime from now if you follow the exponential increase in the ability the technological innovation it's gonna be spectacular it's gonna be absolutely so when that does happen how will you be able to know if it's indiscernible how will you know if you're in it and how do you know if you're not in it right now that's the real question right yeah I mean there's actually some arguments for thinking you know this is Nick Bostrom a colleague of mine a simulation argument for thinking we are in a situation right now in fact it's very likely that we should be yeah by that I actually I'm kind of agnostic I think you should take that the hypothesis seriously but I think the the argument doesn't quite go through for what's attractive and what's not attractive about that there you his version of it yeah so the argument is the frame and if you could yeah yeah yeah so his argument is the in the future supposing we believe that the human race doesn't go extinct or post humans don't go extinct over the next few thousand years and secondly the people in the future have an in first in recreating their past just for kind of historical interest or for learning they're going to be interest in running sync because they're now gonna have huge amazing computer power they're going to be able to create simulations of the past that they're going to have some interest in running simulations of the past well the number of if that is true than the number of simulations that these future people are going to be running will vastly outnumber the number of actual timelines the kind of base universe as it were so for the one a real universe where history kind of unfolds there's also let's call it you know ten thousand simulations of that universe and if that's true then it's the case that well given that I'm just you know these things there we are indiscernible for the people who are inside them is overwhelmingly likely just in the base layer that I'm gonna be in a simulation rather than in the real world and what Nick Bostrom says actually is not that we definitely are in a simulation but he just points out the conflict between these three kind of beliefs that we would seem to hold one is that we're not gonna go extinct in near future two is that you know people in the future will have some interest in simulating the past and thirdly that we're not living in a simulation and he himself gives you know a reasonable degree of belief maybe he thinks it's like ten percent likely fifteen percent likely that within a simulation are the people who understand the argument very a bit more but I think you know it's something you should at least be taking seriously the reason I reject it is kind of even weirder I think it's somewhat technical but the basic thought is just um according to like the best guesses from cosmologists were actually in an infinite universe the universe is infinitely big now we can't effect an infinitely big universe where it was selected by the speed of light to what we can effect unto what we can see but the best idea according to the best deal of universities kind of keeps on going but if so then there's already like an infinite number of observers of people kind of in that bottom universe and that means that you've now got kind of an infinite number of people kind of experiencing things and then you've got the simulations and you've got like ten thousand simulations but you can't say there's ten thousand net times as many simulated beings as there are real beings because there's already an infinite number of real beings yes okay constant no no no go ahead keep going but that means if you've got so the key of the opossums argument was that you've got ten thousand times as many simulated beings as you have real-like non-simulated beings so problem is is an infinite number of real beings because the universe is infinite yeah that's right and so if you've already got an infinite number of real beings the fact that you've got 10,000 times infinite that's still infinite right you can't it's kind of a case where like our best methods of assigning degrees of belief to things kind of run out if you think it's you know there's an infinite number of simulated beings an infinite number of real beings then what's the chance of you being one of the other I mean I'd like we don't actually have the like tools to be able to answer that Neil deGrasse Tyson was trying to explain this to me a couple of weeks ago that there are infinities that are bigger than other infinities yeah so that's also the case but yeah that was my world my brain again so the number but the key we're all talking about the lowest was called cardinality the smallest infinity mm-hmm which is the size of the infinity of all the integers 1 2 3 4 counting numbers and if you take that size of infinity and multiply it by 10,000 let's say you just get the same number which is infinity right and then what Neil was saying was yeah oh he's even bigger levels of infinity so if you look at not just all the counting numbers but all of the numbers you can make fractions out of 1/2 1/4 1/8 and so on that's a bigger that's just more numbers than the infinity of the counting numbers I've spent a lot of time trying to understand why human beings are so obsessed with innovation why human beings are so obsessed with technological progress and one of the things that I continue to come to is that we think of everything in this world as being natural but the behavior of butterflies and wolves and the way rivers run down from the mountain but we don't think of ourselves in our own behavior as natural we don't think of our own thirst for conquests and innovation and and the even materialism I think materialism is probably a very natural reaction to our need to somehow or another fuel innovation and that one of the ways to ensure that innovation is constantly fueled is that people are constantly obsessed with buying new things constantly obsessed with the latest and greatest which fuels innovation and when you look at the universe itself and you look at all the various things that we know to be natural processes in the universe like that in order to make a human being star has to explode when you literally are made out of Stardust and just when you run that by people for the first time they go wait what like in order to eat you free to have carbon-based life form that has to be created inside a burning dying star and that's the only way you make this thing like what you are right now and then that thing makes artificial reality and then that thing makes perhaps even crazier makes I mean if you follow the ideas of technological progress if something gets to a point where it's indiscernible from reality how do you know it's not a new reality how do you know it's not a new kind of reality like Jamie sent me hip to these artificial worlds that people have created it online where they're essentially infinite and they're constantly changing and morphing and growing and the games are terrible people don't like them because you go you go to places and there's fucking nothing there yeah yeah and you can go to an infinite number of these places and there's nothing there like these adventures are non-existent so you're on these you're in these gigantic fake worlds where you're traveling from place to place but right now we're looking at it in a very two-dimensional way you're looking at in our flatscreen one day it's not going to be two-dimensional one day it's going to be something that you are interfacing with your consciousness is interfacing with it is it only real if we can take it and drop it on something if we can hit it with a hammer if we could put it on a scale if we could use a measuring stick and measuring is it only real there or is it real if it follows every single check like if you check off every single item on the list of conscious reality and conscious experience yeah I think that's a great question because I think the dichotomy that a lot of people think in terms of natural non natural I think it's just meaningless I mean people firstly think this is natural this is not I mean in a sense everything we're doing is natural because we like Homo sapiens that part of a natural process and in another maybe in another sense everything we're doing is not natural but then why does that matter what's the moral relevance of something being natural versus not natural right lots of stuff that happens in the natural world is just really awful huge amounts of cannibalism they might like yeah murder shuffling so it's not clear why we would care about something being that other than unnatural but then the second question is yeah let's consider this virtual reality again this experience machine that you could plug yourself into and as part of the description I said oh none of this would be real you'd have all of these interactions with people that you think are friends and so on but that wouldn't be real and I think you could very well push back on that and say why should something be physically instantiated like in order for that to count as a real experience right why is it not the case that in this virtual reality you're interacting with algorithms but that's just as much at least it's possible for that to be just as much friendship as if you're interacting with people who are you know flesh-and-blood and I think it's hard to explain kind of what difference would be because you know if you think about Star Trek you've drawn Luc Picard it can be blends with data and Android he's not kind of bio biological but you know we think that you can still have kind of moral worth and friendships and so on with creatures that are not made of kind of human biology in which case why does the fact that something merely lives on silicon why wouldn't that was kind of seemingly merely software why does that mean you couldn't have kind of a genuine friendship with that thing if ax and a sufficiently sophisticated way perhaps isn't there also an issue with our incredibly limited ability to view reality itself because we're only viewing the dimensions that are relevant to us in this current state of carbon-based life form it's Kurt this this talking monkey cling to the spaceship flying through the universe this is this is what's important to us but when you pay attention to those the dudes who write on yellow legal pads and they get into quantum physics and they have all those crazy equations that nobody but them understands maybe you do I look at that shit I go what the fuck are they writing but they believe I mean what is the current model they believe there's at least 11 dimensions that perhaps could be more what if there is a dimension that you can plug into that it's purely consciousness driven meaning there's no physical experience there's no touching the ground there's no gravity but you exist in a conscious state and it's perpetual like if you take a rocket ship and it gets past our gravity and shoots off into distant space and you have a clear shot of you know 14 billion years back to the beginning of the universe itself with nothing in the way you're just gonna keep going for 14 billion light years you're just gonna keep going like what if there is a place that your consciousness can go to like that where it can't it's no longer burdened by biology by the timeline of birth to death by the limitations of the flesh but consciousness itself can exist in some bizarre dimension that we just have an access to mm-hm so yeah I mean I think consciousness is probably just ultimately a physical process why do you think that in ultimately because of conservation of energy the reason being so you know this is oh yeah age-old philosophical debate between the monists and duelists people who think is consciousness just ultimately some sort of physical process or is it something special so Descartes thought there was this pineal gland there's a little bit of your brain and your conscious kind of soul was just kind of steering you're like monkey body through this pineal gland but the question is just for why that I think the strongest argument about why that couldn't be right is it seems to be like it would have to be creating energy out of nowhere and we've never it seems to be just fixed law of the universe that that just can't happen because in order for you know this conscious mind - if it's not merely a physical process if it's not just the brain in order for it to be able to affect what this physical entity is doing it would have to use energy to be able to do that so the energy would have to be coming from somewhere and if it's not coming from just the physical realm then suddenly we got this counter example to all the rest of science sort of but are you aware of the theories of human neurotransmitters being pathways to other dimensions like dimethyltryptamine do you know about all that I mean I know about DMT do you know do sin the pineal gland where Descartes thought that all that stuff was going on the seat of the soul with the Egyptians called the Eye of Horus the reason why the Catholics and so many ancient religions were so focused on pinecones and their their art and their their imagery that's the pineal gland that that's the the image of it that's what it's supposed to represent and for people have had these intense transformative psychedelic experiences by consuming exogenous dimethyltryptamine which is produced by the brain that you have these insane transformative experiences where you feel like you are traveling to other dimensions yeah so I think I mean I do want to say like have you done any of that I've never done the MT Oh son of a bitch why not what are you doing wasting your time I know I am such a good boy but but it's something that's in the brain I mean it's a natural product of human biology I mean whether its natural or not isn't the question just you know if I'm gonna have a career based on my brain I want to be very careful to to not break it no break it you know yeah but it's one of the most transient drugs ever observed in the body about it brings it back to baseline in like 15 minutes mmm okay is that because I mean there's a lot of I do think there's like tons of people very often greatly overestimate the risk so non-legal drugs like MDMA is like super safe and so on very overestimate the list the risks of everything yeah MDMA yeah yeah EMA is weird right that's a weird one it's it's not a natural drug dimethyltryptamine I think the real concern would be psychological because what you face is so bizarre turns for credit and I kind of had the best quote about it I think he said that you would risk death by astonishment hmm yeah okay to the thing well it's so bizarre that it's almost a sin for a guy as smart as you did not experience it but will you just come right back in your you even when you're there you're there maybe it's you it's not like you your consciousness dissolves into some bizarre quasi living State and then you have to like work your way back to being you again you know your you your will McCaskill in the dimension whatever the fuck it is but what's crazy about it is that this is produced in the very area where Descartes was believing the seat of the soul is and so many different Eastern religions and all this psychological like all these different all these different religions and all these different cultures they were all convinced that that one gland had some massive significance in terms of the spirit in the soul whatever that means whatever the spirit means so yeah so then the question is just in these experiences is it the case that you're like seeing into genuinely seeing into another dimension right or is it the case that you just have a new kind of perspective on consciousness so one thing I do think is that in terms of conscious experience is the sort of conscious experiences that have access to and I think that must just be point zero zero one percent of the entire landscape of possible conscious experiences hmm so if you think imagine if you are a bat and you could echolocate mmm that's just a radically different conscious experience I don't think that maps onto any sort of conscious experience that humans could have have you seen people do that you know the people young people can do that it's pretty amazing that is it is amazing to shockingly effectively uh yeah I think you're absolutely right I mean but there's also experiences human experiences that are available without drugs that some people have achieved through radical states of meditation and Kundalini Yoga where they could achieve natural psychedelic states holotropic breathing people that have done that if experience like really radical psychological transformations and incredible psychedelic experiences from that as well yeah and so I think like these sorts of experiences are very important very interesting and what they're you know I said that maybe we experiences point zero one percent of all possible conscious experiences and that just allows you to do like see a little bit more of this potential vast landscape whereas I think but I think there's nothing unmagical about saying ultimately that's all explained in terms of physics in terms of different sorts of new lands filing and different amount of transmitters and so on we don't need to say oh and it's also this other thing which Blake's all the known laws of physics that you're seeing into some other dimension in order for that to be an incredibly important thing in order to unscientific to say we know almost nothing about consciousness in terms of the areas of scientific inquiry we have no understanding at all about the relationship between conscious experiences and you know what we would think of as physical processes we really have no idea about you know if you take give me any sufficiently complicated physical processes which are which are conscious and which are not all we can go on is Lelia this well I'm conscious and so I know that things that kind of like me are probably conscious too and that's the best we've got really and this is known as a hard problem of consciousness and philosophers often say that we've solved it with something and I think it's always begging the question I think we should be very open to the fact that just as in you know 3000 BC people had no idea about the laws of physics this was just completely unexplored territory we should think contemporary science this is just a big like big black gap in a scientific understanding and perhaps it's something maybe 21st century science maybe 22nd century science can really get to grips with yeah it does seem like the ultimate question like what is it for why is it here what controls it is it in the mind is it external is the brain just an antenna that tunes into consciousness yeah the the dimethyltryptamine question is so bizarre because it's the most potent psychedelic drug known to man and your brain makes it yeah what's it for I don't know if this is a myth but I've heard it's what gets made when you die yeah the they believe that during high rates of stress for your body believes you're gonna die and when you're dreaming when you're in heavy REM sleep your body produces larger amounts of it then instead and then baseline but they don't know it's it's really difficult they've only just now within the last few years the Cottonwood Research Foundation which dr. Rick Strassman has a big part of it he's the guy who wrote the book DMT the spirit molecule he did a bunch of the first fda-approved drug trials with civilians where they took people and they gave them a Schedule one drug dimethyltryptamine which is so crazy that it's a Schedule one drug that your body produces but they gave it to people intravenously over the course of several months and they documented all the different trips and all the different the different commonalities that these people had in their experiences and he's working very closely with the Cottonwood Research Foundation and one of the things that they found is that they've recently discovered there was just anecdotal evidence that it was produced by the pineal gland we knew that DMT was produced by the liver and but now they know for sure because they've isolated it in rats so in living rats they know that they produce DMT with the pineal gland so that that explains a lot of you know ancient Eastern mysticism and all the some symbology this all these symbols that people had to represent this this gland now they know okay well this gland definitely does produce this incredibly potent psychedelic drug but now the cross the question is at what levels during what periods of stress like how do you have to bring someone to the point of death before they experience this and if that is the case is it possible that consciousness itself is something that we you know since we haven't really figured out what exactly it is is it possible that consciousness can travel through this chemical pathway that maybe these intense dimethyltryptamine experiences are in fact a gateway to what people have assumed exists from the beginning of time like an afterlife or a sea of souls or something some some stage of existence other than this physical existence that we all experience right now yeah so I mean I feel like I'd be like crazy talk right it sounds like they see I mean I think I'd just be surprised if consciousness was just this one chemical I think it's much more likely that something it's this emergent phenomenon from this incredibly complex system of you know billions of different neurons firing in a certain way and when you have a certain process that's sufficiently complex in the right way somehow and this is just this big black box that we've got no idea about somehow subjective experience comes out of that but it would seem I mean otherwise the issue is you could have just DMT traveling and just a test tube or something and petri dish and it would seem like oh is this petri dish conscious that would seem really strange why would that be the case if you're breathing air and you're you know the air keeps you alive like you're breathing in and bringing that you don't think that air carries the life with it to another place right air is just a component of life that's something that your body requires yeah so I mean it's possible maybe it's the case so again I feel I'd be surprised if it was like this chemical is NASA for consciousness in some way I'm not saying it's necessary but what I am curious as to how consciousness varies you know consciousness consciousness and you you the actual feeling of being alive varies depending upon your health depending upon stress levels depending upon love and happiness and all these different factors change the way you view the world which is really interesting because in effect that changes consciousness and you can be more you know you can be more elevated like you can i've guarantee you all this effective altruism that you're concentrating on is somehow another elevating your consciousness because you're putting out so much love and so much happiness and you're helping so many people there's so many positive benefits to your very existence i've got to manage i've got to believe rather that somehow another that manages to come back to you i mean it definitely comes back to me in kind of how I feel about my life I mean when we were talking about how you know money is just not the key to a happy life the questions well what is and the answers are having a great community having a greater purpose in life I'm feeling like you're making a difference so all of these reasons are why so we built up this kind of community around effective altruism you know people all around the world who are making a significant change so for example donating 10% of the income um to the charities they think are most effective or pursuing a career that we think is really effective and one thing I wasn't surprising from the outset but I'm so happy happened is that the strong community is formed it's kind of like a little global village or something and people have found that actually far from being a sacrifice as you might have expected this is actually incredibly rewarding because you've now got this community of people who have shared aims to you and you're all working towards this greater goal mmm-hmm and that's something that Hank is very lacking in the world today lo so many people just they work 9:00 to 5:00 and you know they have a nice time on the weekend but they're like where is all of this going and of my life am I really gonna think yeah I made the most of this whereas if you think at the end of your life like yep I dedicated my life to helping others and I had this transformative impact on thousands of people you're not gonna think at the end of your life gee I really wasted that right is there something I don't think you can look at if you go deep though down the philosophical rabbit hole and you really consider that life is this temporary experience and even benefiting someone through this temporary experience is still a temporary experience it's like you are helping some you gave them a pillow for the ride and it's a temporary ride the ride comes to an end and then what and then what is the point of all this like what is the point of effective altruism if you're just helping people during this temporary ride it doesn't seem to mean anything yeah so I think there's two things I think your loads just raise up I just freaked myself out well we do get freaked out at this well you know when you think of existential and yeah so angst of existence so I think this too I think it's two answers here okay the first is that the right is the like goal right ultimately again if you think the purpose of life is to increase the amount of happiness and reduce the amount of suffering the final goal is good experiences and the kind of anti goal as bad experiences so when we're sitting here talking having a great time this is us kind of achieving this is getting points on the wind counter so at a time that's like yeah if we were really hating this then we'd be losing well even more so because we're broadcasting this live and millions of people are gonna hear it yeah and hopes about having hopefully about enjoying hopefully and maybe if they're not at least there's a little stress relief like maybe they're at the gym and I go these fucking idiots yeah and they're doing squats and they're getting angry yeah so I think that's the first thing but then the second thing is relates to this idea of cosmic significance where what often motivates you say oh well we're just along for a ride we're all gonna get eaten up by the Sun eventually and so on what's the kind of greater purpose of life but I actually think there are some ways that our actions now can have much greater cosmic significance and that's if that's because I think if you think that the human race survives for the next few centuries it seems kind of inevitable look we're going to spread to the Stars and I think that would be good again from this perspective you can go into more arguments if you want of just saying what we want to do is promote happiness and reduce suffering if that means we can live on other planets as well and have kind of fiving civilizations they're not only where the people are having great lives but also making scientific artistic contributions and so on then that's a good thing to do as well well there's no technological reason for thinking that we won't be able to do that in the future given currently to technological progress unless something really bad happens along the way and this kind of gets back to one of the things we talked about right at the start was one of the focus areas of the effect valtor's and community is on connecting reduce risks from of human extinction of global catastrophic risks these are the sorts of things that could imperil the human journey as it were and I think that if you're working to mitigate some of these things then you're increasing the chance that we do get to the sort of level where you yeah humanity can have a fighting future not just on this planet but on other planets as well and that actually means your actions really do have this huge cosmic significance so the conscious effort to be a kind person a generous person and effective altruism spreads and it impacts people there's this ripple effect and your good deeds could perhaps fuel enough people with this thought and with effective altruism and more people might act on that to the point where we reduce the amount of suffering to the point where we extend the lifespan of human beings we extend the areas where we have no war we reduce the amount of violence to the point where we can successfully innovate to the point where we can get off this planet that's not and then start from scratch with a new dictator on Mars Donald Trump on Mars how about that yeah I mean so I think that Booton on mars happy with fascinating if we'd have to go to war with mars do you think though i mean i've wondered about this many many times I wonder if it's an outdated idea this idea of traveling to the stars and again I go back to this whole interdimensional thing that I wonder if that's the reason why we have never been visited by other planets by species from another planet maybe that's not what happens maybe they develop artificial realities I may be like what Jamie was talking about to me with these artificial computer realities like if if someone develops some sort of matrix like world where you can plug into it an experience an infinite number of things and in an infinite number of artificially created dimensions that are indistinguishable from this why would you want to like risk a six-month trip in a metal tube to another planet maybe that's really retro maybe that's a really ancient way of looking at things maybe it's like Zeppelin's like big flying balloons instead of you know so yeah the question you've raised is called the Fermi paradox right which is just given the somme to a hundred billion stars in our galaxy eight billion galaxies in the effect of all universe 100 billion in the observable universe the universe is also pretty old fifteen billion years old so if it was the case that life is very common that it's very easy for us to life to then developed a level of advanced technological ability we should expect to see evidence of aliens all over the brains but yet we see absolutely none and that means that from somewhere from a habitable planet somewhere along the path from habitable planet to a spacefaring civilization there must be some big filter there must be some step that's just incredibly hard for that or incredibly unlikely other civilization moves them all life moves in that step to another and one hypothesis is this yeah like people just civilization gets to a sufficiently advanced level and they just chill out they just or they go internally yeah they go internal the issue of that explanation I think is just not long enough because you know you'd have to think that that's for this kind of filter to work has to be a really schlong filter filter yeah as in like because there's so many stars so many mm-hmm so many seemingly habitable planets right it has to be the case that it's exceptionally unlikely at some stage of other like not just really unlikely as in like you know one in a trillion unlikely to on this path from habitable planet space failing civilization and so you'd have to think like other trillion civilizations that get to this level of technological ability they all choose to turn inward and that seems just very unlikely it seems like well at least one would really transferred out and if so then we'd see evidence of that because cosmically speaking the time for them getting to the level of technological capability where you can spread to the stars and the level where we'd be able to see a real evidence of that is kind of small so I actually think that a reason that we can't see aliens is because the very first stages of life are incredibly unlikely the move from nothing to can a basic replication and then secondly the move from single-celled organisms to multi-celled organisms and the reason for thinking this is very unlikely is it took an incredibly long time on earth billions of years before this happened and in particular in the move from single cell to multi-celled life that's only ever happened once and so given that we don't see any aliens we should think some part of this was really hard our best guess is that that that moved them single cell to multi-celled and perhaps from the creation of the first cells as well that was incredibly difficult and that means that we're just exceptionally lucky to be alive as it were but if the universe is infinite that means that this has happened an infinite number of times that's right though it might be very far away public like sufficiently far away that we are not connected to eat like we can't contact each other observe each other but there's an infinite number of those infinitely far places yes so they would be sucked there would be some like clusters of the universe and again the idea of the universe is in fact only a hypothesis and I'm just deferring to other people who say it's their leading well the most puzzling hypothesis to me was the evidence of supermassive black holes being at the center of every galaxy and that the hypothesis was that the supermassive black holes are exactly one-half of 1% of the mass the entire galaxy and then if you go through those supermassive black holes you may in fact go into a completely new universe filled with hundreds of billions of galaxies each with supermassive black holes at the center of those galaxies which will take you to hundreds of billions of galaxies in another universe and that it's in never-ending and that's what the real infinity is it's not just the mass of all the things that we can observe in the 14 plus billion light years that we know of from the Big Bang to today it's all of those things being portals to incredibly different totally new universes okay yes as titles all the way down Turtles all the way down so the the real question to me and this I had as the proposes to Brian Cox I didn't get a sufficient answer it's why would we assume that there's someone more advanced than us like it is possible that someone some species some thing is the tip of the spear that some thing is the first that something is the most advanced life-form in the universe why would we assume that someone would be more advanced than us if we are the most advanced thing that we can find the only logic that I could point to was that that we are relatively young in terms of the history and the age of the universe itself the universe itself being roughly fourteen billion years old we are 4.6 what are we what is what is the age of the earth yeah but somewhere in somewhere in the neighborhood right relatively young when you consider that ten billion years of life give or take happen or existence happened before we came along but why would we assume that there's anything out there that's more advanced and why would we assume that this isn't as far as anybody's ever gotten I mean it's so you know in terms of infinity right 14 billion years seems like a long time but in terms of infinity it's a blank so I think we should believe that in the and again let's now just ditch the infinity and just think about the observable universe which is finite because people pulled over sweating in their car right now yeah yeah infinity have you ever heard of claims none but this is no total degradation of km's number and I don't believe so we got known as the largest number ever seriously used in the mathematical proof and Tim Rubin of wait book why has this amazing post trying to explain just how big claims number is and you have to use a special notation in order to be able to explain it and numbers just get really big and once you really start to think this through you're just like you're left just kind of walking back ya know like just tum tana peaked out yeah for our trillion is just a speck of dust brighter even a trillion years is a speck of dust when you consider the possibility of the universe itself being infinite or the possibility that is a continuous cycle of big bangs - expansion - contraction back to an infinitely small point back to another Big Bang which is a plausible possibility yeah I mean I think yeah I'm also I'm very well you know I'm not I'm not Neil deGrasse Tyson I'm butch think tons of the science I think my understanding at the moment is that we currently think that the universe is just expanding and it just keeps expanding from right I know it's definitely a leading theory that it was gonna expand and slow and then kind of come on yes but you mentioned humans being the most advanced kind of creature I think that probably is correct in the observable you oh it's certainly our galaxy let's say you know well we know it is in our solar system right yeah that's right but I think we know it is in our galaxy as we think so and again these so far but the thing is that it's far as in it's like a hundred thousand light years but I'm thinking about but when you're thinking about 15 billion years of the age of the universe that's actually just a very short period of Brian but why would you assume that a hundred thousand light years from now there's not something exactly like us so it's possible but the thing is that if it was somewhat easy or if it was just not incredibly difficult for intelligent life to evolve then it would have happened in the past already and we would see evidence of it and the fact that we don't see any evidence at all of intelligent life another solar systems or and like at all suggest it's incredibly difficult for that to happen but isn't that like being in the woods and unzipping your tent and sticking your head out and saying I don't see anything this must be empty woods um it's more like I mean you're you're talking about a very small area that you've observed and we've taken account of so I think it's more like because I think if an alien civilization or us in the future goes to kind of start yeah spreading to the stars in the course of you know just a few seconds million years let's say mm-hmm there will be really significant evidence you'd see Dyson spheres being constructed around Suns you know to harness the sun's energy you'd see some evidence of like galactic engineering project and so on it would be like a really big impact he could see that with hundreds of thousands of light years between us and the observable objects but again the hundred thousand light years is just not very long compared to the kind of 15 billion so it would just be this amazing coincidence if it's the case that he had life that's as advanced or more advanced than us has evolved just the same time as us where hundred thousand years give or take is basically just the same time but hasn't evolved in the pad hasn't involved more than a million years ago where we would start to see kind of major impacts of that so if something within the observable universe we've observed so little we don't even have really adequate photographs of anything outside of our solar system I mean everything is just radio spectrum you know these the analysis is that they're getting off of light waves of what the components of the atmosphere is and so using your analogy what I'm suggesting is that if it was the case that alien life was like not intelligent life was not that hard to come by you'd stick your head out with ten and you look like Tokyo I've often looking like the woods but why does it have to look like Tokyo why can't it look like Kansas why can't it be like really spread out and very little life because I think if life is letting out then it's just gonna want to what does life do it justifies to harness resources and tries to grow more of itself maybe it reaches a point where it realizes that's futile and just concentrates on effective altruism at home that's anistar that's the turning inward suggestion again and so maybe it's the case that like yeah like is it more important to get your shit together at home or to go all over the world with the same bullshit ideas right I think that's the case would not be the same thing you could turn towards interstellar travel like wouldn't it be more important for these communities to concentrate on taking care of their planet and figuring out a way to work in some sort of harmonious fashion with the very nature of the planet itself rather than travel to the Stars I mean possibly but now imagine there's so on this alien alien planet there's ten billion aliens and they're like let's say they're 1,000 years more advanced than humans are at the moment in order for this argument to work it'd have to be good case that every single one of them makes that decision to just turn inwards and focus on the case because not all those people would be the ones that would innovate in the first place wouldn't have to be everyone that makes a decision would have to be everyone of a high enough consciousness to figure out how to make these interstellar machines decides not to harness this nuclear power and jet off into space but I think over time that will just that would just be everyone really is well yeah I mean just technological progress just keeps going and eventually like tape mean obviously we're doing this like weird thought experiment right speculating on like economics and sociology of hypothetical alien world but I mean just at some point as that as a civilization progresses then there's going to be many many actors with sufficient power so it's sort of liability to spread to the stars you need to say that every single one of them decides to turn inwards so it's sort of like technology becomes very rare and then ultimately over time becomes very common like the cellphone right so when if cellphone was first invented it was extremely rare and very expensive now everyone has one and the capabilities of those cell phones have greatly greatly improved yeah and that this will happen with everything including space travel yeah I mean it also it doesn't need to be the case that gets out to 10 billion people even if it was just like a thousand people or something again it would just seem unlikely that you know in every civilization and every one just has you know even just a thousand people everyone chooses not what single person thinks hey we just want there to be more like right spread out now that obviously is dependent upon there being a more advanced civilization than human beings on planet Earth because if there weren't if there were a few years behind us like if there are the stuck in the 1950s or maybe they're stuck in ancient Greece or you know then then obviously they don't have the capabilities yet we might be the very most advanced we might be the very tip of the spear right yeah and I just think yeah because I think it would be unlikely that something more advanced happened just a little bit faster than us but not say 100 million years ago which is not very long ago right in cosmic terms but it's still possible I mean it's still possible that something happened 100 years quicker than us or that they haven't had the same setbacks that we've had in terms of like asteroid impacts and natural catastrophe super volcanoes and the like yeah it's a it's a real weird thought experiment because you start thinking and you start extrapolating okay but where are we gonna be you know where are we gonna be and why would we do that like that's one things that always gets me about this whole trip to Mars and I have a joke about it in my my last comedy special where people were somebody actually said this to me like because it was before California it solved its drought or mother nature solve our drought for us rather people like a man we should really consider going to Mars because I mean look at our environment California's almost out of water and my joke was like we're right next to the fucking ocean like there's so much water you can't see the end of it we have a salt problem we know have a water problem like what are you gonna do you gonna bring water to Mars like that's a stupidest thing I've ever heard of my wife yeah this is weird when people start talking about Mars I mean I think so there's a project of going to Mars saying foreign laws sang up a colony right now like the aim of doing that because it's awesome totally on ban with that from the same way is like going to the moon it's like look what we can achieve this is an exciting like global human project or even just a Space Shuttle going into orbit it's pretty badass right yeah exactly exactly but then this talk of like oh well we need this in order to be able to survive as a species and like look if you want to have this kind of refuge or colony in order to make the earth more robust Mars is just not a great place to pick whereas so many different ways that I mean Mars is like really on her inhospitable and if you wanted to build a refuge why not go under the sea mmm that's like gonna be protected from you know viruses or asteroid impacts now really though if one of those big things that slammed into the Yucatan slams into where your villages and the sea I mean if you if you had this underwater village with you know 10 years of food supplies and so on then you could like come back because the impact from the asteroid wasn't just like shook everyone artists that the sky is gone the skies get clouded over with that the earth rang for a million years Oh what is that as Italy impact yeah that's so interesting that's so insane yeah when you think about how big that thing was that killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago and there's hundreds of thousands of those things floating around Jase so yeah I was asking some people at NASA just just two days ago actually on how many of them we've managed to identify because they're serious about kind of scanning the skies yeah the mall um and the answer I thought we had it covered I thought this was something than this I was like yeah yeah we know we're all there like earth killers are and they never sponsors like no we've got no idea we just we don't know how many of them are out there and so we don't know how many we've managed to track there's a guy named Randall Carlson and I've had him on podcast a few times and he's obsessed with the idea that asteroid impacts were probably what ended the Ice Age you know 10 to 12,000 years ago and and he there's a significant amount of physical evidence that points to this both in evidence of impact and nuclear glass try think it's called try tonight I forget out the exact word but it appears all throughout Europe and Asia and around that same timeline around 10,000 and 12,000 years ago when they do core samples and it points to this idea that there were significant impacts from asteroid objects all over Europe and all over Asia around that time they think some of them slammed into the ice caps that were you know North America was covered in a giant chunk of it was covered in as much as two miles high of ice just 10,000 years ago and he points to an incredible amount of physical change in the environment that looks like it took place over a very short period of time like catastrophic change over incredibly short met amount of time that he believes points to these impacts melting the ice caps creating massive amount of flooding killing off who knows how many people resetting civilization in many different parts of the world and this evidence of these of the new clear glass of these micro diamonds that also exists they find them during nuclear test sites when they blow off bombs and they also find them at asteroid impact sites and you know when you know that we have been hit many times in the past and they do have evidence of that and then you see the moon and all the different impact craters on the moon you know that this is just what he calls a cosmic shooting gallery essentially he's like it's very likely that that was the cause of the end of the ice age there's a lot of there's climate data that sort of seems to point to that as well okay so this so this is now like really I'll send you some links to some of his stuff because he's been obsessed with this for about 30 years okay because the fascinating guy the two things that would really surprise me about that firstly just that you know there were so many ice ages and it was seem to be this it comes on goes oh sure you know the you know fairly dynamic predictable process where there's asteroid impact super random mmm-hmm he wouldn't expect to have this kind of back-and-forth dynamic if it was passed away that was doing it and then secondly my understanding would be that asteroids would cool the planet because asteroid hits ash just spreads out all over the sky that just blocks out sunlight hmm so it would surprise me if it had this kind of warming effect well I think the idea is that first of all when it hits it the impact is massive and it melts off just a huge chunk of the amount of water that is covering North America right and that's one of the things that causes this massive flooding and massive changing of the topography and as far as like what causes the net I don't know if it it interrupts it temporarily and then it comes back and gets warmer but they have that natural cycle of warming and cooling has been going on since they I mean from as far back as they can measure it what he's talking about is significant quick changes also the extinction event that killed somewhere around 65 percent or more of all of the large mammals in North America really quickly like woolly mammoths really quickly sometimes really they don't know about that that's there's a lot of speculation back and forth about that because they think that humans did it but then they found these mass dead sites where they're not consumed and this was the ones that he showed where these willy mammoths they found them where they had their legs were broken and it looked like they just the impact of something had knocked them flat and they had found like thousands of them and these mass death sites I think but I thought so firstly it just seemed to me like the homo the idea that it was humans killing the mold it seems like crazy oh no I thought it just like like such a good expert but they didn't even have speed they had addle addle oh but that was like the best weapon they had at the time they weren't even riding on horseback at the time but then with respect to the death sights I thought the mechanism for killing a wooly mammoths is you just got like 200 humans and you just chase the wooly mammoths off a cliff that does work if you can get a near cliff but the idea of getting them all near cliffs and killing them all off by a bunch of people that hadn't figured out the wheel seems a little unlikely it's just it's possible because that's the thing like we often tell these stories about you know police civilization humans is like oh and then they might create it amazing this great journey to Europe and so on and often that's like if they moved a mile of the brain so it's like fake journeys actually just yes yes very gradual similarly if you've got this gravesite hundreds of woolly mammoths in this one place that might be over thousands of years I mean again this is just something no that's the thing they're talking about carbon dating that they're all it's all like within the same time period you'd have to like really go over his stuff with a fine-tooth comb and talk to him about it because I'm not the right guy I just I just listen to him and go whoa and then you know try to relay it as much as possible there's a podcast that I actually retweeted today because somebody brought it up on YouTube it's available so I'll send you to it afterwards to see if you what do you think about it but but this is something yeah but if you know the book sapiens know you're like the fifth person to talk about it I've got to get everyone talks about safety and savings is like the book yeah closer to you because difference in this town um but yeah one of the things that most blew my mind there was yeah how much megafauna there was in the early days of homo sapiens you know about moving across North America there were two-ton sloths mmm Jayant sloths and is one of just very very many massive megafauna that we just don't have anymore yeah the Blitzkrieg hypothesis is what they call the human animal killing off all the other animals it's a really troubling hypothesis because we don't want to think that we're capable of doing that but obviously we do do that I mean we're doing it right now we get into the Buffalo I mean we almost we brought the Bison Toto yeah we're doing it just Tasmanian tiger there's a lot of different animals that we in our lifetime of gone extinct I mean we're actually like in terms of extinctions I'm not sure if we'll get the number right but it would be pretty accurate to describe this is the fourth and makes tension with mass extinction because yeah huge the number of species that have gone extinct as a result of human activity and it's also one of those things where we don't think of it as being significant because it happens slowly over the course of many years but if you look at it on timeline you like oh my god look everything's dying right now yeah exactly so it's slow by human standards very quick by nature illogical standards yeah it's a fascinating subject the end of the Ice Age happening so quickly the animals dying off so quickly and so many large mammals dying off so quickly so when you think about what we know people have done like when we almost killed off the Bison they we know why they did that we know how they did that and they did it with extraordinary weapons and they did it with high-powered rifles they could shoot things from a far distance they did it by shooting off trains I mean they did a lot of crazy shit back then so we understand meaning and there's a lot of physical evidence you there's photographs of the actual piles of bones and all that crazy shit but when you when you take away those physical capabilities the extraordinary physical capabilities like even riding on horseback there's a guy named Dan Flores who's a fascinating guy's a scholar who believes that even without the Europeans coming over here and market hunting and killing off all the Bison he thinks just the firearm and the horse with the Native Americans it's entirely possible that they were gonna eradicate the Bison on their own I mean again it just depends about time scales so even if you're just killing like slightly more of the species like killing just enough of the species that they're now below the you know two children for every two rights viability stage yeah exactly then just over sufficient time yeah and remembering that Homo sapiens between the hunter-gatherer Age was one hundred ninety thousand years it's very long time spans again very short geologically but yeah a very long time span so again just a little you don't have to be killing that many wooly mammoths to divide them to extinction over the course of several thousand years what are your thoughts when it comes to like the ethical reintroduction of animals that have gone extinct like there are some people in Russia that are constant they're currently rather working on some form of a woolly mammoth we're gonna take woolly mammoth DNA from some of these frozen bodies that they've got I mean they've gotten some pretty intact woolly mammoths now and they're going to try to clone one yeah so um I don't know the details of how this will work I guess they have to just state it in an elephant but I mean I think it's like scientifically interesting I don't think there's anything wrong with it but whatever thing I don't think Ingham and where you have woolly mammoths everywhere yeah I mean I think I don't think there's any ethical imperative to do it I think there's not imperative not like I would think just if there's more William amis that's the same as they're just being more elephants and it might be of scientific interest I heard while went on like hypotheses that we heard were like oh that's cool but sound ridiculous yeah I heard the idea was reintroducing woolly mammoths - like stomped down snow in order to prevent yes prevent global warming we can slow it down somehow or another yeah there's definitely things sort of thinking that people say over dinner but yeah the idea was just stomp down snow but also to eat the foliage yeah there was like some exfoliating thing that they're doing where they would eat consume so many trees and so many plants that it would actually lower the temperature of the earth what in the fuck yeah it just seems that you're skeptical of that but I mean there is this philosophical question of whether you should so the question of biodiversity loss which has been huge how do you value that so is it the case that loss of a species you can just cash that out in terms of impacts on individuals because obviously it's bad for the animals that died in the course of that we may be like have a loss of kind of information that we can just not get back but is there something intrinsically bad about just having fewer species hmm and a lot of people seem to act just act in a way that suggests they seem to believe yes but it's hard I think it's hard philosophically to cash that out I think it's hard to explain like why would we care so much about losing species where we don't seem to care about having you know deliberately of and amaizing bleeding and so on that we get more species it seems like we're only just conservative about like not losing them but if it really is a value to have greater diversity of species why do we not actively try and promote a greater amount of biodiversity rather than merely preventing loss of biodiversity the I think the reintroducing the reintroduction of species it also like if you have an environment that's stable have you have some sort of an ecosystem that's stable and then you reintroduce a predator or prey or some animal that's gonna eat up all the foliage it's you you're running this big risk and you're taking these big chances that you can sort of predict the future you could look at a plus B well that's gonna equal C but it doesn't always work that way and there's been disastrous result results when they've introduced species to other environments where they're not native like you know what's going on with like places like Australia yes Australia it's kind of hilarious in that regard yeah so the Institute of Abbott no they introduced a type of frog to actually I'm gonna butcher this as well but they introduced type of frog to a failure it took over so they introduced rabbits to try and eat these frogs or something to eat the frogs and then they took over and didn't kill the frogs and I think the more than they use foxes to try to kill the rabbits and they killed all the ground nesting birds and they introduced cats to kill the foxes and I mean the immigrants to kill the rabbits that's like that fact like order turning to do species well especially back then yeah you know when they were doing this in the 1800's in Australia they really didn't know what the fuck they were doing their thinking short term right in front of them and they also brought in a bunch of animals that don't have natural predators so they have to gun them down from the fucking sky I mean they have these all these deer and stags and all these magic beasts I mean if you ever seen a stag they're incredible they roar they sound like a lion and they have so many of them in Australia and particularly in New Zealand but they don't have any natural predators zero no predators yeah so they have to fly over in helicopters and gun them down yeah yeah it's just like and they leave them you just leave them to rot they just have too many of them yeah it's the same with kangaroos as well yeah yeah cuz I've seen those herds of kangaroos you ever seen that no oh my god there's a video that some guy took and somewhere in Australia and it is thousands and thousands of kangaroos running across this field and it looks like a clock but like some apocalypse some apocalyptic kangaroo invasion see if you can find that Jamie the video just because it's worth seeing to like to realize like oh this is what can happen when there's no predators like animals just get completely out of control yeah so I'm vegetarian and have been for a long time now but with some other vegetarian friends we had the conversation of yeah what would be the most ethical meat to eat and I think we can concluded that kangaroo would be the most ethical because it's being killed anyway because they just need it like you've got this population explosion it's on land that wouldn't be otherwise used for anything you know they're roaming free they've got pretty good lives the environmental impact is therefore going to be no lower non-existent as well obviously it can give you meat is very unusual and almost all of those the guards it's not though yeah I mean if it's very nutritious apparently kangaroos is actually a type of deer believe it or not yeah I don't believe that I thought soupy which is a totally different it is but it's related to the deer in some strip look at these fuckers just hanging out this is not the one I'm talking about though there's a bunch of them running across a field this is just a large population of kangaroo yeah you know there's something we lay in the deer family in some strange way see if Jamie could find that to do you know that we have Wallabies in Scotland yeah I know yeah in an island called inch Konica yeah I visited them a number of times and were they introduced to Scotland yeah so lady Aven Cahoon had that bitch yeah well no need for that she so she I'd actually don't know but she owned she owned the island she owned a zoo on the island like a personal zoo and she died I think the route the zoo went to back in everyone so it just kind of was a while please just got out and there's and the Wallabies took over yeah the first evidence because people wouldn't likely visit this was they would find these dead wallaby carcasses on the mainland and that was during the winter the law Scottish for Lake would freeze over and the Wallabies would hop on the ice Wow and get hit by a car but they're now very tame it was a shame because I first found out about them back when it was still a bit of a secret well that's fascinating now it's become a bit of a tourist hotspot Wow says they're kangaroos are marsupials and more closely related to possums than deer okay so they're not related to deer and then correct yeah mmm someone had told me that they were in some way in the deer family or cousins of deer or something like that said earlier you explorers said that they were just that's what their descriptions were they were like deers without antlers and they stood upright like men but I saw so I mean it's a queue or a question so I didn't find like an official scientist saying here's the siding on it but uh yeah that's what hmm I wish I had this my whole life someone who could just follow me around and connect to me every time they say something about this is amazing time somebody put something up on Instagram today and it was a quote from the 1800s about an ancient philosopher or an ancient scholar rather would give his life for the information that's available to the common schoolboy today and this is from a quote from 1888 Wow which is nothing now compared to what we can do yeah I think there was another statistic and again it's unclear how do you measure this but in terms of written information at least one newspaper has more of it an information in it than you know a typical person in the seventeen hundreds would be exposed to for the entire life I wonder what what was the natural predator of kangaroos because kangaroos are they're a native animal to Australia and if they didn't do you know there was a giant predator in New Zealand at least at one point time it was called the haast eagle and it was an enormous eagle the biggest eagle they think that ever lived and had something like a 10-foot wingspan and they believe that even hunted people a huge huge eagle and it's a part of the I guess it's the Maori it's a part of their ancient mythology and they found out that it was actually a real animal that was somewhere around the 1400s was made extinct through hunting my understanding was in Australia before humans invaded crocodiles my understand was there was just no major predators for that's the cat has manian Tigers the thylacine yeah they call that thing the Tasmanian Tiger that died during human like modern tops it's a crazy-looking picture look at its face look at that mouth on that thing Jesus Christ but that I believe those things died off in the days I just typed us in here so that it's nowt stink but the dingo is probably the more when did it die thylacine is now extinct however humans arrived in Australia at least fifty thousand years ago and introduced the dingo about five thousand years ago mmm-hmm so maybe those things were eating tank kangaroos a big part of kangaroos I guess would probably be catching them when they're not what they're young but they carry their young inside their body in that pouch which makes them different from any other kind of animal that would be prey because they can take care of their their young and bounce away quickly well this is why so in terms of large mammals humans killed every single type of large mammal other than kangaroos in Australia I think they were kind of hundreds of different types originally there's a bunch of different things other than kangaroos yeah yeah yeah like one again I don't know maybe giant koalas let's see mm-hmm but yeah an apparent my understanding was the reason for that was because they didn't have natural predators and so they just didn't know what to do with you yeah so let me examine you know have all of these like defensive mechanisms right then also have wolves and coyotes and bears and all those different things that are chasing them down that's interesting that the concept of what's the most ethical thing to eat I would think you would think it would be like mollusks okay so that's it yeah so I do think it's totally fine to eat and if well what I say is I don't eat anything with a brain mm-hm so that means that oysters mussels clams they are okay yeah so I got convinced I didn't used to be like this I got convinced by an advocate for it's called bivalve veganism mm-hmm I mean it's not doesn't make a big difference I don't really like these things they eat them occasionally but you don't like like mussels no really yeah have you ever had linguine with muscles like at a good Italian restaurant with a nice red sauce yeah I mean eat so when they're good they're fine and when about the really bad well that's in that case with everything no something's okay when they're good they can grouse hamburgers I mean you can get down the line you know you could rotten food no but like you know good pizza is just amazing pizza Oh like like I feel like might the very best mussels I'm like mad towards really yeah oh man you need to go to a really good Italian restaurant yeah I ever had linguini with clams do you like clams so again I just feel I feel being different about them Oh crazy you just need to go to a really good restaurant you guys reading in England man that's the problem yeah they don't know how to make Italian food there yeah that's I mean there's a few people right now they're screaming in England I'm a good Italian so you son of a bitch I'm generalizing and I'm aware I mean ignorant in saying that yeah but I can't defend English cuisine oh great having been out to New York San Francisco yeah well London has some amazing restaurants now London does you know I mean but it was always the the generalized stereotypical knock was that the food in England was terrible yeah the first time I went there was pretty bad it's often still but yeah with respect to what's the most ethical meat I think it is a really interesting question because I think you know the debate and vegetarianism and so on it's normally phase of this either/or thing like not doing anything or just go vegetarian or vegan but I was interested in this question of just yeah well supposing you only want to go halfway or of the different foodstuffs like what are the what are the ones that gonna do the most in terms of animal welfare if you cut them out because most people when they go halfway to being vegetarian they might cut out red meat throwing up beef and so on and I actually think that's if you care at least about the animal welfare side of things I think that's just long and I think there's two reasons for that one is one it's the spectre the amount of suffering that the animal has in the course of its life where the way that chickens are currently treated if you look at this average and again we're talking about most chickens though you're talking about factory farming farms and conditions which is well over 90% things like 99% for chickens though eaten are in these conditions their lives just I think they're the worst off creatures in the planet basically and cows I think often don't have great lives it's just nothing really compared to chickens and I think pork are similar like pigs also have really terrible lives well as large of animals cows sheep just in general aren't being at litres badly and then the second question is how many animals are you affecting where if you consume a steak or something that's like a thousandth of a cow on average well as you can easily eat kind of half a chicken and that's a factor that people normally don't consider as well and obviously maybe you value a cow's life later the chickens life or something we do in some strange way yes a hierarchy yeah we have almost inherently or at least we do in the Western world yeah I think it's really hard to know like this is one of the hardest philosophical question I've thought about for ages and I've eventually given up on is you've got an unhappy cow a day and unhappy chicken day which is which is worse how do you wait those two you can't or an unhappy fish people have very few feelings about fish yeah I mean you see a dead fish people don't feel the same way they feel if you see a dead lamb yeah but in general like become more sympathetic I think there's a bias where you know we tend to sympathize more with things that look like us right fish have these weird you know look kind of look they don't take care of their young - that smells appreciation cute yeah and so over time I've definitely become a lot more sympathetic to taking suffering of chickens and fish fairly seriously and I think when you combine these two factors of again yeah fish I think except that there's less good information on them but I think this might be in the category but certainly chickens and pigs compared to beef I actually think if you just want to kill what take out most of the suffering from your diet the moving chickens cage then caged eggs I think in the u.s. actually that's basically all eggs unless you can throw them yourself and pork I think you're the moving and maybe fish I think you're moving most of the stuffing from your diet vastly more than when it comes to B for milk yeah well in terms of like the amount of individuals that get impacted you're right in that one cow can feed much more people obviously than one chicken can so if you're taking one life in that form what disturbs me most about factory farming well for one thing disturbs me it sort of existed and then I found out about it and it was already there yeah and I had been eating it all along and that shocked me in that I was sit still I remember sitting back I'd watched some documentary on it and I remember sitting back thinking like this happened because we weren't paying attention because I was a grown man when I found out about it I hadn't been paying attention and when you leave people alone and you say hey man do you think you can get us some beef and guys like yeah I got it don't worry about it you guys stay over there in your city yeah I'll take care of it over here out of sight out of mind and then when we find out about it and then you hear about in America we have these things called ag-gag laws I'm sure you were it unbelievable like no possible justification for this terrifying is just because so yeah where it's they're hiding information hiding information yeah and there was a case where there was an animal welfare activists goes into a factory farm is filming instances of animal cruelty for kind of documentary film that gets presented she got fired and had to go to prison for not intervening in the animal cruelty that was this happening all the time and she was the person who's actually done so she got tried for not intervening not stopping the animal cruelty yeah we just have pain all of the time I thought she would get tried for violating the ag-gag laws no well she was invasion of privacy on a corporation I think the corporate secrets yeah I think it was prior to the ag-gag laws oh so they found another way to try to discourage that's that yeah so that's so insane but the thing you said earlier which when you're talking about the ways in which humans are broken I think if you just look at yeah suffering the humans of inflicting now the thing that's really worrying is how mechanized it's become so if imagine if yeah there was even let's say a chicken just right here in front of us I just for fun just kick it people would be outraged people would just think I'm this kind of despicable person and that's the natural thing action because I'm just caught inflicting unnecessary suffering on this creature but then you can just modify the circumstances such that this natural emotional reaction of sympathy just fades away where now it's this huge warehouse and it's not just one chicken it's hundreds of thousands of chicken yeah and it's all mechanized and it's all taken out of sight suddenly yeah I mean Joseph Stalin said yeah a single death is a tragedy a million deaths statistic strong no I don't like lessons from Stalin but it's an extremely good quote but he was talking about humans and you know any death of a human will be tragedy and when when they get to large numbers it's sort of it's very difficult to calculate cuz it's hard for people to understand or grasp the concept of a million people dying yeah what's bizarre about factory farming is that it's all kind of done behind these warehouse walls it's all undercover and it's all incredibly common and it's all not discussed like like it was happening I was gonna say if the war is happening and a hundred thousand people a month are dying we're discussing you know how do we mitigate this how do we stop this how do we how do we bring peace there's so few people wondering how to stop chicken suffering yeah absolutely I mean because we've looked into this and one of the reasons it's such a priority area is just the amount of just philanthropic money going into this when it's the focus is really on factory farming not you know say dogs and so on it's in the low tens of millions of dollars trying to stop factory farming yeah oh it's fun to mitigate it what is the solution like other than go envision vegetarian when have we reached this point it's all sort of like unmanageable point where the population centers like Los Angeles New York whatever that don't grow their own food have gotten so massive then in order to fuel these people with food especially with with animal protein you almost have to have these setups yeah I mean I think if you've got the constraint of animal protein I mean I think the answer is probably still no but the other thing is you just don't need that constraint of animal protein and we eat radically more meat than we did you know 50 years ago 100 years ago far more than we need to have a healthy diet I mean I've been vegetarian 11 years to eat eggs though free-range eggs yeah I do that's a for me I don't understand when people don't like when PETA had that whole campaign about eggs or chickens periods I'm like look I can understand you not wanting to eat factory farm chickens eggs because these animals are tortured and they're confined and it's horrific but you can definitely find eggs and I have my own chickens I have 22 chickens and they lay eggs and I eat their eggs all the time I ate five of them this morning they're great but when you're talking about those eggs there's it's like there's no suffering the eggs come out they don't become a chicken you take them it's free and those chickens by the way they're a bunch of little murderers they run around my yard I've seen them eat a mouse before if they found a bird that was down like a like a nesting bird that had fallen out of a nest they'll fuck that bird up anything that's on the ground the only thing they don't seem to like they don't seem to like slugs okay you've tried to feed the know they eat them we pick up a lick of rock in my garden I'll pick up a rock and the chickens come over and just Jack anything that's under the rock they figured out that when I lift up the rock there's bugs under there they're a little murderers man they're ruthless they don't like slugs they do try them and then they they start shaking their head they try to get the slime off their beak and it kind of freaked out so yeah I mean there's this big within the animal welfare can fact mental activists this is actually quite big divide between you could call them maybe the abolitionists on one side and the world Ernests and the abolitionists view is just you know animal the way which the animals is like how we treated slaves this is just this is kind of the equivalent of slavery of our time and the only and you know imagine if we'd been in slave owning Americans head like hey well why don't we just cut down the number of slaves called it's just not doing enough not moral seriousness right the welfare lists in contrast are more like look almost all the stuff thing if we're going to quantify the suffering of the way humans the animals now 99% of it comes from factory farms if we could eliminate that factory farms sure there's still something left it's not like even if you agree we're not the kind of final stage but this is that where the vast majority of both the animals used and the worst conditions are and so the welfare student said say look let's really just focus all of our attention on this and things like the range eggs or circuses or fur just these are just really kind of not the main issue and you know I'm naturally most sympathetic to the kind of welfare this perspective but it is interesting of that animal I know lots of people who were in the welfares camp and then moved to the abolitionist camp on welfare this grounds where the kind of worry is just that if you're just trying to get people to do a little then you're not actually going to move them at all mmm-hmm whereas you need to have this hard moral line and then people kind of see the integrity of that and follow it well it seems to me that there's a slippery slope when agriculture and civilization were introduced that someone wasn't going to exploit it to the nth degree and figure well it's just got to be a better way to squeeze money out of this that you and then next thing you know you've got these factory pig farms I'm sure you've seen those the horrific one where they fly the drone over the lakes of pig piss and pig shit and that these animals are living just completely confined where they can't even turn around and they're just pumping them up with whatever the fuck they need to keep them alive until they get to a certain point where they can kill them yeah and it's through people so many people would be absolutely if that was right there in front of right it would be sickened yeah hence the ag-gag laws in order to keep that money coming in they have to keep people in the dark of these situations and unless they go online and seek it out and and watch these videos yeah and those videos are very polarizing too because well you know when you come to a lot of these animal rights organizations a lot of them have roots in the Animal Liberation Organization which doesn't even believe that you should have pets they think that your pets are all you know prisoners yeah it's so interesting going back to Peter Singer where he said Animal Liberation which was the name of his book which was kind of text you know founding texts for what became the animal rights movement mmm-hmm and what's interesting is that singer doesn't believe in rights he's a consequentialist this utilitarian never used the word once so what he his approach would just be thinking yeah what's gonna do the most good and on the pets question you know I don't want to speak for Peter but he's gonna think well if they have a good life and the worldly turd just seems fine yeah again he'd want to say like the focus should be on suffering yeah on the vast magnitudes of suffering that govern factory farms that's priority one two three and four yeah I have a hard time even entertaining the conversation that there's something wrong with a healthy pet dog like that dog loves the owner the people love the dog and the dog has obviously gone through an incredible evolutionary process where it's gone from being a wolf to being a chihuahua like if you think that thing should be out fending for itself in the forest boy you're dooming that little fucker to death yeah I mean well the question the dog in all of these cases like the animals wouldn't exist otherwise and that it wouldn't exist from people I mean if it wasn't for people breeding them and making them this Bulldog like this thing that can't even hardly breathe and walks with a waddle like we're weird that with that in the first place yeah I mean I find especially the pets like dogs that have yeah like real difficulty breathing genetic diseases I find it kind of gross like this drought that we've kind of done that I've got what it's a Shibui no English Bulldog max some poor little fucker he's a mess we got him as a puppy you know cuz he was cute and you know he just seemed like he needed a home and we took him in guy he's all messed up man I mean I've had him for ten years he said all these surgeries and can't walk right his hips are all fucked up he's just like they breed him to the point where he's half she knows he's actually better off than a lot of Bulldogs because he's 12 now I don't think Bulldogs usually live that long yeah I don't think they live to that age but he's got all sorts of like difficulties can't really run yeah you know he's lazy he just likes to lay down snore but the poor little things like if you look at an actual like legit English Bulldog with their flat faces like they have massive respiratory problems yeah so I find that like it's where in fact we like engage in this product yeah so beating them kind of weird but then like yeah if you're gonna have a dog and look after it well like it's not the problem right yeah yeah and so this this question of just if you're talking about that or you just don't like distracting from the main issue which is rhyming well it seems to me that that this is just like everything else in life like as you go down the rabbit hole and you look at it deeper and deeper and deeper you go this is a complicated issue you know how do you get all these people to stop being so much meat so that you don't need so much meat so that you don't need factory farming and you have to get people aware of what is the consequences of you know going and buying a chicken sandwich roll do you know where that chicken came from here check this out are you happy now yeah hello and a lot of people they watch those videos and then they go ah fuck it I'm hungry I want to check it sandwich yeah let's people do I do think though like so in the UK at least if you buy a pack of cigarettes you get these pictures on them showing kind of what this is what your lungs will look like if you smoke a twenty a day in those warnings and yeah that doesn't stop people in some weird way I mean people are addicted to cigarettes I think it must have some impact by one day it does if you could buy a pack of chicken and you'd say well this is this is this field of piss and shit look this chicken grew up in right like the opposite of an ad gag law like force it in your face because look I mean you're just giving the consumer more information like if you went to the butcher shop went to the butcher section in the grocery store and there was videos that were playing constantly above the packaged meat that show these animals getting like a piston through the head hanging by their ankles and getting bled out while they bucked and kicked oh no how many people that would be a fucking conveyor belt of baby male chicks falling into this yeah well getting ground up yeah that would be a fascinating psychological examination to watch people walk up to that butcher shop and see those videos playing like if that became the law yeah I mean this there's an amazing there's a comedy show a sketch show that did something kind of similar which was you know the B would go up to the butcher's counter and say okay I'd like some sausages they'd go okay pick up a little baby pig and put it into this big this box it's obviously fake and just like do this action and sausages would come out obviously they're not actually right right right and nowhere did you not know where pork comes down so yeah that's the thing that's just amazing is how people can call themselves animal lovers well there's also people that love animals and eat meat like they'll eat steak and then get mad at people for hunting animals I've experienced that personally this is a good case though of the salience issue when hmm I mean so I like opposed hunting I think that the animal gets killed but the thing is it's just so salient compared to factory farming mmm and it's like you know what I prefer that people hunt meat love them like factory farming it's like of course and like you do the math this like not only am i behind that and behind that like a thousand times mm-hmm again the hunting is just it's this very salient thing you know in the UK huge fox hunting and so on that's a different thing because fox hunting you're not you're not eating it I mean it's supposed to be fun yeah and there's some there's some logic to that that if you don't have natural predators you need to figure out some way to control certain populations that can be damaging like fox or in some places black bear and there's a bunch of different animals that you do have to control because they don't have and they don't have a natural predator yeah yeah but the thing that's like incredible for me is just how people can have yes such long views on that such long views on hunting and then just eat me know the actions effectively farming yeah they just don't see it you know it is just because we are very manipulative as he means in terms of model reactions well it's obviously wedding there's certain you have there's certain animals that you have to control the populations of less especially invasive species like pigs like wild pigs are a huge problem in America and getting bigger and bigger I know you guys don't have them as much in the UK but in in America particularly in Texas and now in Northern California would just massive massive populations of wild pigs and they give birth two to three times a year and they can give birth to as many as three to six piglets in each lit and they just cotton in six months later those piglets are ready to give birth so they just boom boom boom boom and if you don't control their populations what are you gonna do you know like let wolves loose to control their populations I mean they have to figure out how to do it and so they've taken to a lot of the same strategies that they're using in New Zealand that we talked about with stags and Texas they have these helicopter hunts where they fly around in helicopters just gunned down hundreds and hundreds of these pigs and they do wind up donating that the meat of that pigs to homeless shelters and people who need it it is it's actually very nutritious and very healthy and very good for you and that's probably way better than buying Pig from someone who's raised it in some horrific factory farming environment but for people that just want the animals to live and be unchallenged and on you know on preyed upon I get it yeah it all seems very disturbing but you got to control the populations cuz you're not gonna have any agriculture I mean they're gonna find out where the farms are and they tear them apart at night they're nocturnal animals you can't stop them with fences they go right through fences they're huge huge animals wild pigs create millions of dollars of damage in Riverside County Wow that's that's like Riverside County's like super populated but this is a it's a enormous enormous problem in this country and by the way when you look at that animal what's really cool about pigs is that they morph when you see that animal it looks very different than a domestic pig but it's exact same animal they're all the same genus it's a called su scrofa and when you take a domestic pig and you let it go within months within months of being free their hair starts to change their snout starts to elongate their tusks start to grow longer they once they become feral once they realize they have to fend for themselves there's an actual physiological change in the structure of their body so interesting it's fascinating it's really crazy their hair gets thicker they develop a thicker plate the male's do around the chest to protect themselves from other males when they fight it's a bizarre so those wild pigs that people see there's a bunch of different kinds some of them are Russian boars they're wild you know the different different kind of pig but ultimately they all interbreed with each other yeah this is so interesting as well coming back to the question of what's natural and not and so on people often think this about meat the rating as well where if you look at the you know chickens can barely stand because they've been so engineered and these huge lists you know pigs that you're talking about like and not meant to be pink right to be brown you know cows just can you really imagine a cow like evolving in the wild anymore of course not all of these things are incredibly unnatural through thousands of years of selective bleeding well crack cows don't live in the wild but here's where it gets interesting in Australia when cows have gotten wild they've gotten loose from these pens that people held them in and then they become what they call scrub bulls and they're out there in the wild and people hunt them like they would hunt a wild animal and they're very wary and they run from people they see people they get the fuck out of there and the Bulls are incredibly violent like the the mane cows these scrub bulls are some of the most dangerous things to hunt in the world because they'll actively chase you down like a bull like you know if you see like people trying to ride bulls I'll bulls kick and you know they go crazy well these scrub bulls are essentially those bulls but many many many generations wild so they're feral bulls yeah and so they they sort of were bred to be this domestic thing and then they got loose and then they became this wild thing and so they looked slightly different like that's what they look like that's a scrub bull so they're becoming slowly over the course of many generations a more wild animal so they they have these hunts for these scrub Bulls and if that thing sees you by the way that crazy-looking bull they will fuck you up they're some of the most dangerous animals that you can encounter in the wild apparently but I have a buddy my friend Adam yeah they look different like look at the hump on its back I mean that looks like some crazy wild African animal and it was originally a long time ago of regular domestic cow yeah so it shows just how artificially oh yeah if that's just if that's the sort of changes you get over just the course of a few generations natural selection as opposed to what we're doing with dogs you know when we create a bulldog I mean that is those are the animals that have survived and and they've did they change their coloration their physical structure looks different yeah in over many many generations it's quite quite fascinating yeah it's like we have to figure out where we stand I think in terms of the entire ecosystem because we're certainly not viable we can't go out there and live amongst those animals and we won't we'll get killed we'll get eaten so we have to stay inside of our homes we have to stay inside of our environments and then we have to figure out like how much of an impact should we have on those things around us should we be like all the other animals like well like the wolves and all these other animals the Coyotes that have this impact on the environment or should we try to lessen our footprint to the point where we have zero impact on the animals and we just live inside of these sustained areas that grow vegetation it's um it's an interesting question because those animals prey on each other they all do and like what should we be a part of that should we take place should we take part in that I definitely don't think we should factory farm I definitely think that that was a huge mistake and I also definitely think that that huge mistake is would led us to be able to have these gigantic cities and I don't think necessarily cities are a huge mistake but man trying to figure out how to feed those people in the way that they're accustomed to eating right now there's a that's a massive although that's an battle yeah I think the kind of question of large populations and how do you feed them that massively tells in favor of lower meat consumption or vegetation sure because you've got this ten to one we're all aware right to create a calorie of meat you need tens calories or more of green or mmm sorry or whatever you're feeding them unless you're in dealing with people just consuming wild pigs yeah wild pigs or can you lose or something with it that yeah there are exceptions to that as well but but I don't think there's enough to feed people though that's the other thing there's 350 million people in this country there's not 350 million wild pigs exactly but it means that in the future just as populations get larger then yeah again we're just gonna need to use land and energy more efficiently so this is like yet another argument in favor of plant-based diets yeah well in America at least the majority the vast majority of the money that goes towards conservation towards keeping wild animal populations high is actually from hunting it's a real strange contradiction that makes people really uncomfortable once they find it out is that the vast majority of the money that goes to present protect habitat to preserve wild lands it comes from hunting in fact hunters voluntarily agreed believe it was in the 1930s to give up 10% I want to make sure that numbers right - but of the the money in in terms of the percentage of sales of hunting equipment goes directly towards conservation there's all these things yeah there's all these different entities like the Rocky Mountain Elk Federation that have repopulated elk into all these areas but done so specifically so that people can hunt them so it gets really weird yeah it was like it might be an uneasy alliance between in many people's eyes but they're the ones that are giving up the money the money is not coming from altruistic organizations that just want to preserve these animals so that they can exist in the free wild way that they did before people got here but there's more whitetail deer in America today than when Columbus landed so it's and that's all because of conservation because of hunting so it's another one of those weird things where the whole picture yeah there's a solution that I've heard suggested for reducing species loss which is to allow basically ownership of species so you can copy like the Panda no now isn't this a weird idea but the idea is that they're now suddenly like at the moment no one has a financial incentive to ensure that pandas don't go extinct whereas if someone were able to say no I have if you want to use a panda and video or so on you have to pay the owner yeah well I'm very uncomfortable with the idea of this laboratory created meat as to where that's going to go why you uncomfortable I'm very positive about it I mean the science is kind of tricky but I'm positive about it in that it's not gonna be in the animal suffering it's gonna be fascinating in that regard but what's gonna happen if we find out that well there's a bunch of it for things right first of all we have to make sure that's healthy we have to make sure that it doesn't cause some sort of a weird disease because you're not eating something that's living and moving and when you eat sedentary creatures maybe there's some sort of an adverse impact on our biology because I think there's an adverse impact when you eat protein from an animal that is like weak and sick and they've actually shown that there was a study that dr. Rhonda Patrick sent me recently that showed that animals that eat older sick animals die quicker they have a shorter life span and in exhibit less health characteristics I believe it was than animals that ate younger animals and there seems to be some sort of a direct correlation between eating younger healthy things and having a positive healthy impact on on physical life itself the animal that's consuming it and that if you're eating something that never existed in the first place like what unless they're able to recreate the characteristics of a healthy animal like a strong muscle tissue like maybe they could do that with electrical impulses like some sort of electrical muscular muscular stimulation yeah I don't see why that would be a problem I mean at least you'd think you'd be able to get past that in fact where you know the meat that we've currently got started all of antibiotics you know there's often viruses that or viruses that kind of arise swine flu alien flu flu exactly you could avoid all of them with all that all that stuff comes from factory farm and in fact yeah and in fact then once you start to engineer meat perhaps you could engineer exactly the healthiest sort of me you've got so much more control over the product don't be crazy so of course you've got a yeah with the development of any new technology you've got to be cautious about it but ultimately it seems like we should be able to get to a point where we have tastier cheaper more healthy meat that uses far less carbon like has far less carbon dioxide as a side effect uses far less land area it's gonna be better in every single way hmm and I mean I think the science it does seem hard in particular just to get the costs down low enough well I think they've got it down pretty low I mean there was a recent article about it where they were talking about the original one was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and now they've got it down to like 20 bucks yeah I think that was misleading was it yeah it's a shame like it seemed to me like there's have been a little bit too much hype around and weekly mean where yeah there's some stories of like the costs are radically going down right well as it's definitely much lower than that I think it's definitely still decades away mmm decades yeah I think so really yeah what makes you think decades so the argument is that the currently the so it depends on what you're talking about like egg white I think is pretty easy comparatively milk is comparatively easy but structured meat so you know steak or chicken that has a structure that's I think very difficult and I think apparently part of what the difficulty is there's a certain solution that you need to go with this meat in and that solution is currently very expensive hmm and the key part of the cost even once we get to the point of being able to develop this getting the cost down low enough since it's competitive you're going to need to take this fluid that currently costs I don't know how much but like a thousand dollars a liter get it down to the cost of soda and we don't click currently it seems have like a clear kind of scientific who would be the ultimate conundrum if they found out that the only way to make that fluid and to make it financially viable is to make it out of ground-up pets well get killed anyway euthanized pets so at like would people be upset if they took euthanized pets and they used it to make the fluid to grow the artificial meat in or would they prefer those euthanized pets just be cremated so at the moment that fluid does have to come from animals why certain part of it that is animal based was just guessing so it's not exactly ground-up pets but is there in still probably brains as I understand it still currently not vegan but it's interesting I think it's going to change I mean I do think given the level of just model cognitive dissonance that's currently going on between people's attitudes to animals pets any animal they can see and consumption of meat once you take self-interests out of the equation once you've got meat that is cheaper than just as tasty I think just everyone's gonna switch and then within a generation people will look back at the current generation and just think how did anyone ever engage in such abominable activity as factually found me yeah well it's probably one of the darkest things that we as a civilized humanity do when you when you think about other than war which is obviously the most horrific thing or one of the most horrific things I mean it's arguable that in terms of suffering it's the next thing because it's I mean it has to be that it is the next thing right and so other than poisoning people for profit you know other than companies that have polluted environments that have wanted poisoning people yeah so in terms of animals so fifty billion animals are killed every year for humans worldwide worldwide most of them have kind of short life so layer no broiler hens have six week lives that's crazy yes six weeks or so from the time they're incubated to the time they're in our oven six weeks that's that yeah and I think they're nuts the point at which they die is that the highlight of their life in my view because their life is just filled with suffering and so that means any any one time the seven billion animals in factory farms right now living basically being tortured for the entirety of their short life so the entire population of the human race it's basically one-to-one yeah at any one time so nuts that that's less than a hundred years old yet much less than that less than 5000 fifty years old that's right was the first crazy asshole that jammed those chickens into those little cages Henley field I think the guy's name so he fascinating arise of the free marketeers so back in the 50s again I'm gonna go on a digression but it's not as mad as an affinity I promise you that's all right there's all right they're all awesome so back in the 50s and free-market economics was just completely dead it was just not a mainstream idea at all within academic economics but yet really if I was to prominence a course into the 60s certainly the 70s and then Thatcher and Reagan being in power huge uptake in this intellectual movement and so the question is can of where did it come from and it was actually very significantly driven by a small number of people in the 50s early 60s like very deliberately saying okay I want we want this ideology to become really dominant and one of the most important first organizations was the Institute for Economic Affairs based in London a think-tank and it was funded by the person who brought to factory farm chicken to Britain so it's weird because I promote this idea of earning to give there's something that you know young people should consider not that's the only thing they should do but as one of many things they should do couldn't you consider doing if you want to do good you could go and like directly have an impact but there is also another option which is doing something you're really passionate about that maybe has less of a direct impact earn a lot and donate what you're making at least a significant part of that to the things you think are most important and then I think of this I think it's Henley Fisher sorry this is like this most perverse instantiation of that where the guy went became a factory farming entrepreneur basically on on pending ticket of give glands isn't that so indicative of how humans are so contradictory were so complex it's so strange in that we will find all these justifications for all these bizarre behaviors and then we were never like totally pure like there's so many so many people that are so that like this is the terrible example but it's the one I use all the time Bill Cosby made so many people laugh and he raped about a hundred or whatever allegedly you know like he was helping and putting out so much love to so many people and then being fucking evil to a bunch of people that he drugged oh yeah that this this exists this duality that they say yeah I think about Nazi Germany think about the number of people who are involved in the Holocaust who love their children and their children and if you talk to them you would have had a like a great conversation they would have been fairly caring and so on this is I mean yeah it's a very powerful idea the banality of evil have an Events phase where yeah the worst crimes committed and not because people are bad it's because not bad or evil in the way that you think James Bond villain like this person's plotting something it's just because they have some goal that is some goal and which they are indifferent to suffering and they caused that as a side of and so it's the same if you ask people do you want animals to suffer have ethically in factory farms let's say you no of course not it's just that I don't care casualties of war exactly and casualties of civilization yeah and the same insight actually when we talk about AI as well as um you know sometimes in the media people say oh the worry about AI is a terminator it's gonna want to kill humans but that's not the worry at all the idea or when you think about Homo sapiens and Neanderthals again it's just having some other entity that has goals on which you're just not very important right and it means that yeah well and they're also gonna judge us and if they are intelligent and they are superior to us they're gonna judge us based on the entire whole of our behavior and they're gonna go look at this messy species this fuckin species is crazy Elon Musk's musk has my most terrifying quote he his quote is the most terrifying to me that he thinks that with AI we are summoning the demon I love that quote yeah it's just like I mean I worry yeah like I think a lot of the media attention around AI is like has been really unfortunate because it suggests like it's coming next year and it's gonna control it's like the demon I think I'm to pull more files write more than is necessary and so on sort of I think but if its ultimate goals the extinction of the human race that's very demonic in our regard yeah I mean it's more been different yeah that's sort of the way we think about mollusks yeah yeah exactly our the way we think of like you know mosquitoes yeah mosquitoes with my favorite because vegans will slap mosquitos oh yeah I mean I'll mosquito mosquitoes sentient or not they're alive yeah but there are they sent like I think clams and mollusks on sentian then insects I'm like well there's some weird arguments about that then I mean why not eat crickets because cricket protein is excellent I've had cricket bars before they're covered in chocolate they taste really good they're high-protein yeah I mean many I do know many people who do advocate for that my view is just like if you're unsure then play safe mmm and you'd be eating a lot of crickets like yeah but there's a lot of crickets out there the end like might be wanting crickets with a tiny little spear I don't think I say you do it you're a lot more brutal than that I mean I think factory farming for crickets would be a horrific institution you know and you just what would you do just fucking swarms of them gonna smash them down to a protein bar um I would I worry about is that what is the current number of the amount of species that have ever existed that are now extinct it's fucking huge it's like 99.99% or something why not us why not us oh yeah and if we do give birth to artificial intelligence if we are the caterpillar that gives birth to the butterfly that winds up taking over the world some artificial butterfly yeah I mean I think the thing that worries me is that you know it's AI is it's kind of its own thing and I think you know we do because it's like potentially extremely beneficial as well if it go even if it's supposing it goes well then it's a huge thing like we should care about it whether or not we're worried about the extinction risk because it's you know one of the things one of the rare cases I think where we can really see into the future and think yes this is gonna be a transformative technology we don't know when it's gonna happen but when it does when it does it's gonna be transformative and it's gonna be very powerful and that means we should have some kind of careful thought about it but it seems to me there's a variety of ways that the human race could kill itself now so novel pathogens being one example Large Hadron Collider I mean so my colleague Toby actually about a paper on the Large Hadron Collider because there was always you know talk about oh we could go on and so he wrote an academic paper where he just talked about the risk analysis that they did and they said oh the chance of the Large Hadron Collider creating a black hole or something else that's like really dangerous is 10 to the power negative 63 you know what that's not going here oh it's not zero firstly it's not zero those motherfuckers they couldn't take what if they're weak but the odds were really long we didn't know but the second thing also is that it's so you shouldn't think that anything 10 to the negative 63 really unless you have very very strong models behind right because what's the chance that you just made some mistake in your calculation it's like you know maybe it's as low as 1 in a million well that mistake completely swamped variety and so that was the point that he was making just statistical point saying right look I'm not commenting or whether this is dangerous or not it's just that you've made a mistake in your methodology with respect to U of esque assessment and so it's really funny because then he was there this is fairly calm sensible you know philosopher from Oxford in a place meeting with a lot I think later surrounded by all the you know aluminium like tin foil tin foil hat people yeah aluminium I love the way you guys say aluminium I know apparently I was so annoyed when I found this but patently your your way is correct and what it is where am i oh this is the weird area I really and then you start saying things like oh yeah click oh there's a nice lickle in the niche in the foyer oh you say it's a niche any sleek fire yeah for yay for yeah we say for you though do people say for you so I definitely heard fire there Walmart people huh was a whitener whether you from originally where am i from new jersey is where I was born because I thought it's a New York thing but maybe maybe I didn't really grow up there you grew up all over the place Boston it mostly yeah but you know you do you do so many things long it's very it's very tell you what we don't do we don't do Queens you guys still have Queens ulis it's so funny every I feel like every time I go no I think the queen is like this ridiculous institution really she just kind of rocks her hand back and forth some sort of weird semi Vulcan stance it's kind of funny yeah talking to especially some of the kind of progressive things I have in America me like you've got monarchies everyone talking about it like it's quaint yeah we're just like knowing Lily things but it doesn't really have power right but she's still losing the fucking castle lives in a castle she lives off the dime but if you do in an economic analysis she brings in more money than she I'm sort of but she takes a lot she's sort of the anti will McCaskill if you ask me yeah that's right I mean she just gets all this free money and that bitch just wears gold and shit and drives around on limo it's kind of ridiculous so you could yeah you could definitely get the same tourism benefit people are mad I said bitch I'm not really meaning the word bitch so I could all due respect folks it's just a figure of speech humorous figure speech okay well I appreciate that yeah I don't want to disparage your ruler yeah such a strange ruler though kings and queens and Prince Charles it's a really it's a really funny part of the sculpture so I keep it's so funny because I keep I spend a lot of time in California but every time I come back it seems to be on some major event to do with royalty so one was the Queen's birthday one was the event of the Queen's being the longest ever running monarch one was the Jubilee we don't know about that at all things for you is these massive events so it just means I come off the plane being in America for a while and this is pictures of the Queen everywhere I'd say okay yeah I'm definitely back in Blighty now mmm now what's going on now anything crazy yeah yeah huge news today what well for me as a Scot Nicola Sturgeon the First Minister I'm so like the leader of Scotland mm-hmm kind of think of Scotland to the UK as like state to fight a little bit it's a little bit different announced there's gonna be a second she's planning a second Scottish referendum so because the because Britain is taking itself out of the European Union European Union where they expect is that announcement can made Tuesday and of month but it's very shortly Scotland did not want to leave for the you voted overwhelmingly in favor of remaining so Scotland in general tends to lean a lot further left than the rest of the UK and previously had an independence referendum it was very close actually 52% with in favor of staying part for the Union so the state part of the Union there's now gonna be a second referendum at least this is what Nicola Sturgeon is saying and because of the brexit vote I think it's much more likely that Scotland will say yes we're gonna leave and then they are the main part of the European Union whereas the rest of Britain will leave and it's interesting for me because I was very kind of ploy of the Union against independence in the previous referendum now I'm not sure now I think I probably am in fit because I think that brexit was just such a bad decision that I kind of want them to be punished for that and well I think there's two things one is that I think that now the case for Scotland being part of the EU but not part of it and the economic case kind of makes a bit more sense now than it did in the past but then secondly just I would kind of worry that Britain leaves the u EU does that trigger kind of spark like you know much larger movement we're just the EU as a project can it breaks down and if it's the case like well UK leaves the EU but as a result the country just falls apart I think you've wanted that to happen you wanted England to fall apart to be punished for leaving the I mean you could be like a very major signal like I don't think you what if they prospered if they were correct oh yeah I mean then if it is if I do go if it was convinced that the flex it was the right decision it was actually best for the world and then I would change my mind I don't know enough about it but I do have a friend who's very knowledgeable and he's from England and his take on it was the the real issue with the U is that you're dealing with a bunch of people that aren't even elected they're just sort of running the European Union he's like and we don't have to tell you when you just look at history what happens when people have a great amount of power and aren't even elected to their their position and you're allowed to just go to any part of the European Union and move into it he's like that was very detrimental and very bad in terms of the way England's financial structure was set up they were like this could this would be detrimental to England but beneficial to other places and the idea was that we were supposed to accept the fact that would be detrimental to England and beneficial to other countries and many people in England did not want to do that and in doing and in making that decision they were thought to be xenophobic they were thought to be you know nationalistic and that it was racist so I think this yeah two things I mean one thing is yeah I don't like yeah I mean so there's kind of two things one with respect to the sovereignty question I mean like European Union like it has its own Parliament and so on you can vote on that you each get number those electors and the reason insofar as it's undemocratic it's mainly just because people don't care like that they don't care well as invited Emma Craddock but turn as in voters so turnout elections for many members of the European Parliament Parliament the turnout is very low I think the sense of thing maybe it'll be larger now that they realise the consequences of it well I mean there's not gonna be any more because it's gonna there's gonna leave implode well bins leaving so Britain's leaving so you no longer voting for members of the P in Parliament so that's one question and then like is this good a bad fittin I think like the economic case is just incredibly strong for your lip being curve good for Britain the reason being just like fleet fade and general benefits both parties you want to really maximize the amount of free trade but then the bigger thing for me is just like with respect to unity between countries is like the tail risk risk of war which we don't really think about cuz we haven't had to meet what like a world war since you know the early mid 20th century but Europe had had like a long period of comparative peacefulness like before the First World War people thought no it's unthinkable given the level of interconnectedness between the countries that world war could pick out and then to dit right and so and I think those sorts of things be you know that's the tale outcome but can be bad indeed and we don't often think about it because it's just this occasional thing and so that's why in general and just always more like not almost always more Pro closer relations between between countries that makes sense to me what he said makes sense to me as well though when he was saying essentially it was like think of the United States but now think of each state being country you're allowed to elect a leader of that country but you can't elect a leader for the United States and so that's essentially how he was looking at the European Union he was saying the European Union is there they're not elected and yet they're controlling all these other elected officials and elected States I'll I'll group together instead of thinking them as like Germany and think it was England think of them as States and think of the European Union and the officials the people that are in control of the European Union aren't even elected yeah so I mean you do elect the Parliament and then it's also the case that the analogy like the amount of power that Europe has over the remaining the other countries is like you know nothing like the amount of power the federal government has or gov government has over states like you know the UK sets so the power of the EU has one of the things that got made lots of attention was bendy bananas this guy like a real focus area for people to hire but in also nd what does that mean so according to EU regulations so EU has a single market so that means you have just the same standards across all countries mm-hmm but then that means you just start to say have these standards of the things like bananas and so there was a 1e with Ag you Latian which was that a banana couldn't be too bendy otherwise it would count as a defective banana and so people will like up an outrage about theirs like how can the EU dictate to us the shape of our bananas but I think the case is like a good one it's like it's really not that important it's just a banana why are they even sort of regulate it then well it's because if you want to have like a free like single market you need to have common standards across and then the market dictates standards we're like the bendy bananas don't sell and then the straighter ones do yeah I mean I don't know more of the detail about it seems to me like anytime the government steps in on something as fucking ridiculous as the bend and the shape of a banana yeah be like hey fuckface why don't you go take care of poverty you know why don't you why don't you handle something real instead of dealing with bendy bananas look so on the bendy madonna's case yeah I can't off the top of my head think of why you'd want to not allow the sale but that's what people worry about when they worry about the bureaucracy ya worry about too much control yeah so um it's a great example and in fact if what why people don't want micromanaging of our culture yeah but then the question is do we want to leave over bananas and I think like there's a lot of other factors it's not the bananas that caused it right but the thing is the UK is part of the European Union has sovereignty over like its income taxes all of its laws as long as they don't conflict with the UN Declaration of Human Rights which was first invented by the UK mmm-hmm has control of yet all of its internal legislation it can we can go to war at once and it did so the loss of sovereignty seems pretty mild from my perspective and I feel like I feel like they focus on these examples which is like okay maybe like let's say yeah it's okay it's a cost we would like to be able like maybe it would be better if it and could make decision of manners maybe the bananas was the bad call what definitely doesn't seem like a universal reaction I mean the the there's a large percentage of the people in England at are very upset about brexit you know yeah so it's a really interesting sort of a divide between people yeah I mean the thing that I find fascinating is that we would make and I think this in general I think this with elections as well because I studied a bunch of voting Theory well doing my PhD and we make these momentous decisions as a country where we get everyone in the population to try and go to a specific place hmm and then get the smallest possible information out of them that you can which is just a single tick like yes or no where's there's so much more you could be doing all right in one case with a referendum well than just a particular date where the turnout is affected by things like the weather it's affected by you know what happened in the week before instead you just have figure referenda and given the momentum this momentous nosov the decision spending more money on like actually getting the accurate views of the people is super important so instead yeah you have three over the period of six months and choose the best you know their best at free basically well there's our orders that would be like a more accurate accurate representation of what people think of a time sure but isn't there also a gigantic issue with people not being informed about what they're voting on you don't have to be informed yeah about what you're voting on you certainly don't have to be accurate about what you're you could easily be misled yeah and the actual hard provable facts could be completely outside of your grasp and yet you still make a big decision I wondered before about having a a test a test yeah you go like but like really really basic I think it would still there's this question of just why do we care about democracy what's the point why do we question it seems like a really important thing oh yeah political philosophers talk about this all the time so the kind of agreed like democracy seems good other forms of government that we know so far seem terrible seem terrible or worse but why why is democracy good is it just that democracy gives us this way to boot out dictators be and the risk of a single person taking power it's just really really bad and so we just need some mechanism to get rid of that is if it's intrinsically valuable is it that people just have a right to have equal representation and that's just this fundamental thing or is it justified on just in terms of the consequences is it because if everybody is able to contribute then people will make better decisions I never necessarily think it's an either/or I think there's also that people like to feel like they play a part like they don't want to feel like they're being ruled over by some monarch they want to feel like they have some sort of a play and the decision-making it's also what one of the gross things about Trump winning in this country is how many people gloated how many people gloat upon victory that their side won and then you're dealing with this whole team mentality adopt when it comes to saw any sort of an issue well I mean this is Cody Jackson right yeah no in general this is one of the things I'm really worried about with is increasing levels of partisanship this is just this really robust phenomenon that we're seeing and it's really worrying because it means that we're just undermining any chance of people changing my mind like someone like people say well cause economy except a but like the vast majority of Tom's voice were and similarly for hello these votes were from people who just always vote Republican yes well not necessarily because the Trump won by so many votes that a good percentage of them had to have voted for Obama just statistically oh and I'm still thinking of Trump's votes what the portion of people have only ever voted Republican to question and I would like definitely bet greater than 80% I really probably evacuate over 90% yeah that's like I mean if you look at the polls like it's always that in terms of expected it's only 46% in favor there tom well there's also the issue that the independence in the swing states whether it's Gary Johnson or whether it's Jill Stein those independents the amount of votes they got would have swung it the other way towards Hillary yeah I remember looking into this for Jill Stein in particular and actually it was the case she would have won the popular vote by even more but in none of the swing states did she get enough of a percentage not just just time but Gary Johnson as well yeah though Gary Johnson it seemed to me was split almost evenly between Trump and Hillary but this is an interesting case so the thing that people yeah I don't think about so much is like I think the process we call this is like a democracy but like one single like checkbox every four years it's like the smallest amount of information you can be getting yeah and it's acceptable to all sorts of different things for supposing and this happens on both sides so supposing Jill Stein became you know really really popular took 10% of a vote she would have just killed Hillary absolutely or suppose and that Evan McMullen is that his name yeah he was a Republican independent okay did well in Utah any was supposing a far-right candidate does really well again takes all of the votes away from them the fact that that's possible shows that like first-past-the-post is a voting system is a very bad voting system yes not accurately representing the will of the people and we could do so much better than it would mean that like as a democratic process you'd be much closer to representing what people actually believe or feel about things because right now it means that yeah you can be influenced by stuff like how much support as a third party get that's a terrible system it's a terrible system it lasts too long the decisions last for four years this person gets locked into position unless you impeach them and then remove them from office they're stuck it sucks I wish I could talk about it more but I can't I gotta get the fuck out of here but this that's the least interesting thing we talked about today but the AI and all the other stuff is just fascinating stuff if people want to know more about your effective altruism movement and more about you where should they go they should go to effective altruism dog that's got tons of information about effective altruism if you want if there's one takeaway that you really want to do you think wow actually this was kind of cool I do want to make more of a difference we've just launched a set of funds so it just means you can donate within one of these cause areas of global development animal welfare or preservation of the long run future against global catastrophic of asks you can just donate and have it insure that will go to the very most effective nonprofits 0% overhead depending how you donate and like we don't take any money along the way and just means that yeah super easy to donate donate as effectively as possible alright beautiful thank you well appreciate it ma'am I'm really fun we'll be back tomorrow with Jim Norton see ya [Music]
