the gyro can experience look I live with the fact that there are some people that have what I do and then there are some people like I'm fucking baffled why is there still here so I get and I get like I get that love it or leave it or love it or hate it really I mean I'll take love it or leave it you're a perfect example what you just use those a great example what's special about this whole thing is that a guy like you like you saying that you know that you're a love it or leave a guy but if you weren't you well you're yours look if you weren't a guy who has this podcast sponsored by the fleshlight a guy who puts out a podcast in the internet way before anybody and a guy whose most recent movie you just said come on kind of fuck everybody I'm just gonna do this on my own do it and release it my way fuck the entire system of it a guy like you really wouldn't exist any other way no you know you can't its cult omit love it or leave you're doing it your way play it with passion do it here's my philosophy and then is everybody's philosophy it's not even an original 101 life you fucking die is it you don't know what's on the other side and we hope for this that we hope for Candyland mm-hm but we don't know it could be as simple as getting the box and stay there for all fucking eternity you had your shot your computer we shut you down and you're finished so if that's the case it it behooves you to shoot for your dreams every time I know it sounds a little dopey and Tony Robbins this but it's real it's real like in a world where you're gonna fucking die like this is the way I think about it and that dude said an example that's real close to home my old man was a good dude my father good guy not many good men in the world this was a good fucking guy did worked at a post office canceling your fucking stamp what a soul-killing horrible job that is four years just to pay for a fucking family who knew if he had dreams maybe his only dream was to like I don't get married enough kids work maybe wasn't a big deal to him and he did whatever he had to to put food on the table and stuff like that good dude take me to matinees every Wednesday go see a movie take math school half day go see flicks and whatnot never no and why not one of these parents that you know fucks around with a kid or something like that where you're like aw it was all good that there was the good straight-arrow fucking dude didn't went to church because his wife made him but wasn't big into the church fucking mode his mother-in-law's lawn all the time good guy good guy raised three good kids or at least two good kids and me and so my father we'd go out to eat one night he's about sixty eight years old we'd go out to eat Morton's in Philadelphia and it's one of those special nights man with like the whole family winds up being the same place hadn't been that way in years my mom my dad me and my wife's with me my sister and her husband and she lives out and at this point I think she was living in Kobe Japan or something like that so she's rarely back in the states and my brother he's married to do but his husband wasn't with us I didn't make the trip that time unfortunately there we are in a back room at Morton's you know and eaten having a great time chitchat and any old man's putting away steak cheesecake he's a couple Manhattan's that was his fucking poison and you could tell and I don't even like paint this in retrospect it was clear on the night parents loved seeing their kids all in one place happy healthy not fucked in the head or something like that and you could tell he was enjoying it there were skids shooting the shed everyone's trying to make each other laugh and shit trying to make him laugh he everyone's since everyone's paying attention everyone else maybe nobody spent attention him eating maybe too much cheesecake that night but fuck it we're all having a good time put him in a cab that night kiss him on the head I was like hey mousie in the morning he'd come out to Philadelphia to see me do a Q&A at the Wizard Comic Con Philadelphia Wizard Comic Con off he goes in the cab go home and I go to the hotel go to sleep I get a phone call at 6:00 in the morning for my brother and my brothers like you gotta get down the hospital and walnut and I said why he goes dad and now my father was in and out of poor health he was diabetic and whatnot he'd had like strokes heart attacks and stuff like oh yeah he was bad health dude but but no so when my brother's like dad's in the hospital I'm like okay what now fucking throw a rock and dad's got it and my brother get here in his voice it was just like you gotta get down here right now and I was oh shit and I hung up got dressed went down I've get to the emergency room open the door first thing I see is my mother who looks more scared than I've ever a human being in my life fucking terror on her face not I've seen my mother cry in my lifetime you know I've made my mother cry in my lifetime I've watched her cry watching fucking Falcon Crest when I was a kid this was different this was like terror fear you know almost like there was a fucking gun to her head and off of her face I looked at my brother my brother just has this expression where he just kind of gives me the slow not which is he's gone you know my father was dead and I went and I saw him on a gurney and shit and I was so strange and I go outside and I was a smoker like cigarette smoke room those days I was go to have a cigarette and Donald comes out and I was like oh this is a shock and whatever you know we were upset and stuff and I said how was it because he was there I said what happened in Donald tells me the story of like dad woke up and had this like big reaction like just like I'm hot I'm on his throne sheets off and mom freaked out what's the matter what's the matter she told Donald call her call the ambulance call the hospital and he was gone within seconds so that's his you know bad enough you know he was hot and uncomfortable you don't want to hear like oh he died in his sleep and we woke up and he just didn't but then my brother says this thing probably defined my life my brother goes he died screaming and I go what what and he goes he he died screaming and I was like Doug what I mean is that a figure of speech he goes no he literally he died screaming and you could see my brother was haunted by it and my father wasn't like a I wouldn't say he was a butch man or strong man but he wasn't a soft man money stretch the imagination and I never heard him get real loud or anything like that and the notion of my father dying screaming changed my life because I was like even a good man in this world he played a game he played straight you play by the rules you do everything you're supposed to you're gonna die screaming and at that point I was like there's no point and not trying to accomplish every stupid fucking dream I've got even if his dumb shit like fucking you know oh my god I've always wants to collect this money fucking Wayne Gretzky cards in one fucking binder or if it's like I want to make a movie or if it's like I want to put on podcast or I want to do a TV show now book chase it all down chasing wimzie's what I've been doing for the last few years just smoking weed and chances and wimzie's anytime I'm like back in the day I'd have a good idea something I really want to follow through on and they don't even get scared you start thinking about some motherfuckers gonna say and be like oh it's stupid why would you fucking do that and fucking why why a lot of why people in this world I try to surround myself with the why nots motherfuckers so you're like I want to try this like why not let's go let's give it a shot got to be game man people help you achieve your dreams and shit so for me the last few years I've just been trying to accomplish every dopey dream - big shit the little shit you got to do them all you can't just do the climb every mountain shit you know sometimes later bar down step over and be like tada so you feel accomplished but chase it all and do it all cuz we're all gonna die screaming and you might as well enjoy it here and when I say chase aww don't fucking do it at the expense if someone else obviously don't hurt somebody else but go after you James man if your dream is to like I want to kill 12 children that's I'm not saying I'm not talking to you but go after your dreams it's not gonna hurt anybody
