the girag an experience so what what is it like working with the Vice guys we fucking love you know I love vice man vice they're my best you I've worked with so many people and vice just lets you do your thing yeah and and that's the best part and like I just went through a whole week I was at Ted I'm a TED fellow this year and I went through a whole week of people telling me what to do where to be and it was like being at a fucking Scientology summer camp was horrible yeah tell me what the fuck happened they told you that you you you can't leave yeah like before you go to like you need to participate in Ted you need to be them all right cool like I'm like minds are reasonable if you have to do something in LA you can go do something in LA right I gave them like four or five days in my time like I was there every single 13 hours like every day they have 13 hours of fucking activities they have mapped out for you some days like 15 16 hours right if you go to their after events and I like that's way too much fucking human in Iraq days yeah explain this so you go there and you're gonna go and do your own TED speech right yeah so you do your own TED speech what is the other stuff they have for you they want you to be available for like networking cocktail events like attendees want to talk to you you need to be available and I was like look i-i've done a lot like I put people on like I put them in touch with ad agency people I put them in touch with other people to do business with other artists I was introducing everyone and I thought I was good so I went yesterday to go do DVD awesome I went a met up show I met up awesome and I went and now they called me today on the way over here and they were like we're taking your ted fellowship where so why are you taking the ted fellowship like because you went to LA I was like you're in Long Beach I just went to LA for the afternoon to do the fucking podcast you're fucking crazy and they're like you took this spot from somebody who would have gone to every talk and been in everything I was like yo the other people weren't there for everything but you're also just crazy like yeah fucking crazy you're crazy then I paying you know they don't pay that since that's you go they do it for the love and they want you for seven days 12 to 15 hours a day what and you can't just leave to go do something some work that you have to do yes fucked up yeah what what is it where people fuck up everything yeah even something is amazing is because Ted I remember the first TED talk that I ever saw on the internet a couple years ago we have a whole Ted thread on my message board about great great TED episodes yeah like the one how to be happy is great oh there's so many of them uh Graham Hancock just gave one in the war on consciousness about ayahuasca and his own problems with kicking cannabis he had like a crazy weed habit where he's high all day every day for like decades and then he like it was it was a crutch for him was like a real problem um great TED talk about it though there's so much good stuff but then you hear shit like this you know like even they suck yeah like even someone finds a way to fuck up even something as amazing as Ted yeah the speakers are great I quit I can't say a damn bad thing every single one of the fellows is like inspirational amazing doing great work the thing is though something gets so good and people feel the power that they have and then they impose rules and that's how society got created in the beginning somebody got so liked and got so much power that they could force you to do things that were entirely unnatural and inhuman that's so ridiculous to think that a guy like you is as busy as you could give up that much time yeah and be angry if you vary from their schedule at all that that sounds like there's more to it Ted's a racist yet culturally kind of crazy too cuz other people missed and they kind of picked on me for it but even before I got out I was like oh my birthday is Friday you want me to stay till Saturday can I at least have my girl stay with me like and I'll just use them Vic oh we can't because you have a roommate at Ted so you're like 30 40 year old people staying at roommate I was like wait a minute wait a minute wait they make you room with people wait a minute why how can they do that I only tell you who to sleep with yeah they were yes and they were like you have two room it's part of the Ted experience and I was like this is a cold at this point you have crossed the thrusts you are now fucking Scientology yes wait that's create shit so they assign you they say you know what we think that Eddie would grow if he lived with Sascha for a week yeah so some crazy fuck who's the Sascha Shulgin who's in there cooking up crystal meth and whatever the fuck he's doing he would have to stay with that guy yes I mean luckily with this dude soft what who was amazing cool cat okay yes yeah you were really thick to be able to pull the name of the dude out is amazing his name was soft wet and I stay with him but I was like I'm 30 I've been stayed in a hotel with people in a minute you know how big is the hotel it's a small shitty hotel it's the Hyatt Regency looks like a fucking Airport Hotel him so you bought you're like in the bed next to this guy yeah so you had to hear each other snore yeah oh dude oh fuck Danny what the fuck is that and they also hold this shit at Long Beach and it's like next to like across the street literally you have back-to-back Outback PF Changs and like Subway it's ridiculous but the whole thing is just weird I was like I'll pay for my own room though no you're not allowed I was like you're not allowed to pay for your own room yeah they're crazy they just want to control you that is amazing so I still love the talks I love all the speakers but the organisation is fucked that's hilarious that they think that they could have that kind of influence over you it's part of the Ted experience Eddie is part of the Ted experience Eddie is part of the Ted experience owned only that no one's talked about this before because this seems like straight-up Boy Scouts yeah you know what is the thing is most people they need Ted they need Ted to put you on they want the cosign and most people it's like if you do something for me I won't say anything about you but that's I mean I think Joe you're the same way I don't give a fuck what you do for me if you're a fucking weirdo and you're about to start some new cult conference religion I'm gonna say something I'm not all your rules I would write a book about this yeah if I try if they actually try to get me to do what they wanted me to do for four five six seven days whatever it was and not paying you they send packets to to be like this is how to network with billionaires Wow like how to go to network with billionaire's how to go to a network and talk to people and like talk to potential people who could collaborate and work with you they're like don't just go ask them for money and I'm like this is crazy oh my god I mean so just go ask them for money and it's in the packets yeah and you're a grown-ass man and they pick you like you're obviously intelligent if you getting picked for ten and they're like today when it rains you should pack a punch it's wild see that what that is pardon okay what that is is exactly the opposite of the vehicle that got them there the vehicle that them there is the Internet what got them there is the fact that the freedom of the Internet allows people to exchange interesting conversations like that hey you got a listen to this got a washes it's lady gave the speech on monkeys it was amazing whatever you and what they did is the exact opposite yeah and that's why even though Obama is focusing on gun control the most important debate that Americans will face in the next five years is Internet freedom internet freedom is the most important debate we will face and we have so fucking blind to it because the lobbyists are doing it under like under our noses yeah you surely should have the right and ability to put your own website up and control your own content and express yourself any in any way shape form you choose and the benefits of that have been staggering to our culture over the last couple of years yeah just just over the last ten yeah you know and the idea that corporations might have the ability to step in and stop that or regulate that or restrict that or censor you if in anything that you do and somehow or another if anything you do and somehow or another one way or forms cost them money yeah and they decide that this is something that has to be stopped they're going to be able to do that and yes we do something and once somebody realizes they have their hand on the faucet and they have the ability to turn it on and turn it off people get crazy you've seen that study it's like Ted like these yet people yeah they even want power yeah they do this shit where they invite these people to go talk and they actually don't put up everybody's talks until this year they used to pick and choose and cherry-pick the talks they put up and you would go there for a week 15 hours a day do all their shit and then imagine if they didn't put up your talk what if you talk sucks if your talk sucked I feel like it should just go suck on the internet like I don't go mad at each other on the internet you know right but maybe if yes and no because if you like say if you have a comedy conference and you had all these comedians do sets but some of them were just dog shit did you want that set to represent your your company know you would you know you wouldn't do it yeah I wouldn't I you know if I did though invite someone and they stayed for a week and I didn't pay them I would be like the least I owe you is the opportunity to quite pass there's three people on the planet earth that enjoy your vegan I mean yeah that's one point yeah that's a point I guess but I know what you're saying to protect the brand it makes a little sense but you know for the most part most people's talks are fucking good yeah they're there for a reason Yeah right really different they're not gonna get an open mic or the TED talk er yeah but they gotta bring your show right but they give opportunities to a lot of weird people I mean it is absolutely possible there must be I bet if we just ask I bet we're ignorant to it but we just say show me the TED Talks that suck a fat dick yeah they're gonna say okay Twitter Twitter people please show me the TED Talks that suck a fat dick yeah I mean if anyone wants to see the Sarah Silverman TED talk there was never let out she get a sec she gave us never let out no they never let it out cuz she made fun of Ted see I would have fuckin wanted to watch that immediate really and the thing is if you're confident is that you're loud you you can laugh at yourself they don't know how to laugh at themselves she made fun of Ted in what way like during her talk it's like the mythology of it I didn't see the talk obviously but there was a Sarah Silverman TED talk they'd never let out Wow Wow we need to get serious hey yeah I need to run into her somewhere I could I can make it happen okay am I gonna happen hurt um I I've never heard anything bad about Ted before so that's why this is such a shock it is weird though you meet the donors and stuff and they can't tell Asian people apart they can't tell African people apart and it's just it's weird man like they're nice and everybody means well did they call you David Choe ha ha no they they just mistake you for other fellows cuz so many of them are Asian really that's funny yeah how many different people do it every year uh every year they pick like 20 fellows and then they pick a bunch of other people for the main stage so yeah I mean no it is it is a ill Organization I still even though they booted me today I loved the speakers I loved the talks and I wanted to continue but I hope that they at least you know they could say I suck and that's fine they could be like Eddie's a shithead he went to LA he did the fucking podcast and he sucks but I hope they just changed rules for future people so listen you didn't do anything wrong they're crazy and all they represent is a distribution method for the greatest minds on earth that's all they represent it's not that they are the greatest minds on earth it's just there's so many interesting people today we live in amazing time and just when you good something like Ted whatever the Ted stands for it became synonymous on the internet with fascinating talks yeah boom and then it's off yeah but you wanted to you could do the Eddie Wong's you know fascinating motherfuckers on Vice and do the exact same thing yes like I think there's a lot of room for that cuz conferences like I would love to hear more people from you know downtown LA downtown New York walking and doing these ideas because they don't find those dudes they find academics they find people playing ancient instruments they find people that are you know working nature things and and they have their kind of like cultural sect you know but there is a lot of room to find genius in other place geniuses everywhere you know this yeah you travel around the world you find genius anywhere so there's room for conferences that like look under different cultures cuz they're kind of looking under the same stones all the time right and they're gonna run out of bugs yeah and I'm one of the I'm one of the first time they've stepped out to be like alright there's this dude he's Chinese he's in the hip hop he lives in downtown New York he used to sell drugs he now has a restaurant I think I was the only working chef that was a tenth fellow so I I was one of their choices that was really out there but it just didn't work out didn't work out cuz you're not willing to be a fucking slave and sleep in a hotel room with a stranger for a week yeah that's insane honey I rehearsed for two days I fucking did the tour I did everything I'm supposed to do and then I was like I'm a just peace out for like a half day in debug Wow you know you need that since that's crazy and in fact they don't pay you it's crazy you guys need to do a vice show exposing Ted how Looney ten apps I told vice that I would if I said before I got booted I sent them in email like yo you gotta see this shit it's like the beginnings of Scientology Wow it is so true that once people have a position of power and influence and people want to be a part of them Pio go corrupt yo and micros the fresh hole what is the threshold at which something becomes a religion yeah it's kind of insane it's so easy to start a cult today yeah there's so many people looking to jump on board you know all the people that would have a hundred years ago become Catholics now they're like man Pope just won't stop fucking kids I can't do this I need a new cult I don't know why people still believe in these like you look at what these people are doing like what these what's happening in the Catholic Church is insane fucking Pope's resigning yeah this is the first time it's gotten so hot that the Pope's like I'm out of here he's asked for immunity from the Catholic from the Italian government from prosecution because he's responsible for shielding pedophiles he personally and a lot of people don't know this the Pope personally responsible for taking pedophiles and shifting them away to another place where they molested more kids and what would you expect you don't these people aren't allowed to have sex yeah it's natural to want to have sex it's natural to want to go to LA and do podcasts you know soon that you cannot come to Ted and have sex without condoms I'd be like fuck that did you measure yours and no unprotected size there's no raw doggin at Ted legal law no ass fucking while you're here oh man now while you're at Ted fellow there would be mutiny I wonder if they would have liked you you could slowly start imposing behavior standards you know on fellows you know if you want to call it like a TED fellow or whatever new organization you want to start they do shit like you should have a standing you should give a standing ovation when this person calls you should do this and that it's not easy yeah that's what wait a minute wait a minute fake standing ovations yeah and they were also saying like you know when the founder comes Chris Anderson comes like you don't have to give him a standing ovation like you know it's nice if you want to but he doesn't actually need you to do it I'm like the fact that you needed to give me this fake halfway disclaimer is so fucking strange wow that's so strange ah yeah tell you who to and not to give standing ovations to who's a lot to apply you have to apply to go to Ted to attend and then once you're accepted you pay $8,000 hahaha that's a mind fuck wait a minute yeah you had to pay no hell no ID but the people who do it they apply like oh okay so that people that attend the strict audience members yeah oh you got to want to be so down so bad to do that to go through an application process and then fucking pay that's a lot of money how many people are going now maybe it'll go I don't I think uh like 2003 them whoa holy shit yeah that's a lot of money they make holy shit yeah that's a lot of money yeah they make offer you yeah two thousand people paying eight thousand dollars is how much six 360,000 no sixteen hundred what is it 160,000 know that what anymore no it's way more than that it's like sixteen million I think but yeah mm mm we're so Cyrus yeah 16 million mm time Jamie you don't know shit about your numbers yeah and I didn't even bother calculation shows masca asian always I'm asking Asians from now on pretty sure 16 million if Jamie you silly bitch what is a brunt do you ever go to calculate a bill tonight
