joey motherfuckin dears sup brother and just on the drive up here I was thinking about all the busted assholes that are in the hospital today from the gay pride parade yes can you imagine how many guys went down there just to say I love getting fucked me ass this time bro let me tell you something that was one of the biggest turnouts my friend went he said he had a fucking blast one of my buddies said he had a blast blast gay people great in fucking New York all over everywhere everyday they're celebrating they can be frightening but anybody who's got a problem with that is crazy but I'm the dark side let's talk about the facts here a couple confused little young white dudes went down a yesterday sure I'll go have a drink oh yeah some guys who just wanted to be an ally allied to the gay folks I just want you know I'm not gay but I am your ally next thing you know Jed's millionaire that's so brother that's what guys have to remember gay dudes are dudes it's the all same rules apply all same rules of scumbag eree that apply to men apply to gay men yeah that's like three types of game is this gay guys that aren't interested yeah there's gay guys the semi interested and the gay guys that live to convert it hurts my feelings as a 51 year old man that that's still a big deal that anyone cares at all it really does it hurts my feelings cuz I thought that by the time I was a fucking middle-aged 51 year old father that we'd be done with that people wouldn't care if other people were gay like of all this shit to worry about of all the shit in the world to worry about you worrying about guys who like guys like what do you give a fuck and they always go biblical they always go biblical like it's always that if God wanted the view in the Bible all that is that shit drives me crazy where I lived in my old house in North Hollywood there was a gay couple cross the street two dudes one was a pilot for a major airline and he was in the process and the other guy got fired from Target but being a transgender this goes back to 2010 and they had cats and you know me though I talked to the guys about cats there was an old guy down the block that would come home and talk to Mike you can't block them old white dude like he can't talk them cannon carries in that neighborhood I don't want to Morelos fucking assholes moving here and I go there round here feeding fucking homeless cats what's the you know I am right til this day whenever I go to my old neighborhood and I see him outside and pull over I talk to him say hello they're just too sweet people trying to be fucking it just being who they are trying to be who the fuck they are then we make jokes hey I made jokes from the whole thing but at the end of the day I learned the hard way and I talked about on stage the other night you were there when I said that my daughter invited me to a party yeah that she went to school with a kid and his parents are transgender and I felt kind of weird and I went and on the way out I looked at the kid I seen 60 transgender people they could they come from a community yeah and I saw this little kid smiling like I'm adopted that kids a doctor look what they're doing for that kid they're making him my wife like and I closed the door I went in right now and like I said in the joke I hugged the lead tranny just said I will fucking tighten that's it I eat the food nice yeah it doesn't matter it doesn't matter the only time it matters with me is with sports just stop with that just stop with that and where we're gonna be fine with this site look there's some statistic see if this is true that someone sent me that out of the 14 states that allow high school kids to compete as the gender that they they identify with rather than their biological gender in those 14 states transgender students are just dominating transgender male-to-female there's dominating there they're winning everything it's it's great I know you have problems with the boxer I have promised a lot of sports all of it when it when it comes to like power sports like I'm not sure they've done the work here I don't like this idea that every trend is like they use the excuse of outliers and the outliers are there some like super athletes like you can get a regular girl who weighs 145 pounds or you can get you know a run to Rousey weighs 145 pounds you know there's like there's extreme athletes that are people that are different right like Serena Williams is clearly a different level of athlete than a regular person right a regular girl who's like her weight she's just superior and I think that that is what you see with some of these transgender athletes that come over to become women they say well they're no different than like Ann Ann Woolf who was like a superior athlete female box your CN wolf knocked girls out no dude dude she haymakers his chick with the right hand and said when the ball's brutal one punch knockout so you've ever seen men or women perfect technique boom just wait Lay's this girl timber she falls out cold and there's not a whole lot of women other than maybe Amanda Nunez but Amanda Nunez is doing it with them little gloves on I wonder if she would be able to do it like that with those big gloves I think she probably could cuz she hits that goddamn hard but you know you got to judge each sport by you know the like we see Paulie Malignaggi goes over to bare-knuckle boxing he doesn't do that well in comparison to say like if somebody like you know like a really good high-level striker with knockout power with the big gloves on would you put like if you put Deontay Wilder and little gloves I don't imagine anybody being able to take that he's fucking people up at like a heavyweight with those big gloves so it's a different thing you know so who the fuck knows but that the idea is the outlier the outlier like the the if you get one superior athlete and then you have them sort of commensurate with the chance gender athlete a guy who was an athlete who became a woman and you know in his 30s and they just identify as goes through the surgery but how much benefit does he take of having testosterone flow through his body for 30-plus years we really don't know it doesn't mean you hate transgender people doesn't mean you don't love everyone doesn't you don't want everyone to live their life and and be whoever they want to be with a total freedom I don't think we have we have males compete against males for a reason because we feel like it's more fair even though it's not like it's not more fair if I'm playing basketball against Michael Jordan that's not fair he's better it is better athlete there's just people that have got to be way better than you no matter what you do like if I had trained all my life to be a better basketball player than Michael Jordan it's not even physically possible right so there's outliers in males but when the outliers when there's so many you have to when you see so many transgender athletes that are dominating in sports and then when you add combat sports which is how I got involved in this when a woman was doing that who was a transgender woman just not telling anybody and saying it was a medical issue well that's fucking crazy we all we know we want to pretend that everyone's equal you know we want inclusiveness and we want peace we want everyone to get along we want equality want gender equality okay I get it I see where you go but we also have to look at reality the reality is there's just fucking giant physical differences these transgender athletes are dominating against women who are born a woman they have to be a woman their whole life they never have 30 years of testosterone through their throne flowing through their veins it's like doing steroids for 30 years and then stopping it's crazy that's what I think you're freaking me out you know I just smoke some reefer me too man get me on this subject I don't even know how to follow Oh transgender people but but as human beings I love them all I love everybody dude I Eddie Izzard is one of my favorite guests of all time he's so interesting he's been transgender since 85 I believe he said prefers women likes women it was not not a gay fellow just likes dressing up as a woman and extremely intelligent very interest a fucking that special me very old 15 years ago was my mom yeah say what you want to say it was mine I was up there with the great specials because it hadn't loved a one-man-show tone to it yeah you didn't qualify it as a special but when you look at it as a whole it was a great fucking performance he's a special person and just happens to be transgender it kind of makes them even more interesting speaking about special people I got to apologize to you for something for me because I've always had this discrepancy last night I went out for a little while I got home I had a couple numbers in me I grabbed the fucking Apple I saw the cast online and I put the TV out of it in front of me was the Blues Brothers ooh what was the last time I watched The Blues Brothers I don't know so the scene that opens up is them at the restaurant when he's trying to

everybody snorting coke rodney was throwing a party they could you know this is a different type of movie these people having fun that's the difference dad and fun on that set there's probably alcohol the directors drinking you know he's keeping their bill how many extras of dancing fucking hundreds they were all in tune and it was like everybody loved that movie that's one of the rare movies with a musical scene that fucking everybody loved the Blues Brothers right now the Blues Brothers Scott I'm saying that live like that was a sketch I I guess so yeah Aykroyd wrote it mmm John Landis directed it they co-wrote it together Ackroyd's crazy into UFOs he's like one of the main celebrities they pull up when people start talking about I like UFO real believers he's done like little clips where he narrates things do you have faux shows and shit he fucking believes well didn't they just release that even more belief now but yeah those yeah it's fun I don't know if it's real but uh it's fun that's how I feel doc I did a podcast with jim Florentine and I explained the jim Florentine that what people don't know is that Hudson County New Jersey northern New Jersey is the number one place in the country where they have them UFO sightings really northern New Jersey look it up Jamie if you get a minute please not to be rude but isn't that like near a couple airports no it's closer to like that you know like when you live on New York City and then you look at the Hudson River they say that people on there babbling they're drinking coffee I talked on the phone and they'll see a little flying saucer and I know for a fact that in 1976 a little one whatever the fuck they are I know for a fact that in 1975 in 1976 you could check me out on this are you a full land in the Hudson County Park I was a kid in the next day the feds locked off the park that yellow tape they had samples go look it up dog they say you at fault busy that's you see that that that that's called the North Bergen is where I'm from that's called I forget what it's called but it was so there was it's a circular building so they did so much coke in there in the eighties they call this the grinder that's the thing called because it was shaped like a little hedge the Stonehenge I have a couple friends that lived there people that lived in that building have seen UFOs for fucking years and if you go to YouTube there's an actual North Hudson Park UFO they dug up they even they came out tomorrow there's a liquor store and the liquor store guy says he's seen the lights mm-hmm you heard like the organ music that they play hmm they landed a couple Martians got out and took samples and got back in the thing and took off there's a youtube thing there's a History Channel special about it and I still remember being a young kid do you find anything Jamie not give that that was what's popping up all this stuff about that building and it says a UFO landed that's what the story I'm reading right now is what he's saying yeah and witnesses you know it's not just one guy that says oh no UFO it's people who got knocked on the door and said dude did you see anything anything at 11:00 10:00 at night and I said you know what there were lights flashing outside they contacted police departments to see if there was a man they went full and the FBI came in circled the park closed it was by the Little League field in Hudson County but it is a step you know like you'd think it was area 51 you'd think it was close to the northern Vegas the number one place to see UFOs is northern New Jersey they even made a reference to it and The Sopranos when he said something he goes what are you talking about last week you said you said you have fallen hackensack because that's where they're at Hackensack Moonachie right though those you gonna Moonachie new jersey a lot of ugly yeah a lot of people with big heads the only new jersey this fuckin Segovia Spanish restaurant it's been there since nineteen fuck inch lemansky I don't know but that's the only good thing about Moonachie I think those people in Moonachie I've been abducted enough and they put them back as big-headed motherfuckers I did a gig there a couple times oh yeah they used to be like a bar there's a bar that did something Bob gonzo gig yes outside the seat Club was it yeah it's outside no no I think Bob is more down to shore he had a button well he had gigs all he had gigs all over Bob how I met Bob was he did a gig in Romano's Italian restaurant in my hometown and my buddy's like hey aren't you a comedian let's take you up there everyone up there Bob's like I don't know you know he's unknown and next thing Bob came up there's like I got to put you out cuz my friends threatened me so Bob poked me haven't we've become friends ever since that's awesome I think I follow I'm on Facebook we have a chat from time to time on Facebook but here for you UFO motherfuckers look into northern New Jersey that's the fucking mother lode of them that's interesting I read that before but I kind of go 51 51 UFO sightings in 2018 is a you get biased because the the the story is always some person in the woods and they get abducted they see a UFO and some strange town in the middle of nowhere the aliens land abduct people you always think about it being a rural thing but if I was an alien of course I'd go to New York City of course I go to New Jersey what what the fuck why wouldn't you you want to go see the craziest thing we have you got like seven million people stuff together on a fucking tiny island and in comparison to the rest of the planet stuff stacked on top of each other awesome amazing buildings in all these lights at Times Square look at all these people mowing around traveling over these bridges to get to this one hub there's one hive of humanity of course if I was an alien I would check that out why would I look at a barn you know no man you savage joked that well the United States is the Tijuana of outer space - they're like well we doing this weekend wanna fuck em they come down when they're fucked up and they want to see a shell policy that was the whole bit as I think aliens come here when they're high I did think they'd just get fucked up they like come on let's go let's go check out the monkeys this Cole dude come on let's abduct a couple of them have a good time let's go see there it's monkey pen I think I never saw a fucking UFO I want to I never have though I want to see it land and I want to see one of those green dudes get out so I think I I thought I saw some shit when I was a kid but as I got older I thought that was like a fighter jet or something that's what that was like there's something oh god it's a real sketchy memory it's one of those memories that's like barely active but I remember thinking for like a day or two when I was a little kid maybe I saw a UFO but I think I was trying to convince myself of it you know I was bored but I think it was a jet I think it was something something fast and unusual have you ever seen one of those stealth bombers that looks like a fucking UFO you're seeing one of those things in the sky no yes it looks like a star wars when you go to like a Blue Angels no those are like I think those are f-18s that's what I think it is I think that's what that is I flew in one of those I had a bit about that too yeah you hold on to the hand you got a do you hook either hold on your handle if you're steering the plane or you hold on your straps if you're a pastor I was a strut I was in the passenger seat so I grabbed the whole my straps and you have to go and you have to force blood in your brain stay awake that's how much g-force you're going through it's insane see that's that's one of those stealth bombers I saw one of those in the air over I guess it's Edwards Air Force Base is that what the one it is that's his Edwards the one that's out near Palmdale I think that's it cuz we used to film fear factor in palmdale and we saw that they fly overhead like that look at that thing tell me that doesn't look like it's from another planet when you're on the ground and you see that fly overhead you're like what the fuck is that so I think that's responsible for a bunch of the things that people saw I think it's military crafts connection question on an article you pulled up to 51 sightings what type of sightings do you look at this fucking thing what is considered what is considered a society well the thing is like you just see shit but how do you know if what are you doing you know these are the sightings okay we'll go back to that video look at that thing I mean come on if you're just sitting on the ground you saw that you're like they're coming the aliens are coming that does not look like it's from this world that thing is madness especially with those two guys next door cat it's fucking beautiful duh like what an amazing design that thing flying through it looks like something on a keyboard you know it's like a symbol on a keyboard and it's just flying perfectly through the air that looks like the future I mean that really does look like it's from another world I would imagine like little blue dudes black eyes and talking to each other in that thing right going through fucking wormholes and shit and that's what that thing looks like and what's the what's the thing that they're gonna have a hundred years from now just imagine that I just want to know what what the logistics is for it to be considered a legenda illegitimate sighting legitimate sighting legitimate sign it just means that someone saw it you know you you don't like if you're a lawyer okay and you see something and then you convince yourself that what you saw was something extraordinary I mean you have the feeling that you're looking at something from another world but if it's just some drone or some military vehicle and then you look at it and then you convince yourself then it becomes a bigger and bigger deal in your head that's a problem with people doesn't mean that everybody that see something is seeing that people are kind of full of shit well let's see you see let's say there's a 1-800 call Martian mmm-hmm alright I see a fucking thing I call that twenty hundred calm I saw Martian ok whatever the fuck okay 1-800 Martian right I don't the fall off stop ring okay the phone stop ring it will never start playing it be people knocking the Martians my concern is when do they consider it incredible what does it take for it to be credible for me for it to be credible I got to see the motherfucker land get out my might take is usually military guys when when you have military fighter pilots that's a extraordinary human those that's a you know if you can be one of those guys that flies one of those b12b twos to for them to trust you with that billion-dollar fucking spaceship dude you got to be a an exceptional human you there's no room for someone who's full of shit you're gonna be a top-flight fighter pilot you're gonna fly around with gunfights in the sky because that's what they do they have gunfights in the fucking sky those guys are exceptional human beings so when they see something that's when I listen for sure everybody else I'm not not not that I wouldn't listen but I don't know you know you might be crazy but if some and you might be crazy even if you're in the military you might be crazy if you're a fighter pilot it's 100 percent for those fighter pilots and all those if what's pilots that do test runs and whatever they they see they say that things there's a bunch of signings not another thing a bunch of sightings is a bunch of sightings from these really credible guys what is it fleet of UFOs followed US aircraft Navy pilot says yeah I'm not all about see these guys that are talking about these things these aren't guys with histories of embellishing things there's I mean they have this whatever that is is that radar what are they looking at is that infrared like what is that screen that they're looking for does it say what kind of image it is because it's like a weird look it's not like a photograph right it's like a weird computer image because it's um it's it's detecting it right with some piece of equipment right isn't it like tracking on radar or something like that I know what you're saying I feel like I've heard that description of it too with this this article just says it's a video of two aerial encounters but that video doesn't look very clear why isn't it clear my phone does a better job not shit cameras on those I mean that was better have good kind of mean they don't have good ones but like and we're gonna catch movement at that high speed up there yeah all that stuff oh so it would require some exceptional gear I think and it could have also been at night I don't know what time of day it was mmm so convenient so convenient do they never have a clear picture that drives me fucking crazy drives me fucking crazy because if it is real I am I love I want it to be real honestly I really do but when I look at I go god damn so many people are so crazy and so many people are so full of shit you personally believe and so do I don't don't don't that mean there's other galaxies out there it has to be well they're definitely the galaxies of the civilization those civilizations yeah some form somewhere how the nine planets has got a beat dude there was something but I don't know what I'm not gonna sit here and tell you what they called or whatever but there has to be something at this point you have to believe that the universe is too big it's just too big to discount to say no I doubt it like that's so crazy to say this is because we haven't seen it yet it's so big okay nobody caught in what he said that though tracking equipment radar and infrared cameras on his aircraft detected UFOs both times he was unable to capture them on his helmet camera okay so maybe we couldn't look at it hmm get it and good vision or whatever I maybe ya know or that's a good accent why he I would imagine as fast as those goddamn things are going it must be really hard to focus in and out and that's interesting he says that lieutenant Ryan Grimes believes graves whatever a squadron of UFO foul his Navy Strike Group up and down the eastern coast of the US for months hmm that's I'm Tonya ya little fucking I read something about the Hudson River and all those people have live across the Hudson River whether on the Weehawken Edgewater side or the west side of Manhattan those are where the people and their balconies see all that shit look at this shit we did have issues with them when we went to the Middle East lieutenant grave said okra Majan them following the war imagine if you were there were aliens and they came down to follow the war so they see the war going on in Iraq Afghanistan come down and they're checking it out just to go on a cynical side of this they're not necessarily saying they are an alien ship they're saying it's a UFO so it's something they're not sure of what are some sort of awesome drone that some middle-eastern company hasn't it can just follow shit upon semester or something sure that would be the more likely death its explanation right terrestrial would be more likely that someone has advanced shit we know they have advanced yet I mean we know they have incredible drones you know I mean the stuff that they can do no very they got drunk that Green Berets of SEALs you put razor blades on and they slit your fucking throat when you're driving whoa that's how good the technology is on those drones Jesus Christ I wouldn't be shocked if they give you all kinds of things you're gonna be standing there and they could take the drone to just come down no fucking way but razor blades onto some shit well you could totally see someone having a small drone like a small thing like the size of a cheeseburger that adds poison in it and you just slam it into somebody you can I could see that this but but you're seeing when you're seeing stuff that's flying around the sky most likely is made by a person because people make stuff and people know how to make stuff that flies around the sky but then when you get to shit they like defies physics like some of the things these fighter pilots see that's when you got to go wait a minute you see these extraordinary feats of traversing distances like they can get from one place to another place so fast it looks like they disappear this is something they all talk about they all talk about the insane speed which these things can go they could just change angles they can just go and then take a hard right angle turn they can do stuff that nothing that we know how to make can do that's where it gets to be like whoa like nothing it's not like it's like oh that's like a fighter jet but like really fast you know I'm saying it's like an alien car oh it's like a car but it's way faster you know it's an alien car but this is not like anything that we make these fucking things they fly this way they say flat like a like a plate hovering over the ground or but when they go to fly when they go to take off they flip up sideways and they have like the bottom of the spaceship is pointing towards where it wants to go and it does something to space and time make some sort of fucking magnetic gravity connection insert big spooky words whatever they know they don't know how the fuck it does it right this thing can go like insane distances and insanely small amounts of time then when they all report the same kind of behavior of these there's so many of these reports are like that they're talking about this thing that goes insanely fast turns on its side it looks like a tic-tac it looks like a saucer it looks like they're trying to figure out what the fuck the shape is because it's moving so goddamn fast but it's doing stuff that nothing we know how to make can do I don't know if it's from another planet it might be from here it's exciting shit I wanted to be from another planet that's what I want like unbiased like what am i honest what I would I would love it just be completely honest I would love it if was aliens but it was people I'd be even more scared because they goddamn people can do that people can do that and no one knew like some because if you could imagine a person who can make a spaceship that defies all of the rules that we know about travel about air travel they can make something that defies all that shit and somehow another keep the whole development and production of it a secret and then have this thing and take it off and no one knows how the fuck they did it that's almost more impressive than aliens because that's what these things are doing is so if these are these pilots are accurately reading what's happening and they're telling the truth the thing that's remarkable is their stories are very consistent there's a lot of very similar stories from different people that there make a living flying superfast warships hope they see things they know what the fuck they're looking at they see something they don't know like what in the fuck is that when they see something like that that freaks me out that's when he gets me because when it's some fucking kids riding his bike to school and he looks up and he sees a UFO okay maybe it did happen maybe it did happen maybe the kids being 100% honest or maybe he was bored maybe he was bored and decided to make up a crazy story and stuck with it and then after a while telling it maybe he believed in himself that happens to people see things they don't know what they're seeing they decide that it's a different thing I've said this before but it's a true story when I was in in Alberta there's wolves there and I thought I saw a wolf for like a whole second it was a squirrel fucking squirrel but I saw gray fur movement wolf squirrel like if you're dumb or if you're compromised or if you're a little drunk maybe a little tired you know maybe just saw something that looked really weird because of you know whatever weather conditions that are affecting some part of the world you live in these things called ball lightning flies through the air you know it's it looks like a UFO you ever see that shit it's like a real natural phenomenon somebody might see something like that and then add a bunch of other shit to it and that's where you get a lot of these stories they get like natural phenomenon and then people are adding a bunch of shit to things but then on top of that you have credible stories and you can't throw out any of them like you got a you it's when you look at all these things you can't decide just because there's a bunch of crackpot stories about UFOs that the ones by legitimate fighter pilots that those aren't real you can't look at it that way it's crazy to look at it that way because it's more likely there's something out there then there isn't something out there there's way more likely when I was a kid that happened Hudson County Park I wrote it off I didn't even pay attention I'm a man riding my bike up there saying the Fed tape and seeing people with those orange protective suits on yeah well I didn't I was like these people fucking out in my mind then one that I got I five or six years ago and I saw it if somebody had posted on Facebook a YouTube and I read more more into it and I discounted it until I read the accounts of the 28 people you know in that building the liquor store there was a guy who had just got dropped off a bus in New York the buses drop you off there from New York mm-hmm the bus driver said there was a flash he thought you know there was just so many people with stories that you know they didn't see a fucking guy get out only three people saw people get out hmm nobody else discounted the lights and the noise and other bullshit that went with it I wanna shit my fucking pants if I live in that building I saw three little Martians get out or they could just be fucking hold on who knows who gives a fuck yeah man you just wanted to tell you that that's where people can get freaked out and they can you know they can think all kinds of things that didn't really happen any one night I was on acid I thought it was a fucking I thought the FBI was out there with dogs laughter next day it was fucking a fire I know all right I dumped the ounce of coke down the toilet oh my god he does i hallucinating because when you doing coke more than fucking ten hours you start hallucinating I started hallucinating I thought it was fucking dogs and it was a fire hydrant you know how stupid I felt the next day pretty fucking stupid huh pretty fucking stupid i sat there and I went over and patted the hydrant you fuck you fuck this is the problem with any story liked all these fucking UFO stories it's people's memory memories not that good it's not that good it's too hard to figure out what it actually looked like after you saw it like you see something crazy like a year ago and then you try to describe it it's too hard to describe like you barely remember it your version of it is a rehashed version that you keep repeating to yourself you know if you saw something like say if you're hiking and you saw a wolf right if you saw that wolf when you try to describe that that moment you saw that wolf years later look what what are you actually seeing when you're going into your memory how much do you sell we're always lying about how accurate our memory is it's not that good if you did see a wolf which is an extraordinary moment right you're in the fucking forest all fat off and you see a real wolf looking down on you a wild motherfucker in the woods of Canada just looking at you staring at you on a trail that's an extraordinary moment but if you try to recount that in your mind ten years later what do you actually see how much do you actually see you see this blurry weird fucking misty version and you've got some words that fall into place that can describe it but how accurate is your fucking memory it's terrible how I could is your memory it's good with statistics okay look I can tell you about fights I can I can tell you what years someone fought I can tell you how this guy won and how he beat you know this many guys are the triangle and I remember things but if I actually have to remember that what it actually looked like in my head I can't really pull that up I barely can pull it up but I see it I'll recognize it again you know if you show me Joe shilling knocking out Melvin Manhoef in Bellator I said watch that ko so many times a wild crazy slugfest and if I see it I'm watching it happen in a video I remember it yep this is how it goes here it goes boom DK awesome but if I had to just pull that out of my brain right now it's not good you know I'm saying like if I had it like if I have to like close my eyes and pretend I saw Mike Tyson knock out Michael Spinks I kinda can see blue flashes I can kind of remember weird little parts of it you know I remember the final right hand boom it just sends him flying through the ropes it was chaos it was just like he's the best ever but if I had to like play it back in my head it wouldn't be nearly as good as a video of it how is the memory in your life how are the memories of your life do you remember being three young B five like I was fucking suffering like my suffering I was like trying to taking my dad my dad died when I was three I'll have to hold memories well I have two memories that I can look you in the eye I don't remember what he was wearing or what shoes he was worrying by stealing my driving from the Lincoln Tunnel from New York New Jersey and him put me on my lap no seat belt and me hold on to the steering wheel Wow and I still remember him and my mom having a discussion and then taking me with him that's it nothing else Wow you know you try to go back on your memory and you start to write a little bit you memory gets better I don't when your memory gets better the problem is with my memory I'm always wondering how much of this is accurate you know how much what I mean how much of it was I really paying attention during the moment and really being like to it like if you have a biased perspective of something that's happening and then you have a memory of it how much does your memory of the bias perspective memory in the biased perspective shape what you think happened you could actually kind of twist the past in your head if you're not careful and you start thinking about things that didn't really necessarily happen the way they like if you got I get fucked over at work you know I had to come and my fucking pension and all this and then you you look at it from that way wow this guy worked for an evil company that fucked him over or you go to the employers and some of the other people who work with the governor no no no that guy was a fucking asshole he made life at work hell nobody wanted him around he didn't get fucked over he was so negative nobody wanted to be with him in the office we had to get rid of him like you have to look at it from their point to you don't know so the actual memory of it for that guy might be that he got fucked over by this evil company but the memory of the other people is a completely different experience the memory of the other people is this guy was annoying to work with oh and they're both you know it's both I mean who the fuck knows who's right but my memory is good at some places and completely bad and others like right now my memory of thirty years ago the spot-on I can take conversations we had we honestly what we did a year ago like I'll sit here and go what do i do last fourth of July I have no fucking idea well I went home when I went home for three weeks I I went to dinner with a friend of mine and then the way back I had him in tears telling him about the night his arm got broken you know he looked nearly cheated me in the face and he knows Joey I forgot I broke my arm it's amazing we remember how the fuck do you remember that go that was one of the best nights of my life I never laughed so hard my friend he drove his car at my friend you know people wanna come and they drive yes he didn't stop in time I need to have my friend my friend went down who's hilarious is is he got up he went to take a swing at this guy and the guy put his arm up and when he hit he broke his own with the punch but all over the punch and he had a word cast and we tortured him and my friend kept threatening to sue him and it was just a he and he well I was telling him this his face was red he had to take his napkin down and he was banging the table he goes coax I just remembered the broken fucking arm I know he's my age because I forgot you know before you came in Jamie and I were talking about Achilles tendons and I still remember the time ripping and pulling the hamstring like having to go to the hospital I was 15 and having the fucking doctor do or something and it was bruised blood was running from my ass to the top of my leg it was fucking horrible hmm I just ripped the hamstring we were talking about you know like just that you know and then this this a theory that this times like you go back to Newark like you I don't know if there's a fire you going in to work that fight no I'm not I'm not working that one but let's pretend you went back to Newark and you went to Syria grandpa lived and you saw a corner store that was still there this is interesting and you go into that corner store and maybe you got a bag of wise potato chips maybe you get a bun that you went there and God they say by tasting that bun and it takes you back it opens up all those fuckin memories while by eating something from the area something something it's like sometimes a song will tell you something right fucking songs really yeah for sure that's why it's important sometimes when you watch a movie or TV shut to have a soundtrack because we have a soundtrack we all have a soundtrack of our lives a couple years ago i was on the podcast and we were talking about some on Jovie new ir I remember give me some chicken stab and listen it's about Joey stuff like that you know say like you'll see you're even saying I fuck Mary Lou Smith in the ass listen you know it just brings you back it just brings you back but they say this you're examples that bring it back yeah it was me and my best friends we're by the lake no no banging some yes most guys most guys will hear a song don't be by themselves don't be by that with your wife and your kids you know you'll hear never say goodbye to Bon Jovi and you're thinking tonight that drunk midget chick sucking your dick - her - you never told nobody it just comes back it comes back to haunt you for a minute you know a shit like that always go that was the song that sentence in prison - like whatever I don't fucking know like when I got locked up the big album was Appetite for Destruction the big of the big one I got locked up the big hours for the regular people Appetite for Destruction for the brothers it was don't be cruel by Bobby Brown that album he made so long when he split from new edition so every time I hear don't be cruel the other one every time I hear especially that fucking mr. brownstone every time I him mr. brownstone I want to crash the car because all the bike is to shoot heroin for that song you know I'm saying like it's time for mr. brownstone that's all they would talk about so every time I hear those two albums I fucking think about being locked up and what's on the rap ever since Guns and Roses went on tour that's all you hear on the radio now but the radio for five minutes every day you in over rain walking to the jungle because that's it that's it right every time I hear those jams I think about that's stupidity that's fun welcome to the jungle was mine but there's a lot of people who will say to you like oh you know I make love I used to make love to my girlfriend listen for that out you know whatever but there's some people animals and say you know yeah the truth I used to get my dick sucked listen when I was 14 yes music more than anything is like an imprint of the time of the of your life when you saw it like if you go back and think about like for me it was stripes with Bill Murray I think I was I had to be a teenager what you to stripes come out what year was that 81 perfect so I was 14 years old that meant that was I was in ninth grade I was a freshman in high school so that when I think about that movie like that was the the epic movie of our time when I was a kid was like that was I think about that time of the year or that at that time of my life you think about who you were you know it brings you back to a weird place like it's it helps it enhances the memory fucking tremendous that was a great movie more when he was such a funny movie think about the line yes the fat dude why join the service and the guy goes I want to lose a couple pounds and he was amazed amazing in this it's a fucking great movie man it was just so good at the time you know it just you had a smile on your face through the whole movie like even the moments of the movie that weren't like hilarious when they're setting things up you just it was so well done you just smiled all are you guys looking at this ass you got the guy from Beverly Hills Cop you got Zito from Miami Vice you got fucking Howard Ramos who was a blessing in my life he legitimize me when I did his movie the movie was terrible but he was phenomenal otherwise that's awesome I don't know what this brother went on to do but you know this is fucking great calm but look at Bill Murray this is no no man this is the height of Bill Murray now you guys gotta remember we were just talking about another great movie a couple minutes ago didn't these both come up the same year did they yeah 8180 this is the shit we were going through this is why we talk about movies and music it's not that we're old men fucking being nostalgic I'm telling you the truth mm-hmm they were making great movies at this time there was a few great movies yeah a few there was a few yeah I mean I mean quite a few I should say this planes trains and automobiles that come out 83 82 84 you know you got it the comedy lesson is we were getting those years 87 well let's think of this like just cinematic look when you're did the Godfather come out 73 73 702 Exorcist 73 the mechanic 73 it was just too much mmm just those three movies right there The Godfather the mechanic and The Exorcist yeah and if you look at who was up for an Academy Award the 73 you'll fucking die you'll die you go how the fuck can they pick a winner there it's also imagine the stark contrast between that and 53 1953 the movies were kind of corny you know even if they were good they were kind of corny you know if you go any earlier than that like to watch King Kong ever watch I watched it with my kids and wife wasn't home and they were scared they're like I don't want to watch a scary movie I go we're gonna won't laugh at a silly scary movie and they're like really I go you got trust me this movie was from so long ago that what they thought is scaring you're gonna think is silly and they're looking you serious because they they go okay but if we get too scared just shut it off right I'll go I'll definitely shut it off they were like I think seven and five at the time you just fuck you movie it's so fake looking and the gorilla comes out they thought it was hilarious and then because we talked about it being funny then they were just laughing hysterically and cracking all these jokes about what that thing like looked like that it looked like my youngest daughter said it looked like someone was moving poop around but it looked like just like it was made out of poop because it's all clay it looks so dumb but you know back then that was as good as it got whoa look at the new Godzilla no Godzilla's got awful people leaving with a fucking headache are they yeah look at the old gods oh it's a comedy it is oh my god you see those poor little Japanese people look at this though and yeah we don't think this looks but it just raised a huge man look at these guys like yeah buddy you're not in a plane it's like so fake looking you know like these guys flying around and look how bad the gorilla looks it's so crazy but at the time this was unbelievable this was amazing so if you go from this to like Apocalypse Now the jump in terms of like how impactful it is and how much they nailed it like this is it's a fun movie man don't get me wrong I have a King Kong poster on my wall in my house I love the movie I love this movie I live a movie poster from the night cuz I'd much rather see the old Godzilla's godzilla vs. mortola versus the smog what's the Godzilla just to see what Japanese people were doing yeah they had the string on them they would see wide shot so they would show the Chinese people running and then they would just have a single shot moving through the air yeah they're Japanese Japanese look how dopey looks like even when it's lit up that is fucking fun man that's fun look he's going through the fucking electric God so let us give a fuck the shooting um fuck you yes you know they can't show you a behind shot of the Japanese shooting Godzilla cuz there's really no God they just shoot into a wall it's completely separate this is like a real clay model if you look at her he's really not sixty feet it's maybe fucking eight inches or something no this is not a model these suits this is the difference between King Kong and the oh shit yes these are men in suits and it's really complicated and these guys had to be really strong because they're carrying around this gigantic rubber suit and it's heavy it's fucking hot as fuck so the reason why it moves so fluid what the Japanese did that was brilliant was they had men and they put men in these monster suit looks just a fucking above his mouth yeah go in now Google the man who wore the Godzilla suit it's actually pretty fucking cool it's not easy to do these guys had to walk around and have these fight scenes and shit in these big giant suits that wasn't animation that's a dude in there this isn't that crazy and that's that's what it really looked like in terms of height wise it's like the size of a person see that guy go back a bit you see that guy getting out of it that right there that's what the dude looked like who's inside of it he burned them who saw it was like a clay model man no no some King Kong's a clay model King Kong was claymation from Ray Harryhausen that's how I got onto the subject with them I was telling them about they loved that Monsters Inc show and Harry Hewson is one of the characters or something about Harry using his in the movie I said huh I go do you guys know that is and they don't know I said that is the guy who of course they didn't know who it is well fuck my talking line but I said that's the guy who was one of the original monster animators for four movies like King Kong he did all that claymation stuff and back then I mean that was the state of the art you gotta think that's nineteen fuckin thirty something I was like King Kong was what 33 yeah Godzilla that was later that was post-world War two yeah see you got it 5450 fools post post World War two was Godzilla Godzilla's after we we shouldn't say we somebody from the United States drop bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki when they used nuclear weapons the idea was that and all the nuclear tests that they had done in the water there was no real understanding of what the fuck was gonna happen and so the science fiction version of that would be that all that radiation would create some super monster yeah the man the Japanese no I gotta give it to him they were dealing with radiation poisoning and death on unbelievable an unbelievable scale I mean hundreds of thousands of people wiped out instantly from atomic bombs I mean and so the just a sheer force of the power of those things you couldn't even imagine that there could be anything that could do that just one thing that falls out of an airplane that can do that well what else can it do you know well what happens if it gets in the water what is it how does this chicken affect fish how's it gonna affect you know who know so the the science fiction version was always awesome like a Godzilla would come that's what the new ones about to write anyone is same kind of thing like a dinosaur got zapped and now that I believe the new one was all the other dinosaurs came back and they had to reawaken Godzilla because he is the only thing that can fight him oh he's a super superhero never bring him back he's a good guy in this one oh no he's not a good guy at the end of the last and everyone complained because there's like this weird Winky scene where like Godzilla and the main guy like looked at each other in the eye or like same team bro you know the real Godzilla's man the real Godzilla Circe's are not Cersei that what the folks are named the dragon mother of dragons dragon and the Game of Thrones that fucked up that city at the end like that's that's what a like a real that's a real horrific idea of a fire-breathing lizard but Godzilla was always adorable didn't really go after people even the early even the early Superman's the first like six episodes you could see the string really check it out that's a little black and white this is Ben violet maybe the pilot in the first three episodes so they figured out how he could do it you could see his train it's a weird the Godzilla stories a weird story right because it sound like Godzilla goes on a killing spree it just goes through Tokyo and just starts lighting every building on fire he doesn't do that he's like almost like he is almost like a good guy lizard and in the new movie it's more accentuated then so he has to help help us and Walter I was the fucking Mothra was a moth Mottram was a moth yeah and what was the smog monster caravan there's all tamanna wrote there Rodin was yes look like I'm trying to remember like wings and shit right didn't Rodin have wings you got again this is craziness shit oh that's right lope Rodin could fly look at that one with the blue sky below on three oh there's a three-headed one yeah but this is new monsters these are the new ones the new what the fuck a day with this new shit give me the blue sky right there with that yeah right there that's kind of TV show it was the smog monster had laser beams coming out of his fucking eyes like Medusa yes he did yeah one of them had fucking laser beam did you really think that oh my god the three-headed things that was that called again I forgot about that three-headed the King Ghidorah Oh Gaeta remote Rock Road and it was Ghidorah yeah just pull up a video of Godzilla versus Ghidorah it was so silly but man when we were little kids this shit yeah lose your mind I used to love dishes the best when you found out Godzilla's gonna be on TV or so pumped from the actual new movies oh there's a new movie with Peter so it's not that this movie is out right now it is it Godzilla king of the monsters yeah that's why in bronze in this all three of these are let me see these bitches whoa special effects today so god oh my god dude the special effects they can do today are insane so we're looking at it says King gh I do RA H King Ghidorah oh my god dude the fucking special effects are insane there's Mothra Wow is this supposed to be a good movie though the things with these movies is and I really hate to say this how come they can't do both how come they can't have animate amazing special of 40 percent on Rotten Tomatoes how come they can't have amazing special effects and a fucking killer story no I can't they do that I was that's one of the last of the great 2009 is 10 years ago yeah which one was that avatar avatar was a great story with great special effects like it was good at the end of it people it's Pocahontas in space get over it okay yeah it is it's it's a classic story like James Campbell always talks about this classic structure of these hero's journeys there's a lot of that in there it's very similar to a lot of those stories it's still great don't let that get in the way of the fact that it's great that movie was fucking awesome that movie was awesome just a special effects in the way it all went together and yeah that fucking the bad military guy was cartoonish yeah of course he was so what why let that get in the way with your fun think of it as like when a movie like that I think of it is like it's like a lot of the hyper-violent Tarantino movies like you know what you're signing up for you know you know what it is it's not supposed to be some detailed analysis of the human psyche you know where the guy takes a strange slow transformation over the course of two hours no it's a fucking bad guy this is the bad guy here's a good guy good guy can't use his legs wouldn't be awesome if you could be one of those blue things papow I literally fucking fucking movies great I never saw it I never wanted to see it look they put too much money into it too much they could make a movie if I give you a 6 on a million dollars it's not yeah any idiot can make a movie if I give you such other milk Joe EADS James Cameron James camera is a monster I love James there's so many amazing we've made some great movies I think that's like building an ego it was like fucking building a team to put a movie together which I understand but 600 million you know per Husker nominated but I love when they shunned him they shunned him know who shunned him at the Oscars he walked in and he thought he was bad to the bone he was sitting there with his little new girlfriend and his ex-wife directed Hurt Locker well so they both up for the same thing oh and he's sitting there looking at Spielberg like winking and I went got all the other white people it was happening and all sudden they go to announce the winner of the best movie and they showed up at Barbra Streisand Oh once you pay her fee you know what her number is just a walk out of hand what's the number big big big look Barbra Streisand look when she does the theaters like this I think it's a more expensive than the fucking Laker ticket when she did the Staples Center cheapest ticket three bills buy the refrigerator thousand to sit on the floor Barbra Streisand they'll fuck around so when they call her it's cuz she's white somebody's ass all up even James Cameron knew what he saw he's put his head down look at the tape he knew what he was done and she came out and gave it he lost that to his wife Hurt Locker though was that was like a culturally significant movie at the time of a war those super well done there was no bullshit in that movie like that that is a good fucking movie her lockers one of those moves at the end of it you go Jesus speak of a Hurt Locker did you see what happened in New Jersey yesterday what happened ice went to New Jersey to go into some Jewish place and Jews got together and held hands and 36 of them got arrested I've always said those Jersey Jews don't fuck around Doug he's ghost Jews all of them New York's Brooklyn they held hands and went up against ice good for those little young kids they don't fuck around those juries I was telling me last night I'll leave you know they somewhat make braces in Jersey and they do all across the country there's just a lot of Jews in Jersey I just wear neck braces did you know that why because then they're under lawsuit Oh like every time I go to the Meadowlands that'd be a guy's neck braces are at the Meadowlands and I asked around what cause on you you don't know what that is they're on the they have somebody on the paper like they have a court case going oh that's so fun so they got away fucking neck braces and they calling the Jewish gold chains a Jewish gold chain so Rick was you gonna get a fucking neck brace to get the backwater of New Jersey like a fuck didn't the Jewish folks are interesting in that it's a religion and a race it's a religion it had a both right kind of because a lot like Jewish Ari's Jewish but our he's not religious anymore at all no he went over did the whole fuckin but he's Jewish yeah yeah it's a different animal there's a lot of Jewish atheist you're like how how the fuck how can you do that how does that work they just do it they identify with that tribe it's a part of a tribe it's like a tribe right like a tribe and a religion and a race sorry three things stop when I was a kid I know a Jersey Jew it was a turn his name was cuz his love I'm gonna name it smart Wow people gone dumb because they called him guaranteed 30 like he would get you thirty thousand for it my people will cut that thumb and just put on it okay Jersey but early Jesus and then you take an advance from you get hurt and you're taking advance simcoe's let me get 10 G's when we were in Brooklyn last time when we're going to UM Peter Lugar's and so we drove through these Hasidic neighborhoods and these you know we're the ones like re there's Orthodox Jews there's a big community of Orthodox against but in in New York and Brooklyn particularly and Ari was explaining out they don't leave this community this is where they they stay these are all their people they don't give a fuck about what's happening in the outside world wow I just you just see this interesting subculture that it's one of the more cool things about New York cuz you get to be in that comment that sounded like a genuine even though they're isolated they have their own neighborhood it's a genuine melting pot in that regard you can go to a Chinatown like a real Chinatown you go to Chinatown New York City that's a different animal man I mean you might as well be in some part of Asia amazing this restaurant what's the name of it whoa hop where's that it's in Mott Street it's open 24 oh yeah you gotta make a that's real 24-hour just in New York just put the fucking menu up from whoa hop when I was near shooting that movie the one that I was starving I got stormed and that one there ya go I can't do it I called wall hop and what time you opened okay go we'll open I hung up the phone I went on who but it was a $10 cab ride and I go I'm gonna go to Wawa but I chickened out Jerome I don't want it that goes to war - doing the one you're gonna find it back mall that sodium will fucking kill me when the lobby up don't fucking I'll be up for two days we often went to Chinatown after playing pool because it was like the best thing that was you know back myung early stand-up days when I didn't have obligations we'd stay up playing pool till 2:00 3:00 in the morning and go and you have a real meal like a really good meal yeah its meal at night with egg rolls and steak on a stick fuck yeah and I'm just a pork fried rice alone will set you off once there even diet coke back then when did Diet Coke get invented now there's always been we always have yeah we always had three kids my mother refresh content I drank tap my mother had tab people got super sad one tab one away remember like people be all bummed out I love tab but a girls drink dad that was a grocery yeah tab fresca fresca was more of a girls drink but tab was a girls drink because a paint can wasn't didn't tab of like a pink yes yes that's 1982 that's when tab went away now diet coke oh wow I thought it was older than that hmm me too yeah I still remember in 85 when they changed the recipe that was 85 motherfuckers went nuts they went crazy and they really they went crazy new coke like what your on coke why would you fuck with the taste of the best soda of all time coca-cola is the best tasting soda of all this is other stuff that's really good like root beer is really good it's interesting but there's a reason why that shit sold a billion fucking trillion gallons over the past so tap had saccharin in it and led the bladder cancer in rats people found that out and then that popularity declined exactly when Diet Coke came out 1982 oh they got set up put on your pink oh your yeah your pink tinfoil um let me see a picture of it with the tab can look like was it pink I'm trying to remember see again memories okay like I was talking about I know that that registers with me okay I know that that makes sense yeah that's what tab looks like that makes sense but that looks like it wasn't going to call a company also yeah I think coca-cola discontinued tab put more fucking cancer in it sold this diet coke what I was gonna say is I can't I could never draw that like if you asked me to draw what a tab can looks like okay look I wouldn't be able to I was in that realm or that read but I don't wasn't coca-cola right that's what I'm talking about with memory you know memories is a weird thing it's very weird because my memory with numbers is pretty good I remember a lot of important dates and times and things and statistics I can remember a lot of statistics and I remember a lot of fights I could go pretty pretty much tell you what the outcome was how much do I remember of seeing it how much can I pull up and watch again how accurate is that oh no like I was more of a sporting guy when I was growing up and yesterday I was on a plane and they had DirecTV on there and they were showing the best time I was looking at the iPad anyway I was watching something on the iPad but that screen was on they was showing the best 10 football plays and they showed Joe Montana Florida Dwight Clark in 81 and run away my memories that wait a second I won eight hundred on that game does it had the over I had San Francisco getting a point there fucking Dallas went into San Francisco given a point in those days she's not on my clock see how in snowy Joey was throwing Heat that's what snowy Joey was up this coke throwing fucking touchdowns up there Joe Montana like I have all like ice Jesus Christ oh no no there was a catch that some giant made with one hand I don't know what the fuck oh my god they showed the best 10 catches I was sitting and I was looking at them but then I saw this one catch I don't know what the guy thinks the kid they traded he just reaches up and the defendant he fucking pulls of it oh my I don't know if it's Odell Beckham I don't was all go back it's like his specialty is doing those catches did you see Francis in Ghana knockout Junior dos Santos yeah I didn't think it was a real knockout he just blushed them look up he hit him and he went down and held his head let him fight it out listen that fight was over yeah listen to me I was over it doesn't matter the scary thing is he just clipped and clipped him he clipped him rocked him put him down pounded on his head and junior just couldn't he move he just laid there and take it and they stopped it quick there was a hundred percent legitimate hundred percent legit so it's between you and I that this would go a little long I thought that he was a seasoned veteran I thought that he would go at least take him into the third round and try to no you know nullify his power by the third round you can't keep throwing those fucking hey make this I thought he was gonna wrestle him it was not what I anticipated it was not the game plan I thought I got off stage and it was starting is I got a is that walked into the green fuck didn't they were going and I was so fucking happy I'm like let me watch this I go I think June he has a shot as I thought that he was already having a floor holding his fucking boy jr. had a good start where he was kicking the leg especially the the lower part of the leg you could really write someone up with yeah yeah he knocked him off balance and that can really fuck you up man like really mess up your movement and if that was the case if we was able to mess up his move and get him to miss a little bit you know may get him so that he was having a hard time moving correctly and keep chewing on that leg then maybe there would be openings for him to to jump in with some punches the problem is when they're both on the outside Francis is bigger and the contact are way more grave and Frances Clips you it's 99 I don't care who you are he's so confident in it too he moves forward and he's gonna throw everything full-speed the first round with him is extremely dangerous because he's just trying to take you the fuck out it takes a guy like steep a steep a Miocic saw what he was doing and what he did was just ride with it just moved away from him kept his hands up when Francis was coming after me used good defense and he kept moving and kept pick picking away at him picking away out picking away and I'm taking his shots when they were there and then started wearing Francis down taking him down beating him up and then just dominated I'm clear-cut unanimous decision for five rounds it takes a guy like that a guy like Steve a that has the mental fortitude to stick to a gameplan not panic in the firefight because that's what happens with in Ghana you like Jesus Christ I'm gonna see lights any second now I'm gonna see a big flash and I'm gonna be out cold any second now it's coming and you see the reaction they have to them it's they fight different they fight different with him than they do with anybody else because the consequences are so grave you watch the way he knocked out Alistair Overeem the consequences are so grave so everyone's scared no matter it's normal everyone's scared to fight you know there's at least there's gonna be some anxiety or fear or you're gonna your heart rates gonna get checked your dren tones gonna be pumping but it's even more so if the consequences are more grave right look if you're gonna fucking take a skateboard down a small hill you're not freaking out right but if you take it a skateboard down like 4 Mile Canyon what does that for my on Boulder what is that one of those crazy roads that goes sunshine Canyon right if you're taking a skateboard down that going 50 miles an hour you're gonna shit your fucking pants you're gonna try to land this thing right try to figure out how not to die here because the consequences are so much graver you're going to be more jacked and that's what happens to these guys and they fight Francis the consequences are so grave they make mistakes and then with jr. he reached for a overhand right he just really really extended himself you can't do that with Francis he's good the scary thing is this true with Crow classes ever has a game plan and they get punched in the face that's my advice in my times Isis yeah I think it was it some guile that you know you once you get that first point to fight I only saw two fights the funniest one was the first one he gets the kid from Dallas props to him he went up against like a lieutenant the KKK the guy drew blue on his face at the weigh-in and they almost got into a little scuffle in the way and then he had no fucking love in his face he didn't smile one time he was definitely a member of the KKK and this little black dude from Dallas came in and he did a spinning back kick in that dude he was all over him no he talking first fight on the Conn the main card which fun defeated from he's nothing unless displeasure serious yeah I didn't see that first fight on the card he's ain't no now how did our strong really good he still has to he's gonna grow a little bit he's ever get knocked out once before he really makes that big jump but once he gets it the guy kept doing spinning back kicks on him I mean the second one he was right this bang this guy just hates black people who the guns right no that's Paul Craig yeah yeah no they're Paul Craig is great no he's probably great it's a fucking joke drum roll but did you see what Emil first he went in with a tough face you know like fucking the guy from he went in there like fucking war Braveheart he's a tough guy Paul Craig is good wait till you see the fucking fight I'll see it no he was great he just sweet he got waited for the second one and when the foot land that he was right behind them not be no more time click poof I turned around they hit him with a fucking drop and right hand you could see his feet just going you know when you come yeah are you feeling just playing the same thing it was like he came he just what Jamie's got it oh gee yeah it was ba what that's the first one so he so right away he timed it but that the back lap I love being up ba ba that's it little man look at us the last one yeah while the guy was a tremendous and look at a free whistling boom bo bey goes boom boom there you go he's probably right now reading fucking Malcolm X's - sigh ocean yeah that was ferocious I had people wonder why people want to spin that much you know those like that I hate all that shit spending punches why are you giving you back to a killer I never understood it well that's not what I'm saying I'm saying if you're not that good at it he doesn't have like a really fast you can imagine Barbosa okay Edson Barboza wheel kicks people and puts them on Pluto he spinning back kicks you to the body you mean he's his kicks his spinning kicks are fucking insane but these guys are not that good like what I'm saying is like Paul Craig that's not a specialty he's more of a grappler but I mean he can strike obviously he's a good striker but I wouldn't think that he would want to throw spin kicks this he's not like a Taekwondo guy at home if you don't do Taekwondo for ten years why you spinning kicking Lee you're seeing it's an athletic yeah guy you know all those that I hate when they even that reverse punch I think I keep is doing and doing them like you know what choke him bust him in the fuckin ear see when you're talking about like Edison Barboza though lands it on Dan hangman kept fucking kicking his body those spinning back kick is just fucking in so you gotta commit to that to really make it about commitment well I'm max Holloway spinning a little fucking cat and then they got the guitar played did it yeah what's his name mayor mayor did so did max Holloway invented it I don't know how I just saw it on it see the first person I saw yeah like that's amazing that's amazing max Holloway is the but he's such a fuckin cool guy I love that guy wim places show he's a champion he'll come back like who the fuck comes is better than him yeah the way he draws to Dustin Poirier excuses all love all happiness he's amazing Jason Statham what's he doing what's going on no let me see he's a real karate guy Jason Statham has real striking skills like what looked like he could tell even the way he's standing here like the way he's moving no no he's gonna spend it but you see even the way he's doing it like this guy's got real skill look at that Kapow he um he achieved a very high level of skill in karate I don't know exactly what it was but from people that I know that I've done martial arts with him and train with him I said that guy's a bad motherfucker like a legit badass really knows martial arts I believe it right you see him like I believe it seaman like snatch one of those movies I can fuck people up they did a mechanic yeah fucking face you really should just say to them hey let's not do that let's just write a movie that's similar and in homage to it I know they'd even doing Omar's that's what really pissed I was no respect and any level for Charles Bronson not even a fucking else many why why do you say that would mean if you watch the mechanic and study the mechanic it just wasn't as a white guy shooting people he was very calculating there was no very calculated where everything was made to look like it was an accident a very much accent one of the best beginning setting the only movie that starts better than the mechanic is scarf like that no it's something that has a better opening I forget there's no fucking dialog for 11 minutes for yes it's him setting up a guy to make it look like the fucking heater blew up like those type of guys the guy had a friend that he used to say is but the best way to kill somebody is breaking the house take the fucking pipe the gas thing out of the stove point it down and light a camera on the refrigerator and then leave whoa give it 15 20 minutes and it's late night Irene what is this Jamie this is the beginning of the whole movie actually this is the beginning of the mechanic this is the beginning of the original the original yeah okay when you know Jam Michael Vincent's father in the movie Charles Bronson kills he gets a contract to kill him that's how Jan Michael drifts to him when he killed him it'll look like he had a heart attack he won in his medical file and he saw he had a weak heart and he went to meet him and then he shot at the road and he goes run run so was the guy who's running he had a hard time hmm Jason Statham and whoever the fuck made the movie make it look like he was just shoot him up Charlie hmm now you say to me Joey what do you think so much offense because it's you know it's the fucking mechanic yeah it was that good of a goddamn movie you know they redid death wish no no no you know you can't redo Death Wish one of the most disturbing movies you'll ever see Bruce Willis yeah he should be shot not on the shot again okay I mean he did fucking listen you know what death wish has that nobody remembers what when I saw when I was 10 this is why I don't play that shit has one of the most disturbing rape scenes you'll ever see and Jeff Goldblum's in it remember they knocked his daughter I raped her spray paint on her ass I left that movie being 11 like film from my mom now yeah like I left it and I became tighter with my mom at the bar I tried to get a stick of the knife like that could happen to women like that happens to women like guys just rip their pants off I don't know I didn't know what that shit was till I watched them uh whatever the fuck of this death wish it's a different world for women yeah I couldn't even believe it when I watched that didn't they never talk about how disturbing that scene is that's the thing that most men never have to think about unless you're in jail most men most men don't have to think about that ego style women have to think no what happened right he goes to Arizona they said I'm tired zona to build the building maybe becomes the redneck and the red there's like man I can't happen to you because I put a little something in your bag for you to take back up to those big city folks with Charles Bronson got back to his eyes was a fucking white cannon from Texas Walker Z he was an architect he gave him a fucking cannon so trust Bronson so let me go and have some fun and see what happens first night first night some guys I got old time but give me twenty bucks you could see the panic in his face he was an old man yeah and stole it he stole he didn't take it out and say fuck you no he was panicked when he shot the guy in the subway scene you could see he's scared you ever wear that fucking look look oh this is great that's right right here look he's an old man Doug 53 years old fucking killing it in America giving men like you and me hope he was giving all the men hope this fucking guy right yeah I think he was at least 50 years old when he was watch yeah look how scared he is byah while i pinga rather you Bob look at him he's just get better Sudan shooting these yeah this is a brilliant film they'll never do that again because they won't take these little fucking details he was petrified that's a great scene in hard times I think he was 50 years old by then remember when he played that boxer mechanic he was 51 I think hard time yeah bro he was I think he was 51 our there's no trt back then son that dude was doing that was just a taking eggs and he was going to Formosa I forgot what what if I'm also that's for most of Caffe that a little broad down there that's where he would go right to either some shit he lived down there I don't know what to do where does he live well when he came to LA that's where he took the name Bronson from was that Street up in Hollywood really well said well is his real name he's a Polack radensky something just that they told him what you can ski yeah chance yeah you can't have that name so he looked around Hollywood perfect I said Bronson you fucking believe that when you hear that she's like we'll always you were walking down the street and this it's like when you had Jamie Foxx on it yeah he made his name Jamie Foxx because people would think he was a hot chick that is the most thing I've heard in my lot Jamie Foxx was a bad mother brilliant man brilliant man brilliant that is the fact that he figured that out yeah like a chick you should pick your name on the lineup they see that Jamie Foxx you get a chance to get out there so smart you're you're right you know like if a guy sees that Fox whatever Jamie with an especially with him I yeah he's supposed to Jay I am I yeah doesn't he always basically regular Jamie that makes you think it's a broad right off the fucking bat this is Jamie JY mie OH - its girl yeah usually the I before the M as a girl spelling it's all out of those weird words like Shaun but there's a lot of hot Shaun's that are girls right what else what are the ones its Garrett they used to be like Stacy like these didn't name dude Stacy like Stacy Keach they said you know there's a lot of dudes like in their sixties eason name guys Stacy there's something there's a name that a friend of my dad that was a guy I can't remember it now wasn't there one of the weird guys in airplane Leslie Leslie Leslie these two name guys Leslie how we're that's a weird one what's his name Leslie the hilarious dude Leslie wasn't hilarious the guy was hilarious wasn't he and Creepshow - was he one of the people in Creepshow that got killed I feel like he was one of those people that got buried on the beach or some shit like that yeah yeah husband yeah he he did something to some some rich guy yeah buried him up to his head I forget those fucking scary horror movies like Creepshow fun hair horror movies they don't make enough of those anymore either those are my favorite movie with a cigar anything else scream wasn't bad right I wasn't mad at all and what year was that 87 yeah 86 money sounds fun ass moving I think the Latin that's the last one I watched but the last movie to scare the living fuck out of me was the first night man on street with the tongue coming out of the Father but before that you know the people are you know you don't watch Walking Dead you know why again I'm loyal to fucking when I was a kid those Dawn of the Dead movies what was the guy that wrote those George Romero George Romero I'm loyal to him my loyalties with him I took acid and went to George Romero that one doorman is dead when the helicopter chops a black guy's head off who when he doesn't even know the helicopter lands and he's a zombie yeah and I think it chops his head off I'd remember tripping on a side almost had a fucking heart attack Walking Dead was awesome for the first few episodes they just lost they just can't keep something like that up forever it just becomes too it's too hard to keep story going it's just sorry got too weird but the best horror movie a zombie horror movie of all time is 28 days later that's the best one that's that British movie so it we didn't get into like way after it came out in this in the theatre over there most people have seen it they'd seen it they'd seen it on cable or DVD right dude was what was 28 days later even in the theaters out here was it said Jeff the debt the one after that was a big deal but it was a British movie right oh god damn that movie's good I remember I bought a version of it on VHS on the number European VHS was a different format he was like a DI of a different player or you had to have a player that was a universal player that could play both I had one of those just so I could get some cool documentaries and shit that you would get from Europe just as a reminder I want to give props to American allies for returning my luggage Oh after the whole weekend and they missed that fucking half ounce of weed in my boxing glove so you're the delivery driver you were dumb fuck that was it they lost my Muay Thai bag DJ I was going to Columbus to go to a short when we die and I brought me out you know my little fucking shin pads and my gloves and some hand wraps you've been doing that a lot lately huh more done of it it's great right I go twice a week well I've had 56 the targets that they can I take the class where everybody else I do everything else I'd die then I go to one boxing just Tuesday and Wednesday there's Tuesday and Thursdays boxing then when you do the class did they have safar I'm good these things I like no head gear that's right you just have working in a combination shit like that saturday sundays are going there's an open matt if i'm home i going there's a a chick that's like a nice cop a nice cop oh no you know she's a tough chick yeah yeah she trains for Brett and the whole thing so I go down and just let her beat me up to death let me ask you this as someone who was born in another country how do you think that they should handle the immigrations that are here cuz this is the big question a lot of people know people that are I mean I'm probably a lot of people listening know someone who they love that's illegal whether they're illegal from Canada or they're illegal from Europe or they're illegal from Mexico where the fuck there's a lot of people that get over here and stay over here that aren't supposed to be some of them turn out turn out to be amazing people so how do you decide how do you decide who gets to say and there's someone coming over here trying to make their life a better a better thing but just doing it illegally does that automatically discount them from staying here that seem just crazy what if they're great because a lot of people come over here because they were super unfortunate and where they were born and they dude they grew up in a shitty place and they wanted to make it better but they didn't know how to do it so they came over to America by hook or by crook they figured out how to get here they got here and now they're kicking ass why why would you want to get rid of them as long as they're not criminals not hurt anybody why would you want to get rid of them Oh for starters let's do this that's what's going on right now just points the finger at a certain realm of you're pointing the finger is south of the border yeah it's Canadians a lot of Canadians which and I'm not saying nothing bad about anybody this is the United States of America right convey the fuckin have a dream yeah and whatever happens bro sometimes the dream goes to put you know when I went to New York I spent three weeks in New York and I Hubert and I did a little thing in my mind you know I took twenty obras in fact I became Oba planning because I was doing you know all these rides not one white person pick me up not one time voila and guess what I asked questions I asked everybody questions and the most inspiring person I met one night I worked oh I wrapped that 6:30 in the morning there was no way I was getting the van to go home but I just called hooba I wasn't Ridgewood Brooklyn and this Indian girl picked me up very cute you know 6:00 in the fucking morning it's still kind of dark out you know 5:30 whatever it was and this little girl that weighed 90 pounds back me up time to car hello we have charged her in the back if you want to charge your car in his little caramels in the front hmm you know and I said were you firm when she told me India and I go how long have you been a year and a half spoke perfect English Wow I go why do you why did you become a little bit dry but she doesn't became over driver because I was a waitress at an Indian restaurant and the guy abused me and he would only pay me 8 bucks an hour and take half my tips so me and my cousins got together we put away money and we rent the car we leased a car my she drives in the daytime and I Drive it at night Wow and I drag or why do you aren't you scared to go on it man she's like no she's like I love it because there's no traffic in it hmm I go what do you walk with I just asked her Bryan creepy questions not say yeah and it was I want I'll I gave her an extra tip like let me ask you this can you be illegal and do that I don't know what the status was with her I didn't ask her I didn't any what do you think do you think that you could do that do you think like if you came from another country came from Guatemala illegally you work him over here though and became a uber driver could you do that me no could anybody do that or do they check your citizenship what do you think Jamie there's yes they can do that so someone definitely can come over here and start working for uber or another or similar I'm not doing that necessarily like through the proper ways they you can make if you have a legal friend you can use their license to be there like the uber thing and they don't know who's behind the car so it's all the time I'm ordering food you know you definitely have to have a valid driver's license right yeah so when you get a valid driver's license if you're illegal well that's the part like I so I'm saying so like no but that doesn't stop someone from getting behind a car if you don't have a license it's any day thanks wonder where I'm going well just someone get in trouble right now are we on the shit list because we agreed in somebody else to give illegals licenses yeah that's why I was asking there was a thought that popped a memory popped in my head about some story like that but they were gonna give illegal aliens the right to drive I'm sort of saying like it does happen but not above the board basically because yeah but are you sure could you see if they're trying to give illegal aliens driver's licenses because I remember a story like this too as well people are super upset about it it's a weird thing managed 13 states that allow it there you go baby where do you have to move with one of those states in DC California is the first one as of 2013 Colorado Connecticut Delaware everywhere this week Hawaii Illinois Maryland Nevada New Mexico New Yor interest everywhere there's weed Hawaii doesn't necessarily have we know Vermont I think a white medical business standpoint they work for cheaper and work harder than well you know I mean there's so many benefits to as a business owner and differently when was last time you saw a white labor you see them you go in the kitchen and at any restaurant it's all you know I mean and so now you value you're questioning what what rights you have as an American you come here you get a job you're working hard you stay out of trouble yeah out of trouble yeah I mind your business you know I mean I grew up you and I grew up in the East Coast away you go to a Chinese restaurant and you'd see them but those the husband and wife working and the kids would be doing homework at the back table and that he came in the daytime it was a different couple which is telling me that two couples got together they buy a home and they open a business together they work together that's what those immigrant groups do mm-hmm and then from there they bring a cousin and they open the open and next thing I know they got three houses on the and now he just had a fucking immigrant family move into your neighborhood not necessarily good or bad you know I'm saying that then nice we all had them in our neighborhoods sure I remember 70 years ago this was your grandparents yeah so you have to think about your grandma but how would you want them treated I'm sure your grandfather got a job laying brick way before he got his immigration papers I don't know they did it right I think they got it pretty right you get through Ellis Island and they push through I mean at the illegal situation it was a different world back then you could immigrate pretty easily like my grandparents did weren't rocket scientists when they came over here and uh you know there were kids their parents weren't geniuses do you know what's going on farmers do you know what's going on in South America right now Nicaragua Honduras all those places pure hell pure hell you know I can't be mad at you from one - get the fuck out of there but this other places on earth right now will this pure fucking hell go or not yeah there's place women come over - let's point everybody out let's lock all the fucking boarders don't make it seem like it's just Mexico that's the fucking problem you know we're getting bombarded from everywhere we'll get new people in here every day from everywhere I ain't mad at it they're coming here to make better lives but don't just keep pointing the fucking water that you know who else is coming for that Mexican border that nobody's talked about Jamie when you get a minute if you'd love to check it just to verify me you know how many Cubans are getting sent back to Hugh bond a daily basis from Mexico really getting back the girl shot but Cubans that when they come to Miami know why they're not coming through they closed all that type of shit why so right now you can't come through Miami it's easier to come go from Cuba to Mexico and just join the walk whoa and walk up but once sightings are in America we give them asylum right if the tag but does that still go on I think Obama removed it did he really yes Trump made it so we can't go over there there you go applicants woven's pack Mexican shelters hope people are going through West that's crazy so I think the number a couple weeks ago I think 900 Cubans are getting sent back weekly to get shot did you think more people more people are make it towards the border what since Trump was like build that wall build that wall do you think more people are headed towards the border now because it's just like it's a popular thing to do it's a part of our culture like a part of the conversation is the border wall right like do you want a border wall or do you not want to build that wall make it a fucking million feet high bring it right to that top of the earth or are you one of those people that thinks anybody should be able to come over here and have a better life you know and there's those two ideas are fucking clashing left and right some people think that people should be able to try to do better try to better themselves they should have the opportunity and then some people think fuck them you were born somewhere else you don't ever get a chance to come over here go go in through proper channels which is almost impossible do something that's very valuable to us over here see that's the thing like if you're a person who has some extraordinary skill you know you could probably get American citizenship easier you're unusual if you're contributing to the physics department at Harvard or something like that and you're you know you were born in Germany or wherever you probably could get citizenship a little bit quicker and you're just a guy who like lives in Guatemala wants to come to America because he thinks he can advance his life he think he can get better words where he lives there's no that you can't go anywhere you're stuck the the the poverty is extreme the crimes extreme and he wants none of that he wants to do better so he makes it over here like listen when you talk about immigration you're gonna get good and bad from every store you know Castro with 79 opened up this prisons in the Mario and you got a hundred thousand Cubans and a hundred thousand fucking spoiled rotten savages from Cuban prisons when they were no clothes and this they have to shit in a hole in the middle of the floor they're savages they're animals they got no problem taking your life from a piece of toilet paper but the same runs true from other countries yeah we get the good and the bad from other country you know let's not beat around the bush before Russians come here they got a course they go to a school and take the 12-year week course how to come here and get money right off the bat how'd it go to Social Security check that out Jamie that's a very weird one they get taught how to come here and scam the system whether you want to call scammed I'm not putting nobody down I have a tons of Russian friends I love them I'm not saying them bad but I've heard that's a fact I've heard them from them I have a friend who's married and she told me one day that before they come here they take a course to prep them on how to get money as soon as they land three days after they get them they land they get cashing and Dola paperwork what to say they coach you that's hilarious it's like a service that they offer yeah some so you have to class work but but if you ask yeah that's how many Armenians come over come over get citizenship guess what they do they get Social Security and they move back to our meeting they get the check sent back to Armenia they have a system on how to do that they got a thousand loopholes now brother and if you learn those loopholes you became the fucking system there's nothing wrong with having a group of people that all agree on certain rules right which is what the United States should be but the problem with having a group of people is you don't get to pick like who's in that group so you're just deciding instead of being admitted by your merit how good a neighbor you are or how nice of a person you are they just whether or not you're born on the dirt like born on this dirt of that dirt because if you're born on that dirt you can't stay but if you're born on this dirt even if you're a shit human being you get to hang out you get to ruin other people's lives while you're here as long as you don't do enough that we need to put you in a cage and then if we do we keep you for a couple years let you out you do more I mean this is we have no problem with that I don't know what what the percentage is what the percentage of good people versus bad people that come into the border the thing is every time it is a bad one that comes across the border it's highlighted as an example of why we got to keep the border closed and they have a point they all have a point absolute when you see someone who is talking about illegal gang members they're sneaking across the border and murdering people it absolutely has happened it's a hundred percent of a real thing that's not not fiction the question is how much does it happen and how much better is it for those people's lives that make it across is there a way to screen better to make sure that the bad people don't come in and all these questions are legitimate you know you don't want a bunch of fucking evil vicious people from another country in your neighborhood that's how everybody feels you don't want your children your family to be in danger because someone snuck across the border and they have a long history of working for the cartel murdering people that's a real thing that's a real possibility so all the people that are vigilant all the people that are scared you know they're probably smart to be scared look at fucking human history people are capable of doing some awful shit no one saying I'm not I don't think there should be no no wall at all nothing stopping people from coming across you definitely don't want pieces of shit coming over here promise how you find out did you ever notice that maybe were full yeah we're probably maybe we'll full did you notice that when you go on there's homeless people I'm in Torah fucking Boulevard I'm Lancashire Boulevard under bridges everywhere has I never come to your mind that anyway you go there's cars everywhere and the between uber and lyft and cabs now there's traffic in every major fucking city this good luck or whatever did you notice that maybe it's not that I hate Cubans or Mexicans or Puerto Ricans or blacks or Germans Irish maybe that will fucking full have you ever come to that conclusion yeah we're just full right now yeah we have to take five years off like I would accept that I would accept that I would accept a special circumstances like why you have family here but at this point right now I will fuck them full yeah yeah we'll fall we don't have nowhere else to put any more that we really don't looking no steadies unless we pack them all to Iowa and send them all you know send them all into my where's the highest population of Mexicans in the country I would probably say Southern California right wrong really Indiana Chicago yeah hi they form a ton of shit in Chicago ah that makes Illinois you know where's the highest population of Puerto Ricans the Bronx you're wrong Cleveland clean doesn't the 50s they shipped today all the dealers were worth taking Puerto Ricans is putting them to the Cleveland Ohio area to work in the fucking Ford plants and all the plants and that's all those places sat down all those people sitting there holding on to that dick when you go to certain parts of Ohio there's a suburb outside of Cleveland twelve fucking Puerto Rican Wow you know interested but it's I don't think of it as we hate Russians or Geralyn Johnny that I look at it from a different perspective at times and maybe we'll fall you know this for me to send my daughter to day camp costs three bills a week I'm not complaining that's a great day kids a science camp they make potions then learn about light bulbs and electricity my point is I did the same thing for free when I was a kid all I do is walk to my Park there's no funds left hmm there's nothing left for these kids you know I don't know if you were I walk into a Dodger game or an event I go I always think of the family of four in America today that both parents have to work yeah and everybody has to work if you go by my office for the podcast in the middle is it a 24-hour day care and weigh tons I'll leave my office at midnight I see parents picking up their kids you know carrying them on over their shoulders into that car you know it's cost a lot to control all of the American family yeah there's not a lot of jobs well you think you see everybody's driving over if you take all this Uber's is interesting I'm thinking of doing a documentary I'm just yelling overs and talking to these people ask them why they're over it yesterday I had an engineer engineer lost his job 58 years old got a work Asian fellow very nice I tipped them extra you offered me to plug the phone I mean you know you know you have to look at that and go wow there's a lot of people in this country without work there's a lot of fucking homeless people money to take care of what we got here it's true like there's la as an epidemic homeless people right now where there's so many tents on the street and at the fuck endemic but they're everywhere I mean fucking Lancashire yeah you're not doing there in Sherman Oaks yeah the streets are hiding on the underpass underpasses are stuffed with them now so you know I mean we have to fail what are you gonna do it you can't walk through those under water do you know what the answer is you know what they usually do with them well they give them 100 bucks make them a bus pass to Vegas and now Vegas is stuck with that we talked about that on the pockets a lot every city's done I recently keep story just came like shit it's time to get fucking some apart and put a tent city and make him be resourceful okay 110,000 empty rental units in Los Angeles fill in those spaces won't solve the housing or the homeless crisis yeah but the problem is if these fucking things are for rent and you have these homeless people that are drug addicts and probably mentally insane and you let them stay in those rental apartment they're gonna destroy your rental place well let's be honest there's 110,000 whoa whoa whoa whoa it all depends on what kind of homeless person you're talking right you talking about person who's down on his luck are you talking about mental illness mental illness drug addiction yeah that stuff violently well I see 60 when I see a hundred when I see 10,000 homeless people in LA I got to assume 4,000 of them are people were down there look a minute they got four flat tires and it just kept you know this times people don't do shit for periods of time it could be here yeah it could be it's like these fucking hikers every fucking three days a hiker gets lost okay yes like this gets lost and they stroll off when they get saved they're all happy to see em I like witness news I'm happy wait till they get the bill they get hit with a bill oh yeah every time but most windows helicopters claws so they volunteer if every fucking hiker got paid for for a fucking taxpayer we'd be broke so like in Colorado so if you're one else hiker it goes and snaps her ankle and you're on a ridge somewhere they come and get you I caught somebody money you gotta pay somebody there's no fucking tax funds does that cost whoa that's a lot of me you gonna hit listen if you'd like lady who got stuck in Hawaii for a week where the fuck she was a month ago those helicopters cost something just stuck in Hawaii Oh a lady the lay of the teacher that girl yeah you know they found her right yeah they found I assume I'm just saying this story just because what happens to something like that happens see

at the homeless situation when you hit me with a 50,000 number which is a lie if you go around that way it's a while and at the airport and hook that fucking thing onto the four or five nor to look under that there's a hundred people just under there mm-hmm so whatever number they tell you what do you think they tell you as far as like homeless population and oh I I don't know I know Garcetti is under fire yeah like the people of whist because they gave two million dollars well he came to really knows they gave him money and he didn't do dick alright yeah they gave me some type of money you got to put up some shelters I saw the day up in North Hollywood studios there's a church then on Thursdays they go and take showers there you know there was a place in Maine that was offering they were offering young couples they wanted young people and young families to move up there because it's tough to get people to live in some of those parts of Maine so they offered incentives for young people to move up there and a lot of African folks started moving up there you know they found out that that was a good place to be and so they like filled up a lot of their shelters up there there was an article about that see if you could find that interesting it's like hey they like look I know it's cold as fuck but we'll take a chance they're from a war war-torn part of the world that they could just be cold and main and be at peace hey bitches that's why Marcus Davis lived up there I asked him remember UFC fighter ma yeah yeah I asked him like why do you why do you like it in maze like there's no fucking crime you know it's none he's like there's none he was everybody's nice it's cold as fuck but everybody's nice over the comedy club up there where was a comedy club was on a wharf and it floated no where's where's that kid from Maine every month Marley Bob Marley's from Maine yeah he's a man yeah not for the club was that more asylum-seekers arrive in Portland Maine from southern border a city Debates assistance Portland's human resources director criticizes comments by mayor Ethan strimling welcoming the arrival of more immigrants they'd say that they're all from Africa a specific Africa but they're buying and bus tickets to go from like San Antonio and tell other parts in Texas I think this is a different one this is a different thing yeah just just google it from Africa I did did you I've made African shelters yeah I'm gonna sort of pop that mm-hmm one person a new migrant surge from the war this one from Central Africa Wow interesting but you know for other people in other parts of the world like I'll take it and I get it main is it is cold as fuck for a good stretch of the winter but you know they just stay indoors and keep fucking these numbers here Wow la population LA County homeless population jumps so from 2011 it was 39 thousand four hundred fourteen and in 2019 it's fifty eight thousand nine hundred thirty six so it jumped up a fucking ton to almost twenty thousand and that's just over a period of eight years that's crazy that's a lot of people just a couple dudes but my house I'd take care of there's a couple dudes that live in shopping carts I always drop a little food there's one dude that was like that he's like a soldier with PTSD and he was in the park he's got to be six four to any big black what do you wanna do every time I see him I pull over I give him a twenty I introduced him to my wife and my daughter you know you see anything used to just attacked he's just attack you rip him apart well my daughter started going to grammar school I saw him when they walk him by the grandmas who I pulled right up I go that you see I grab just go right there so my daughter goes to school you see any suspicious white people you just rip them apart those people don't lay that he has a Rambo knife bigger than Rambo hmm bigger than Rambo I love I love him to death you could see the with a PTSD and mental health he won't take showers mm but he's got a heart of gold whenever he sees him he smiles he gives me a thumbs up I never said in that neighborhood ten years I seem in that part maybe six never violent behavior he doesn't drink alcohol so I know he's not just a fucking drunk they just can't get it just mental health no it's a mental health issue yeah it sees a veteran I asked him how you doing what's going on they told me his whole like a little story as much as he could without being embarrassed so I just Dookie every time I see him I just put money on his pan and he's as happy as a pig in shit but he's a fucking stone killer they ain't gonna be nobody no shoes at that kid's school cuz I got him checking it out three times a day you think I'm getting you I don't think I'm kidding you I love them I love them too that my wife waves at them we be pad of mercy waves at them everybody's happy with just so there's no misunderstanding it's like a little peace of mind is there ever gonna be your time when there's no bad neighborhoods is that possible is it possible to have a place where there's no crime at all what do you think holds that ever really gonna be possible I mean it's definitely better now that never has been before and you can think that if if things move in the same general direction they'll be less crime a hundred years from now than 100 years ago but do you ever think there's gonna be a time where everywhere is safe you know the internet gives you a lot of education on what cities are having a hard time they don't tell you but they don't really feel yet you know every weekend you see the murder count in Chicago it's crazy every weekend the murder count of Chicago these fucking countries ain't no safer Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico a couple we think about a year ago that is many shootings in Puerto Rico one weekend as they do in fucking Chicago on the weekends you know but if the shit that happens in that way we don't hear everything what's happening Dominican Republic all these people are dying I'd die I don't know what is that for minibar it's this it's that what do you think what do you think Jaime speculation I heard that there's lots of deals that get made from like fright like if you had a friend that was like maybe brief fill-in minibars mm-hmm your other friend would then refill the little bottles with not actual liquor and like they just kind of refill those I've seen videos online it's not actually having the Dominican Republic but where all-inclusive resorts that's what the video said they're just refilling bottles of Kivar CA and Hennessy and all sorts just like the brown water I don't know what the fuck they're even doing it it's like a whole system they have there's like 15 people the little factor in the back of the shed on the beach just filling up empty bottles of shit so just ripping people off I don't know if that's what's happening in the dr but that's what I've read speculation online says that there's just sort of something I mean this online not any of its again is speculation it's nowhere right there's seat that seems to make sense right if some had a scam and those little mini bar bottles are kind of expense not a bad batch and just like you get bad batches of drugs they're gonna find out they got some homemade fentanyl or a bad thing and yeah maybe they got some bullshit homemade booze that's poison they got spread around yeah yeah but the whole thing is suspicious acoustic are they doing kinky shit at the hospital kinky shit yeah what kind of kinky shit no answering no answer no hablo we don't know oh no it is they're probably overwhelmed imagine if we're sitting over here talking about it how many people have been calling them how many people are furious because they lost their loved one over there they don't know what the fuck is going on and then someone said that it's not necessarily really an uptick that does not necessarily really an uptick of deaths it's just that they're highlighting every time someone dies and that the reality is people die all the time I don't know if that makes sense you know like I mean how many people if you were just looking at Los Angeles that come here and they visit one I'm having a heart attack and die it might be a lot you know we don't really know I mean how many people come over here from another country every day and wind up dying while they're here this is not a normal thing that people do because people do it mean if people are dying of heart attacks and ulcer strokes and all sorts of other shit is that because someone's doing something to them or is it because a hundred thousand people a day come over here and one of them a day dies I don't know what those numbers are know this legit what do you show me people that died at number great numbers I guess this looks like only maybe 12 to 15 people or since March March that's a lot what is it I don't know I don't know if that's it or here in California all these people are done no no 50 year older yeah right which can happen in any point time especially if you're on vacation doing viagra drinking straight Jack Daniels fucking up a storm you could have a heart attack bro but all jokes aside no disrespect is that can you google how many people is this an uptick or are really is it no what's the best way to say this diaper yeah yeah yeah what's the annual tour right torez death rate and is it any different from what we're experiencing now because it would be weird if we just found out that no this is just what happens and they're just making a big deal of this for a story with this that you know 55 year old drunk guys die every year the Dominican Republic and in Cuba and in Puerto Rico and people get hammered on vacation bro you know that I have no reason to go there why they sell cocaine on the beach I do not like that idea yeah at all when I heard that they sold cocaine on the beach shit what's the big Mexican resort whether people go for Spring Break 401 but oh yeah Tulum no thang khuu Cancun Cancun they sell coke on the beach yeah all those times when you sell coke on the beach I don't want to be on that beach and I was a junkie he's ever saying I just have this weird feeling about that they sell coconut Beach they do that in Costa Rica too I had somebody offered me some bro no yeah yeah yeah pill thick's used to have a funny joke about that about walking down the street that someone's trying to say I see you coke coke you got coke we got weed got coke the guy would see me heroin and you go fuck heroin and he goes the fuck why do you think I wanted heroin man I can afford coke very funny - one about 2.7 American Americans visited Dominican Republic last year which publicly releases data on only about natural deaths such as car crashes and drownings it does not release information about deaths by natural causes such as heart attacks or strokes even though it compiles reports on Americans who died on all Americans who died abroad it's a matter of statistics that a certain number of travelers will suffer serious illnesses accidents and even death while traveling internationally the death rate in the Dominican Republic is not any higher than the death rate in the States officials said that's what I'm talking about you don't when people visit other countries don't expect them to stay alive because you don't expect them to stay alive here they die all the time but when you're talking about what do they say what was the of thousands how many hundred thousand people visit the Dominican Republic every year 2.7 million visited last year Americans visited last year oh my god really report seven million yeah ten people died I loved twelve people have died I guess why don't I think it was a hundred thousand so anymore last year eleven people died last year no this year this is a month last but I've been to 12 people that's a lot of fucking people going over there man people die but meanwhile everybody's scared to go to the Dominican Republic so it's like probably killing their business and oh he was fine until we track had the minibar come on man are you sure you know some some people I'm sure are getting fucked the scary one was the lady got attacked there was a lady who got attacked alright so they beat her half to death she has no idea what happened she saw a guy with an outfit on from the resort like an employee's outfit and he fucking clubbed her and beat the shit out of her and she doesn't remember anything they left her for dead and when they found her they thought she was dead you know bro I helped me I'm sure for the last 10 20 years there ain't nowhere I really want to go why is awesome I'm scared of all that shit go to why it's the United States we were Laura yeah good job you know my wife and I sat down and were like all the place where you only go it's a six-hour fucking flight it's true you know yeah why don't we do we got some of

certain exact way to go clean what time is I don't know what time of the year to go any time okay that's while bullshit fuck yeah for Hawaii okay I'd go to Hawaii any day of the air so that you don't go from like December to February because it's a little season I like that we went in June before that we went last time we had gone was in January or December yeah it's um it's beautiful that the people are so nice man it's just it's lastly but I shouldn't say this they're probably getting mad you're gonna make more people come over there it's fucking it's an amazing place to live man they live in Paradise they live there they're on an island that's created by a volcano in the middle of the ocean and it's fucking gorgeous it's it's so pretty it was crazy betting they saw in the water we saw a lot of a lot of dolphins man - spinner - spinner dolphins I guess they call them I guess that's what kind of dolphins they wear I don't remember what kind of dolphins but back in December we saw whales that was awesome that's amazing that you see fucking whales breach the surface of our dealin whoa wild man just go out there in boats and look for splashes in the distance then we saw them big schools of dolphins they swim under your boat it's wild shit man you know cuz they're just these crazy sea mammals that are super intelligent live in the water right off right off the coast I mean that said it's such a paradise because what Owyhee has it no other place does is it's fully surrounded by the most beautiful pristine water there's no shit beaches on Hawaii it's all gorgeous water and then scuba G yeah we know we snorkels okay so when you went snorkeling it's a shark no that's get the fuck outta me what that scares the fuck out of me sharks get the fuck out okay guys are killed I love you too hello you said I am fucking to a point that's why I'm petrified and I don't know why you should be I grew up in a be like I still remember my mom taking me to Coney Island dog being a little kid getting that hot dog I got both times I went to Coney Island I had drama the first time I went to Coney Island I got corner what's the undertow yeah yeah well you you're you go out hearing your waist yeah well being you were playing yeah we look at our parents and they're two miles away it's very dangerous oh the fucking lifeguards I had to be five maybe five maybe four I was my first experience in Coney Island second experience in Coney Island I'm there with my cousins we're jumping up and down I'll never forget it had to be hot like those hot days we ran in do you know we're swimming around and I want some we look up and there was the biggest piece of shit it was 13 14 inches spinning around the beach just floating past us walking out telling my mom I'm never going back that was the last I went to call me out and then I went to Jersey and I went to the beach I loved it everything was hunky-dory and it started here about 2003 I went down to the beach and when we got there that God the lifeguard walks over you know after you smoke a fucking joint you got past BF on you the guy comes only because the beach isn't closed officially but there's been a couple shark sighting system so if you go into the water I just want you to know let me know and wave over at me this is when you come up here and you make the right turn down you know I don't know anyways it's the other way of going down to the beach not the 405 way to sunset you get off it's the other way what Canyon there you go Topanga Topanga can't you get on that yeah that time we got right there soon as we landed that'll be two thousand three two thousand two the guy said oh we it's not close but they've been seeing a couple spots are trying it mm I always try to go in the ocean I'm cute my mother loved the beach we always went every time I go to the beach I go what the fuck is wrong with me and I buckle up I take the 4 steps I dip in and then I walk out a little bit and once I start bouncing I go on then I take a couple strokes Joe I feel great and as soon as one of those fucking things touch my foot you never see a fat motherfucker run as quick as you say I just run out straight and that's it I put my SPF on I'll go back in the water I go in just to refresh myself did you see the fucking great white base off the coast of Jersey the one the bit those guys are selfish means bringing in you see that unbeliev that's not normal brother I grew up in Jersey there's always been sharks but not great whites like that great whites started the first time we ever saw a shark was in Montauk Montauk is next to a MIDI where they really shot George Charles are supposed to be happy oh one of those if you look how to know what correctly it is when they shot George it's supposed to be the coast of fucking long I'll mmm but if anybody knew when I was a kid I used to go to Montauk all the time that Beach was no bueno dog you'd be on the beach and a fucking crab would walk up to you mm-hmm they walked by this but this is geez this is unheard of guys come on that's just it's biting their buoy is that what that is yeah or is that a sack of meat yeah yeah I think there's they're chumming it yeah are they chumming why is it biting that thing then is that definitely what's going on what is on that rope back there oh it's what it ripped it apart oh yeah look there's salmon fillets 2,000 pounds or of fish fish fillets the they think the shark was 2,000 pounds look at the size stop stop doing this because it's hard to for me to tell what's going on okay they dangled so what is it biting what is that yellow thing in fact that buoy yeah it looks like it but why would it bite a buoy it's a fucking animal but you see how they have that piece of fish they were dangling in the water it seemed to me like they were I think they were fishing that but that with that fish it was already filleted so it's like the body the head and the tail it seemed to me like they're putting that in the water to attract sharks I bet they know a spot where sharks eat see what I'm talking about see that's the part of the fish that you can't you know it's like he's got it opened up like a fillet and they're dragging it through the water I think to try to attract them maybe I saw it they're like let's see if we can get it close yeah maybe right yeah oh shit never mind get it away yeah throw it yes he they're throwing that in the water I'm definitely trying to bring him closer to the boat I don't give a fuck they put a leg in the water look at the size of that fucking thing off the coast of New Jersey that would make you want to scratch your fucking head then a week later a seal attack the girl in a California beach I feel I saw one where a seal grabbed a girl's leg yeah it's pulled her into the water off a dog that was a different one this is another this is another one and they're blaming it on a chemical in the ocean whoa knocks or something like that that wants the seals get that in look at this girl how she got dragged in cuz look at this look at this my brother Oh oh my god yeah something's going on shit holy shit bro I think the climate change is everywhere it's all over and the fuck is that oh that's incoming like wow that's crazy that they got it on video too it just jumps up and bites your fucking leg maybe to payback oh yeah no I see one on here no it's a big giant shark Oh ch and then the rest of the dogs come in to help it's buddy and it sort of stays for a second I thought maybe it had one and they're trying to get it to release it did it I don't believe no look at it Jesus Christ it's a really crazy fucking video but the dogs are huge also they're no bitch-ass dogs yes to the beach with five savages like that that's a fucking shark bro no you got to be very careful very careful now something's going on and you have to do you think the world's coming to an end not at all what do you think I'm ready Bravo the fuck the world we got whistling and dick until something happens but what I miss make all these shark attacks especially on the East Coast the last three weeks well here's one specially on the East Coast one thing could be lack of food right I mean they over fish the fuck out of the ocean people know for a fact that that's a real problem that's a real problem overfishing is a giant problem they're worried that the ocean fish in some parts of world will literally be extinct there'll be nothing left and 50 60 100 years who knows if they don't clean up their act but you just see the way they do with commercial Nets just just throw those fucking things in and just insane wide Nets just scooping up everything and then they they get all these fish and they dump them in the hull of the boat and it's crazy how much fish they kill it's crazy how much what a desire for fish we all have but if sharks run out of shit D and then the seals run out of shit to eat the Sharks start running out of seals then they start going after people little seals eat let's good question I don't imagine the heat fish years ago seals up in San Francisco were getting killed by sharks yeah such a high level at such a high level that a guy was on a surfboard and they couldn't imagine why the shark bit him and then they looked into it they said from underneath the shark just sees they see I see a seal yeah yeah there's a crazy video of a shark taking a seal out out on this one right here right in front of all these people on this on the marina Alcatraz Alcatraz okay watch this back it up a little bit what's this splatter this shark just jacks his fucking seal right in front everybody they're all looking at watch this boom look at all that blood and everybody's like what the fuck so oil slick a blood the shark comes out of the water with the seal I mean look at that blood that is Annis bright red blotch and a fucking huge shark destroying a seal in front of everybody just let you know that's their world there's monsters right there it's just they can't get out of the water I mean imagine if you that was like right next to the woods and you know that if you didn't go into the woods you'd be okay but if you did go into the woods there's a giant gray thing that moves 30 miles an hour that just bites the legs and arms off of everything it runs into is that what the village was they scared him going to the woods because something's gonna kill him if they put on a costume the village was about a bunch of people that didn't know that it was like 2,000 and mime and know what they got some they're gonna die if I something yeah they scared him with some costume or some shit right giant shark but that's what it's like when you're sitting on the dock they're looking out at that shark fucking up that seal in the water it's right there I mean you could just jump in I mean it is sort of like being at the edge of the woods watching some mythical monster tear apart a creature in front of you we spoke when you win Hawaii that's the first thing I said to you though nothing happened and they got well there's a lot of tiger sharks tiger sharks bite people bull sharks are apparently the most dangerous and they're the weird ones because they go through freshwater they'll go I could they found bull sharks way up near Illinois like near Chicago on rivers bull sharks get in fresh water and swim all the way up the river in fact Jaws was actually inspired by bull sharks that bit people over like a successive couple of days in New Jersey in a river in New Jersey that's the the actual original story that inspired Jaws came from shark attacks and like I want to say like maybe the 50s or some shit like that that were a near a river in New Jersey a freshwater river speaking of New Jersey someone want to show you see if you can find that story another's been shark's Mississippi River yeah yeah exactly they can go way up they can survive and fresh water the bull sharks are there a weird animal I think that monster guy that that television show River Monsters that dude that cool guy I think that guy caught one somewhere if I remember correctly that guy that used to hang out with wild boy steve-o and Chris Pontius Manny he got into that water in the bay at San Francisco with like 200 bull sharks the footage of it is fucking crazy oh my god there are some ones just with no cage nothing obviously though I thought when Stephen was on that fucking tree and the Lions jumped up in the tree to be with him like what in the fuck they were took his hat from him took his hat off his head I'm like what what what what like he was inches from death one of your fans sent me an article for you oh about six months ago really interesting and got it somewhere my tickets on Twitter so Rocky Balboa something rocky about more Sylvester Stallone was a young guy anyone into a gym and bailed because he wanted chuck wepner's trainer to train him but Chuck Webb his trainer told him to fuck off because some of Estes that long had done port so Sylvester soul on the way out stole Chuck what there's no book that he wrote in and that's where he took the idea for Rocky is that true did you ever hear this I never heard that this is maybe it's true despite the fact that Stallone was sued by Wepner in 2003 for using his story for rocky he ultimately settled for an undisclosed amount of money in 2006 according to forbes seems being a good spirit about wet-nurse tale being told on the big screen in an interview with deadlines Chuck producer Mike Tolan said that Stallone was supportive of everyone involved reading the script and even showing up on set he and Liv had positive dialogue during shooting her movie about Chuck they did a movie but Chuck hmm that's weird that he's used his story for rocky so the idea was that he used a story when Chuck Wepner fought Muhammad Ali that's actually based on nobody kind of makes sense that would be based on cuz Karl was kind of like a Muhammad Ali character and Rocky Balboa was kind of like Chuck Wepner but if I remember that fight correctly I mean I remember Muhammad Ali beating the shit out of Chuck Wepner I don't remember it being like a close fight like they mate didn't they make that fight a draw wasn't rocket even a draw he did Muhammad all he'd knock him out Chuck what no dude he beat him up he beat him up he didn't knock him out but I think he's went I think he went 12 rounds mid that might have been 15 rounds my thing back when they were doing fifteen matter of fact I think it did I think if I remember correctly went to distance but again my boxing knowledge is not like my MMA knowledge it's like be level what year 1975 it was billed as they give the white guy a break oh my god Arius they should have done that in rocky he's knocked out in the 15th round okay fifteen throw so that's what I'm saying it wasn't like rocky rocky the story of Rocky is this guy who actually was a good fighter but just never focused himself decides to focus himself for this preposterous opportunity to fight for the title and actually hurts him actually hurts him and it's a draw at the end of the fight it's a crazy fucking war and turns out to be a draw that was not Chuck Wepner story I mean unless these part of chuck wepner's life we pay them yeah you obviously pay my dad might have this mace be some truth to that function store maybe and stole all has always been known to have a sticky fingers hmm he stuck you from the Expendables that was any student yep and that is to take them back there's in those days that's what they did right for people what people don't know is this is how people would do that they meet with a guy Jamie I hate doing Jamie's and I got an idea but like I moved back to Columbus also a year later Jamie turns the TV on and there's this story on TV Jamie takes him to court and wins he has the notes the appointment that his agent made for him to meet Stallone Austin long has to shell him now the amount of the script he doesn't have to give him proceeds of what he made yeah so it's a it's tremendous scam if you do it and get away with it I'm listening I'm not bad much to one we tase them I've every time those Rocky's come on i watch those fucking things yeah and I am more more baffled that they kinda still hold up and what's really baffling about the Rockies is they keep on coming you know they're writing another one Creed yeah Cree now that they got Michael B Jordan yeah you know did you see the video of Michael B Jordan going through that tactical course it's fuckin badass man I don't know what movie he's preparing for please prepare for some fucking crazy crazy shoot-'em-up movie I guess you know I did Harun tactical I did this thing with our boy and I didn't know like boy was John Murtha was telling me that half the movies he does you gotta go to a six month before there's a road he's going through one of these courses like John wick style listen you gotta go through six months of this it says it's with four black panther so this is when he was in that movie Black Panther so he's preparing for he's a bunch of guns movie this no no no make sense yeah he did shoot a lot of guns not really yeah he was a mercenary don't remember Michael B Jordan was a killer and then I remember the hand-to-hand fight so I guess yeah well there was that too but I'm sure there was some gun fights and just to be able to handle it and look and look like this look like I mean I don't know enough about shooting to know if this looks good looks good to me though you know I'm saying well if you watch like Tom Cruise and collateral mm-hmm when he goes into the Japanese bar on in Koreatown or whatever it is he's using tactical shooting yeah like it's real tactical yeah I always knew that Tom Cruise is an alternate professionally that's why he gets twenty eighty million a movie the whole deal but I had to talk to our boy he was telling me now that all these movies now you go over there five six months before the movie starts and it's you know eight hours of training mm-hmm you gotta give it up for your boy John wick oh yeah it's 56 five hours a day jiu-jitsu he's doing jiu-jitsu and he there's a bunch of scenes of him doing that say or say who did it with a Henry rifle on those Henry old-school Western rifle spanglish with those called you know those little load them up ones where you let the rest down to reload we were kids we had those yeah you pump them the stronger begin shot your grandmother something like eighty times if you hated the motherfucker you start pumping that bitch at like 6:00 in the morning you get all full that was the ultimate dangerous weapon to give to a kid a fucking we had everything we had tube surgical tools oh my god yeah I had a friend that lived on the second floor he would just peg off kids walking over check just he was in school too so he would run home from school go on his fucking on his second third floor attic lay on the floor like a mercenary and just shoot kids they couldn't invest down oh my god how funny was he he would put nails he would put nails and wait tables like deed at school someone people put that books down they get caught by the nail he was just a fucking nut no he's somewhere installing elevators in Pennsylvania so I'm gonna fuck those wrist rockets are so dangerous we just use marbles just a Chris Rock is by a bag of marbles and get a wrist rocket oh yeah coz marbles they fly consistently you can get used to where the trajectory is gonna go if you have a rock oh the fuck knows that much that rock weighs you know this rocks heavier than that rock it's hard to figure out where the fuck things are going but when you get good with a marble you understand like right here I kind of can judge the arc of that marble you can start nailing things you can start nailing things I mean you got your first marksman repeated you ever got a marshal repeat it I never had one of those marshal repeater his pellets BB's and darts I had one of those knows about a oh my mother caught me gave me a beating I had the fucking double-oh-seven knife that's a knife from the seventies the ins Oldham in Newark or in Harlem I remember several Oh sevens and a wooden handle hood and I used to get the the painted jeans do you know I don't when I was like by the third grade do you know he's still shaking down on the way out and the way and do you know that because they were worried about you Oh in the first second grade before my mother put me in Catholic school it was called shake down take socks off Wow sorry how much money you went out with this piano no that's a Marchman repeat oh look at it it was bb's pellets and that's where you put the darts up on thought you had a lot of how many kids got shot by the cops holding that thing none what are you talking my god none none that's the 70s nah no okay we're talking to you first before they shot you in the head when they start to shoot and they shoot you in the fucking leg back then oh they were normal people because they were neighborhood kids they in those days the cops in your neighborhood 60% were from that neighborhood so they understood the person they understood the kid they knew he had mental health now they'll get up suddenly from cold the city and put him in San Diego they don't know the area when we were growing up especially when you were staying with your grandpa no work all those cops grew up in North on the road and said fucking crazy don't worry about them is when you go out over the Rogen's you take your gun out you don't point that bright Joe put the gun down I see what he's saying like the cops were members of the community knew so they knew they weren't going into everything cold they weren't going into everything cold I think the people that I have to worry the most of cops are pull people over cuz you just fucking never know you see what happened yes I'm the cop the black dude in North Carolina whatever he was I don't know way it wasn't sorry Fitz North Carolina he was smoking a blunt the cop pulled him over he fucking drag the cop whoa grab him by the elbow it's Jamie I know you saw it on the news dragged them twice not once but twice the cop was try to pull the gun then the cop shot him in the leg oh Jesus and he still dumped the cop off and he got away Wow so he's out there the hole in his leg yeah no they finally caught it me - ambulance I won't get forgiveness so he's just smoking the blot looking up right in front of the cop the cop said he smelled marijuana so is he holding on to him yeah over the side whoa so the guy tried to drive off and he hung on it looks like he hung on to the car am i correct there that's um when you he's reaching for his gun now I looked at one now look at that are those bullets yeah I mean look I just dumped from their Joe Rogo shit what he he just thousand there and they got fell over on the dirt he probably fucked himself yeah he fucked himself up that poor guy so was he holding on it's like when the car takes off like what is he doing it looks like he's holding on so that's the way Joe Rogan I can't tell so it usually has yes so they usually have that BAM along the side will you put your leg up at least that's what I think is going on but he's holding on to the window - it looks like he's trying to hold he's got his arm in he said well this time he's got his lies he's holding on to his seatbelt he's holding on to his seat yeah no it is look at look at this oh yeah that's it that's what he has so he's holding the seatbelt man he's got his good fucking gun out he shoots the guy not yet he goes to grab for his gun is that when he shoots him cuz the dude does look like he at one point in time man leave me the fuck alone look his grill I'm just trying to smoke my motherfucking blunt what is he going on with his teeth is that like some kind of iced out girl I don't know now that's when he's does that boom he shoots him Wow but at least he shot him in the leg and not right don't write but the whole thing she was rather crazy he's hanging on with just a gun by dash cam shows Florida man drive of course it's for Florida driving off for the deputy dragging from his car after traffic stop the man is now facing an attempted murder charge okay was he dragging the car or was the guy hanging on he was a guy hanging on while he's trying to drive off was that the same I guess yeah but I mean I don't know if he told you to stop you can't go so like you can't rush drive away can't just drive away okay with that and once the car starts moving you're he's hanging onto the door you are dragging him yeah so he's hanging on to the seatbelt and they're dragging him fuckin stitches the guys walk around with a bandit slip the dude who got pulled over though he's hilarious play that again his reaction he just keeps puffing on the blunt smell marijuana man were you talking about what look at him he's an Aries he's right a little movie like those are so sparkly are they is you have a grill on can you tell it looks like he's got some kind of ice to up grill am i imagining that again my name is Joe Joe Rogan what his name is Rocco Rocco see he's got a wild name - that is hilarious the whole thing is so funny I hope the cops okay Ronnie this is babe his name's rocky money I told you it off yes rassee money boot off down the tracks cops done lit up rocky morning money rudolf judea to boot oh that's hilarious the best name i've seen in 14 years on the job [Music] rocky money rudolf that poor cop went to work yesterday with a positive attitude and he gets fucking dragged smoking a black and milds the cops like i smell weakness like i don't have we don't have marijuana so was it just a cigar that's what he says he says just a black and loud it's a very distinct smell between a black amount of marijuana well maybe if you're some goofy cop and as you know I think it's marijuana pull him out what do you think it smells what is what is a black and milds smell like so what it's called black and milds what does it smell like I don't know but yes a very strengths the distinct smell you can tell it between us any cigar and a black or Maude you can pick it out see but I don't know that what if I had become a cop and I smelled that would I have to know what a black and milds smells like he might not like weed what is this mile thick cigarettes tobacco a smoke yeah it doesn't smell anything like we you know what smells great pipes I got a nice it's closer you know isn't it interesting that like the smell of tobacco from cigarettes it's kinda gross smell from a cigar not that bad smell from a pipe a lot of people like that smell like a lot of people like like kids like the smell of pipes smells like some tobacco burning in a pipe actually smells good weird I like the smell of weed fuck all this shit then pipe nutmeg in it yeah those are old the guys used to this month not around that much I love was nutmeg nutmeg the real but what I'm saying is that drug when I was younger when I was in my teens I felt like people were smoking more pipes at all the schools tea there was a teacher my grandma school smoked a pipe I still remember a teacher from my high school vividly smoking a pipe I haven't seen anybody smoking of Piper steven crowder give me one that's right here smoked one he was on the show yeah but he gave it to you for refill yeah brought tobacco and everything how was it it it's not bad it's a kind of a pain in the ass you got to keep it lit you know it's not something that just stays lit like a joint you know you got to kind of keep will it make you feel like it's like tobacco you don't accuse that little high it's a nice little buzz like cigars I think of the best version of that because the cigar stays lit and you're getting it from the leaf to like cause like your tobacco your saliva rather is breaking down the tobacco obviously I'm not a scientist but your saliva is doing something to the back over the leaf and it may look at these little kids smoking cigarettes if you have a pipe this look is gonna pipe is that a pipe yeah I was just looking for kids is the one on the left have a cigarette he's got a cigarette yeah that's this one's probably fake but I know yeah yeah in the 50s and 40s look at that kid smoking cigarettes in the lower right hand corner kids smoke that's like an 11 year old kid yeah Wow look at that all the kids selling newspapers they were all fucking addicted to cigarettes Wow hey do me a favor send me that picture I want to try to get that picture printed up for the studio that's like a little rascals and shit yeah Wow yeah see save that picture see if we can buy a copy of that there was a kid in my neighborhood growing up on the North Bergen his name was Olsen family Olsen that'd be like telling them like Jimmy Olsen yeah they live next to a body shop by 13 he had already been smoking fuck I swear to god he had cavities so he would just put the cigarette in the tooth gap and just leave it there oh I'll deal with the cigarette in the cavity his teeth the green he's on Facebook might say I thought movement at the time and should I wave at him but that's how bad in the 70s and 60s I think the fifties kids were fucking smoking well give that give your throat a vacation smoke a fresh cigarette camels shit it's a doctor a doctor's telling you to give your throat a vacation Chesterfield cigarettes are just as pure as the water you drink Wow people were evil back then they just lied what God wanted more doctors smoke camels what it's a than any other cigarette I get of course I smoke camels I like to relax as much as anyone your t-zone will tell you t4 tastes t4 throat from me the first time you smoked a cigarette and in a pie for 14 or 15 what happened to you I thought it was disgusting I thought I was about like nine I thought it was a fucking horrible I got dizzy and then they turn to say right I almost put the bathroom on fire and my mother found that no-good the next time I smoked one again was many years later Adam Ferrara used to smoke and he gave me some of his cigarettes we were doing some sketch I don't remember exactly what it was about but I was supposed to be smoking cigarette in the sketch I was supposed to be like some annoying poet smoking a cigarette so I kept smoking a cigarette while we're practicing this thing and I'm blasted out of my mind three four cigarettes in we just smoked them back to back to back and you don't smoke oh my god the nicotine I was like this is crazy this is what you're doing all the time I was like you getting high all the time like this a fact science advances new data that may completely change your idea of cigarettes the experiences of camel smokers confirmed camels can literally relieve fatigue and irritability and that doesn't naturally do it it doesn't naturally yeah man people just got sick millions and millions of people got sick from smoking just drop taking a big drag of chemicals mixed with tobacco they probably didn't mix the chemicals with them back then packed down was probably just actual tobacco these all of these ads are really good smoke after you strenuous exercise smoke after strenuous exercise it's hilarious asthmatic cigarettes imagine you got asthma someone gives you a pack of Kools here this will help you hey what you know what you need is camel no filters how about a Lucky Strike hilarious how crazy this how crazy it would be we took one of these ads like if you knew your grandfather died of cancer and you took one of these ads and fucking took it to the cigarette companies got some badass attorneys and said you know what man look at what you guys were putting out in the 50s and 60s mmm doctors favorite cigarette is camel cigarette are you fucking crazy like think about the end think about how outrageous with what we know today that at it outrageous it's fucking out right now ranges so evil like doctors favorite cigarette is they're telling you doctors are not saying like no they're not saying like my accountants favorite cigarette they're not saying my police officers favorite cigarette they're saying doctors to let you know it's gonna be okay because they know it's not gonna be okay you know it's not don't know you don't know you really don't know you really don't know you went to the movies you're 13 you're 10 years old your father gave you a nickel you went to the movies and Marlon Brando was smoking the cigarette in the wild one and all of a sudden you go home and you're like and you tell your friend while that looks so cool and your friend goes smoking is bad for you and you're like no I just saw an article four out of five doctors surveyed smoked camel fucking cigarettes they look to the eighty actually it's not bad for you it can literally remove irritability nose throat and accessory organs not adversely affected by smoking Chesterfields did a six-month study and they said nothing was first such report ever published about any cigarette oh so it's Chesterfields you just get them in your okay imagine there was once a Reuters had it nailed oh I used to date a girl that works at a crazy house like what people go on that crazy mm-hmm and she used to bring you know I was a broke comic she used to bring me home cigarettes I would smoke those cigarettes and go off the reservation uh-oh like they were like low-end cigarettes you gotta see the shit they put in there like I could tell a visible difference from when I smoked a camel or a Marlboro light did you ever smoke Sherm was charm Sherm you know what Sherm is no Sherman was something they were doing where certain cigarettes they would dip in formaldehyde I smoked weed with formaldehyde what's that like tremendous she's fucking tremendous but I was into that shoe at that time that Sherman's Mosley turns people into a zombie you take a joint you dip out of there formaldehyde or coat it my friend load it let it drive it again I was so crazy you smoked that shit and it'd be it'd be ten hours it was up to me this says that it was if when people were doing it they would say it was embalming fluid because it would make you turn into the zombie but it was really just PCP oh really they would call it embalming fluid that's what like urban dictionary and some things that I'm looking up now calling like what what it actually was but did you look up sure yeah yeah that's that's what it says so it's a hoax I don't know that it's a I'm sure some idiots probably did find some formaldehyde or a mauling flit and dip it in but well after all the bad press the PCP got I could imagine the people would eventually be like alright listen the we gotta stop smoking PCP so they were sneaking in things nobody had a good PCP experience another thing said I had 50 good ones good PCP experiences but guys to be honest I didn't know is don't be CP oh they called it THC crystal THC crystals so that's what it was called THC crystal how do you know is PCP because he is later I found that THC crystal didn't fucking exist well THC crystals is like the crystals off of we from what they tell you at that time you'd ask the dealer like where'd you get this wrong we're out on the street was you took stems you threw them in a pot of boiling water then when it comes to a head the stuff that stays to the edge you scrape that off yeah and you put it into a powder form and actually you snorted that was the word on the street but what it really was was PC fucking pee it was an animal tranquilizer oh so they were just saying that so they could sell it so they could sell it and then when you go into New York City in the eighties when you went to the weed spots yeah they sold two types of weed but they also call the thing sold the thing called trays trays trays that's a three dollar bag oh so when you paid they would sell you and a ten dollar bag a sense of me got five joints or something then they would have like a special $20 from Buddha tie and you would get three joints two and a half joints tight joints and then for the tray you get a tight joint of this white powder that look like a line of coke when you put means Abel so what you did was you roll you join then you took that white line you sprinkled in the joint you smoked it bye-bye Irene bye-bye Irene and they always gave it a weird name like Jim Jones Oh tons of time after he drunk Liam saying after kill those people yeah so they would give it we had weird names Jim Jones how crazy was that suicide they would make give it all these weird names Jim Jones named a town Jonestown that's Eno that's when the cops move in when you name a town after yourself like what are you doing I'm just running Vernon Ville and that's just the town but in Guyana yeah I've made people sell everything and moved that that's just a horrific fuckin you know it's been a guy in a bunch of times Steve Rinella you know is that yeah he's been on my podcast from the show meat eater yeah he's recorded a bunch of episodes in Guyana living with the people that live in the jungle fascinating shit fascinating watching all those people live and he's interacting with them and hanging out with them bowfishing with them and shit just wild man they found pictographs on a rock that's on a river they have no idea who made them no idea how old they are just sitting there just probably thousand years old don't know what they mean to some people from an ancient time ago in Guyana I wrote this shit on a rock and you can still see it today I want to see what that fucking place looks like then Jim Jones had no they just did whatever but no it's just a jungle that I just grew up they went back and they read ugh up the old stage he had a landing strip too right yeah that's where you shot that I dog I still remember being a little kid and I'm showing the guy getting shot the federal age the camera falling no the governor or the senator they show they always showed this shot of the camera going down mmm they're the reporters are about to get on the plane and then the truck pulled up and guys just opened fire on them I think I found with the camera rolling Wow the lady's still alive the senator the woman she got shot woman got shot the congressman whoever the congressman the senator what we got he died but her assistant lived and somebody else lived and they just got interviewed it was either the anniversary or some shit I hate all that shit I can't see the people he took down man he just coats are dangerous it's very dangerous when one person wants to be the only one to talk and tell you what to do and make the rules and be special when you got that one person that gathers a group of people and has all those people listened to him without question and tries to say that he has the the answers for whatever reason that's appealing to people it's very weird but people fall into that trap over and over and over again we have a strong confident man who is telling you what you know and then you see them giving in to the power and for whatever reason it makes it even more attractive to a certain segment of the population when you see someone reveling in the power of being a cult leader like I guarantee you when that guy in Waco what the fuck was his name correct correct David Koresh I guarantee you when when he was on the news and talking about how they'll never give up I kept girls were probably beaten down his door trying to get in that cult the crazier and the nuttier and the more more apocalyptic your message the more people that want to join it's weird and they just they just don't have the ability to discern oh this is not a good idea this guy really doesn't have his head on straight this guy might be fucking completely crazy they've always realized those things a fuck fest anyway oh another ten that guy slingin dick he's arrested that'll crush banged everybody's wife yeah yeah yep the friend I had a friend who grew up in a cult in the stories room oh yeah horrific I know the friend I know we talked about yeah horrific you know so you look at this shit and you're like I don't fucking dangerous anytime someone is running any kind of thing where they got to separate you from everybody else come to us we're gonna get you away from all those people it never goes well it fuck it never goes well it never goes well they want control they want control and control of you and the best way to do that is get you away from all this other press people with all their questions they don't know but we know we know what's really going on we know what this is really all about next thing you know you're gonna cult how many cults are going on right now that we don't know about it's like a gang of them that are just like bubbling under the surface that one they found out about last year right that was a section New York yeah that's the real they throw motherfuckers in jail over that one yeah the next someone is a weird one right because it was legit actors and actors and actresses which does a sex call right they're all sex calls they should stop saying sex calls right no no sex cult it just looks like Buddhists they're like they go okay yes whatever you got just think about that a guy who tells you he's God crazy right does she coming back the next they smell like cock and God knows what else look and you have to still respect the guy all in God yeah they do yeah then such a sick sick fucking mind it's certain you have to be in such a weak state as a human being they're really buying into that you can't call them you know you can't call it they're just for the fucked up weird state yes maybe and they had a void in their life somewhere and this is the way by filling it in I just I don't see it I can never join a cult well there's a bunch of different things get along with the leader mm-hmm you got a house yeah those people that want to Jones time have a sell their home did you see wild wild country country no what is it it's a Netflix documentary about the Pacific Northwest cults all rock nice guy that eventually went on to he found this this crazy cult and he went on to buy this town up there I heard about it it's fucking amazing how'd you listen we live around so much stupidity while watching one sit down watching on TV it's really good though the documentary is incredible it's so well done and as Sheila who's running things she supposed to be bullshit it's crazy they put they poison people she did all kinds of crazy stuff it was its wild they ship homeless people in to vote so they could take over the town they just brought homeless people in from everywhere just picked him up come and the homeless people like yay we found a home and some of them were like really into it and then they're like alright we're done with you get the fuck out of here keep them out after they took over the home everyone in the town that lived there before them was fucking hated them they had their own police force armed guards I mean guys armed to the dick okay just carrying machine guns shit well how the fuck is a tool o'clock cuz we that's what always happens with us how the fuck I thought it was like 1 o'clock you know 12:30 we have fun this is e I'm
