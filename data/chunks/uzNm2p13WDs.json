yeah especially like if you it was a part of like a comedy festival maybe not even a regular set just like ladies and gentlemen we present you da my rare and a hammer and you just swinging back and forth with a wireless microphone in the air and talking shit when you look at the Warren Commission report and you look at the inconsistencies in it there's a great book about it called the best evidence by David liftin who was he was actually an accountant and was hired to go over the Warren Commission report and found inconsistency after inconsistency over and over going to detail these in grade order but difference in the inconsistency of the autopsies inconsistencies of the various reports of what went down inconsistencies in the Warren Commission of their findings that would cancel out each other's findings he wasn't one of the few guys with a first guys to go through the entire nine hundred volumes fascinating fascinating book that I read when I was living in New Jersey i was living in New York rather and I was doing a gig on the road and I read it and fucking bombed that night oh my god was in my hotel room all day reading his freaky conspiracy book shit in my pants and I was like 23 years old and then I went on stage that night and just hate it that's terrible and I learned a very valuable lesson from that book don't read or watch depressing shit right before you go on stage did you break into big conspiracy mongering in the middle your set that you just no no but I became a conspiracy break fresh shirt for sure that book best evidence was what threw me over the top I've had to really distinctive times were the things that I saw on before I went on stage fucked me up and that was a big one that was probably the first one might have been the second one it was all the same time I was a slow learner but the other one was I went with this guy named JB smooth you know JB smooth funny funny he's hilarious and JB and I were doing a college together in New Jersey and JB was it was really hard to find JB was he was running late so they had me go on first and I wasn't prepared because I was sitting in the group they had a little rec room with a TV on and the TV was showing this documentary on the Malibu fires oh I was so fucking depressing it was the early 90s and these people lost everything and this guy was crimes a fireman and he was crying and weeping his house was still there but his neighbors had lost their houses and he was just crying and weeping this girl was looking for her dog and they like all right Joe um JB is still late so what we're gonna do is we're gonna put you on and you do your set and he'll go on after you I was like oh no so I went on stage thinking about this guy crying not even for his own loss but for his neighbors lost that girl looking for a dog and I just got so sad and I went on stage a shit when I was in high school I don't remember the kid's name but someone wrote a really cool article one of the one of the kids in my school about a boy scouts about the problem with the whole of the code of the Boy Scouts because one of them was keeping your thoughts clean yeah I forget the exact let's let's put a Boy Scout code so you get to thinking about something like man I shouldn't be thinking well that's that that was anything that works well this guy was the guy who wrote this I remember reading this as I was a you know high school student goes guys got a really good fucking point the the point was like what do you give a fuck what I think like why are you trying to control my thoughts like I'm not hurting anybody I might think something crazy and deviant but I'm not doing it if as long as I'm not doing it I suppose to keep my thoughts pure maybe it's fun for me to entertain ridiculous thoughts but isn't that I know cuz that's kind of like what self-control is mmhmm yeah like self-control doesn't speak to that thought the idea is you entertain my self control speaks to its like you get an email and you're like I'm gonna write a really mean email back but any new is so fun to imagine what you saying I mean email I'm gonna put it up the tamale like Rhett you write a regular email and that is like supposed to be like adult behavior exactly yeah control yeah well you know someone assault rolling your actions you see someone who's an asshole in the car and you want to pull him out of the car and beat him to death but you don't you don't do anything you just go yeah you drive down really like yeah I would I would pull his finger nails out I'd so his eyes open and throw salt on the nigga stare at the Sun I never go there I just go to bone breaking right away snap someone's arm they don't want to fight back yeah trustworthy loyal helpful friendly courteous kind obedient cheerful thrifty brave clean reverent a scout is reverent towards God is faithful in his religious duties he respects the belief of others yeah here's the big one clean a scout keeps his body and mind fit and clean that was the one that this guy had a problem with I I remember reading that going yeah the fucking Boy Scouts are silly kids right
