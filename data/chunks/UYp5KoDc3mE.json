boom I'm rolling what's going on man how are you cuz here what's up my pleasure pleasure pleasure to meet you man I enjoy your social media man and your Instagram is one of my favorite for sure I appreciated millions it's doing me yeah you're doing you but you're doing it correctly it's a lot of fun you're a fun guy like your shit it's fun I just try to be genuine with it that's all that's cuz that's all I've been on there from day one and that's what got me this far that's been working so why not yeah man you know I found out about you Bob found out about you from two people one for my friend Andrew Scholes yeah I love that dude he speaks very highly of you but - because my friend style bender UFC middleweight champion he played your song and one of his walkout so his fights I didn't even know I didn't even know I'm honestly until it's just like a lot of stuff I really don't be knowing I'm out the loop with the mainstream stuff so if I'm not if I came especially something like like UFC I'm still new to that I'm still learning it so when he so went on I think Andrew a Charlemagne the one told me an Instagram told me to him when I looked at was like oh shit this shit is big like smile because this one he did it like why smile bitch was still bubbling so he was one of the people that I kind of realized oh not this shit going to a whole nother level just by him doing there and I appreciate him doing that - cause he's huge now he's huge now here's a champ now he did this back before he won the title this was I believe your shit to me he did win the title when he did that I thought that was the title I didn't know I don't know I'm still new to this that UFC thing actually that's what brought me into it really that made me give a fuck about I was like shit let me see what this is about you gotta come to one live I want to just can you want me to tell you what it is I didn't like to see the excellent nigga getting his ass whooped like like I don't want to keep saying get punch punch punch while they're down man yeah I guess cuz I the environments you come from I try to get away from that type of shit and so to see it like I don't even watch videos like that saying somebody gets shot in the head and I'm just starting to get comfortable watching fights mmm so so with that but now I want to go to a UFC fight not just because now I guess my body then got on my mind I got desensitize to where don't bother me as much well any time you want to go let me know this is a shilling this weekend where Vegas she and I might come fuck with come on down hello let me think I don't want to say I got thing do I got some is at least two titles right oh shit three titles I can't go I'm going on doors how do you forget you going on Honduras no I just be doing shit like you shit whenever I get a chance to now as far as traveling just for fun yeah just for fun just for cheer is why we have my me time my space time to gather my thoughts and do my thing hmm yeah so not even not work-related at all just to join yourself that's kind of where I'm at mentally and everything I just I'm kind of pre retired in my mind really to prepare myself for when when shit slow down I think you should do that I think I should with me for for that well you buy for you need to prepare for 60 I always try to prepare for late I'm 52 so 60s around the corner for me they get 50 I'm just realizing because I remember when I was a kid I used to be like man and I wanna I want to give my life to God and all that but I ain't gonna have no fun i'ma wait till I get about 50 and it hit come 50 about to pull up shit so now I mean but on the 5th is a cool cool agent and I'm just and I'm just started preparing for when when I can't take care of myself but what it all is is that we know it ends and we don't know when we don't know if it's 100 we don't Fitz 80 we know it else so you hear 40 and you go oh how close how close my which I know it's about time to wrap up I don't went half the century like what's the average 100 at the most so I'm like yeah alright I know this shit for the end pretty soon some type of way so yeah let me prepare and then I look at I watch old people like so I pay attention to them so I see what they going through them like I it's my turn pretty soon I had John Witherspoon and earlier in the year with his side of the large ad yeah sorry and he died shortly after he died like a couple months later and uh I've known that guy for a long time and I remember thinking like he was just here he was like happy he had all this energy he was hilarious and then a couple months later the lights shut off that's life man that's life this life that's life that quick just like that was in the big scheme of things from thousands of years it's just like that but a guy like that is just like iconic figure hilarious comedian like he's is it's weird that he's gone you know why because it's weird when everybody leaves it's like they're just they're just it's just they're not in this space anymore you know it's just gone I don't see it as weird though cuz I see death is just as much as life it's the same thing so I don't see it as weird I mean of course emotionally we had motion attached to it bothers us you know but anytime I get it yeah that's what I think it I think that's the key to all this shit understanding once you understand you just you can't pretty much got life figured up you think you have life figured out I never feel like that I never felt I got life figured out yeah you think you got it nailed I mean it's tough to learn like I'll just tell them stuff like this they've just opened my mind stuff he was just telling me stuff but all the flow tank but the beginning and it's pretty much life and death that's like it's just like any other thing in life I mean any other thing that's living there's nothing no no difference so it's like we just think it is because this shit here make us arrogant that's true and I also think it's a thing it's a manager perceptions thing you know like you have to manage your perceptions like how you view things so you could freak out about things or you could just everything's perception is everything I mean it's just how you look at it in this that's what keeps you sane understanding like it's just how you look at it and understanding there's no good or bad and shit is what it is you just got to be on the right side yeah and the universe doesn't care it just keeps marching the other very nature don't give a fuck not at all nothing is more powerful the nature and once we realized we'll be mo humble you said you saw cats hunt on a safari yeah what was that like I got it on my phone did you see him get one uh you got to sit there for a minute and I didn't have no weed and then where were you you know tens of Tanzania Tanzania I posted on my Instagram out why I tried to share shit like this here cuz around front we never seen no shit like that but it was dope as fuck it was it was way more interesting than I thought it was gonna be it's like really watching like being in the hood and watching the fight or watching somebody get get shot okay yeah I got a little dope give it a sec cuz there's a oh I clap something that I clap give it a second unless y'all got Wi-Fi yeah I got cricket you know I'm gonna rich broke life stuff but yeah it was dope as fuck man like just being out there I take I took a lot of pictures and shit I got it like a histogram pee where I used to post post dope pics from when I traveled and shit did they make you take malaria medication I never took nothing yet know where I went really uh and I'm glad I didn't because I heard people that do take them shots and stuff they get sick real circuit yeah well thank you and plus I don't eat a lot so it ain't too much that's gonna fuck me up I eat McDonald's wherever I go McDonald's is your friend but you like the country it's thank you see is that oh the show take that one too yeah oh yeah yeah yeah I took that pit so is this your other Instagram the comedic are yeah that's my other other so it's just photographs photographs like just and I call the comedic guy cuz I think comedians got to dress that you know cuz we observe you know so I mean you should be able to take good pics if you're comedian well this meat markets intense whereas that was it a Zanzibar well I think what kind of meat is on that oh shit I don't know something I even eat so generally McDonald's man like I don't trust me and matter-of-fact me in our a drew one time we went to uh we did the hip not the hip-hop Awards shit the MTV Awards over in Europe and why we was over there the crew and everything and I I travelled alive I'm like it was like man we're gonna go get something to eat and I'm like I ain't eating this shit like now come on let's go get something I was like man you gonna fuck up go over there everybody the whole crew had to go to the hospital I was the only girl really here cuz I don't eat that shit y'all got food poison trying to eat Andrew - I'm not sure he said he didn't but I swear I told him - he said he didn't get it but he might have listened to me that time but but for the most part I just don't eat when I go out to country I eat shit that I'm used to a fruit rice it's chicken and McDonald's McDonald's you ever see one of those cheeseburgers or they put it on a shelf for a year and they film it a year to see if it deteriorates yeah your later looks like it just got put there that's a good thing though let's face food like if space food is good for austra astronauts yeah it gotta be good for us like we be hating on McDonald's way too much like nobody's really really died on on paper right they have from jacket they dad from eating a lot you eat anything a lot you go guys PP he fishing and fat is fuck that's true but I think someone's died from e.coli I think that was a bird that was jack-in-the-box oh right they had an e.coli outbreak I mean but that could be at everything and it could be in any restaurant a place that shit that you just showed on there I'm pretty sure it's Ecoline that shit oh yeah they by the immune to it yeah that's what they learn - from traveling at the end of the day you could eat anything you just can't eat a lot of it mm-hmm you get it when I go over the Asia baby everything moving do you see that there's a meal to like a hundred my kids explain this to me I didn't know about this it's called mukbang what's that it's a style of video that they do in Korea where Korea like I guess their proper and polite when they eat that's they have good manners they tried to do that culturally so they have these videos that are real popular where they just eat like slobs they'll eat like octopus and they have the just splatter food all over their face and make a lot of noises while they chew and these videos are insanely popular millions and millions of views of people watching someone eat that's cuz it's well you can't go by they are view of millions and they view ain't that much because you guys think it's billions of them so I mean that's true but there's not billions of Koreans but I guess it's it's a lot of them how many Koreans are there that's Google it's a small country relatively hey Syria how many uh how many Koreans that day out you Koreans population out you I don't know that you know let me just do the paper right tap type at the old house yes population Korea 50 million 50 million what are you have to do one point fifty one point four seven that's a lot and how many is America's 330 so it is no so it's more of us they don't know how many Mexicans are they do not they do not and let you go to a concert look you go through a constant endlessly fucked up that there's a population of people that live amongst us can't get green cards and they if they left like you ever see the documentary day without Mexicans mm-hmm la would fall apart la would literally collapse because always do that we show them show us you're the humblest yeah but they can't because they don't have the paperwork that's the thing they're all they're all illegal if people come over here or legal in there you know valet parking and washing dishes and don't lead if ER until and scape and everything they can do if if they stopped other people just gonna take their job other people someone else is gonna find them nobody's gonna take a job as paying two dollars an hour like they aren't making that much no other than someone else just like them that needs that opportunity and they're all coming over they would have to organize they would have to have some resources needed to sustain themselves while they're organizing yeah but the thing is about the green card thing is like you just should be away where someone can earn a green card I mean if someone's been over here for all this time doing great having a good life being a good part of the community but they're still not it's like how does that work though like if if we get overpopulated cuz the mission like what do we do then like I keep panic like we always say like we we gotta let everybody in because that's how we got here but then when they get full and you look like LA and traffic like a motherfucker like alright go back home you don't want y'all you don't want no tourists here we don't want no Outsiders here so how does that work like what do we do there is no solution you're right person illusion there's no perfect solution it's real messy there's life if you want to make a perfect solution what you do you have tests for everybody mm-hmm everybody kind of slow to American thought like what would be the test like this isn't you can have a test like that does it be bias maybe but I mean who works harder than Mexicans just have to be on paper what it's gonna be like who can build a house who are you like maybe there's a way to find out who you are like what kind of person are you your person that's valuable member of the community well nowadays with technology they could just put something and scan you and figure it out find out your thoughts a put you on an fMRI read your brain yeah but then you gotta figure out what would they be looking forward to see if they can let you in they convicted a lady in India from brain scan of murder there was a they used fMRI and they said that through this machine they were able to detect functional knowledge of the murder and that's Minority Report is that moving I don't think they're don't think it's real though I think they just didn't understand the see if they wrote something about it it can happen though it's gonna happen no it's gonna happen I definitely think it's gonna happen but I think to where they're out right now if this person really did get convicted I don't think they really understand the science I think they're just convicting them because someone said it makes sense and then there's not enough people that actually understand what how little you actually can read like she could have had she could have been told about the scene right and then devours your reading society in this rain it's not clearly defined yet it's just like if you told me some of it like what somebody told me after a while if you keep replaying in your head you think you told yourself yes yes you think maybe it was your story with somebody else's story that shit happens to people yeah especially like minor shit from like 20 years ago and then your friends like I told you that last week remember oh yeah I told you it happened me on Instagram boat I'll post something ten years ago a tweet and the next thing I know somebody else do it and then I bring it back they say yeah I got it from them like bitch I made it up memory is a strange thing it's a very strange thing that's some good that's the thing reason why I like technology too because it kind of keeps it I'm going in here oh yeah for sure keeps our brain in here so you just got to pay for it you got to pay for your brain that I clap that's really our brain but it kind of solves all the times it's all time or two that's a good point it really is kind of my brain that's where everything gets stored you have to pay for your brain for the rest of your life in that video of the Alliance just like one of those fucked up old memories yes what you said you owned you said you don't know feel like you got life figured out why not like what was I just endlessly confused by all of it I mean I understand it you live you die I understand how to be nice to people and understand what's good and bad I understand you know about you but I am so what you feel like you're missing something what no it's still bizarre as fuck like the more when you look at it when you really look at what it is it's bizarre as fuck all these random interactions taking place simultaneously amongst billions of people swarming on a planet that's spinning and toral twirling through infinity is going through the galaxy but that's with all the star and just all of that when you see all that and you notice all that you realize we are pretty much an ant like in a big scheme of smaller than a hat we just I'll chair so it makes no sense to put that much thought into this bullshit I fuck it like it is what it is I mean that's true too yeah it's not like I want to think about it all the time I just I do it out of boredom like I'm I'm damn near wanna wanna go to Mars and all that shit you know but I just don't want to be the only nigga Mars is too long that's six months yeah unless it's a party on there gotta be lit bro think about that think about this what if the earth was moving there now we owned the party bus now right we are in the party bus you in the party bus and is a space they don't tell us nothing I mean when we get there they be like are we here yeah because if you think about it earth is like a spaceship with like a convertible spaceship there's just no roof yeah yeah yeah I mean there's the only thing save us is the atmosphere that's where yeah yeah I want how much would the space should be different be like an apartment complex versus a whole city yeah honestly they could be doing it that's what he should be that's what the motherfucking billionaires should be trying to do move this goddamn earth out the way just push it but we want to go in the Sun with it yeah how does the Sun how come maybe I'm just being retarded as hell how does the Sun heat this guy eat the earth up but not the moon like why the moon coat move doesn't have an atmosphere the atmosphere is what captures the heat but yeah that's what captures it but so the heat ain't out there in space well the heat is on the moon the moon and the Sun it's 250 degrees and in the shade it's 250 degrees below zero so the moon never turns new this always like just stuck in one position yes and it's it's the moon is stuck in one position right I'm trying to picture it hold up this the moon the earth and then the Sun everything is revolving around the Sun the thing is the moon revolves around the Sun like this like it's always doing the same thing so as a piece of the moon is high there's just the Sun if you get in the Sun the Sun SPOT the bright spot of the moons 250 degrees if you get in the shade its 250 degrees below zero so giant flares a son Paul yes it gets very hot in the moon the thing is there to protect it or they're not rather they're not protected by an atmosphere so we have an atmosphere the atmosphere the the magnetosphere the oxygen the nitrogen all that stuff filters out all the heat and captures and keeps us study the sir one of the reasons why we're here we understand yeah cuz I but the school's I understand how the moon's important for the ocean and all that but I'm just wondering I was sitting there watching um my favorite movie and the selling and I was you know I was yeah that's a good movie I watched that I rated it's definitely it's really very lifelike is it's pretty much what it is but I was watching that and I watch it in a mankind that new one that's on Apple plus I was watching that it's on the moon and I'm just looking at him like where the Sun it like and if the Sun would start making me think like that but ain't no I appreciate you telling me that not look at it some more see there's no atmosphere in the atmosphere is the reason why we have blue skies the blue skies yeah I know all there so when I thought that was I thought that was stopping it from burning us up no no no no no no so that's not starting this it stops us it helps us from getting burned because we have an atmosphere yes moon there's the moon it's hot as fuck yeah that's what I'm saying so so the moon is hot it do get hot on them it also gets insanely cold okay if you go in the shade it's fucking cold a shit 250 degrees below zero you never want to go out of space yeah I'd like to go and just see I'd like to go over the lip that's my goal that's my goal that's my my goal in life like I just want to do a selfie with the earth behind doesn't it happen that's it that's gonna be available real soon yes 15 there right is you're saving up is that what it is now I think a core takes you on like virgin virgin yeah you get to go out there and and come down but so this is something they're already doing I haven't ordered sort of pay attention to find out that day I undergone a ticket for any problem I definitely won't war for real like yeah I'm gonna do it I'm gonna start a gopher and tell them to put me up there tell the black people to put me up there been doing this I don't know there's another company I know them and they're doing they have a raised platform race for the out of space but so is this the virgin jet this is a virgin oh yeah that's another code that's got like a balloon that's gonna shoot people kind of straight up and back down yes all that wise did you see how it did that it rides on top of a plane and they're like let's go yes fuck to me if I have money like that I will be kind of like this look where they go holy shit nice like you get to go like like a roller coaster there yeah like 10 minutes maybe when I go right there not a lot that's all I need right there just the talk shit it's done you motherfuckers ain't never did that would be the ultimate stunt on their starting up above the earth yes you're the hardest fuck and I want to prove all the flat earthers that's mom's dumb fucks I want to show them so bad you stupid motherfuckers yes I want to do that so bad shit on them it's so sick I can't believe that's a real thing me neither America's like where I live in I got a house in the Bahamas like you went at night time you can really see how right on the earth is cause it's so pitch black and when you walk out the yard at night it feels like you out of space and you can really see how round the earth is listen is damn this stupid how people don't don't believe that is righteousness it just people want to believe shit is a trick people want to believe everything is a lot people didn't think America was here when it was over here like it's true it like it sounds so just like people don't think out of space we don't think it's hard to think that fathers didn't you think therefore you got to think about it you don't want to think the people that didn't think America was here at least they have the benefit there was no photographs they had never been you know anybody who's been so it probably was way more of a question whether or not America existed versus whether or not the earth is round the earth is round you can see it it's not hard they have satellites to take a photo of it every 10 minutes the idea that all that's fake is so crazy the idea that every mission is fake every Space Station mission every satellite all that's fake like why these guys and the weird thing is a lot of the dudes that are doing it they're like super Christian a lot of Flat Earth people yeah they're super Christian they think that this is all like the idea that we're in space that we're on a flat ball to keep us from God like what I mean in religion and I do believe in religion but their religion you have to keep them in a certain space to keep their mind focused on that right there cuz otherwise they so you can't tell everybody everything no because then they'll go crazy that's why that's why I believe in religion I really did for normal people I know what you said it gives people help hope anything that's gonna bring you to love and peace you can't be mad at yeah you know so I feel like it's it's like something that helps evolution almost like a vehicle for aiding evolution to take us out of our barbarian days into our civilized days and then transcend but this is religion or wisdom or right here I think so I know so cuz this with we're conveying and talking in in preaching pretty much this is I mean this is our evolution of I believe where we're at we're at the evolution of entertainment and conversation is like our Bible and that's what we're doing with social media I tweet my shit like that like I tweeted thinking like a hundred years from that somebody's gonna read this shit like we read higher graphics okay so I see what you're saying so it's are all of our way of talking shit out and figuring things out the same how religion was and that's why they established these parameters yes because you understand all right if you go this way this is what's gonna happen I got to tell them this so they it's like a child you're not gonna tell them all the truth because if you tell you ain't ready for it and that's what religion is like I ain't gonna tell them that that God was I mean that Jesus is really a regular person because if you do ain't nobody gonna trust no regular person I got to make this motherfucker up me amazing walk on earth walk on water didn't you trust it yeah you know I'm saying but if he just like me and you he fuck up no man once you don't want to see a fuck up yeah especially back then when everybody knew that no one knew what the fuck was going on and they were yeah you know they made up I mean not that any of the gods aren't made up but they did make up gods God for Thunder the God of War the god of this the god of that that all these gods battle it out over destiny there was just gets bored yeah so I guess shit that's what all this shit got from boredom this shit we doing right now this is border that's yeah for sure this is I mean it is funny that what people do today when they talk is kind of like they're trying to figure things out and rheostat like that's one of the so much change going on with the way people communicate and the thing that fucks us up is our brain for sure we are more nature than we're more this than we are this this is like this is just everything we talked about was just speaking just talking just talking shit we don't all the thousand times and regurgitating what really makes us how we move yeah what we do you know it's about how your actions your action is really much you creatures of habit you know that's what really tells you like I'm talking all day I can say I'm a good guy but if I show it hurts you know yeah and the other thing that you just said we're creatures are how were creatures that's the other thing like human beings wanna think of ourselves as something separate we're doing the exact same thing everything did yeah live and die we'll just do it weirder than anybody we do it weirder than everybody else that's I bet every other crew should be looking at like look at these motherfuckers hey just look yeah yeah all they do is give up shit fucking death that's it get high play video games do they get out movies animals no I care about shit that don't matter we fight we fight for sport but this the most entertaining shit of I wouldn't give this shit up for nothing no it's enjoyable we're at a great time too I love watching this shit I love life that's the wrong the reason I want to live long cuz you enjoy it I want to see how that shit gonna play huh how do you think it's gonna put out you never know it's all about humans emotions because it can go either way but I know I mean I think it's gonna play out weird it's not gonna be it's not the same world that it was 50 years ago it's not gonna be the same world it's gonna be a totally different world and I just won't look at it and be like fuck em I did that one day I was at UM in Vegas that was the place where everybody be performing Dre Dre Dre us was that then you know you got the outside Club and I'm looking at it and I remember be going to Vegas 20 years ago and like I'm like damn this shit look like the future like now it looks like how I thought it was gonna look twenty years ago and I was thinking about all the people that didn't see this mm yeah yeah I got a state to see how this shit gonna be after this like I want this I want to see even if I'm locked y'all like this here I just want to see I want to have it have my memory that's my that's all that whoa yeah if you take out your performer from the 1950s from Vegas the old-school performers like you know Frank Sinatra and bring him to 2093 fuck what the fuck happened it'd be like what the fuck someone hands on a pamphlet or girls that come to your room like what the fuck gonna be shit what is it gonna be what's it gonna be 20 50 years from now I think humans gonna all be one oh like me and women is gonna be one we're gonna evolve into one like aliens yeah I can you see those alien little gray guys there was up no day we're getting closer and closer like even if you look at ages you can't really tell a boy from a girl do you really gain they all look like they got the same structure like me so they even I think Asians the oldest people on earth so theyíve all way before so we come around to it well they do this crazy thing about they definitely a hundred years ahead of everybody on there well they definitely are for technology for all the things they created they mean we talked about this yesterday like a million firsts came out of China everything came out a Chinaman like they ahead of us they they were way ahead they were ahead with gunpowder they were ahead with everything that's what that's what I like if you want see how the future gonna look go over there yeah you see yuichi looks over lobulated protests no it's untested in Hong Kong for how long now months for what four months but their government is changing they used to be under British rule now they're under Chinese rule and that happened I think in the 90s and there was a in the 90s whatever it was it was there's a there was a there's a lot of issues with the Chinese government running them the way they run China and the people from Hong Kong wanted to be back the way it used to be when it was run by Britain and their extraditing people they're doing they're doing things we're and then the protests have been violent the cops have been shooting people it's like a lot of crazy ships and then there's a lot of video of this and the the streets are filled I mean just filled with people protesting every day and it's it's I mean it's not something that comes up too much in the news how often you hear about this in the news what can we do about it go it's good question we just watch it play out just like they do with the with everything else with Vegas that's why I don't get too much into their type of shit cuz if I can't change it it's like what the fuck I'm gonna do one thing I could do is change what I think the future gonna be that shit there's some shit that was playing 50 years ago that's true you can't change it but it's also true that's fascinating is it yeah to me it is it's cuz I'm watching I just think it's right over of people with no power try to overcome a tyrannical government that's happened before in another in other countries you know there's plenty times and someone some lost it's just you got to figure out what if you're trying to make it not happen to us we got to figure out why it happened like this and try not to to make that happen over here for our butterfly fit yeah well that's one of the reasons why a lot of gun advocates are very happy there's not very happy that this is happening but you happy to use it as an example of what happens when you have an unarmed population and an armed military that sort of tells it what to do and there's nothing you can do but of beginners I believe in gun low I just don't see the point if like because at the end I'll like if you put the who not who not gonna get a gun now if you make it illegal right the people that shit they don't give it you can get illegal guns into it not me yeah not me but me you can leave the guns anyway but the people the people the law-abiding citizens you make that loan ass they can't get one yeah I was stupid at this point and if people can YouTube and make a good like it's just stupid yeah will they make them with 3d printers yeah I see I've seen it on YouTube yeah but remember there was a guy who got in real big trouble because he released the designs remember that Jamie it was a torrent was supposed to be and I think they're arguing that you should be able to do that and it's essentially a plan you can go out another country and make a YouTube page and do it like is this the way the world is so connected and far I it's kind of you could do pretty much anything you want if you know what you can do ya know now there's oh that was a good tweet you could do it is what I say you do what you want anything you want to do if you know I watch this and then and then post it about 34 minutes it you would you didn't smart start smoking weed two four years ago yeah that's crazy I never smoked and never drink I mean I drunk every blue moon like on my birthday but I don't drink I hate liquor hate the way it tastes so what happened we're smoking yeah um what well when I was younger everybody did it so that was one reason I didn't want to do it cuz everybody was on drugs and all that my daddy used to do crack and all that so I was I was against drugs so as I grew up I just never gave a fuck about it as much as anybody else did but I'd used to love the way that smell like I love to in smells I used to be in the room just smelling this shit and then after a while then once I got to a point in my life I was like I can't fall off like this is the worst my life going gears like alright I tried and then that was the best thing ever happen to me trying that shit when you tried it were you like what the fuck was I thinking boy I should've been doing this yes oh yeah cause when I first did it I did get high cuz like I tried to get the song shit I was scared like I was like he's gonna do something and I ain't doing shit I was smoked everybody that was with us you know I was just smoking smoking smoking and then once I started really getting into it I was like this shit is really what's up like what are the laws down in Atlanta I [Laughter] [Music] don't know it's just so stupid it's illegal everything is stupid man oh it's just that just make all drugs legal well that's the only thing that's gonna stop the cartels I don't know what this shit I just smoked but that shit good is here yeah that's Kevin Smith shit that's uh what did you call it Jamie do you know Jay and Bob they all have different little names on them I think that she had some what's name only research new goons this one says new goons is shit good in a bitch this is the indica one oh you smoke the indica one black yeah like I like black oh yeah like in the indicas you like they to me they like slow me down like that's what I need that's what you want that's what I need I really do need it's the slow me that I was way hyper I was doing way more thinking to like that was why about too much shit you mean no not too much I was just wild like and I don't even say while in a bad way I just say I was saying way too much I shouldn't be saying that and especially this day and age will P be any feelings and shit you know not that I give a fuck but when you trying to help people you want to teach them the right way so what do you think happened like what you just said that people in their feelings today like what do you think happens why do people get so sensitive because with attached time oceans more and we don't do that much taken you know I don't think what changed uh social media yeah a lot of it but I don't like to blame it on social media cos it's just the evolution because they say the same thing about television and all that shit but I just think it's the use of it to the to the public I think that's what it is I think now every person and there's it opened up our minds even it's just new to the society as one but over time of the evolvement and will get smart enough to figure that and it won't be that much we still learn that humans are still learning their feelings now I mean especially in America they're still learning their feelings like Asians and got that feelings no more so so now we just had our stage of still learning that feelings and hating each other and all that shit there once that does settle then it'll come evolve naturally louis c.k had a real good point about this he was saying that it's like what you have on Twitter we've always had it's just people talk like sometimes people talk and they say shit that stuff that's dumb they say nonsense you know but this is kind of like the same thing they're just exact same thing it doesn't mean anything it's just the same thing we all want to say anything we just wanted package different yeah and that's what I learned on social media that's why I was on it quick cuz I've learned it I figured it out that seemed like oh shit this is a new real estate yeah this is where it's going so I I knew what I applied that to the social media internet and and that's that's how I work so good for me it's the same thing cuz it's nothing changed you just gotta figure out what it is and take it from the old glad to the new I feel about it like two ways I feel well I enjoy social media I think it's a good thing overall but I think that all the complaining is because people are getting there they have a voice now that they never voice before and they also get rewarded for complaining yeah right people that they don't last as last long it fails is that but it's also annoying so eventually what happens is people gonna wake up to it and what this is is just a new it's a new level of communication because everybody can communicate now with almost everybody it's real close to everybody to everybody but that's getting better though because 10 years ago it was real sensitive I remember on Twitter but now we got points like like now people like Dave Chappelle could put out especially talking real shit yes and people take it for what it is well five years ago you had to be like Kevin Hart you know so it's like now you can really speak your mind so let's evolve and people getting is it like it did bring out the the the whole ass motherfuckers at the same time after why I like bill bird shit that shit was genius - yes like he can say that now like five years ago that special wouldn't work as much as he would've got beat down but now it's like all right the tides turning dance turning so it's just it just takes time it takes time for people to get it take to have people to warm up to what they don't want to accept yes 100% agree and I think overall the more reasonable way of looking at things is going to prevail because the the dummies won't be crazy for a stop you just got to be patient yes just gotta be patient and yes just mad no I'm a patient motherfucker we are with those indicas hey I love this indicas er that's a patient type of weed mm-hmm hello you been scuba diving about ten years now yeah about ten years and that's where I learned about life who's good with that yeah Scoob with that and let me know I didn't know shit how deep do you go down had the deepest Abed like 130 Oh but ain't none down there when you get to that point ain't nothing living down there okay you might see his shipwrecks and shit like that that's so fucking deep yeah is 130 says you there you go from a space oh so that's from there and take pictures yeah bring an iPhone down there or no that's a nice lift no not that deep that was that take the tectonic plates mmm where you could touch the only place on earth where you can touch North America and Europe oh my god what if it ground right way and honestly you can't I don't even that you could do it no more because they said its prayers a centimeter every year some shit I was separating the poet like Pangaea right you know the theory of Pangaea all the continents at one point in time a long time ago oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know spread apart they actually can piece them back together and form one laughs yeah I saw that yeah but that's what that's another piece that we're still splitting as we speak yeah this motherfuckers moving there's always finding shit right they're always finding their like offs offshore finest city they find some yes there there's a lot of places that we don't know we we more into business than we into life well especially this aspect of life that things are constantly in transition and constantly changing when you find cities under oceans well you see shit like this is you didn't think you know we thinking backwards so that it's like we should care about this more than we care about that cuz natural disaster shows us every time it's like we ants well you look like boom you're living in Atlanta I mean you have to deal with hurricanes the hurricane almost hit me in Bahamas my house didn't hit namu the last day it was coming it was coming directly to my house and they moved 10 miles up in this by 10 10 20 mile and hit Abaco and all of that shit how much of the Bahamas got had that just that island of I think Freeport and Abaco Abaco got hit real bad though that shit like natural disaster type shit like wiped out right wipe out take shit are they getting worse do you think that hurricanes are getting worse I don't know I think just life if nature is doing with this dude its nature it's like that's like that's like a little grasshopper saying you think that you think the humans are getting worse like he can't control us and we can't control the AG yeah but these fucking hurricanes are I think what's causing them is the ocean water and it is definitely warmer it's definitely there I mean that's that's just what this earth is is gonna definitely dad's do something eventually but there's nothing we can do to stop it we can slow it down that's why they trying to find other Earth's so we can move at this motherfucker yeah we so far away from the earth ending dude she may not like to have yeah you know I do believe we need to save there or so than anything well save ourselves it's gonna be fine if we go stay yeah yeah yeah it's gonna be fine without us if we blow ourselves up for her if gonna be okay as far as life yeah we gotta save life gonna save this process no signs of life volcanic eruption kills 5-8 missing this morning the earthquake in New Zealand there people on it what happened eruption kills five eight missing people died on a vacant they were on top of a volcano I was like watching the news business yes where was this New Zealand yeah they had three tour boats that were there there was like up to a hundred people that were there right before it went right before exploded like oh my they would take tourists into the crater where you could be like oh look at look at a bubbling and people were like to tour boat said be us left that's why they have this video of it going off like it's literally like there right there Oh father one boat of people that was still there and that's what people decide our world baby yeah you can't say eight missing that's eight dead people yet it took some drones and we're trying to like see if they could go you know so crazy though America hasn't had one yet that fuck us up that what are you talking about mentally like we're not ready for it like other countries they get them bitches every year yeah we ain't ready for it that's I mean in the Bahamas it happened someone this the worst has ever happened but it happened so much that you you understand you're not big as nature America hasn't had there's definitely spots that don't like la la does not have it but Mount st. Helens had a big volcano eruption back in the day remember a bunch of people died not not in modern day time yeah yeah I was like 1980s hello thanking this society man they keep we couldn't do it when was Mount Saint Helens eruption there's no way to get everybody out the way need another for how much we try to plan it well the big one is Yellowstone that's beyond our earthquakes no volcano there's a volcano eruption in 1980 mount st. Helens in Washington State I remember that I was a kid that was big one man that was like right before I was in ninth grade so I was probably in eighth grade and this was going on oh yeah a bunch of people died yeah was a scary one is it a city no no it's a mountain you know but there's enough people that live near it that got jacked well you look at all that hurricane woulda hit New York that would have fucked up America oh yeah yeah I would even think they realize if came with a dick I was up there when it when they hit it wasn't bad it was a tribal to store but but do you remember when Tribeca flooded a few years ago in New York remember Shane Smith from vice had a video of during that hurricane it was during after one of the storms and Dean Tribeca was like underwater like people go in there apartment complexes the first four feet of the lobby would be filled with water so you'd be sloshing through water to get up to the stairs elevators down that kind of shit so just a matter of the hurricane exactly a real one like the one that hit the Bahamas Bohemians they understand how to live and keep MOOC and bring it back Americans don't even know how to do only people that'll be re probably the Amish hmm if technology starts from scratch start from scratch again would be fuckin like we don't know what to do hey my daughter I had I got an old school like a 75 Caprice but it wasn't my 72 by 72 Caprice I had my daughter Mike huh she didn't know what this was rolling down the window rolling down the window hey motherfuckers wouldn't know what it did mother like matter of fact funny Andrew I was trying to get directions here cuz my shit was fucking up it was so weird he'd give me directions by voice alright you gonna see a light you're gonna turn left you got the old screw way late no no we don't even know how to use those little simple things like we all know east west north south when I first used to get gigs I used to get a notepad and they would call me up on the phone they go okay here's the directions you're gonna take this to the that you're gonna take that for six miles and that's how you got to every gig you got a do and you would write the direction down on a piece of paper and I would have like a folder for all the different times that I wanted these places oh just that's one of the reason why bo get where I live on the island and lies to keep my mind on some regular shit like my mind is if I won't need it on this island I really need it so I learned how to sort of worst-case scenario happen I could steal survive so if you get stuck on the island the rest of the world fall apart oh if they're if the rest of the world falls apart I could steal survive like an Amish motherfucker yeah that's saying I know how to cook like like killed animals and shit like that cuz I ain't good there yeah I still wanna learn how they had to clean a deer I want to learn how to do that type of shit but but for the most part I can get some fish I know other fish yeah well in the Bahamas that's all you didn't need anyway right yeah in chicken chicken chicken and fish and you could probably have chickens just run around there's no predators right snakes what if I singing that there it might drop me you know rich mother might be bringing some type of animal up there you put pigs in the water and shit oh that's right oh that's right those are that's the place where it is that the Bahamas where all the wild pigs are they come up people feed them yeah as a tourist but now I remember I used to go there it would used to be just me and the pigs you know really how long ago was that about five years ago when I first started because that's the first place I went back when I started smoking when I start smart I want to go everywhere I went before and get have it tomorrow and that shit was one of the places where they have wild pigs swimming around the tourists you get tours there really it's just like in scuba diving they start just throwing shit in the ocean like like little statues and shit throw it in the ocean and you go look at it and people be it's just for pictures oh so they put it in there and to try to get more people to scuba dive yes shit yeah and then it ended up become a coral reef and shit like that over time so it kind of is good but at the same time is really that's the only reason why they put it in there pay for people to pay for to it it's a weird way to get people just throw pegs in the ocean it's weird that people will go all over the country yeah people I've heard people talk about in LA pictures all these pictures on my Instagram with the pigs those pics of fuck you up too if you have if you're around them you don't feed them they'll bite you in your ass that's a pig yeah baby fuck mother fuck my picking them up taking pictures you know that's so dangerous yeah they'd be fucking with them they got to stop but I'd be seeing them trying to they be trying to get them drunk and shit you gotta stop that come on come on so they feed those pigs every day is it that like a daily the tourists do but it means so many tourists coming there they give them stuff throw them little brandy so they're almost tame yeah they kind of they kind of involved with it and they they used to they come in this swim teni guy he go on us on there I think Nicolas Cage's throwing that island but he probably sold it look at that yeah I took that picture that's a great picture right do they get food what would they eat out there that's all I know so it's just what the people give them and they you have tourists tourists some tourist boats every day I wonder how they control their population how they keep them from exploding what you mean pigs make a lot of babies yeah and they eat them would be right next oh so the people on the island you okay they steal pigs I guess I mean yes they break it yeah so they feed them that's kind of a wild way to grow ha that motherfucker look like a tiger I just looked at this one look like tiger pig they do it weird yeah you know that happens in regular pigs if you let them more pigs do look nasty but they so fucking good mean delicious like the bacon yes good is fuck okay I had some bacon recently from pigs that they gave chocolate milk and hazelnuts to they fed up chocolate milk and hazelnuts and do it taste better was I don't know I don't think so I think it just tasted like bacon it's like a Ferrero Rocher bacon forever now those little things they're called this for I don't know how to say it it's a hazelnut chocolate thing like that okay yeah yeah I know it's a rare Roche yeah okay yeah I don't know I don't I can't really determine what that tastes like but it was just bacon pigs have a lot of babies man what's weird about the pigs is they're all one thing like wild pigs and domestic pigs they're all the same thing Hulk yeah they just get weird when they go when they get wild their body changes their hair grows longer their nose grows longer the tusks grow longer just from being wild and it happens like immediately they could be out there for a couple months so just naturally does that taking the domestic Pig you let him go and live in a wild when he knows he's on his own there's a shift that happens in his biology and his hair starts growing thicker and his nose is getting longer that's what scientists can use them for something yeah for people like us right as we go out there we just gonna naturally grow horns and what we're gonna get meaner we're gonna we're gonna revert back to what we used to be when we had a hunt and gather yeah and people mad at us yeah as we good it yeah life is I forget the quote somebody somebody made this quote maybe it was George Orwell or someone famous is that if you get a man sufficiently mad you can see the caveman and the red gleam of his eye something along those lines and the idea if you push a person far enough that's why people are always fascinated bus like game of ival still yes like the part where he beat him so much to where he ended up just being like a pet yes you know it's the same thing you you can do that that's what anybody you just mold and how you want them after why you mold into what you want to be mmm that's why that movie was with that show so we doing stand-up that we do and all everything entertainment we you know go how we want how we want it to be yeah how we see the world what we want what we want this the world to be do you ever think of stand-up as mass hypnosis I don't know what that mean Matt maps of mass like mass charge oh okay yeah yeah it you have to put people on the hypnosis and do it that's why if in most comedy clubs the bar is outside of it because it takes away the attention and all right hey I thought you say a mass associate it feels like hypnosis you're in the groove it is like that because and that's why you hate when somebody talks or because it throws you out of the yeah either hypnosis and the people near amount yeah that's the real problem yeah it fucks it up for the people near you see people as you see them turn their head away yeah shut the fuck up you see that it's the art and it takes time but it's hard now because people don't care about art no more some people do like that dude who paid $120,000 for a banana taped to the wall that was Provo he was right that's why we're talking yeah I wouldn't talk about that's why I never post about it see I know what I'm doing I don't talk about shit and I don't want to promote it do you see the other dude ate it some of the guy pulled it off the wall ate it and he said that was you gonna keep talking about it huh yeah it is promo you're right but it's fine because now that that promotes another person to do it yes you seen against the ecosystem that's why I try to watch what I push cuz I know how stupid people uh-oh that's the idea let me put a naked woman there on tape on the wall either that he's it's true stupid shit he make it sense yeah that actually makes a lot of sense it was called comedian okay what was called comedian the art artist yeah he's gonna keep talking about it I bet he's gonna talk about it more look at them you ever go to the LA County Museum of Art mm-hmm good don't go there if you hate that banana you'll hate that place this fucking LA County Museum of Art is one of the weird this like some of it is art some of it's an interesting shit and then some of it is like there's one of them there was a plexiglass box that was on the ground and I literally thought it was a seat I go what is it somebody sit on there got some crafty way said no no that's the art piece mmm so I go what is that supposed to be it was like well the artist wants you to interpret you know whatever is in that box is the art whatever it is you need some tea like what I interpret his mind I would have walked off with it oh that's how you do interesting I think it's bolted down don't forget the first idea that thank you from Back to the Future no it's a there's a guy named TGT studios and he makes these dope clocks you want one I'll get you one yeah I want everything you got in this motherfucker the flame sale it sold out of the flamethrower that's dope we ran out of gas on - you got a dope life man I envy people that just can do what the fuck they want how they won't you know I envy that thank you cuz I have to think about what I do because I have to think about the people under me mmm so which I don't what I do I just feel obligated to but how does it stop you from buying a clock now the guy I'm talking about be able to do what the fuck you want like like this shit is that's what I feel when I'm in here just like and you can tell he really do what the fuck he whoa yeah I do what the fuck I won't don't get it twisted but I still this is just dope thank you though I'm very lucky yeah we are allowed we blessed for sure if you listen to this you're blessed you're alive today you're blesses mm did you achieve it yeah I like it come oh that's um Joel Olsteen shit that's me that's a great fucking song you got a lot to be smiling for that song is the universal that was from the universe yeah that was all the universe I was put out there for the universe I'd love to see what it did that was the dopey shit it's a great message it's a fun message it's great to see what it did just to people just how it brings people together I just when people tell me what it got them through what they doing or just seeing older people seeing people from from babies to 90 years old just enjoying it so you won't even as a comedian as I entertain to see people just enjoying it and enjoying it for the right way on what you put it out there fo yeah you know you like damn this shit working that's the best part of what we do hey he's fine the best part is you know work for me is like like you like I really do what I do for other people because I don't got everything I want you know it's like now it's just all my agenda is for the betterment of other people as a whole that's what I want to see that's your ultimate your ultimate goal my ultimate goal yep my ultimate goal is to have a little bit of look Duval VIN everybody I feel like if everybody act like me the world be perfect you'll be a more fun place for sure you making some good points I'm thinking about how can I help on Khan nothing I'm thinking about you can't do that at this point you can do something like if you implement I don't you're the best thing we can do in life is just be the change you're gonna see just be that everything we are is what we saw so you have to give more examples of that moving the movement that you want one up is the move and it trickles down over time the butterfly fit everything is the butterfly fit Dontrelle so trying to change that's how you change it but in the meantime that shit gonna happen I don't know who writer who wrote depends on which side yo that right hmm that's the second one don't know who's white or who's wrong depends on what side you're on mmm Lil Duval bars you can see that like you know like all black screen white letters face black in the beginning of a film you hit the J no moment no no give me that lighter I'm just trying to think that it's over over I'm high as a bitch his Kevin Smith weed is legit a bit did he say that some crazy amount of THC it's like 40 something percent THC I'd need some of it Kevin's another one he can get high until a few years back wonder what happened well sudden he went from never getting high getting high all day every day that's what I love yeah this is my pastime like I needed at this point just to pass through life it was like I only do it when I ain't got nothing to do which is most time most people ain't got shit to do we just do do you get hot before you do shows yeah unless is like 9-1-1 it was just one time I just like the at that shit with every word I was like no I can't keep doing this I got a way to act when I'm by myself just have this sometimes too when you're traveling you're already like a little fucked up in the head like your head's always kind of a little foggy plane rides getting up early not enough sleep that kind of shit then you have no that's why I got a plane there Oh so that made a lot easier do you fly yourself you actually fly don't you I try the fly I'm learning that's why I just I bought the plane and learned as I go what kind of plans you get I got a baron 50 and a bear 55 and uh Cessna 421 and you learn how to fly them yeah I know how to take off land and do all that but as far as like really paying attention and that's what it's hard for me so I'm still trying to learn to pay attention and learn what's would endure when shit out instrumentation yeah learning when shit broke him cuz the motherfuckers do Burkean and I wouldn't know if my my own pilot wasn't there oh really yeah I don't know I'm sorry what Pro lot of things that shit's break like a motherfucker shit every time I mean it's something on that motherfucker right yeah but I'm blessed the way I can afford to do it and it pays for itself counting in what we do so I like it though and I like the fact that I like getting more more people like me into it you know the thing cuz I think a lot of black people need to get into it more so cuz this should be going on for a long time and for to be going also longer we not into it as much we should I think that's a problem but Aviation's freedom it's man it's the most freedom of them I mean you you got a three dimensional road in the sky you go wherever the fuck you want but you don't know that going till you do it so this this is you right here oh yeah and this is uh s my bear so is this propeller-driven it's a not this uh engine just just a regular engine but it's driven by a propeller yeah yeah to to Continentals I think there's got kundiman engines in them so those are supposedly the best if something goes wrong cuz you can still kind of land them yeah they best this is always best they have two engines because my first plane I bought had had one it was a piper and and he and that would be cool too cause it's a lot of laying the land on a nerf but I used to go to the Bahamas and he was like if you don't want to be over that water with just one engine so I was like are you right so I got the planes with two engines on so if one go out that bitch is still flat I got video of that on there to go to my rich bro page rich broke air I got pictures of that it's showing with the plane flying with one with one engine play long have you been doing this far by the yet they had this plane over by the year by year and a half maybe so right when you started flying you just went ahead and bought a plane yeah right when I worried when I bought a plane that's when I that cuz that's my way of getting into it because I don't know I didn't know how to get into I was like I'm bad and I have bumped my way into it and that's what I did I found somebody how did I find that guy in the Bahamas I think I rented his house out to something me he say I'm a pilot I said really I'm trying to buy a plane won't group and that's the conversation bumped into that but is that there right there with the uh fly bridge broke air now that ain't it that's my old now go to the go to one of the last two posts on there you can see you can see what the propeller another and this old one is the one that one propeller it's the one here one propeller yeah you don't want that right you went to rich broker oh oh yeah go to Instagram I felt I could send it to you it is kind of amazing how few people learn how to fly right yeah there go right there but that's it would be wonderful one of the engines out the shitter so why did he go out yeah it's the dude fuck that what if it won't start back up again well the other ones you can say it now the only problem there is you got a watch like if now that shit don't cut that bitch cut off why you taking off you gonna you gonna crash you know so you you want to watch your way you know that shit make sure the engine is run have you had any Close Encounters nah no close calls I should say close call Close Encounters I think that's like aliens only thing i mighta had was uh no never and then really happened so everything smooth no problems easy landings my first plane soon as as soon as I bought it so the lay that bitch cut off really soon landed my first play but it was a whole other fuck you know old fucking plan honestly you do all this play I'm taking a rather old one to these new cuz the new ones are stale trial and error and they crashing and all that shit there Oh like the 737 yeah it's like those are still using new technology you want some shit that's been there for like 30 years most of these planes you see now they owe they're like 80s and 90s really yeah most of them Gulfstream unless you get the new one but the ones the rapper's written I'm Simone 90s Gulfstream but they still nice and they still good if you keep them up and then most of them ain't keeping them up I keep my playing I look better than most of these these commercial planes when I flew yeah on the commercial of for the sound like the transmission was slipping I do not want to hear irregular noises on a plane bird flies helicopters so I went out with who bill burr oh yeah you know all around Malibu right after the fires you get to see everything that was just devastated as those that's crazy to see that was one thing about here that humbled people up let him know that nature's reals the forest fires the wildfires were out of control here last year we got we got it we got it I think I think we need to be humbled as a country as a whole honestly I don't want to prey on it for us but we need something to Humble us towards more so life than money yeah and I think a natural disaster yeah it was and we have no choice do you remember post 9/11 do you remember what happened it was the way the way the country changed yeah I was I was supposed to be dual carrier yeah that day Wow I'll probably open up for earthquake I was in st. Louis and I got stuck in st. Louis Wow and we had to drive a greyhound back Wow that was the longest ride but that changed the way everybody wants for a little bit but yeah it made you realize nothing else matters that's when you realize what really matters well that's a disaster oddly enough that's when people are happy yes we're happier when they've survived something rough that's what island life living does for you unless you you understand what matters and what don't marry mm-hmm that's what America needs little humbling just humans needed in general and when we get out of control were like spoiled brats a lot of countries got it like I say Islands get it you know I'm saying I mean you're always gonna have corruption and stuff like that there but for the most part they get it more than we do yeah they're in tune yeah you in tune you nothing comes before nature yeah I'm people Hawaiians Hawaiians oh I like that very I mean as a culture we've got to detach from nature in there you know we don't we don't need it we think we don't need it right you know so that's that's where we have fucked up it yeah you need a humble back for a second no I think you're right I think right I just don't want it to have to happen like going through it yeah I honestly don't like I don't really own that type of time I'm like shit I know it's gonna happen either that's why I try to practice now and prepare myself we do live on the island and shit so I can be prepared I don't want culture shocks I won't be culture shock when the shit like the lights go out and even a god shit you know the first five minutes you cool then like 20 minutes later like I I gave me a vibe this motherfucker turn the lights back on the generator yeah like even though now in the shit last time I was the electricity they cut that shit off for like three four hours just cuz it'll be having no reason but honey is good about they say they fix and shit but they don't be fixing right there look there was a big lawsuit about brownouts in California they were doing it on purpose they were just shutting down giant wasn't it part of like a negotiation or something try to figure out what it was what it was criminal no it was a bunch of your stuff let's see I just use it as a way of I this guy with a showing behind let's see what you can do without this mm you know it's kind of my way I I can't use the phone it's stunning how quickly you feel weird yeah all the powers I don't know everybody has no power no one has any power whoa just practice it but you practice it in that goddamn thing what's that thing you can think tank sensory deprivation tank like that's just meditation like you get away from everything like that's why people like camping you know cuz Campins like hey this is what it's like you know this was like if you live outside in your little cloth house man if you go outside and leave your phone for about 30 minutes or hour the grass tile looking green them just like you start really seeing shit you know yeah is this getting maybe it'd be the little shrooms or something but I did just everything's enhanced is when you put that down for a little bit it just takes too much your attention yeah takes all that attention mine too yeah I try to put more into it than I give in then it feeds me yeah you know it's hard it's just sometimes just bored you just wanna find out what's going on in the world yeah but you gotta put your nature back I try to put my I try to put its still humanity back into it you know cuz you could use it for good to put it back out so she we doing it now mm-hm yeah yeah we're doing it now it's just um you could listen to this while you're in nature someone might be on a run right now in nature listen this highest fuck what's up black but that's our amazing transition between no weed and for four years later full-blown all in I was I went the same way in the beginning but for me it's been more it's like 20 years now totally but is the same thing you know I just thought it was for losers oh I can't believe I was missing out on this that's how I feel bathroom oh yeah shrooms is really drugs that's what that's what that's like everything is the synthetic of death yes you realize oh this would be trying to imitate no that's what they're trying to get this what they trying it they're trying to get to this crazy place tree but I don't like em oh no cause it ain't for everybody no like everybody shouldn't do it I use okay that's cool five guys out there that shouldn't do it yeah but I used to think everybody should do it too but then people with schizophrenia to become a real issue yeah if you thought if you're not at peace money yeah and you got to really be understand when you see thing cuz sometimes you don't come back you know say some people don't come back yeah just give me the box but yeah it's some people don't come back and you know famously yeah acid acid does what's wrong fuck with acid I mean I can't I don't fuck with nothing that people die from you know Alan fuck with nothing that that I can't see came from nature yeah it's good move that's only we this room that's that's as much is that that's a good call for everybody just other general rule you know don't fuck with anything that doesn't just come out of the ground that's natural especially when something like weed or mushrooms and has thousands of years of use and a shrooms it like you're right like we you realize like there's something for everything any like any other drug you yeah you got they got a strain or something that'll get you that same stimulus same thing with shrooms is just like hey that's the only time I feel like I eat bad when you're on truth that's not no that's just like as it is amazing isn't even hard to explain because this is like this is fuckin it's pretty amazing well it's amazing is that it's been around for so long and it's still illegal so guys like you have these crazy experiences it's illegal in in Colorado now right I think Colorado did something to decriminalize it but Oakland famously recently decriminalized everything ayahuasca mushroom what is a lesson ayahuasca is the edible form of DMT it's a drink that they take and like to Amazon indigenous people who invented I think somebody just told me about that it's real simple it's not similar to mushrooms in that it's you know it's obviously different thing but it can be insanely potent from what they say I've done the synthetic form of it which is DMT and I haven't done the ayahuasca which is the edible form of it the edible form of it is like well those would be like more mild but lasts longer I haven't had a chance when you do it let me know you know what you know let me know whether the everybody loves it I don't know okay we may maybe maybe like one person ever but there's also someone who died recently from I'm still on my I'm still on certain level I'm still probably at level 2 or 3 with shrooms like I went all the way ed wits level tore through how many grams you taking the most I've taken and this is about mistake like 4 grams because I missed and put the scale on mmm that's a good solid dose and yeah that was too much that she had me so emotional like I've never been there I've never left and I'm a comedian I've never laughed so hard was that day like that I was laughing I was crying I was just and it wouldn't stop my kisses wouldn't it just wouldn't stop it just laughing farting like I just couldn't control no type of it's like all my shit was just like and it felt amazing like it was just like amazing I think that but after that I couldn't do I was like I can't cuz I couldn't shake it just wouldn't go away it lasts about seven eight hours and that's another thing about soon they do let alone a long time yeah ayahuasca is shorter than that apparently I think it's I like it for a long time I I like it I don't but I only do it like once a month cuz I can't go through that emotional rollercoaster so so much yes it's fun but it's like I was like a ride it's like hi I don't want doing her mother but but I didn't do it like once a month maybe two grams and I fucked only one time like and that was good but I didn't do that much like I could fuck only one it's just a little bit but when it's a lot I can't ain't even thinking about fucking I feel like I'm fucking it feel like fucking that's what it feels like hey I'm just thinking about it now I'm going through my mind I'm sorry no no worries you know there's a lot of people to think that's the origins of religion it is I think I think the origins are dead and zodiac I think zodiacs is really real religious I think we really are science and some kind of way of stars and all this shit connect like real astrology yeah I think it all connects I wish I knew enough about real astrology to make fun of it but every time I start talking shit about astrology I'm like I don't really know that much I don't know shit about me them learning as I go I'm looking and I'm paying attention I'm just going by observation right see scientist to tell you it's nonsense but are they sure like there's so many weird factors that they're taking into account the moon is in this and the Mars is in retrograde and Venus's oh there's all that shit they're taken into account it's not even real what they're saying I'm a like a like I was saying earlier I believe we are more of our nature than we are what we think we are so I think if we're connected all together how to articulate good I've been I've been working on there that's why we're back and watch Ella cell again because it's kind of like that but it's like like like say France is a dog before it shit the turns around like that just natural right like we do certain things naturally that we don't even know we do but if you understand the connection so that you can kind of use it to your favor and change to change everything so Brett I just can't figure that yeah I ain't figured out how to use it there's my superpower yet like I'm trying to figure out how to use it in you know people could take numbers and they say numbers do shit in the world certain things I think this there is that in nature you know you just gotta figure out like which time it's kind of like even the social media I kind of do it just let nature take its course and do certain things in life and nothing's even social medias in life I kind of let nature take its course I plant the seed and and let it grow you know and it kind of does what it do so in the same sense in life and I don't know I got to figure it out a little more I got to do more research with my words I know you're saying but I I think I got it I think women are more powerful with it than we are they're more intuition towards it or yeah they just don't know that like if they knew how to control that shit they'd be like gene on ax men hmm you give them say yeah I do you know you you ever heard of the e ching you know teaching is oh eaching is an ancient Chinese Chinese method of divination and I think you like would ask it questions and throw these stones and there's all I think there are hexagons I think that's what they are and they have different marks on them and they read these marks and it's supposed to predict things mm-hmm and it's they've had they've it's been around for thousands of years it's really complicated it's it's it's a bunch of different side you have what is what it is it's the chart step yeah this is very visual so cool listening it's gonna be tough but pull up one of those charts this is well when you throw the three coins you get a number yeah that number then correlates to this chart and then you get this symbol and I'm gonna magining then you take that symbol and then it equals one of these thing wind heaven Lake fire thunder earth mountain water and then I don't know how there's a lot I think like charter law very big like safe is if I knew the charts think I could know when to be at a certain place at a certain time to get a certain type of energy that I want yeah something like that you know I'm saying like it's I I can't I can't explain it but it's I'm still trying to learn well there was a guy named Terence Mckenna and he was just very famous psychedelic philosopher dude and he studied the eaching for a long time and he had some really wacky ideas but one of them was he thought that each Inge was a map of time and that's what it was created for and there were were just we don't really totally understand it yet and that with this method of divination the reason why it's so effective is somehow or another through these things and viewing these things you're actually having some sort of an impact yeah it sounds like total nonsense like hippie bullshit I don't because he's good crystals shit I just lost my train of thought it's like when you we don't you know how when like 20 years ago the stuff that you know now I was still the same shit but you didn't have a clue about it like right I'm trying to think how to explain it in layman's term like like back in the day like we used to wear baggy clothes you know hip-hop we bag it in the mother fire now that I look back I was like this shit looks stupid than the mother but I was blind back then but I really would because I had on what I had on yeah but I was blind and the motherfucker it happens with people how about cell phones but I'm saying in this in yeah even in bear bothers now you look back like what the fuck that I have but in your mind so what I'm saying is in our minds we really are really blind it might be something right here we just not paying attention to it because our minds ain't got there yet right you gave them saying different way so and I said that the sake because when you said we just ain't figured out the methods that you say the way we ain't figured it out yet it's there right in front of us we just got it we got to stop overthinking it's really simple everything is simple we just overtake it think about the car car had all them different components to it and I was just a laptop now simple and we could have skipped all that if we would have just had our minds right where's Aetna go from the Model T to the Tesla and go to just well just be me up right beam me up you know the shit sounds so far-fetched but now is like that shit probably good that I think it's gonna happen but I think it might not be really happening when it happens I think we might get locked into some sort of digital realm that's what I think I think we are in the digital wind that's where all this shit coming here we've all becoming digital so we can go somewhere else it's closing in on us like you said your brain is now the cloud like we're just a piece of nature like we think we're just evolution of the next thing yeah humans like we're not even supposed to be humans all right I'm going to fuck we're going to no we go away there was a guy named Marshall McLuhan and he said human beings are the sex organs of the machine world that's it that's it that's it he just worried that yeah yeah it's like we really think we in porn but we really just a step in between another step mm-hmm yeah we're the what was Elon Musk cause he calls us the organic bootloader for our artificial intelligence well he thinks is that we are here to sort of give birth to artificial intelligence so it's gonna take over from there and it'll be the new life form my one if that's on the way and like the gods are looking down on us like these dummies are worried about global warming they people left us somebody from another planet watching us is a shell right go look at them the over there doing this year again dude hide that sky in here yesterday are they looking at this world like oh they finally figured out how to get to the Mars think about that I got this book from this dude the the author SC Quinn was in here yesterday its empire of the summer moon and it's all about the Comanches and the United States fight against the Comanche and how long it went down and then at the end of it by the end they had defeated the Plains tribes you just get this horrible feeling of how all these people got wiped out their way of life they had for who knows a thousand two thousand years is now gone completely like that could be us and that could be us by our own doing I mean that's a sensation but I'm doing in in all Egypt yeah everything oh that shit be done yeah so I mean this happened then what's the story in the Bible I don't forgot the story which one the one with a weight they Sodom Gomorrah when they cleared the whole play cuz they saw there was like Babylon it was fucked up oh yeah I know what you're talking about Sodom and Gomorrah right right right they she was so fucked up over there that their guy just washed the whole place up yeah what was the place shit where's what happened with my Christian sodomy or the two cities oh that's what they were walking away and he said don't look back and want somebody look back and he replace it yeah that's the story that's that's what the story is I'm not saying as facts I mean but it's something probably like that happen and that's because they were all naughty that's what Salaria very not that's what Solaris it's not a buttfucking and shit that's just hilarious what kind of a weird God it's the problem when I don't thank God I think it's it's more just as a whole just hi everything evolves into you know you put something in see where it rolls mm-hmm this is what I shit wrote too late what the fuck that's what came out of that shit right mm-hmm that's what that's what that's why I said you really can't predict because that shit can roll into anything right now it certainly can you know I'm saying like especially this moment like that the shift we are as far as in the big picture we had a shuffle like a in the century of 1900 we we had a shelf on that I think we're one or two big inventions away from being unrecognizable one or two big ones one or two big ones and maybe 10 20 years and things could be unrecognizable to to the robots to I think they're if all we have to do is get to a point where there really is an artificial intelligence and it can make choices and they can think for itself I don't know how long that takes maybe it takes 30 years I think they don't I think that's here then I don't know if it is but autonomous artificial intelligence that can move around like something that's built like a person or a dog and can move around and run the world I went to this Expo in Japan and that's awesome damn near like it yeah they're close they're getting close I think they're there though I think for real artificial intelligence I think they need more more time but all that shit is happening so quick like they're developing quantum computers Google now as quantum computers that's just like man this shit been going on like I didn't realize till I started flying airplanes like all that navigation shit was there 50 years ago Hey but navigation satellites yeah the satellites all the stuff we get known on GPS now like GPS there's on iPhone they invented shit out I don't know when was it due don't know I had GPS on my phone in the 90s oh yeah but I'm seeing a man on my car even afford your car that's one for your car they was in Lane 73 yes started by the US Department of Defense in 1970 1973 the first prototype spacecraft launched in 1978 the full constellation of 24 satellites operational in 93 I think they have FaceTime on the moon like it's it had to be so that means it's been going on so this technology been going on so just imagine what they got now yeah there's probably some shit we don't know about yeah they got people morphing into animals around this bitch you think so you never know you never know stay whoa stay was amazing this is dope did you hear the shit that they announced that China had created human Pig hybrids or monkey monkey Pig hybrids they make hype residing anything knows what they're gonna do man who knows people just doing anything putting a shit in the pipe and just they doing that with humans now when green eyes I won't tell one day they're gonna have an artificial body there's gonna be a company that's gonna have an artificial body that works perfectly and they can guarantee that you can take your brain out artificial body and put it in this put it in this new perfect body take it out of yours put it like a surrogate and they guarantee you you'll live longer you get an extra hundred and fifty years with Jewish your body I'm a moron I would definitely do it would you want to live forever no not forever but nobody never know when to end that's the thing there's like a parable about that about some guy who lives the hundreds of years but he has to kill his kids in order to do it I think Trueblood was kind of like that to that movie when the motherfucker was them vampires he got tired of living like I did she born well I was in did you imagine seeing people complain about the same things for hundreds and hundreds of years you gotta kill in they go against fighting funny right the entire to this shit then they go again but did you go through the same shit every twenty years yeah you probably get tired of killing them two people that's 90 years old tired of hearing this shit pee with a view though you just oh yeah you just laugh at the young people going through they shit hey hey there you go did you ever see interview with a vampire oh remember it it's like Tom Cruise Brad Pitt movie here but I was like should i watch it the game it's a great fucking movie but the whole idea is it the part of it is this these vampires been around for hundreds of years and they they're starting to get sick of it mm-hmm they're kind of freaked out yeah that's not true blue or the tablet yeah makes sense my grandma man she lied really yeah my grandma from Bahamas she she be like like she be depressing like she cuz you got think about it when you get old you only one around you're gonna go talk to go mad give a fuck your kids over come over there to take takes photo-ops either I give a damn about that you know so like history stories she she she passed out in the garage and stayed there cuz she thought she was dead and then she realized she wasn't got up and walk away right back in the house but you don't want to be here you that's why you want something you would even if you don't believe in God you won't something after this like well you gotta be some after this shit you I wanted to be you would want to think something after this because this is this this is boring at the end it's don't want in good it doesn't end good see some people think that for sure nothing happens and that to me is just as dumb as thinking for sure something happens you know either way I'd rather be I rather be right than wrong she she rather believe you I know you ain't believe as I told you I believe when you see a dead person it seems like something's gone I swear to God when my bit when one of my best friend a comedian that they passed that I rest when I was like oh no this is gotta be a god or something cuz I saw it like this you feel they're gone that you know when I was in the room with him right on his deathbed I saw it like you could just see and you can see that they see it cuz he really like at the time he wanted me he asked me to play smile bitch for him and I played it for him and after that he tried to pull the pin out his mouth and the fun thing about I didn't think it was like nose is it I didn't see it as no suicide thing it was just like you could see that he saw I next level I mean next step mmm you get what I'm saying and so that I didn't let them do in the figures I didn't want to see as I know them pulled them down and told his sister to come in but it's just you really see it being when you're in there and you see life and see it where it ends and and you know it's not a bad thing you just see like this is this is what it is yeah this is one else yeah it comes and goes comes and goes I mean is some some mix I hope you know what someone said once and one of the one of the gracie father's talked about this to said he believed and he lived his life Elio Gracie lived his life like you have to get everything perfect you have to do everything the right way or you come back and you do it all over again yeah that's how karma there are people in Indonesia think and there's no crime over there when I was at in Bali well it's a great way to think if it's right way to think and if it's right I mean maybe that's think about even if even if it ain't right you should think that way because if you thought that way if you thought you come back looking like an aunt you ain't gonna be doing too much crazy shit you gonna do right you will do right by people yeah the best way you can well that always makes me think like someone like you like how many times you done this ride you don't I mean like maybe some people just may be the dumbest us or just they're just new on the ride that's what you know what times that's the best way to articulate it cuz it's like to me my whole life it like this shit is so simple but to everybody else is so complicated like maybe you've been on the ride a lot have you been on this ride like a thousand times that's crazy if it's real and look how many times you think you've been on this bitch anyone think but life makes none of it makes any sense it doesn't make any sense it you and I are making noises with our mouths and we both know what we're saying and we're laugh and we just met having a great time smoking weed together talk shit that doesn't make sense either like life is bizarre so if life this way this this way that we live which is really interesting if this goes on forever like I enjoy life and I know you do right enjoy it it's great but if you told me that was gonna go on forever I'd go fuck like this just goes on forever and ever that's a view that's gonna give me anxiety so it's not so say nothing then just let the spirit but if it happens again and again and again again and again and again throughout eternity if that's what life is if you just live this life over and over again why would that be scary but it would it'd be scary because if maybe I enjoy this life but I want to think that there's something better but if it's just this life over and over and over again I get it right why is that scarier than doing it once because it's not scary to do it once like right once like right now I'm having a great time you're having a great time Jamie's having a great time we're having fun right why wouldn't want to keep doing this but if I knew that it was gonna happen over and over and over again forever I'd probably freak the fuck out but that might be what life is yeah that's definitely what life is it could be it's just as weird as life itself it's not weirdest it's great when you look at it as beauty ya know it's just like I look at it like this like certain things I'd never asked for I thought that would happen but it happens in certain like I like my certain spirits is just gonna come to us that's what I think we're more spirit than we are anything else cuz where I'm from away from we would've never met we would another thing but even we just come in here we can vive and and just you can feel I could feel this you can feel it like that this shit's supposed to be here at this time at this moment it's just all the part of the moment yeah you get what I'm saying I do get we're saying it's like there's a process going on and all the ups and downs yeah right just talking but it's a process in the spirit that's using us at this moment to get whatever they're getting out of it and then go somewhere else yeah yeah you know what you're saying I've thought about this before too because I've thought that ideas imaginative ideas were a life form I mean an idea just comes in your hair like say if you have an invention that's what the internet could in a lot of ways right and I think in an idea in general it might be a type of life form like what are these ideas these have I think this is sativa I don't know what that is give a shot but that life is like you know what was I just saying I swear I had a point ah shit I didn't mean though you all for I was trying to be a good host dirt is no good man I was just absolutely forgot what I was saying fuck What did he say he's rewinding - apparently back in this book that game is just vibe with it but you know I just kept anyway I do feel like it's bigger than us even there - like it ain't even about this is about wherever this spear for they take to something else no whatever that is well one of things that I think is great about being articulate cool conversations like this that we could get and put on the internet it's a fun conversation and it makes people want to have more cool fun conversations it makes people better at it you know I think this that talking is in a lot of ways like an art form people can talk and it's annoying but it's they're expressing it's their self-expression even if it's just regular communication whereas some people can talk they can tell you anything and their voice is so cool you want to hear and talk about everything you tell me lots of mother shit but I don't think I talk that good when it comes to shit then I'm good at this conversation talk maybe but the conversation talks what everybody wants your authentic yeah that's what people want people want to hear a guy talk like you that's just talk in the way you talk rather than someone who's talking like a newscaster or a morning radio but I think people need more to see how people move by actions yeah you need to see is I could talk that's like a preacher could preacher could talk talk you out all your money if he if he know how to talk right that only he's a good motherfucker that's true sounds true I rather person judge me off my actions more than my words because my words might offend you you might get pissed off but I complete - and never have enough you can't in none of my accent gonna show a flaw in it and if there is I can accept my flaws I mean I can say yeah you're right I'm yeah yeah I did that you know I'm saying but for the most part genuinely I'm always moving in the way to where I'm not trying I'm just moving in the way of a good way in the space of a more benefiting you than me that's beautiful I believe you too I can tell you I can tell you all you are on like that kind of a path but the thing that I was getting at in a way is that both those things are important the way you talk is very important too because you way you talk like it affects young people in particular look it's cool I'm listening to you philosophize on things and just relaxed approach I can't if I can't control what the fuck am I worrying about it and that that is a message that a lot of kids could use as you know you know somebody just said on my Instagram today they say and I'm like the Robin Hood of knowledge for the hood like and I was like Pam I like that that's because they do feel like that I feel like I am able to articulate it for people like me yes to get it yeah get what I'm saying a hundred percent yeah but in also you don't have there's nothing about you while you're trying to talk where is Robin true knowledge Robin Hood knowledge there's nothing there's nothing about the way you talk that's contrived and that's what's lacking what people are lacking is people it bothers people when you're talking to someone and they're doing like the Morning News guy please you don't even know who the fuck that guy yes yeah you have no idea with them that's a style of talk that they make them do if they want to tell the news in the morning but you don't have a goddamn clues to who that guy is when you talk about something you have zero of that you have zero of that fake thing that you're trying to project out there to fake things weird things gentleman very good to see you this evening we're having a wonderful time here at the show and you see darkness behind that guy's eyes he's talking like you know what you know it evidently I think they come from where I had no choice but to be myself I kind of molded myself I never was raised with rules so now trying to be fake it's harder for me to be fate than it is for me to be real like I can't I'd be trying to put on the face don't work like I'd be really wanting to be fake because they said I could work for other people but I can't like I'd be trying to so it's like easier for me to be to be just genuine and it's because I'm not good at lying like that yeah it's definitely easier to be genuine but Solaris that you tried to be fake how would you ever try to be fake cuz they'd be working from this man like shit what did you do what did you do where you tried like just trying to go in the room and do the industry talk shit and act like I care like I don't fuck like this just get boring and shit so thank God thank you I never I never gave a fuck about I never gave a fuck about always I won't be famous just to be with the people I never gave a fuck about the industry part of it like that I may because I've been doing a long time now in my world maybe that's what it is so I don't intrigue me as much you know it's like fucking a bitch a thousand times maybe that's what it is but oh no don't do nothing for me like that what does it do what the the entertainment part of it gets me to where I can get to the people that's what I use it for like I love the people for real and then and the front of everybody is like I recently found out Harriet Tubman is my I like blur not for real like so it kind of makes me like so that's why I figure like that like I do like helping the people you do like helping she's you're great on yeah my granny said my name's on the statue oh I got that to see my brain is my brain your brains are statue no I'm say I got my brain no man I'm saying I got the statue in here in my brain my brain is an actor your name's on the statue oh yeah yeah the brains on our club yeah my name is on the Harriet Tubman stage have you always been like that I did did that change at all when you started smoking weed no I was always loved people I've always that's what my name come from just representing Jacksonville Duval I've always did that so whenever I can't wrap it it's in my name so it kind of like psychologically for a person that's my from there it makes them see something because you are what you see so that's what I always used that name really yeah to elevate the people from where you came from yeah that's beautiful that's a beautiful name for a name that might be one of the best names Duvall yeah because the the sentiment behind it that's one of the best names I've ever heard I love that I love that you doing that but I love the thought behind it that was the hotel from day one I mean I've always knew I was like even where I grew up it always knew like I supposed to be here in this shit like then I was like maybe God put me here to see this shit for that reason to get out and tell everybody that you can get out too not just to be example you know cuz I mean I think the world is gonna evolve out it's gonna evolve but I don't want the people from around front to get left behind to so it's just like I let me show y'all with what's going on so you can get a chance to be in the same situation hmm just to see the world a little more you know so that's all that's why behold let me find this so that's a great name and the great reason for a name man yeah but Harriet Tubman so just the Harriet Tubman thing just made me realize like him that's why maybe I'm like this it just all goes back to the nature thing we were saying like it's it's in us over time you started realizing that might really be where it does come from I mean who knows an ally traits like that to come from besides learning from the people and my grandfather that's not even like my blood grandfather I grew up with three grand daddies and I didn't realize that was norm till I got older but he was always in the community in Jacksonville so I think I get like that from watching him growing up it's wrong way out yeah if he's a mentor figure and you saw the benefit that he got out of it I don't even know if I saw the benefit I just think it's just come second nature you are what you become I mean you are what you see in this that's just the way I moved from around older people like I've always been around older people and then think older people who people that was raised by older people they end up being alright because older people teach you the right values in life hmm my first friends was old people old my these that bridge parties and shit here go ahead search God shit you know that shit in the brain it's got to remember like oh let me think about that thing seriously what data planet you want still wait on that line don't think I'm lying shit I'll get what he got here oh that's the room that's what it was the wrong one no fuck I had just posted on but that's the the monument in Bristol Pennsylvania some shit like that and Bristol and is it just her living surviving relatives on the monument yeah yeah all the names of all the names of the people that Wow they're good money I found that's all my mama my sister my MA my nephew all that's on there that's some dope shit you know so I could talk shit about that to be like maybe you ain't got no by a grandma great-grandma Harriet Tubman though I wonder how much of that actually gets in your genes I'm thinking all that dude it's just like an athlete and like athletes the next athlete be better and better than your other yeah like this natural genetics this is naturally any experience this is like just natural experience we probably met full spirits ago probably yeah yeah like maybe we're out like if we are both living the same life over and over and over again we're probably done this couple times yeah maybe sir for sure heavy doe necks like that there's people that you run into in your life where you do feel like they're supposed to be in your life like there's people that you run into like this person is B I'm them we're family you know that and you you look keep that forever I got friends long-term friends for 25 almost 30 years that our family they might as well be me you know you get to that point with with certain people were you like you know I know them and you love it you love them so well is how does it feel like over 50 like is that it you think that's because all with 50 it makes you feel like I gotta be friends we keep the friends that get close by no no I don't that's one thing I don't worry about I know I'm 52 are you worried about being alone no not right now maybe one day I would be but right now what I'm worried about more than anything is just keeping my health you know just make sure our exercise and eat correctly and take a lot of supplements and make sure I keep my health to live 2 more years but not even that just maintain quality of life see that you get hit by a car tomorrow and be in the best shape of your life you look like Ronnie Coleman when you want mr. Olympia still get hit by a car and died you don't think the Hat you think it's a I think happy people live the longest I think they live longer I think how long is longest I mean even if you even if you're pushing 114 well 112 114 you're not gonna fucking care though at the end is near yeah but I mean like just most of the people I see that's older that's genuinely happy and moving and and healthy-looking you're happy like that there looks to be that the moving was that they they be happy yeah like the ones there's a baby like that you know there's a lady that goes to this yoga class it's like cancer yes yeah if will specifically exercise you can see people that are in their 70s they're still fit there's still exercise you're still working out and they don't have a problem when they can't move around then get too old your body starts to fall apart one of the biggest problems is you can't get around let me ask you this and this might be weird or stupid turtles live like a hundred years a lot more than us well however long yeah they don't do that much moving it's true if we didn't do that much movement we could live longer I don't think that's how it works but I do think it has an impact a slight impact I mean cuz it's like we're using it's like a car engine you keep running at all it it's going no matter how much is helping it's gonna hurt it more than its helping there's a statistic about professional athletes not living to over a hundred and how many professional athletes die before they reach 100 versus regular people well I saw people only alone right too much distance like if I know how short people live long as I'm good like that's my trip y'all gotta worry about y'all Hill that's true it's really tall people what is the average age what's the oldest a professional athlete has lived bored of the line they have been around for a hundred years right when was a professional a sport started Russell that's a good point Russell's got to be the oldest and he taught Oh motherfuck he told his mother I've ever seen live he looks perfect in the green looks fine him agree called is great he's old man he was in a Bruce Lee movie remember yeah there he was three foot pop was that Game of Death 98 97 97 96 couple girls that were playing football football player whoa but but you know what when they put football in 20s then I was little bullshit helmets you couldn't just clash into each other like today see yeah but see were you little you don't have to worry about all that Oh what we're gonna live don't live all we gotta do is just be happy yeah think about all the all the old people short that's true there's a lot of short old people although not a lot of giant old dudes no ain't two-minute big old motherfuckers it's me a fat old motherfucker no that's uh he came he might have been one of the last ones he lived a long old fat life yeah a lot of them time really young like Ralphie may rest in peace Ralphie Ralphie was in his forties right John Candy I think he was in his 40s - he's a big guy yeah I don't even get into it like when people died at age cuz we all I mean I know they say too soon I don't really know if it's a too soon or too late because at the end of the day it's still all like 100 years in mix of one of a hundred years it's just do what you can right here yeah do what you can while you're here don't sweat it don't don't try to change things you can't change and that's the big one the big one you can't change is your own fragility well you get that from the game of thrones some shit the clock yeah no that's from Russell built the dude on Instagram who makes dope custom metal clocks he does everything himself you Wells did together I got a started getting started on some dope shit dope shit from I don't be accepting stuff like that cuz PB won't stuff back and that's problem people won't stop back to me for me and if I choose the poster that might but don't shit I mean mister I don't say messed up but a lot of money I turn it down just as I don't do that type of shit like that I don't do it either but I've had people send me things and then send me a script could you please write like they wrote it for me holy shit this cool exclamation but like literally later they write it out for you I'm like what are you talking about and make it bad they don't care they're just trying to get your something from you to help their business than I hate they're like I'm especially me i dude shit really from the heart and I do it because I want to do it I don't expect nothing in return so when people don't have that same type of mindset I don't want to help exact like you can get it how you want to get it but I just don't feel it because you're not good for the ecosystem yeah that's true if you're around people that have that negative mentality it's a drain it's not an asset it's a drain it will fuck it up you gotta keep genuine people right now you try to just keep that spirit they keep it going that way like I try to put that is still in an injury to like injuries and I fuck with injury jokes man yeah good guy anyone funniest motherfuckers I put there's two people that put up that I think the funniest people him and Jase key them two motherfuckers and I ain't just saying cuz they're my friends they are my friends and I might be biased but I still put them up against anybody I don't know J ski but I love Andrew he's awesome I love how he markets himself to is relentless like you didn't need Netflix didn't need anything else he's done it all and he doesn't like like a business he's a stand-up standing you know and that's one of the artists is kind of dying you know I'm saying but he's like a stand up stand up and he keeps it I envy him he doing cuz I I'm going to entertaining and and doing stand-up and doing everything else but just straight course stand-up I like that shit and it takes it there sometimes I have to reel him back though because he will go too far you know he's like on that board Atlanta crazy and genius like he got his right nigga well he's taking risks you know if you want to make some good comedy you gotta take some risks yeah but just it's interesting for me to see people with like him to have a great work ethic like he's a he's a brilliant guy in terms of like how he's putting things out there and editing things and strategizing and doing these the game he steadies he sees and he takes his thing and that's good for young guys once he once he understood like just you don't need Hollywood no more like no you know cuz a lot of especially in our generation they're stuck in the mindset of thinking that is Hollywood but it don't really exist in this day and age like that not as much as impact on the coachee like it used to that it it has an impact but it's not the only impress yeah exactly alright yeah that's what I mean it's not the end-all so you can create your own shit on a piss internet made of the even playing field like you can do your own thing so you don't really have to just use that route and once he understood that he took it and ran with it yeah it's not even an even playing field it actually tips the other way because you need to use the internet no matter who you are exactly you need an easier if you hey they got to come to you yeah if they're your motion picture company trying to promote a movie you got to use the internet and they got to come to you that now you're the you're the book Network and they got to come to you for the brands and the ads and shit like that good your Hollywood I'm Hollywood you're really the new Johnny Carson rounders motherfucker you know shit being on this shit from way people way people been saying shit like even like man you gotta get on that show you gotta get honestly I I just respect you as a comic like I've think I didn't see it as I don't see people as like the same partner but I just see it as he doing his thing he got his lane he went in I don't be seeing the big big picture and the way people seen and I'm like this motherfucker got a got a goddamn coke following around this motherfucker like this man you gotta go get on there you just gotta get on the show and I was like hi McGill in shelters like me y'all damn they're the same person y'all gotta meet y'all gather me I'm like am I gonna know shit about me about me fuck about me I do though hey man so it's just don't matter he's dope is dope to have you here man it's been fun hello we've been talking two hours now for real yeah it's like two o'clock oh okay that's cool like that joint man no problem I'm still in some of this shit it's still free no you know nigga still free shit I give you whatever you need man we get a drop-off from speed weed do you ever use speed weed in LA so we delivery service for my friend Gino uh-uh outstanding stars he's delivered me some shit well ordinarily we keep a a chest we have a war chest he gives us this giant wooden box filled with we but we kind of drained it filling it up so as to come back mmm should've had him come back before you were here a tragic miss miss sight I don't know Otto lately you studied like Buddhism and Hindu it a little bit of it I've read a little bit of it I've never practiced it I try to practice it in my way of living as a scene like thee I think all that shit come from that like the start of his Hinduism I think but it's just like the piece of it yeah it's just I think that's where y'all start just nature and do you can just live free but everybody can live free cuz some motherfuckers crazy the Hindus stuff the ancient Hindu stuff is fascinating because they they always talked about this shit called soma and no one knows exactly what it was what was I mean it's a it seems like it was some sort of a psychedelic I don't think they've ever figured out what it is they think it might have been like mushrooms mixed with something else and they called it soma they might have created some sort of a concoction they would do it in trip balls it figured things out so it's probably real similar to what's happening when people are tripping today when you were saying that you took four grams it's probably real similar that feeling is probably real similar throughout history people have figured out different ways to get it yeah when I was on that shit I've seen the hundred dollar bill the hologram when that bitch was up Hey you could like you know the little hologram and the shit comes up off the dollar hundred dollar beer when you're on mushrooms it does I did well then motherfucker came up late night if that's how the cops find out if you're on mushrooms that's why I was like whoever made the hundred dollar bill they was on shrooms must pass it like that shit what's your so I shouldn't tell you this right I only like I can't think of that bad bout it like I just only bad news maybe I wouldn't do it in front of people like that yeah loose they did some studies on mushrooms and they found that it actually increases people's vision in low doses it makes your vision more accurate like if they have parallel lines I forget what the study who who did the study but the study was if you have these two parallel lines and one of them shifts ever so slightly off line you'd be able to detect it quicker when you're in psilocybin than when you're not so there's two statistically proven with randomly selected people who are either on or not on and they ran this series of tests and they found that the people were more effective at detecting whether or not the angle has changed so you can see better you have better a better view of reality when you're on mushrooms unless I tell them a homeboy act like I'm small you know must really make you see if happen yeah they think it might have been one of the things that led to us evolving shrooms yeah they're a the sea oh yeah you don't watch that show that's a good show which I'll see now what is that that's what the guy from Aquaman oh oh oh that's right what does that call the Apple show yeah yeah cause see it's good show now that's a real good show and it's about them being blind him that makes sense so it's like naturally created vision but that an improved vision and it was one of several things they think led to a valve and quicker one of them was that we started experimenting with different food sources but more access to like bugs and you know rats and all these little things that we could catch we started hunting things then we started using tools to figure out how to hunt things and all during this process we're eating weed and we're eating mushrooms so we're probably interacting with the psychedelic compounds that people have used for thousands and thousands of years when we were primitive man and so as we're taking these things we're trying to figure out new ways to hunt new ways to protect ourselves from our enemies new ways to farm we start inventing things and start inventing language to think there's a direct connection between psilocybin use and the ability to create words and and language so really we all want we all just nature yeah we just keep evolving and evolving we're nature that lives in houses yeah that's what we are that's crazy right now that I'm thinking like so the shrooms so really everything came from this room and this room kind of trim used us yeah this room used as in growing in interesti the shroom used us to manifest reality the the shroom used us to create life it's not just a shroom it's the ideas too like I think all these ideas that you get we were talking about this earlier like what is an idea if you have an idea like hey I'm gonna invent this thing this thing's gonna benefit mankind you just have some crazy idea that's supposed to fix things maybe it sucks pollution out of the air and then someone takes that and runs with it and improve something else then someone takes that and improves something that you're doing this among on giant scales millions and millions and millions of people are doing this and they're contributing to this and they're all using ideas they have ideas then they turn that idea into a physical form and then every year they expect it to get better and better and better every year they innovate nobody ever looks at a television he goes 72 inches it looks clear let's just stop no more TVs it's blue this guy they give always gotta get bigger always but why is that the reward is improvement like it's constantly gearing towards improvements like that it's bore them bore them well that makes us do more and these are ideas right ideas that we turn into things and along the way there's a bunch of shit that fuels our desire to get those things and make these things happen like lust like materialism like maybe what materialism or people worry about it being so empty maybe what it is it's a function of getting us to invest heavily in newer better shit so that more things accelerate faster and faster and that these new inventions come in a faster and faster rate because that's what we're constantly focused on his newer better shit so they're constantly inventing and improving and all the while we're just dumping money into the birth of our successor yeah the technology so we're just a movement we evolved from the shrooms to the human to the ideas to the culture to the different cultures interacting with each other the resistance of these cultures interacting with each other so whether we just organism we're an organism yeah a fucking awesome one though as much of a fuck what they talking about ain't nobody getting shot anybody doing all that type of shit that shit was boring to me nobody sent a video through the air FaceTime in Viking porn you know nobody's flying helicopters yeah ain't flat submarines pianets submarines man you've never seen no goddamn ain't never seen no lying 120 feet yeah I done that fuck submarines man if you were high on a submarine I always wondered like they got to be the dumbest job to ever won't play do you know you're like have you ever been have you ever school with that like I just told us Norco that's the most I've ever done like I was saying like scuba diving like by the time you get past 100 feet it's just dark it's nothing down there that's worse than being in jail and solitary confinement and how long do they be down there there's people that be in them some hope for a long time they got to be crazy there's no way you can't tell me like that solitary confinement by these cells yeah that's just like in that movie I was saying on I mean that show it far mankind they was up there going crazy yeah they was going crazy because they because they had to wait for something to be fixed for them to sit up there so every two weeks they had to wait and he was watching the same show over and over over and over they had the practice net shit and they went crazy I couldn't imagine what coverage 30 days up to a hundred underwater yeah oh my god thirty days bro 30 days underwater how bad is that toilet smell by the way we should talk to some some seamen how much do they get paid to do that how much do they pay you to do this not enough there's no way they would get paid enough 30 days underwater it could be all the money in the world dish if they were getting paid correctly there'd be no money left for anybody else 30 days underwater in a submarine why that's the craziest reality show ever shit I just put that out in the universe someone's gonna do it they're gonna be it's called Project Nemo the Big Brother project Nemo just film people under water for 30 days no see this shit that could be a great reality show look whoever whoever is listening that's thinking about doing it just go ahead and do it make it you have that do it have that will do it for the culture that's that's for you do it for the codes whoo that would be a popular show a fucking submarine filled with people for 30 days I don't even want to get on a cruise ship man do you fuck with cruise ships no I've never been on a cruise ship never want to well I'm not that yeah I don't like being in the place I like in my own place like the island that I'm on this not nobody there but I like being there but I don't want to be in the middle of the ocean yeah and I can't go where I want to go like that's right you're not gonna do me like well yeah it's also like and I know how powerful that ocean is so I'm gonna play with that fuck yeah most powerful thing on earth it's also like the thing that's beautiful about you and your plane as you go over the fuck you want you get up and fly and you kind of you're free you get to experience it the same thing boat No why not I don't know I'm thinking about right now but it's the same thing in a boat like when you're in a boat right you're out there on the ocean you go left you go right you can go wherever the fuck you want that's something beautiful about a boat is that you're gliding across the top of this water and you're kind of in control of your destiny you can kind of decide where you want to go you could be casual you can enjoy the it's just drive along the coastline just fucking Cruise Line are you ain't doing nothing doing none of that you gotta go with a wants you to go and you're on there with a bunch of other people and everyone's drunk yeah no I don't if I wanna be bothered with somebody I don't want this sit in my room cooped up and every now and then people throw people overboard yeah I don't like tourist spots like that right this is surprising how rarely it happens if people throw people overboard so it's probably lately husband and wife back in the day they probably used to but they probably got it to where you can't throw people off they probably okay I mean like most of the places for people off good luck in Vegas you can't throw they can't jump off no fucking building them oh really they won't got balconies on the mum on the mum casinos not in the regular hotel rooms because too many people were jumping to people to me the people's job is 300 people since nearly 300 people since 2000 gone overboard on cruise ships and ferries holy said that too but holy shit how many people might have recovered this wasn't just as according to a professor in Canada so I don't know if that's just Canada do they ever recover them have you ever heard of one getting recovered don't they just keep going usually because they can't stop oh my god they can't stop is that true bro I've just heard that you got to be careful because they're not gonna stop for you I've never been on once I don't know there's hard that's why I don't care about cuz I'm never doing it so fuck that are you crazy they don't they don't stop for you I feel like a whore check I'll check I feel like if you want to do that do you yeah Jamie we might be getting sued now by the cruise lines to someone might snot for you there is absolutely no merit anything young Jamie have said I disavowed you could see the amount of smoke in this room i disavow I don't mean nobody said that's wrong I'm sorry he said if someone fell overboard they wouldn't even stop oh well we lost him I was like how many times they get you after you fall overboard don't they stop if they don't stop that is fucked up if you go overboard and they don't have some sort of a solution to try to go get you that seems crazy but if you did it on your own wheel you crazy that's you can survive the fall first oh really who's the ships are very high what I'm reading right here oh yeah they do have a process to go get people if they fall I think they have smaller ships they can send out and go back and you survived thank you that's a long jump to the bottom right what if you hit it face-first like an asshole that's a fucked up window man falling off a cruise ship in the middle of the night ah shit I've been playing the countries with you just want to drive off you can write me if you don't value a life shit you can't be you can't put everybody else and upset I'm not to be upset more upset about who you are if that's what happened if people just jump off I understand what you're saying yeah yeah that's what I'm talking about but sometimes people get thrown off oh well that that's yeah it's always like a husband's like I don't know what you want I came out here no one here anymore I don't the for Karpin they see him the day see him walking around the day before looking up for every security camera I think they got him on footage marking security cameras trying to figure out where is the best place to throw a reward the Lobos soon will be making another I was watching it not too long ago this says they turn around they turn around who says they do little if it falls off of that man it's so hard to put back in place oh I thought it was like one of them that you touch it in the light touch no it's a there's some some magnet that is making it float in the air but when I tell you it has to be perfect I mean it is so hard to do Jimmy how long it take you to do I didn't even get to do it at someone else had to do it Taylor do it I've done it once it's Jeff did it worse it takes like 10 minutes or like it could take yeah you could get lucky and you do it right away or you might be doing like this oh who gave us up and I was about to do this next I didn't I didn't even know it wasn't connected think on that I know you do but yeah we came real close I thought that was going down that one next to it that's a real luck the whole vibe no no it'd have been fun it's that that's too fragile I mean it's awesome but I mean if that's what happened to something the fucking helmet is the shit though that's all that will do no no it's a real helmet see you Hollywood no that's a guy named Shane against the Machine he's also an artist on Instagram I bought a couple of things from him but this one is a real helmet from World War two and a real bayonet that they converted into a lamp oh dude it's weird every time I look at it I think about like somehow or another this helmet from war from the 1940s is now a lamp in my studio how do you think the next war gonna be I'm terrified I'm terribly a kind of socially uh I mean that's so I think we'll be more electronically electronically it could be it also could be diseases it could be engineered disease is that why you know half the fucking population yeah things can happen Russia was working on a lot of Chett during the Cold War and I wonder how that shit gonna be that shit terrifies me diseases and artificially created diseases such as terrify or even artificially : the grade that they anybody could be that anybody can make that happen well some people can they definitely did for a while during the Cold War just we're lucky that I'm telling anybody can make a disease there now if you with with technology and just learn about the Internet you can teach yourself I deduce news you can but you know we went to the Center for Disease Control once for this TV show that I was working that we talked to these guys that are working everyday like in these space suits with like incredibly toxic viruses they have it in Galveston Texas so we went back and we saw these labs and everything like that and we were asking them about engineer diseases and they go listen fuck engineer diseases you got to worry about real ones just regular diseases every now and then a pandemic comes across a flu you can't fix there's some new Ebola you know there's some new things yes always new strains that's why the flu shot doesn't always work correctly on everybody I've never had the flu that's good for you yeah I have all the other shots but I don't get a shot every year I just don't know that's the best way to do it I think the body is made so perfect like long as you all know abusive abuses like it's Skov heal itself sort of but you need penicillin you need drug you need a lot you need antibiotics you need that chicken we can have both things we could have science and we could have reason right you have except right you twist it when I get sick I do use like certain shit without I don't like to rely on it like I don't know how to swallow pills good for you I don't know that's why our videos I have never swallow a pill before in my life you ever take vitamins I use B C powders okay like when I get a headache I need to have to take a b c product but as far as that that's as much as I do like if I have a headache yeah they make vitamins you can mix in your drinks I do vitamins like I'll take a vitamin like them to a days so shit like how do you take it you smash up everything go get on me bears gummy bears make kids take cvd gummy bears right yeah those gummy bears CBDs are great are they ever saying I don't know we'll get something if you get a better job I want to sell some CBDs make my own brand CVD coming bears because like I used to give a man they had cancer to died the one I was telling you about he used to love them them CVD pain so I think that would be dope well people that have arthritis it's a life changer fatherhood yeah a lot of my friend Dave had these really locked up fingers his fingers were fucked up he just couldn't bend him couldn't straighten him out started doing CBD and his hands just slowly but surely relaxed and now they were perfect I mean that was something that was fucking with him for awhile I don't know if it's because over time I haven't dated but like when I Drive my old-school car the steering wheel it's hard to hold my hands lock up and I want is that because over time by using the regular by the steering wheel getting bigger as my hand evolved to where to it it can't even

lived with the flow of it yeah we were in Florida we're in Gainesville for like three years and then I lived in Jamaica Plain then I lived in Newton which the suburb of Boston then I moved to New York and then out here you start Boston okay what about you I started to live uh Lance got seen I'm started laughing skull is a fucking great little Club I've never done oh you got to go there man you got to go there it's a perfect club it's like I don't know how many had seats I don't even think it seats a hundred I've probably I've heard of it but I've never been over there it's above this killer burger place to have a killer burger place downstairs but it's just a cool I'm cool vibe how many four seats 74 seats 74 seats man I try to do that when I'm in Atlanta I've done it a few times I'm gonna go it's one of those ones it's like it's just a perfect little spot I started at Uptown comedy corner and 99 I've been doing 20 years now Wow yeah shit how long you been doing 30 there yeah what is it now 88 I started so 31 31 years I started in 88 I started in 31 years that's so crazy that's why I feel like it feels long but don't feel long it's like damn them yeah it doesn't it doesn't it does in that it has been a long time like a lot of times around the Sun but it doesn't in that it's still exciting it's still funny shit man when I'm about to go up at the store you know we're all hanging out and look at my phone check out my new shit I get another I get more a kick out of the crowd it's doing that then I do the stand-up part of it I mean the socializer stand apart yeah good people unless I really fuck with him as a person mmm-hmm you know I'm saying like I just like I like the stage more so yeah I know what you're saying then the comedy just chilling and mm-hmm I like that part you don't like chilling I do what I like the part is just the the energy around that part of it oh well it's different places of different vibes yeah you know when we're real lucky in LA everyone's real friendly real supportive it's like very family out here everybody's all huggy everybody's like real supportive it's there's no like it's been never been a time in my career where I remember less bitchiness less squabbling well you didn't let the bottom it's a lot more scrambling dog-eat-dog world so people cut it is do that a little more so I remember some look different oh yeah no I remember then come on you make it I'll make it that's how I used to say shit that is a problem you can get one of those these motherfuckers ain't shit guys deeply in your machine oh yes there's no way you're gonna get around that that's a test of life life is just throwing you another extra puzzle yeah but you can get to a point where you can make your own ecosystem touching your own circle it's like I you coming if I won't allow it you come in this if I see if you if you genuinely you know yeah for sure and then if you can't you do your thing over there the problem with those ecosystems if you get somebody who's not doing their best and is annoying and doesn't want to change sometimes people do get those you get haters you get people who try to sabotage your fun it's real unfortunate when you run into people like that but they do exist they do but I can count I'm a good judgment of character I kind of read all vibes and I don't go by how you treat me I'll go out you treat other people hmm is you can really see because they treat them like this another time up treat people that can't do shit for you you know you get a lot of people asking you to shut all the time and I have no problem saying no I'm not alright cuz I I do I do stuff genuine out my heart to out for real so when people when people want me to do stuff I do what I want to do I'll do what you want me to do you know and I know I do enough to where you can't make me feel bad for not doing that right my own true I know what I do you know I wouldn't be where I'm at now if I wasn't doing right you know so you dudes like want to open up businesses with you and shit all the time hey I got the idea whenever a person like especially when they wanna do shows and shit I'm trying to put something together when you hear they're you know you need to do it with me put nothing together I'm trying to put something together I'm producing this little thing yeah I'm producing this little bag I got Dede if I could attach it to ya ya ya know ya know that gal oh no I hate it but that's always part of the the whole hustles it's always gonna be those guys that try to glom on and and try to sell something attaching you to it and what they do yeah it's like you how am I you you can try me but don't be mad at me for saying no hey man just in their eyes it's the best project of all time it's gonna be amazing trust me it's going to be for your own benefit if you come along on this this was I say if you mad at me for that stop fucking with me hey yeah you're fucking with me she made this easy for me yeah yeah yes just important to find people that aren't like that people that are supportive supporting each other seeing your friend support your other friends this tastes good it's good we right that's a sativa that stuff's gonna make you think about space which shit we already talked about that shit I had to bring myself back because I didn't wanna go too far left on the show too far left too far out do well trip in there yeah and plus I can't articulate it enough I'm still learning it so in the Bahamas they probably have very little light pollution huh don't worry that's why I say it looks like you have a space X jokes he came to my house X him that shit looks like out of space it feels like you're the snowglobe like when you are there you see every star when you were you out there you realize like this is why people thought about out there more because before technology at night that shit probably you have no choice but to look up there yeah that's what people need to see right yes when you look up they're like man they up there like something going on you can you see shit going on like I think they are already up there chillin it's a club up yeah a club who just people are nodding like nah no just kind of these motherfuckers just chilling like like like on district 9 and shit you see me I think that was the mood where they had another little space up there that was that movie know they bring tourism down they probably having tourism up there now they trying to do that to tourism in space yeah yeah that's gonna happen yeah Hotel they're gonna open up oh Jesus how the fuck would you be able to sleep when you're hovering over the earth I wonder how many likes to ever get [Laughter] that would be like the ultimate Instagram influence her big booty girl I'd be ripe ick sticking her ass out and behind her you see the earth life is all about being happy I don't buy this this is a positive 2020 you can go to is se selling tummy tea you reap what you sow and tummy tea I've been drinking this juice and look at must it is amazing for your hair I mean amazing what you say what is it the International Space Station that's that this article here on NBC said that there's plans that have people going there not to stay there but to go there next year and then a oh yeah there are four people by 2022 whoa who's gonna be the first to fuck on try that hotel try that's right that's right I love you the first one that's just ahead rules if I have a doodle cameras that'll be the first point I do cuz I'm going viral that day I'm going Instagram laughs and oh my god that just skeet and just blow on it rings tied up in a bow you should be the first to ski into the air astronauts they've done that before I've got no way they was that board up there did start jacking off adjust that that's just sceeto I don't think they ever get a moment where they're not under camera that was man who gives a fuck if you fun fun much you think you gonna give up what they gonna do to you you know what you gotta come back down here jacked off and let there's footage somewhere I promise you we gotta find the cool astronaut this time yeah fine to the air like a cloud are we still on there yeah oh my god oh it is fun as fuck that's a good joke to have people over has anybody had sex since come on man but I want to know if it's been documented bago say come on people write books wouldn't you what you trying to do you won't be the first mother fuckers out of space ah man I definitely would see it you kind of have to no official officially yet nothing officially correct but maybe someone has I mean maybe the Russians say there's not we're not the only ones they go to space russian sputnik' vodka and bone and they probably have orgies up there yeah I'm telling you man music during the EDM and they've been fucking on the moon everything I'm telling you is not all on the moon we've ever been visited by aliens mm-hmm yeah thereõs walk amongst us now they coming in coming to see how stupid we are and go back and tell these stories and shit you think so I mean I can only see why I mean if you thought there's no way we're the only people in this whole universe there's no way this only happens one time in this one part so it's got to be somewhere else and I'm pretty sure they weigh your head as far as technology and you know what's the other word progress innovation yeah all that yeah wait fuck yeah so if they gather know they gather be they gather look at this the only make sense yeah if we could stay alive for a few thousand years longer than we are now I mean imagine how much she would have by then and who knows what they've done you know whether it mean they might they might have they might have created a technology based entirely entirely on their atmosphere and their planet it might be just a different way of propulsion a different way of organisms different way of everything there's so many possibilities they can be sort of trips that's that's the that's the power like rips like those are humans I read something somewhere about the possibility of there being living creatures in other parts of the universe that are made out of light that's that's what I mean like it's like what are the what are the parameters for something being alive with given all the different possible environments in the universe like what it's all about life is like what life we've ever discovered on earth like maybe life can exist and bizarre crazy environments just a different light like that cocoon like a different kind of life I mean like that movie cuckoo who's like old people and then they got young yeah if I can but but the thing was it came and they looked that look cool in the spirit like a like he became like a life I don't remember that enough I do remember though economy I remember it was old people and they they turn young and start fucking yeah yeah big part of it yeah yeah yeah but will you look at it from a but if there is like other kinds of life forms out there because it's just like a liar and it's like a life telly I forgot about this and if we thought about they thought about this long time ago man Wow cocoon where was time man not it was just some shrooms back there oh for sure that's what you see when you're high as fuck come on I'm telling you that's why I'm telling you we gotta watch that again the ice is melting that thing give me that photo give me that phone man you realize the earth is getting too warm sexual diseases are ravaging your population you have to stop you have to slow down you're headed to the edge of the cliff humanity is in great danger you're pulling all the fish out of the ocean you're heating up the sky and filling it with particulate the very air you breathe there's not much time left I see the boy with ma'am telly look at that thing fuck that whatever that thing is I don't want it in me in like in because that's what I'm saying like that's that movie there was like 30 years and one that like 30 years ago long time ago so that was 30 years ago that mean they'd been new yeah about what we just put in two and two together I think the light thing was just was a physicist was speculating about the possibility of different for he was right yeah he was right motherfucker so just thinking that might be like what you said that theory was with the light we might just be little lights of also how hard would it be for aliens to make fake people to move amongst us they could travel here from other planets why can't they make fake people that can wander around yeah how many people do you think you know that are aliens Donald Trump you don't give no fucks about humanity down here you know give no fucks maybe he just knows the spaceships are coming yeah if you were president and they told you spaceships are coming what the fuck do you tell people hey it's over now you get the drone you get a droid like you and you be on that spaceship and let let people do what they do and piss them off let them get mad at each other kill each other that'd be a million I think if aliens did show their face if there was like a real bona fide alien invasion or at least alien landing it would be real similar to how we change in terms of the way we look at ourselves in humanity real similar to a natural disaster you'd be humbled we would all be like oh shit like of a real spaceship landed and real aliens are on board the station I don't know let's still think the government motherfucker that's where the government doing something that's true that's true to some people you given you given humans way too much credit we stupid for the most part as a whole yeah some people definitely think it was fake yes the way it was fake it would be real hard to convince someone that it wasn't for man people God could come down here saria's me as God we wouldn't believe it we would believe like we don't we don't believe nothing that we ain't really seen the foe yeah that's just how humans are we stupid well that's where the whole flatter thing comes from right all right I've never seen it yeah you know it's like you know what's so stupid about that it's like if you really felt like that why don't you just get in the boat and go to the end like wouldn't that make sense like you would be the Christopher Columbus of this shit if you want to be so sure and tell everybody they wrong get your ass in the boat and go to the end yeah that you really feel that motherfucking smart that is just stupid like it's it's the dumbest shit ever well it's weird too because they dismiss all of the evidence that the earth is round but yet they show no evidence that's what I said so prove me into that's what whoever listened this get in the boat it's just ride ride ride ride all right until you get to the end and when you get to be in take a picture and put it on Instagram is in it too but the thing is if you say that there's someone like you don't understand you've never done Flat Earth research there are those photographs they have been definitely doing video live do it live do it live you do it live so we can know for facts oh and I'm gonna be up an Instagram headquarters so I can make sure this is really VI e bitch there's a nice wall very tough to get through whatever is there go there go to the ice wall just give me one picture send me one good picture what it looks like Thanks that's oh yeah I can do it please see if you go further with this they think that stars are fake they do they think that the Sun is way closer than it then we've been told how do they explain how do you explain the Sun actually going from from Sun up to Sun down curving like how do they explain it we there's a very logical explanation used to understand the science explain that bullshit sorry you can't they stupid hard to be there's gonna be people who tell you that something's not real no matter what it is it doesn't matter if it's people have water in their bodies it's gonna be a guy out there well actually there's no water in human bodies the water that you drink is immediately evaporates through the surface of your skin in an incredible pace so reason why you're so warm you're at ninety six point five degrees instantaneously the myth starts forming and you disappear you don't actually drink water there's someone out there that will tell you that there's someone out there that will tell you that human beings can live off of air there's dudes that think that their guru lives off air and he hasn't had food or water for years there's people that are just dumb man that's cuz wee boy when you bullet you start thinking the stupid shit you're thinking you know what you're talking about you didn't did it to end poor genetics and it might be on the first couple of rides must be the first couple times around as a person that's what it is that's what they only first right we own our fourth when they steal reality yeah I think you've been on a hundred at least yeah you've been on a lot of rides so if I've been on the herd you you had to be on the same amount or even more than me yeah I think we've all been on this a bunch of times and I think if that's real I mean now be let's see you have to be a little more up because you white so so you had to be a little more so you might have been like one if I'm 100 I'm gonna get you one up because in this generation in America y'all got one up on this right now but wait till we come up we owe y'all ass you know your layers but we're gonna be out like that ain't know if I can help that's why I wanted to steal the the the humanity and the for the money you know that take over all the humanity we got to be careful of anything that separates people we done necessary thing that doesn't really mean you know what and you know what I do for real and the people always ask me about the trip I don't know why that's one of the reasons why I don't use colored emojis all my emojis I use be yellow for the most part unless it's a joke I'm trying to because I feel like that's still pushing the separation mmm you know saying so it's like to me I don't feel like this like it's no reason that the yellow is and then you're like why are you ain't using this I'm using yellow I ain't using white or black I use nothing I'm using yellow right in nothing yellow fake people yeah this yellow big fake just given this it's still given the same exact thing is just yellow yes it's just laughter yes laughter smiley face crying laughs yeah I don't have to be a black laughter unless I'm telling the joke of something means like like black man don't cheat that's right I need the black fish right a little bit I don't give a fuck Jamie had a good point once about emojis that they're like the new higher go fix yeah and what avails language eventually becomes a series of emojis that's all it is we ain't got to talk no more totally possible we don't really have to talk like we own iPhones if we could text and all that stuff there you can send feelings you got push like little things and they give a feeling we don't have to use none of that shit we barely use Ninian now we better use our arms all this shit the only thing gonna be like this pretty soon it would be hard to convey like hey did you go to the movie at seven o'clock or eight it would be hard to convey things like that through just emojis o'clock yes you can do range though but then you'd say you'd have to go a movie and then the @ sign and then seven o'clock and then you would go question mark eight o'clock question mark I guess you could right there just a movie seven eight question yeah but seven eight is weird seven question mark eight question mark me it's two possibilities seven eight like that's how you'd say it someone you wouldn't say seven eight they're like what the fuck are you saying 78 what are you saying - I'm saying I know what you're saying but like it would be a clock it'll be a number science by the sick I said man who ever I'm communicating really about to be over Allen imagine our legacy if they came up with a language that was all emojis that kids just learned really early it's like that now my daughter when she talks to me it's mostly in emojis but even when we put that FaceTime face she like to put that on like they do that in there like that game what's that game she be playing roblox yes that's all a roadblock so that's oh they don't even talk to each other they be I don't know what they be doing in there but ain't no voices they're learning how to connect with machines they learn how to connect through energy and feelings in in whatever you draw or whatever your creativity it's like we're we're evolving out of our human body slowly but surely I couldn't agree more it's happening whether people recognize it or not and it's gonna be real weird when it takes hold and I don't know what form it's gonna be it's gonna be a wearable device I think I'm willing to go with it I didn't think we'll be right where we at man so shit I'm cool with it you just got to go with it that's how you enjoy like you know and if you ain't laughing at life you've missing the whole point of this shit like this shit shit fun like this shit funny as hell just watching how stupid this shit evolve it just it is fun it's weird - weird time it's it's a great time it's not great time so right now this is it's a spoof like it's like everything that was in living color what we grew then or everything a comedian said 20 years ago that we didn't see it it's like really life now is like this shit is really crazy yeah so it's like just laugh at this shit shit funny isn't love but it's very strange yeah it ain't strange it's funny it's funny too strange is funny and I like it strange what's the milk container kind of choice of those these the mom was very shit cookies cookies yeah mmm that from the stash yeah those are good those are speed weed speedily yeah telling ya it's a must shit what happened just hit my knee on the goddamn or the metal thing yeah hi yeah you just feel that I just gave me dirty as fuck and that bitch ain't moved I've come they've got their bridge meet material it's all made with steel girders I made this what they make them the matthew bridge off the injection yeah but this is like there's no move oh shit y'all got ropes got roaches in there no I got rose traps we get roaches sometimes we find them dead in the bathroom like white in the fuck day ones too you can't get rid of roaches can't get rid of rats I ain't no roaches came from I didn't even know ya know they have roaches they're a different kind of roach though they're like chill California roaches yeah they're not fast you know the roaches like even I've watched in my time of living like even like roaches evolve and do certain things or flies be slower I seen a certain play they quicker now is it you see even insects evolved anything evolves um somebody was telling about me about this I think my wife told me this there's different kinds of roaches as an outside roach and an inside roach there's roaches that are more they live more in like fields and they're slower and less reactive and then you got roaches most likely that probably evolved in cities you got imagine if people laying out rose traps and people are stomping you every time they see you gave you got faster and you give you a faster those roaches in the East Coast like if you go to like a New York City Roach that's a fast roach Oh New York see the rat mice at those are terrifying gives you that Netflix documentary on rats uh-uh oh man if you ever want to freak out there's a great documentary on Netflix just called rats and they take these rats and they test them for diseases and they fucking all have something they have giant like parasites this one had a botfly and it's cheek like normos like like a 1/4 how big a third of his head how big what did they eat like on the side of his neck right that's where it was it was in his neck bro it was nasty and then they were just saying like look there's there's as many of these fucking things as there are people I mean and they did they get rid of know what that rat I mean like rats that's like that well there's definitely rad so it's like that yeah I thought they no man they haven't done shit to get rid of rats they can't they thought what they found him all over the country they can't fucking meet you basic immune I just read this the other day that like 1% of the rats in LA are gonna have some like bubonic plague of course already I think it's very sooner if they don't already have it it's one person rats eat shit ok the dog shit famously the animal shit and they eat our shit so if you're a junkie and you're just shooting heroin into your asshole and then you take shits and these rats eat this shit mmm some some homeless people turned up with what was it typhoid typhus yeah that's a medieval disease that's why you need to get closer to the country so rats get a hold of that rats get shit eat their shit they all get sick everyone gets sick that's why I get closer to the controls but away from that city shit yes boy when they come it's gonna go from there and spread but by the time you get to you you'd be the grew young your own shit I'm glad you brought that up so I want to find out what what does the definition between city girl and country girl the thing you doing bad city boys and hot girls yeah see the booze and hot girls but that was something like well city boys that's always been like a Florida thing from Tampa that's actually from Tampa as songs from Tampa called called city blood by Tom G it's always been like a little vibe and like we joking in them and whooping Florida and it's just something I just a song I wanted to bring back for for everybody in Florida oh can I do that the hip hop awards and everything so it was really just like a culture thing that's just like a vibe we do with jerking vibe and everything down there and this it just it was good for the culture and flooring like it was real big for Florida just that song really yeah well yeah yeah I was wondering what it was boy it's a dance oh it's a dance yeah that the city boy was a dance city boy yes it is it was dope too though because when I did the Hip Hop Awards everybody from floor there was tenth into that because it was it was representing everybody in Florida you know those moments for the coach you won Florida can use some of that right Florida always takes jokes people including me people always shit on Florida I should only choose but we are crazy but there's there's a lot of good things about this to there and that's the good thing through all that bullshit we know how to have a good time and that's what our music shows the good times in the vibes that we that we do yeah a lot of the vibes come from us because shit that's all we do is party down there and that come from the Caribbeans - well the south of Florida - well be another country I mean South Florida might as well be some Latin American yeah let some Latin American country this particular substitution yeah might as well be like Puerto Rico yeah like Puerto Rico's kind of America right not white not quite but kind of they say you don't make it to America - like - like where's Paul Donald Trump's Donald Trump's border that's what it is right here that's the border of South South North America DC called Florida's a new country it's called south south north america Oh south south USA yeah but but the rest is south to be pissed but if you called it south south North America it's so stupid the rest of us should be like yeah you can have that yeah yeah south of I want to call it what South no who wrong with it yeah everybody in Tennessee and no you know the real South Billiken fuck you man you can have that you can't have the South but South South North America keep that Florida some people do I mean it would be crazy if someone did decide to branch off like if Texas was like enough we're done we got honestly and you go to Montana and all that they already go by these logs do it they won't you get shout out there you shot in North Dakota South Dakota well for the longest time on my channel it wouldn't make a speeding limit like now I don't blame them this state we're like it ain't that much to do out that motherfucker no way they do it's a lot of places like that in the country we just they just do what they do but it's also Montana the people that lived there value freedom it's very important that is free yeah that is free today value freedom so they're like you know we don't wanna rest of America don't fuck I mean like they don't fuck with them like America let them do what they do there's not that many people what's up Jimmy speed limit scientists as reasonable improvement reasonable and prudent truck 65 night all vehicle 65 that's interesting is that in Montana is that now is there this typed in Montana speed limit and they said they're raising the limit again reasonable and what year is that what is that I don't know well see if you have a Corvette and you're going 95 miles an hour that's kind of reasonable and prudent if there's no one on the road if you know how to drive and you got a car that handles really well and drives really fast right most people in the country know how to drive they do with all the time they race that's well that's all the races being in the country in the country country right right so they no other race yeah that's what they do you grew up you that's what you do as a teenager you learn yeah if you're in Montana definitely I'm pretty sure they out there race they probably live in a best life out there for real mm-hmm it's a good place to live if you could take the winner I heard on what was the place in was it South Dakota where's the mind in it they have mining in South Dakota that's what um strippers make the most money oh really uh-oh where do I read this crazy story about the mind life about what it's like there his mind was there is crazytown it's right that they yeah that's what it was vice had a documentary on it and it was these crazy towns that pop up right next to these mines cuz all these dudes working these mines and they make money and they need somewhere to blow it off and so it develops like this sort of community around mines mining towns and it's really like what it was in the Old West when you think about those Old West II towns of the saloon and fucking shoot-'em-ups in the street what was it our way that's the same thing it's miners and thieves right there's people mining gold and people who are thieves and people bringing in cattle to feed the miners and people feeding ranches all that shit I mean it's uh it's kind of what happens whenever you get this thing that people are trying to resource people trying to pull out of the ground and then that you build up some sort of ramshackle civilization around it is there still stuff is there still stuff to mining yeah what are they mining what are they mining in fine Linda I think they're mining some I don't remember what it was that would device one like fracking oil Oh fracking yes see those jobs are dangerous you know any kind of mining job no matter what you're mining you're dealing with heavy equipment and shit it's hard to get people to do those jobs see this I get people do that job what's that job where they go get crabs oh that's a hard job yeah you watch that shit yeah I'll be watching this shit is catch yeah our King currently be getting them king crabs up in Alaska is crazy that's not worth it those guys cool my doobie I mean maybe shit they get like that getting them tunas like I think they be going with like 250 yeah good tune so it might be what's up that's what's your way of life is you want to go out of there apparently still really yeah well the Homestake mine is what it's called in South Dakota mm-hmm Wow so there's all kinds of different mining going on down there yeah this but this one article that we read is just about this one town where everything got real crazy because you just got a bunch of men you know men making a lot of money but they don't have anything to do and they start getting fucked up that sounds like America in a few years well that's what America used to be right I mean that's when the miners came across the country that's exactly what happened every fuckin Old West movies the same thing right it's all like there's a saloon people getting fucked up someone gets out of line someone gets shot people are gun fights in the street it's always that shit that's what it is now like that's what its kind of in I think you're not coaching that like young people getting money man think I nothing else to do that's what he's just fucking it up it's like it's nothing to do it's like like when we hit there's probably like where I guess in the 80s where White's words when they start getting money with the Wall Street and all that shit yeah the spin is like a motherfucker son a snood us so it's like shit we don't know what to do is we just fucking it up yeah getting stupid beefs and doing ain't nothing else to do even if you do everything I put my mom in this put my mom and that's gonna happen in a
