three two one what's up Dave how are you live bitches yes you wanted to say that I know thanks for doing this man I appreciate it thanks for having me dude I've watched you fight a bunch of times online and let way is probably one of the most brutal combat sports in the world and it's so interesting watching a guy like you you kept it quasi would you say you're good yeah French it's not bad it's terrible but how do you how do you go from Montreal to being the king of what what yeah it's it's a crazy journey man and like like you know way too it was we go there let's go there basically when I was I was to play baseball I was available I was a pitcher in Pennsylvania I was like doing a bunch of like University baseball traveling team and then I got into like a fight with my father I shout out to my father and this fight well you know they never went physical oh but it was like going very hard and they said like my both my parents said they've really please leave like the you're like you're kicked out of the house oh yeah 17 18 Wow so like I had no money and I was like like almost like industry it was - for fire night so for you guys like - 20 degrees Celsius it was like like okay I call my friend like come pick me up and I couch her for a few months and finally got a place got my shit together but then I had like a fire you know we didn't we didn't speak for many years now we actually have a good relationship now but so then and I believe that nothing good comes out of comfort right like heart yeah so I was I was I had a lot of like I said fuck baseball that's like I wanted to fight because of that yeah crazy so because of getting angry at your dad that's what made you want to learn how to fight it's like I resumed it maybe like that a little bit I hope he doesn't take it the wrong way but yeah worked out so you shouldn't take it the wrong way but it all worked out well sure and then actually funny enough my first love was grappling I was I did like a did a lot of competition like noogie I want someone like in key like but was mostly noogie and then I I actually had my league called the SFL I was like a submission Fight League once a month I had guys organize I was or I was on I was not fighting I was just organizing it and got the guys fighting and submission only not IB gdf just where was this at in Quebec in Quebec yeah I'm on near Montreal so then we're doing this and then I said my coach my seafood seafood Patrick again shout out to my coach and he said I said I never want to do anything other than grappling he said well you're at all and you know you're good reach maybe you should consider no I don't want to do I only want to do a noogie he's like okay he lets me do my shit and then yeah eventually I started I started doing like I come from Santa background like yeah right which is a style of martial arts yeah so Chinese martial arts all the army in China does that very much and it's pretty cool so wide stance spinning attacks you know and cool stuff a lot of throws I was actually with kung Li in the San Jose shit yeah we did some laser head buddy videos Wow I mean to do one together after all right no not really and there head-butted a person Bundy pads I fucked around you know and head-butted the bag but just joking I'm never I've never like I've seen your pad routines will you incorporate headbutts into the pads yeah it's I feel like huge fight like you train so if you don't if you don't train it how the hell you're gonna throw in the straw how does it become do a lot of people head butt pads or are you am I'm teaching them now okay I see you originated it yeah I've never seen anybody do okay you I mean I've seen people head but people in fights particularly the UFC the early days Mike Mark Coleman when he was the heavyweight champion he was the Godfather of ground-and-pound big gigantic wrestler and he would take guys down get on top of him it didn't matter if you were in the car he had but the fuck out of your head I see when they took away his head butts you know because it they changed the rules they took away fucking 20% of his game 20% of his game he'd control you slam is foreign in your nose you know you couldn't see then he'd pound the shit out of you okay I mean that was one of the ways he did him that you could get out from the UFC they took it out of the rules which I don't totally understand why if you can elbow in the face and the eye sockets and the nose why can't you headbutt I don't know it's cuz a headbutt cuts elbow cuts and actually can do way more than an elbow and so knees knees cut as well true yeah I think I think it should be legal I think so dude yeah you do yeah at it so how did you get explain the path to let way okay so now we were basically at the add-ins starting to striking so then I do a couple fight nights and I love it I start fighting but then it's legal in Canada you can't do like folk even Muay Thai is illegal so I didn't ties illegal in Canada or promote I what ya know elbows how come the UFC's legal tell me about it oh my god you can do it but you have to do a headgear and shit for a muta Wow even in France shin pads I'm not sure but there's no elbows again no elbows so I amateur Muay Thai no elbows but that's not my ties that you know it's not oh that's crazy even in France I think Muay Thai like Thai fight when you go there they have had little elbow pads really yep what's and I was fighting with elbow pads sanchow with elbow pads hilarious friends Wow amazing and then what else and then basically I went to Thailand for the first time because my friends were there and just easier because me amar with like for those who don't know it used to be called Burma and now it's Myanmar and it was super hard to get visas and you know a bunch of things stuff like that so I go there I do my first prom with I fight because then I was I was like partying and I was I want to get a fight so you give me a fight I win how much training had you done you did sonda and then what else well did Santa and grappling and MMA yeah bit so basically like so no muy Thai no everything with that before my first movie fine y yeah it was a brawl it was crazy but beautiful to watch but wow how many people could say that I never did moisturize before my first more time but I got lucky I got a nice elbow in the clinch Chloe and cut him up right here so start thinking about elbows there that's my elbows now yeah but like just to back up a little bit basically my coach Sifu back to show me back then a black belt magazine Burmese boxing probably the same that you saw sure and then I'm like I want to do this right and starting watching videos but there was nothing it was like black and white it was super hard to find there was nothing about this way so I just put it on the ice but my dream was always to go to Myanmar one day but at the time no Tiger moat I was super big it's like easier fights every week it was visa like you don't even need to get a visa it's 30 days for Canadians really so I was like okay my friends are there they invite me to Tiger and I have a good relationship with them now basically ended up winning their tryouts and III do do it was a big year that year we had like Dan hooker myself you wanna make eligor Sinofsky was there Peter yawns all the guys were oh yeah so it was like yeah a good fight and and then I was like I was for me they were free MMA I was for Muay Thai so we got a scholarship so look following me yes then and then I go to I get that little like I mean thank you for giving that room guys but it was a shitty room with a toilet it was a bed in a toilet you know but I'm happy at the time I had no money you know I just like I'm happy I'm happy with this we had like actually my wife is watching right now we had like called the the black hole in the toilet there was the humid AC was leaking and it was so like it was so disgusting there was like we called it a black hole it was the mold the Mafia oh that's terrible for you I know tell me about it yeah that stuff some some of that mold can be toxic right yeah and my wife is not very happy about it I'm sure they weren't testing that mold either so then we get this and then like I remember like it's yesterday we're on the bed and like I'm making one fight a month in Thailand and I'm you know it's like I'm telling I actually got myself in myself in a maximal type tournament it was I was trying to get my name you know in the pooka stadium and the Phuket Sirkin and then and then one time like with the manager pulled me out and he's like you're not good enough because they wanted me to be super stadium like you know check block check block and I want I was wide stance I was I was catching kicks punching back I was not like like they want me to do at all not good for gamblers because gamblers they want you to they start gambling a second round and then I was knocking I was winning like the first round so they don't make money with me so they wanted you to for people don't understand what we're talking about in Thailand its traditional that the fighters fight slowly in the first round they just sort of feel each other out once the bets are all in place then they go hard in the second and third round but a lot of fighters would go over there especially from other countries and just fuck people up in the first round yeah and that's what you did yeah and then didn't like music so what did they tell you to do so tell you to slow down you just pull you didn't say anything just pull me out of the tournament and say you're not good enough not yeah and I was winning I was winning fights yeah so that's how I'm starting to get pissed a little bit and then I'm making shit money and I sold everything that I had that I had at the time to go to Thailand so I'm like a bit and you know like hard shit like I'm like what am I gonna do and then I meet Irina and my wife now were married by the time we were we were just together and she said one day we won't have kids we're gonna bike you have kids with $200 a month you know like is that what you're making for a fight two hundred two dollars a fight in the pooka seems like ten thousand but sorry six thousand but it's disgusting Wow that's the way people get like even for a whole month you were living off 200 bucks I was getting in debt thank God I had credit before coming through he's burning through that shit to go fast fifty bucks a week that's kind of crazy so that was I was spending it like $500 a week so I was I was I was getting that pretty fast Wow like fast so by the time you know and I'm like okay what I'm gonna do so we're like we're crying on the bed my wife is like you know I believe in you you can do whatever you want I think you're you know you can be champion I said I don't want to be just champion anywhere I don't want to be I want to be champion and like the most brutal shit in the world like but let's weigh it was like it was almost unattainable at a time so lean to people the rules of life that way because we keep talking yes true so little pots no gloves takedowns allowed so suplex to the spot on the head elbows to the back of the head they don't care right you know takedowns allowed so soccer kicks soccer kicks and I mean yes the body but you can sort of on the way down yeah you can kick them in can i body lock and on the way down you head but then you get back up the referee doesn't care a lot of times is that rule though is it legal or a lion gray law you gray area so you can actually do a takedown and then drop the need like me stomp and then it's okay yeah yeah they say that basically you're supposed to help her brother up so when you fall down you help them up and you see you fight so the mentality is like we fight for 15 minutes and if we punch each other in the face face would help elbows head butts and everything and let's see your first who quits but then if you go on the floor we get up they want action back you know mm-hmm even though I loved I loved the I think it's true that on the fly I understand on the fetus more exciting so it's easier for people to understand for sure yeah especially for people that don't train they always want stand up fights sure so you how did you wind up going over to Myanmar so okay so just again I I got myself i watch advice documentary on prison fight okay look at that so the prison fight thing another that's again for its for in Thailand for those who don't know it's sanctioned by the tide the partial Department of Correction and they didn't do I was on the last one ever in 2014 and basically its inmates fighting foreigners and if the inmate wins the the sentence is reduced whoa yeah have you heard about this No okay prison fight yeah I did that and we were so basically we go into maximum security outside a Bangkok maximum security prison and it's like a movie man like they made a movie actually about it recently I was on the real deal yeah and I was with my Turkish friend we go there they take her away were phones look at that big metal door we go underneath I have goose bumps talking about it and then we go 800 inmate they're all they're all there for leader rape gang rape murder trout drug trafficking and their own they can get their sentence reduced if they win a fight yeah what if they went to fights one guy actually it was on it was on Showtime they didn't mention on Showtime and he actually won the finale you won against an American and the he got released a murder 21 he was actually but at what I heard I'm correct me if I'm wrong but you went he was in a bar and somebody's like talk about his girlfriend touch his girlfriend he went back he took a knife and stabbed the guy in the neck and he got in prison for that for murder basically then he got out for fighting well you're fighting very well don't go to that part of the world with a squeamish stomach so you was but actually those guys there they do some mistakes but they were fighting in lumbini they were they were like high level guys you know really yeah maybe not make all champions but they were like they knew how to fight 100 fights enough so I get a guy who was there for trafficking methamphetamine meth Wow it was like 10 years and basically me actually maybe you know and Barbara's honored well if he fights in glory and he was actually he fought for the belt against he actually lost the belt I recently and we were me and him at the time he was not in glory at the time we fought there and only you know me and another Iranian won the prison fight and what are the rules so it's it's a three-round fight with our rules with gloves with big pillows mmm it else so at the time I again my goal was always to go to Myanmar so look look at that so basically after this I go back to Canada and I'm like my head is like I don't want to be in minus 4 degrees Celsius you know and minus 20 in Celsius so I'm like how can I go back to Asia and so i go to i go to i go back a fire save money i go back and then losing my thoughts basically i when i when i get that situation with arena right we're like we're like we're stressing for money we're stressing for the future i I called up the prison fight promoter and and at the time I said you have a fight for me like I need to get money you need to say well I don't promote Muay Thai anymore I promoted its way you want to get you wanna fight Allah to him like yes that's my just you know I've always wanted to do this so he's like well if you want I have this guy's to to see OTO is a undefeated champion let's weigh rules 36 fights to to to to that's his real name who's undefeated how many fine 36 fights that means it's all K all right cuz traditional its way it's K only 2 and we forgot to say that it's really there's no there's no point system no points no how many rounds 5 rounds so what happens if you go fire wrong whoa Bellona you're fucking the dude up that's what happened wow so yeah so basically I go I said I don't care let's fight I want it because you just it's my dream so it's like well how many fights you have well I have 10 with Thai fights Oh Muay Thai well he's you know 50 fights and let's way and you have 10 fights in multi well let me let me do something II lied on the record he said you have 40 fights ok and then I go over I go over there and like I don't care cuz my coach Sifu Patrick and I we were always like you know I go Jane in like practicing that's the mentality of it like rs.50 like fishhooking in the clinch or in the ground that way no no but I mean you can probably I F Choki probably probably I mean they don't care really really yeah but as long as no eye pokes right so anyway so I was always ready for that I wanted that that aggressive fights so um I go to the fight and some kind of energy comes in my body I don't know I don't believe in that stuff but like I just disfigured him like he didn't touch me much I was using my push kick to the thighs I was keeping that distance and then I went inside I'll use my elbows and I like if you see the fight it's it was you really puffed up like he was pretty cool and then that was my first fight and the crowd like they were throwing bottles at a little bit but they throwing bottles cuz bait there he's their champion yeah but then they quickly saw that I did my lick come on which is the challenge gesture you know very old challenge gesture and the they loved it so they started what is how does that work so basically before the fight you put your arm like this and you you so explain to people that are just listening you put one arm under your armpit so yeah for those at home so you put your left arm under your armpit and your arm in the air and you you hit with your your copter top cupped hand on the triangle-shaped of your elbow and you three times it actually gives me more goosebumps before because that that's I trigger that to the fight right and this is a very old gesture from me amar from the Burmese army back in the days when they were in the trenches and they were fighting enemies you challenge with honor and courage your opponents and you do that it that simulates the wing of an eagle so they saw you do that and they give they got fired up yeah in the rituals yes because some of the times guys were coming from other disciplines or the country and they were putting their white crew they were doing a bunch of other things you know I embraced the culture okay yeah so they liked it's okay because at first they basically they wanted another tall white dude to get fucked by their guys I mean like I was sent there to lose yeah senator what weight are you competing at I'm 180 right now mm-hmm but like most of my weight is in the groin area so but like when you're fighting those guys like what weight you have to get down to so traditionally inlets way the Burmese guys were never really over 180 pounds and so every everywhere category as you know as a belt there's only and I fight open weight so there was like I have fought guys I were 200 pounds 190 pounds it doesn't matter as long and I think it's striking that it matters less than if there's wrestling involved right sure but like there's only what's it's easy for let's people understand in the Twitter there's only one Golden Bell champion for each weight categories you know like it doesn't matter you know Bellator you have see ya when I see their is one champion let's wait for it doesn't matter I'm in promotion and then do they have like a stadium champion like they have in Thailand or the no-no-no stadiums change all the time okay so how what is the organizing body so at the WLC this is the world at which championship it's like the major league of little a and yeah the not actually gonna do I'm we're saying everything but I wanna we'll be doing an event in the States next year really yes in the United States yes legal it got you know the first state to legalize its way Alabama Wyoming oh those crazy bare-knuckle motherfuckers out there but Cowboys don't mean they don't give a fuck up in Wyoming man there's grizzly bears up there there's only 80 people had never been there it's Austin it's beautiful no never been there okay never been no good savoring towns you know our neighboring states but Wyoming's gorgeous yeah but they want to do it like in Miami in Florida they try to get in Florida they wouldn't let it go in Florida they're trying to get it there that would be more prestigious than to it in doing man by all means the shit I love Wyoming you're gonna get a endorsements from Wyoming because it's like it's uh it's one of the last truly wild places like there's beautiful cities and beautiful homes and stuff why only but it's a gorgeous state and it's got real wildlife they have wolves and grizzly bears and elk and it's just like a I've never hunted there but you definitely end where's the best place Utah Colorado's great there's a lot of stuff on Tana I've hunted in Montana did he ever go out of the country only no no I've never hunted in other countries if you had to go where would it be like out of the country Australia is really good I have a good buddy of mine Adam Greentree he lives in Australia there's a lot of hunting out there new zealand there's a lot of hunting in new zealand so it's a nice trip as far yeah Africa's weird huh ting in Africa is very strange like it's got too many connotations attached to it but there's a lot of wildlife there and it could be rough through some places oh yeah oh yeah after well it's obviously an enormous continent but some of the countries can definitely be rough but they there's a lot of these areas that are supported by people hunting wildlife and I if I did hunt I would only be hunting things like antelope things you eat I would never hunt like a elephant how often do you hunt because I saw like I want to do it too because it looks healthy oh it's the best meat in the world I wish you were staying around here man I'd give you some I have a freezer full out there and it's like how's a fixture it's like it's like a lean meat it's like like venison if you ever had venison it's very lean you have to cook it at low temperature no no no it's not that chewy I mean it's more chewy than say like a real fatty beef steak but I love it I love it's so good for your body and it's like wild oh yeah 100% wild yeah just dodging mountain lions and trying to not live it Jack by wolves and bears and shit I I followed the nature is metal because that's badass nature's metal the best the best Instagram this is like Kyle Dunnigan stefania stand nature's metal the best and one of the coolest is King Natsuko so that's pretty good yeah right the headless but nature's Metal Men let the I watch on one bear attack a deer and he was screaming like a human yeah and she was in the backyard yeah yeah that's awful I would show that to people that think the Bears like his cuddly little things might probably eat deers alive they eat him while they're alive I show that to people that think that we're like we're over nature you know like like we're mammals like yeah we're I'm part of nature we just live in cities and we're very well protected yeah yeah but you that's one of the things that I actually enjoy about hunting is when you're out there in the wild the real wild wandering through the mountains you realize how vulnerable you are you know when you see bears or you see vans well I don't bring a gun I hunt with oh but I mean even with a gun you're still mean if you don't shoot something or if it comes from behind you like a cat yeah like a mountain lion fuck you up man you just see if you have a rifle and you don't even have one in the chamber and a mountain lion jumps in your back good luck getting cracking a bullet and get your safety off and do I get in some did I haven't think like you there's no way you can like you can't like I poke the guy okay people survive by stabbing them people that have survived you know there's people that have been in life or death situations with cats and they've managed to have it it's possible but it's not likely okay I'm likely you're getting fucked up it's that's like if there's a simulation one day I want to try it you know and you can retry emulation we don't kick actually and your face ripped off and with a bear - it would be nice you see that video recently of the trainer you see that yes bear decides you know what fuck this game just throw up just tears the guy apart at second happen in any moment do you're not supposed to do that with bears say hi to them you see him hopefully you're in your car keep driving wave at them don't get out of the fucking car and definitely don't try to train them did you see one li when there are no hair oh yeah the most beautiful creepy yeah creepy okay yeah so anyway yeah please go so we're talking about the prison fight I believe there's something like yeah yeah so yeah so I get yeah I know actually we're going to I crossed over till it's way and then I you know I was giving a just to tell you how much like I I really wasn't prepared that much and it's kind of a crazy how it happened the my translator Burmese translator before entering the ring told me you know if you want to protect your head but don't forget to put your hand on on his head right I'm like what do you mean is that well you know put your head so if he strikes you it's not gonna cut you and that's what I use in my seminars - and Wow and I that's like leary before it they call my name so I go into fight and actually stop the headbutt from this oh yeah and like people at home that you know let's say I try to you know if I would put my hand on my head in the clinch right and if you would strike on my forehead and he was he could still strike me in the jaw if I put on my jaw can still go to my temple but the goal is to and what we can do it laughter a little bit like under I would put on your head so this and if you strike me it's gonna it's gonna stun me but not cut me where's the key yeah but then again why it's so difference in the why is it so different is because you lose a limb that you could use for striking you have to put it on the head of your opponent so you have like one limb left to hit or whatever's right complete different clinch and most people when a clinch in Muay Thai whatever the clinch if they hold the biceps right and then in the middle there's a head right it's really cool that there's still one martial art in the world that's still like will not budged it will keep it raw that's that it's it's an effective technique and this has always been my problem with glory that glory doesn't allow elbows I'm like why not have full Muay Thai rules allow the clinch allowed knees to the body in the clinch allow elbows knees to the face the plum I mean all those those techniques are very valid to be able to cross over an elbow in the clinch I mean it's very skillful it's real and yes you like yeah so that's why elbows and then a head man that is that's another element yeah that's the thing so that's why I think headbutt should PMMA I believe I think so too and if not well we have MMA which is like the most generalists martial art with the grappling and the wrestling and striking but then inlets way we have like the most permissive striking sport on the feet yeah that's pretty exciting yeah well bare-knuckle boxing is they've doing a lot of that in Wyoming by the way hosted in Wyoming yes that's that's where they do it I think that's the only state see if that's the only state that allows it I think it might be one of the only states that allows it but I II was a big proponent of bare-knuckle and MMA I was like why do you get to pad the knuckles up when you don't pad the shin and this and the elbows and it doesn't make any sense but then the cuts the truth Mississippi and New Hampshire have also recently added it but Wyoming is the first yeah yeah I needed you late yeah the cuts are huge and that's the thing but it's only hands right right if you would have your legs to push him away you would have your elbows you had the head butts you would I feel it's even anything they would get less cut off I get less cut too right I think you know in a way actually think like if you look in general most fights I have a bit less cut then then the bare-knuckle boxing cuz it's really just standing in front and sugar and you just punch it it's right I I'm I want to be the new generation let's we fighter cuz the Burmese actually they go in the pocket and it's a bloodbath you know scar tissue everywhere right short careers you don't fight like I don't want that I want to go back to my wife and be a handsome hey baby right so you fight well you also are very long right you're tall and long for your weight class yeah so even though you're fighting large out with you a 6-3 I'm 62 and 62 so when you're fighting these guys do you usually have a height advantage yeah and that's a good point so basically people say cuz I 2 to 2 and 20 min that's another guy 200 min he was the legend used the former champ that when I defeated for the golden belt he was the open weight champ so to to was 75 kg and the other one was open weight so basically 30 min and him are both around five-nine five-ten and so but the thing is actually and now after facing a taller opponents like Americans and French and Australian six foot and up six four three and everything if you if you look at this like East like five nine would it be about here five 10 and then the headbutt would go right away to my job yeah okay and a six and and if I want a headbutt him at 5 10 5 9 I would have to drop my level then do a headbutt but it's slower but in my like I fought in August said Burzynski's like 63 I didn't get that didn't get to this happens in ski father yeah what way yeah I didn't know that yeah you fought him yeah last month Oh second round I got him with a weave and then a hook independent I but I think he was it was pretty cautious of the head but we didn't get in the in the market so yeah I was in Burma he's a cool guy he's a very cool guy I didn't know he was doing that yeah he was bigger than me though he's a big fella you got ease not 170 anymore so is there cutting weight in that way well in the double you'll see now the strength he's trying to put like more strict weight class and but before like I said I fight I fight open weight but now open when it was very restrictive as morph as the properly popularity of loose weight increases there's more big guys I'm going to fight right so now in WLC I am I'm fighting cruiserweight which was 190 hundred and eighty five pounds dude that guy head-butting who's that supposed to be the guy you sure that's me that's you I got that my friend he's pretty cool huh yeah that is cool and like it's the same face yeah I do when I head but you're very angry face well I try to be kind outside of the ring and angry inside and you don't fuck we don't let anybody so have other like big-name guys like Seth but say you know Seth Wotton you have see a quite a long time I think you live in fights yeah deal to me fight or two there are other guys at that level that are starting to make their way to left way well we actually got a message at it from the AYGO Sanchez Diego Diego so fucking crazy of course he wants to do it he said Dave I'm not in UFC anymore oh maybe I shouldn't say that oh shit he is dropped a scoop well he ain't just not in the UFC he said I'm out with my contracts you want to give me a liquefied and CC would be nice wow that fucking psycho of course he wants to do it yeah I think you would love it oh yeah you'd love it he's perfect for it yeah I'll corner him - yeah that's interesting but so yeah apart from that there's been like it was mostly strikers and I had so I thought Cyrus Washington maybe you know yeah sure yeah I also disfigured him - yeah yeah and we had a little bit of rivalry and he's a very good fighter very good fighter but he wasn't able it was running around the entire freakin fight he's a shorter guy - alright it was 5:10 I'm losing yeah I'm not sure a bit shorter than me but yeah he's a guy that throws a lot of spinning techniques yeah and I was aware of that and I was I wanted to make sure that you know I keep my distance but then I I know I had a better inside game than him so how do you want it I want to go inside fast yeah hmm yeah so him and a couple yeah but the biggest name was the Burmese guys you know they're like 55 million people four people I don't know that there's 55 million people in Myanmar and their national sport is let's way yeah and it's like your religion that is crazy crazy it's crazy that it's so popular there and most people unless you're a hardcore martial arts fan you don't even know about it yeah you know there's a lot of UFC fans probably listening to this podcast just hearing about let's wait for the first time yeah and it's it's okay because I had like again gyms that hosted a seminar with me and he said he's a marshal at it for 40 years and never heard about literally wow so it's okay we're in that transition now you know but then in 20 30 years they're gonna ask hey do you know about Latoya yeah I heard the black castle it's also YouTube I think a lot of the videos of your fights and some other fights on YouTube people go whoa they see the head butts and the body slams and the suplexes and shit it just shows like wow this is why all this is a wild sport it's pretty exciting one of the rounds of a normal length three five rounds of three minutes yeah okay yeah exactly very similar to my time yes but then the crazy part which my fights I fought in the traditional literal rules is that you have an injury tab mount injuries of meaning that let's say you knock me out Joe and then I have the they pull me out of my ring in my corner they slap my face they bite my ear they pull right here here whatever do you want to make me up they light your ear but that helps you wake you up really I don't know hurts no they done that not to me guy never used but you've seen people do that pull the hair yeah you've seen them bite each other's ear as it goes just like the mom would she won the ear a little bit really it hurts no oh well I'm sure it hurts but I mean what about ice so it seems like that'd be a better way to weight you everything because let's say you have two minutes to get revived okay so you get Kayode yeah and the fights not over two minutes to get revived why isn't the fight over I don't know that's there in traditional back to 2,000 years ago these they want to give another chance but the double you'll see I thought oh my god they're so crazy yeah WLC is eliminating one with that and I'm good if you want guys to have a career out of Latoya right yeah it's better for the brain oh yeah a lot better because I've seen I think only seen one time actually it was to him in with that I think Cyrus would actually you get the only guy you know you get knocked out he went back to his corner got revived and won the fight what yeah we win by decision and although no decision how the the style Cyrus Washington's corner threw in the time wow that's really rare so most of time when you use your time out you're your outlet you're gonna just get knock out twice yeah I imagine I mean you just had a serious head oh is that it right there yeah show it to me in the beginning in the beginning myself again boom elbow here oh my god he's out fucking cold I look to drag him out and he actually finishing one to fight that is the same so they drag that is fucking insane that is fucking insane that thing they're gonna bite ears who know they're not gonna bite his yes don't tell me they're gonna bite it's literally the dragon he's out cold and this is one of the strongest like like he was to two men yep so sit him down he's literally uncanny way to stuff now he's starting to wake up with the water that's hard though like that's freaking a heart like can't think about what Jamie they just bit his ear rewind was biting his ear they pouring water on he's gonna do it right there huh anyway anyway just like yeah that's that oh he tried to bite his ear it really did that's right so they just pouring water on them and they give me a chance to wake up hey wake up bro and he's that is so crazy what kind of I be right there yeah oh my god he's kissing him - he's making out with us he's like oh I'm gonna fuck you if you don't wake up and the crowd goes crazy because they like you know they want him to keep going yeah it's like it's really about grit and about like heart and he goes back look after at like 36 and he ends up winning I was like gambling that here as well I'm not aware of it I think really but a little bit it's not but it's not my talent I know there's no alcohol service it's about Latoya but it's not like Thailand yeah okay so here's Syrus Washington they put his mouthpiece in and he's aware of the rules right he knows he knocked him out yeah but then it's a long time after that so how about the time it's a long time like how long I at the end of the fifth round but how many how much time they give them a break way it's a minute or two a breakthrough in between rounds nobody meanwhile you got knocked down was it to revive them is that just just two minutes yeah oh look at this he's already back to it you know that is cold that's crazy so this is so bad so I find I fought both of them I fought Cyrus and I fought to two min three times so basically the look that is the end so Cyrus just go put out a towel there like it's over it's over so tell me what the fuck wow that's crazy welcome to the world of little why but that's so insane that they revived him I mean that motherfucker was out cold so put them in now I like that I have a big rivalry with him we had a trilogy fight with together and yeah he's one of the strongest ever saw in my life like yeah he's like he's almost like immune to - I don't know he has his stuff so but think about like I was watching when I when I got into Latoya I coached show me show me fights I got in his fights right and I was like it's it seems so far away to go actually there I was a little kid from Montreal you know from Gatineau actually and then fast forward a couple years later I'm fighting him for the most anticipated rematch in the history right like it was like it was everywhere in this in a country live on national TV it was like 30 million people watching it like almost the whole country it was insane and then every million it's crazy people in the huts and they have a satellite and the people gather in the villages they have electricity but they have like they don't have a running bathrooms but they have a TV with a satellite and then we we fight in December last year and that's actually you showed my head but last time that was that was him oh yeah you know the head but knocked out and I did knock down that he showed yeah and he said like this to do it a lot yeah because people were saying oh head butt doesn't work like no no yeah that was during fight companion yeah I was telling them no no no you got to see David Goodman I appreciated that but so yeah that was the headbutt my first headbutt knocked down like this like this a really I use headbutt I used the head to create distance so let's say we're in the clinch right and you I would like blunt I would put my forehead the hard part of my skull on the jaw on the night I wrote on the understand oh and the mastered muscle here and I would just use it to push and then I couldn't bring back bring it so create space and then headbutt now the way you worked the pads we have headbutts is that something that you invented I never I was never told so I just I just started guy wanted to get better right so I started doing it and yeah I pretty much invented it Wow I mean cannot put invented but like I started doing it but you well you started actually doing pad work for headbutt stuff yeah and in a more refined away because they do that in Myanmar a little bit of headbutts on the pad but like I wanted to know more refinery and following up what you want oh yes you do show this award Netflix that is good actually that's I actually has neck flex is that something like the iron neck like the same sort of a deal okay look at that so it's a chain for witness my lifesaver meant for my neck to be honest I used to have those rights with the freaking concrete concrete thing yeah but that's plain what that is so basically for people at home like site record I was always the last guy after the gym to go train my neck because I feel like he helped it helped spur ahead but prevention and concussion and everything definitely helps concussion prevention and I feel like if you would punch me in on the front what would absorbs the impact would be my Marcellus lado mastered muscle yeah and so then I started in this but those when you when you bite a weight and you pull it up it works the back of the neck but then I was doing neck raises I was on my on my back and I was the neck raisers in France or the front of them but then I was getting a bit stronger so I was putting in like kettle bell in my forehead and like you know thinking about to get stronger but then I can't carry this biteable neck and on my trips on my tours right so then this guy reaches up he's like well you can break that in your luggage and you can put a 45 pound on it if you want right that's pretty right yeah so then I started like just doing my neck like this and I like it like it's practical and I can when I'm on tour right now I can just do my neck everywhere in any gym with the weights you know have you ever used an iron neck no no no I have one out here I want you to do okay I think it's the best for training your neck this allows you to rotate okay it's like a halo and it has a 50-pound bungee cord like a grapplers love it like jong-hyuk when shuttle swears but can you do like heavy weights like this I can do like a 45 don't you don't do it wait no so the idea is don't think it would be good to do weights I don't know see it's it's very controversial some people think that when you're doing like the traditional I have one of those head things a leather thing with a chain like that you put a plate on it yeah yeah I've done these but some people think that that motion with weights puts unnecessary pressure on your disc okay so the idea with the iron neck is there's never any pressure in your discs because you never straight okay you got a halo the halo sits on top your head it forms and it's a picture you pump it up so it gets tight in your head but I feel like no those twisting can be a bit like not detrimental for the disc you know I'm just gonna try what's right afterwards but I mean I'm not a physiologist so I don't but I I've talked to people that I really respect they don't like the gay thing okay well I guess because I use the width and I feel like it like actually maybe you saw a video I did with bass did it a and then no I didn't see it eagle throat in the neck I tell people that someone's fucking with you like just grab their neck slam in the neck like that but this I feel like as I'm doing more neck my muscle go overlaps idea right oh yeah all this yeah stuff right here so you're someone a lot of this a lot of materials you need every day every two days and I do they do neck bridges as well yes there is back in front yeah they're pendulum and everything but I'm not I'm not doing Mike's idea I'm just doing frontal because I miss neck up - you know Tyson had to get surgery on his neck it's risky the neck brace it if you don't know well you can hurt your back yeah neck bridges are a lot of wrestlers want to fucking on that couple yeah I mean you put a lot of weight you know you see that arc and you're rolling back and forth and the thing is it's tremendous pressure on the discs it's an unnatural pressure okay this is the whole concept behind the iron neck okay is that you don't put that kind of pressure because you never have like a flex ation okay of the neck while you're strengthened yeah but definitely like for example when I went out let's see you by the neck where I put the next flex on my head and like when I do this I feel like oh yeah so I feel it's like any muscle like bicep mmm build up muscle and and frontal yeah frontal would be neck raises are you doing trap work as well did you shrugs I'm not the biggest guy you know the better I feel a strong neck a strong back and again for people at home when you do a headbutt why I sit Rainier yeah it's training your fucking neck yeah it's it's not because I'm gonna do a whip with my head that's actually when it's detrimental for your spine right when you when I do a head but if you look at all my videos and head butts I put this it's like my spine is rock solid and you use your legs yeah so your head is stable your neck is stable but it's strong but then you push with your legs yeah to create a good head but yeah helping real power with that head but it's not just like a thump like a thoughtless sort of a thumb you want to be doing it like a technique yeah and then you would actually people say ah and we can talk about Isabella if you are if you do head butts you know it's gonna be a brain damage well first of all any any marshal or any contact sport there's a risk we're not playing soccer here right but right and even if you are soccer players get brain damage and it would devolve heading the ball yeah sure so I mean let's do what we had life is short we don't know what's gonna happen after this let's do what we love I love doing headbutt so so basically when I when I I feel like if you hit with a hard part of your skull with like the horseshoe horseshoe yeah I know I feel like you're inflicting maximum damage to your opponent but not to myself there's a great video of a girl or like a girl who's this fucking guy is in her face talking shit outside of a bar and she grabs his collars she grabs his his collars and fucking slams her head and to him and he goes out it's the best hilarious though cuz this guy's way bigger than air he's just being a dick and she's like oh yeah okay you know I want to teach your head butt and kick into grant it's not they know you don't watch it this is a fucking hilarious video so this guy is like oh you see they're there they're in the middle of like this thing let's see when does it actually happen the guy's like pushing her and back in her outfit boom oh bitch fuck you he's pushing her yeah she's tiny way smaller than them I mean I don't know what was being said but he was pushing her and pushing her back she's like you're out bitch love it girls other head but that girl's cell defense probably wakes up in the middle night when she has to pay and thinks about that yeah she used her house dude that girl she did it well somebody taught her or she just has good instance the wheels together let's we contract they have women that fight left yes sir yeah when actually was maybe you've heard but she was on The Ultimate Fighter show with Julia she's a lieutenant and she did she went she went pretty far I think but she from latina she won that in Japan Latoya is pretty getting pretty big in Japan really yeah there's a like a literally in Japan I fought there are three times in Tokyo no kidding that's well I know that the awareness of it is growing like what is is that the Internet is that what's making people more aware of it some people say the internet some people say it's Dave I don't know well it's you too I'm sure yeah you know that there's like a face that speaks English that you know you couldn't say thank God you couldn't have like them two men speaking Russian that's hard to get excited about it sometimes that's all it takes is like someone crosses over it becomes the best at it from another country and then you could speak English clearly and so that's no accident that's the way you obviously have an accent but jollier but if I sure learned English while watching Fear Factor no you didn't I was watching it incorrect maybe but that's not how you learned English that's why I swear so much doesn't even make any sense how many fights have you had over there I'm over ten it's like I choose right now first I have my first couple years I was doing like six fights like yeah like like four or five fights and I was getting like super not depressed but like it was a very redundant you know it's like every two months same same technique same position same thing same running same heels it was like and I had like whoa and I was like getting injured everywhere like my elbows were hurt my knuckles were swollen so I'm like I call my wife and I call dad after train was like can we just take a break okay and I say now I negotiated like a very good contract with that we'll see and they take care of me so I am able to take we know one or two fights a year so what how many fights have you had total I would say I would have to check her I think Wikipedia has it like maybe 12 something like that but then yeah yeah yeah class this year only fight once and so your your it's better you think yeah do it that way I'm still like it's like a dog on a leash with a I'm hungry to go fight right and I actually have a they fight like once every two months they fight very a lot right there means and I feel at one guy she fights for time this month like a young young Burmese fighter he fights four times Wow but I feel like I have a unwillingly I'm happy with it but like ambassador right so I have yes not only for the support for the country too right so I have to do a lot of other work so right now I'm working on my online academy people can learn let's wave via videos I need to film like a lot of videos you are really famous in Myanmar right like someone's home what told me that your wedding 30 million people watched your wedding television they're more than that I think but yeah that's fucking insane it was so the story that I look so now we go back to the story when we when I when I went to over after prison fight I went to miyamura then after after I didn't even talk about the prison fight we kind of scaled over it I mean I won like no man I think the more important is the let's wait part so then I okay I just I will talk about it because that was my connection to the promoter then the promoter guts gets me tool its way and then III like beat up to two and then I get right away challenge by a term in the open wait so like that the best in the country when you open wide champion the best in the world inlet or right the biggest and the strongest so he's a third fourth five generation with we fight his grandfather was with and they were all golden belts winners right so the is born and ended like if you look where he lives it's wrong and it's the hut it's in the jungle and he's he's raised in the headbutt culture like you know he's an animal he's a headhunter he just goes for the head and he he has a good right hand so I'm like and I knew right away after that fight with to to he was fighting down like two so we I go shake it hand he doesn't know yes and no in English that's how bad he is and I as a good fight you just give me a head mouth and I need that we're gonna meet so we meet and yeah and then why was I going with this basically we what was your question Joe you said I bear with the first fight that's I think it's important to talk about this because I was my second let's we fight ever right and I'm fighting the best legends in a row yeah exactly yeah so I'm like they want again like oh two two two two didn't get him so let's get to tormenta to fuck him up right so I go back to I was I was at Tiger at the time and that was you know we'll go back to this later but I was they were laughing at me because I was doing head butts on their bags and they were it was all a big show every time I was doing head butts right like oh look at Dave doing this look I had to teach this guy with 300 my mind my my coach at a time iPad holder at the time I had to teach him how to hold pads for head butts and that's how when I developed a bit the way to do you know jab cross hook head butt elbow and stuff like that so then they're laughing okay cool I don't care I'm winning fights I go there and first fight that's the hard part man like I the first round the first couple rounds of three rounds II I keep I I push kick his stomach and he grabs it and he he's through smarter like many times so I actually section my the back of my leg like it was I had to do physio like my nerves I think I'm in the back of my right leg was sex session maybe not section but like severely damaged okay so yeah section would be pretty bad so what do they mean by section does he mean like tear yeah it was like and damage is that from kicking you back because he did it many times in the same spot sorry on my the back of my knee okay which there's a lot of nurse he's catching your tip kick and then kicking your other leg yes okay so then many times and I know it's tearing yeah yeah and I don't worry I'm like what fuck like because I want to go inside I want to do my elbows and I can't because I and so then adaptation I think is key in life as well right needed to do to adapt and for that so again this guy is 70 fights you know yeah like all my chaos is just smashing everyone and then I I started at that thing I went I went to the leg instead push kick to the leg instead of me and that he couldn't catch it anymore and then it was it was making buckle up so that was a big big thing in my you're hitting him above the thigh hyperextending the knee and you can't Kate in so you either bull they call him the bull so he goes inside he can't he can't go inside if I'm pushing his leg too much he's are having a hard time and he's gassing out a little bit because he's give is usually knocks him out in the first round he goes far right so then I'm like I kind of I knocked him out a couple of times like knocked him down a couple times at the end of the fight so it was a real draw right it was a real draw so we ended up the first fight as a draw but then right away I automatically match we fight you again how long two months two months and then leg is fucked up yeah so that but then was it was just it was an added sweetener that was again I'm I'm very emotional today I have goosebumps because it changed my life adieu basically it was if you win this fight it's gonna be it's December 2011 2016 if you win this fight you're gonna pay for your wedding and it's for the golden belt so the other one was only a challenge fight you know but when the only like this was actually for like you can it's for the title fight so I got two draws and now it's like title fight so I'm like let's go I trained and I trained hard and yeah we go we meet up again and now I because I proposed I mean I proposed the arena after the other fight and began about if you have a chance to go there beautiful ten thousand temples UNESCO protected temples and you could at 5:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. and you see the sunrise on those like temples and like there's a hot air balloon it's beautiful so I proposed at arena in Russian I had learned my script in Russian and she says yes I don't know how I tricked her to to to love me but so we go there but then he makes the news to me am i right so they've engaged in began so then the promoter calls me so hey you got that fight in December if you win we you want to get married in Myanmar so yeah so he's gonna be an EMR traditional wedding so full gold with like like I'll sue pictures it's pretty cool but I said but it's gonna be like we're gonna make an event out of this so you obviously it's not stupid the guy pays 20 grand but he's gonna make an he's gonna he's gonna you know they help you help Conor whatever like do you want to build a fire sure so it's live on TV and it's a BBC freaking everything so I had a lot of pressure I had to win I don't want my wife them because their wedding was gonna happen regardless rightly but this could be a better way yeah that's not the most glamorous one maybe there's another one cool not this one ever yeah pretty cool so you have Irina Korova and David Lisak in Burmese language that was pictures from BBC look at my hat maybe Jamie can go on the left and maybe you can see the Hat this one yeah look I have like a hat called I don't know the name but when you see my my my skirt it's got a little on g-ronn G so this no this is everybody in me amor has that it's also in India in India recall that the longi engine me I'm already called longji most comfortable thing in the world you were that it's just like a kilt I have one for you you have one for me it's directly from Myanmar it fits that little tiny bag yeah yeah so you're gonna look it's like a long thing this is directly from Burma and basically yeah it's so it's like a kilt it's like a kilt no a kilt would be me right and this is lower this one is all the way down all the way down the ground and have a story for that okay this actually like I don't give you it that's a dollar a dollar yeah so these guys were underwear under this are they free ballin commando now they wear underwear okay but then the story with this and we'll go back to the fight guys this is that people wear that very comfortable but then when the when like war happens you put it up and it looks like it almost like a diaper right and you can kick because this you can't kick with this oh I say mess it up and then show off your your your leg that's because they have a big tradition of leg tattoos oh that's where you get all your tattoos and your legs you have to come from being over there yeah okay yeah so it is waited I waited before having them because I wanted to make sure I deserve them okay and basically so I like that because when you don't know who's a fighter made unless you see at your face but then let's say that the war was happening boom everybody gets their lungi up and they're ready for a battle and you see oh he's a fighter oh he's a fighter oh he's a fighter right cuz the legs are tied it up got back in the days everybody had every fighter that was fighting it we had the toquyen it's gone okay so they went back to the fire yes so because we're doing a big 101 about me Amara now every it's so many things to talk about so the fight and then I started actually had a kid need into TV following me for that fights and he usually told me that David when we follow somebody the guy never wins but I was like pretty happy so I ended up get him like a takedown I'm bloody I get more than elbow in the face is his head is like open up a pretty big gap in the head he's bleeding and then I get a takedown but I'm using a lot of my teeth this time and like he bucks a limb up and I think I the leg is there legs are not going too well and then I do a takedown and he like he falls on his leg and then he has to use his timeout so yeah they bring him back and he's a looks in pain and I tell my corner and I'm a bit like I'm bleeding because you got me - cut - that's that's also pretty rare but I'm and and then I'm here I said which leg is it which leg is it and my corner had times like it's the it's the right leg so okay so I'm like I can any the two minutes ends up he goes back he's like he looks limping a little bit something I'm attacking the right leg so I try I try to hit it but he's and then I do another takedown and he's bleeding more than not long after that it was over he was able to get up alright so and actually when he fell down it is a beautiful it was a pretty intense moment he fells down and right in front of the kingdom dick AT&T V crew and the blood like leaks on the floor and it's pretty intense like pretty cool pretty cool because I'm excited about this because like there's not a lot of good quality of videos about you know right so is that available online yeah me pull that up I mean if you if you go to my like I don't YouTube or something you could probably see the thing about what we're talking about so this makes you the golden belt chain exactly this is a giant moment for you and this also spreads the word about that way in Canada well not automatically right because it happens in Myanmar right so and then but then Myanmar it's just becoming like crazy people then we get married live on TV two days after the fight so so it's like literally there cuz now they don't resent you for beating up the champion now well okay a little bit because he's representing the entire Muslim community in Myanmar and I'm basically without even because I don't adhere to anything but like basically I'm representing all like the 95% which is like Christian Buddhist and in like everybody else basically so yeah yeah they were so happy they were pretty excited because I think they knew that what was gonna happen like we're gonna promote their culture abroad yeah yeah yeah so they're just happy people are promoting the sport yeah yeah yeah is it hard to find Jamie yeah yeah actually maybe Google like new champion I don't know but it's a it's a so that was a big moment that now when you look at the level of fighters from that way versus moita yeah obviously this is more more more time there's more fighters yeah yeah what is the level life while obviously the guys are fucking like everybody was like Russians prior to coming they were coming and fighting it was to train with stopping them all the time and if you look at like if you look at all the fights I they they're if they're smashing everyone bare-knuckle because people are not used to fry is this arena I've done that's not that's not one but yeah if you go honest that's that's one of the that's another fight I fight at a guy what happened Jim I think I always find this there's another one the more important but yeah the guys are like they what I was gonna get out of you've seen the level rise with all these new fighters getting into the game well as like for example day that was like you know the lumpini champion came to Myanmar and all the X I I don't know you know a Muay Thai like sai-yuk you know this guy I've heard the name yes he's like a dump in a champion or I think he's former worst Stadium yeah so you went to me I'm are many times to fight and he drawed within 2 min and all these so he's just considered one of the best muthaiya fighter ever right and what is the difference like when when Thai fighters come over there what what gets in their way like well that's the terms they're very technical and that brings me up to something else but basically a very technical and they do very well for the first couple of rounds but then when the pain threshold starts to kick in when they started to clinch and then to get ahead but there's no what's happening here right and and that's that's good that he asked me this if you look at me amar you know and then Thailand to neighboring country they were fighting for thousand of years old and if you look at the back and it is the tongue to Empire I think know the exact date but at that time the Burmese Empire was like all the Southeast Asia the biggest Empire in Southeast Asia so they were owning all of Thailand almost like Chiang Mai all these things like you know I'm not sure if yet Nam and Laos all these things so it was very very powerful so that's why they say that literal is the ancestor of all the Mui Mui Lao mo Chou Muay Thai you know because it makes sense they were while they were owning all these colonies right they were dropping their seeds of their martial arts so then as the retreat eventually pushed him away and they became you know Burma as we as we go we have another starting a thing called Muay Boran yeah I'm Tyler so then but then it's very suspicious like how come you have that sport now with no gloves and headbutts Muay Boran is that yeah and you know but but you record lies for a long time by little by me all right so then basically their version of yeah and they added big ropes instead of doing bare knuckle let's wait it was only a bit of cause they added big ropes right so then that but at one point the king of Thailand did a great thing to attract tourism which removed the headbutt and adding a scoring system and added gloves a towns love and a beautiful intricate and it becomes beautiful Muay Thai as we know very very you know technical very nice but then and then what happened is that if I let's say your your Muay Thai guys hey you have Big Al's a towns love and you borrow if you punch you don't score a lot of points you know it's it's it's elbows and knees and kicks that score points so what's going to happen over hundreds of years the guys are going to practice their kicks and it because I think the Tigers are the strongest kickers in the world I believe and yeah so so then if you go across in me I'm are lay by the way guys no gloves no scoring system and if you if you scale only to win they swing for the freakin fence right so that's the two different type of so you have weightless kicks inlets way because you pretty viralize you prefer like you know no gloves cuz you can draw blood right away with a punch makes sense so yeah it's just a history course have you thought about fighting more and more time or maybe even fighting MMA or do you yeah yeah but not Muay Thai though and I'm like I've done it I don't want to do it again how come well I represented it to it yeah so you enjoy it more yes it's freeing you know like you can do head butts there's no love I don't I don't want to put on like DIA I would consider it maybe I mean I have offers but one championship and billets were okay I was actually with Kong the other day in San Jose currently for those on who is a legend of martial arts anda a specialist and he actually called Scott Coker in front of me is like get him a fight like I said well give me a couple years I have a lot of things to do that I want to be happy with my literate career you know more things to do but so possibly hold you now 27:27 so you you're still young I mean you could make that transition yeah into MMA then wanted to we can go we can go to this actually actually fight Mme two times yeah I I was I was so I was stupid I was younger so in that transition before going to prison fight it's her after present fight but like in that transition like I had a year or two before raising enough money to go back and like I said my first love was grappling right so I was doing I did some fight nights amateur MMA and I was I was when I first MMA fight by guillotine and then I went the air again and under guillotine so they gave me like the octopus together I'm joking guys and then third fight was against GSP prodigy like a Japanese guy so I went by decision so I was undefeated in MMA in amateur but then I go I go back from Thailand I'm super excited I'm doing my striking and I added some super decision like nobody wanted to fight the moon he's a good fighter he's a good fighter and he was a new journey of see now what's his name Jonathan Mooney he fought Kobe Kovac in not long ago and so nobody want to fight him and you know he was like I know it's gonna be a striking fight they see people saying he was a great striker so let's go I'm the best striker so let's do something so nobody nobody was except in the fight so I accept the fight but I think it was a bit early for my pretty view he was already on the Raider for UFC right so I took the fight at 170 but I was 170 so he was a big boy and I think he dropped down to like from 190 and but then on the feet I'm like I'm winning I'm doing some good spinning keep spinning punches and everything but then Furious is in his corner and he's like down bring him down so I just stupid I went on the I went on the floor and for me I treated as a more as a BJJ competition so when I'm on the floor I'm on the floor you know III wasn't aware I wasn't very developed yet I didn't have the ring experience yet and again it was the better fighter that that night for sure I almost had the armbar actually and I let it go and the referee I virtually stopped the fight because of elbows and in the clinch and in the in the guard but I yeah it was a bit disappointed for this and so it was just a bad you know initial in early in my career now I'm a completely different fighter I fight you know in front of thousands of people I've have so again he's a great fighter but I know that I would it would be a different thing but it's crazy that you you became this let weight champion without really training that way like you didn't really go to a traditional that way gym or learn it from them you basically had your own approach everything together yeah yeah I think so I think it's like I said battle martial arts in my in my in Canada we we do a lot of like you know science and uh and a lot of seneschal and my Kosovo Pat is he did like to to pro fights but he's a great coach he's a very great coach and he just build me up for it because in G kundo he's a seafood right so you can do it as a lot of in the in the pocket there's a lot of head butts actually stuff every tour you know everything goes yeah so yeah I guess that's why I kind of did everything what what do you want to do as far as your career do you want to establish some sort of dominance and let way before you leave and go do something else well to be honest the only reason why I want I would consider go back to MMA would be because I have ego I think all fighters have you go and I want to fucking avenge my loss and stuff like that so but honestly I'm super happy with doing this as I my goal was to be champion now I've done it's I don't need 2000 bells to be happy you know right so but now you do how long doing this yeah I think you just mean basically you're the beacon right now a lot of people are going drawn to you because you become the most really the most worldwide famous left away fighter ever and because of that you're gonna get these guys that come like the Seth paczynski Xand guys who have fought other organizations and come to you is that what you would like to do is love that just be that guy and have everybody come to you and challenging yeah until like I'm I'm I don't have that that hungriness anymore if it would be nice if there was broadcast of this past now is it my last fight was said was on yes sir - yes he prepares everything no it was from promote the trend they transmitted from wow wow that's incredible who's doing the commentary it's out Robin black Oh Robin it was good that was it was epic with this one you know he's excellent he's excellent so actually next one hopefully can make it it would be in what you do Rio meeting our floor when is it gonna be June 100% in June remember sighs I don't know which state though okay so there's plenty of time between now and then do you know who you'd be fighting no no no idea so if it's gonna be they're probably gonna try to do it on pay-per-view or something right is it doesn't have anything to do with the bare-knuckle fighting guys doing it differently I UFC fight pass I believe and then people can watch it live there it's gonna be pretty exciting too like it's the first historico view of the tweet yeah 2,000 years old you know sport in the US I'm so excited that is very exciting yeah it's it's very you know it's like there's different styles of MMA rather of martial arts that enter into MMA and become effective let way the only thing that's missing is the head butts from MMA you know you have this one element of your game that you wouldn't really be able to I said that you know what I was joking that a long cut before I received these these serious offers for murder and memory promotion I was like if I go one day I'm just gonna headbutt the guy and get disqualified and then it's gonna go viral it's gonna help that's before I think one Fc would probably allow head butts from either way when if C is actually partnered up with WLC they're there they're very friend with the CEO that's the things that make sense yeah and what makes sense because they allow soccer kicks on the ground even inside a kid he actually had a little exhibit in that exhibition fight but led to a super fight one inside of one of their shows in one real an EMR oh that makes sense just to showcase the culture sure sure yeah I just see if I feel like if someone like you fought over there I mean they have such open rules I mean they have more Thai fights with MMA gloves they have regular kickboxing they have regular movie message me for that they wanted me to fight Muay Thai I don't I want to I said I want to file a Twitter well even if I look to it go to CC and that's when we started getting a long way well they're doing grappling competitions in one Fc as well they they seem to be open to almost any marshal yeah yeah for sure and also eSports now like that's the future why he's a good shot tree is a good fight is a good doing eSports yeah I saw that one eSports no he's ahead of the wave yeah because it's gonna be the future wow what games I don't know what fighting this games like street fighting games oh my god if it became huge would they have the UFC in 1 FC 5 the UFC no but I mean if they had the UFC videogame okay we're playing the UFC video game on this fort in in 1 FC that would be hilarious I really would yeah oh my God look at that that's eSport yes oh shit okay one championship launches Asia's biggest eSport World Championship at Ruiz is just a smart visionary for this like yeah well you're the size that have fucking arena that there's nothing shocks me more than the massive popularity of eSports in terms of as a spectator sport not in terms of people playing it I get a total price like five hundred thousand dollars and lake for eSports so they don't go to the other side go there side Jamie let me see that picture look at that oh my look at that that's a game fucking crazy the Warcraft I don't know is that what it is yeah yeah I know de to this game I don't play so we don't even know the game in the window half a million dollars for this there's like 14 years old 15 years old these guys yeah I mean there's real money and video games down before we're parents would say you're wasting your time go play golf you can make money you can make money playing video game you play games I do but I get addicted to yeah I have real playing like like a day non-stop uh you have fucking giant problems we set up a landing where you're laughing it's true he knows yeah I'm gonna see how much you guys gonna tell you but yeah real problem are you an extremist like if you do something you do it like yeah I got real problems man like look if I want to get good at something my brain it's good because my obsessiveness allows me to really concentrate on excellence okay but the problem is like there's no benefit for me getting really good at quake championship you know that's the game we're playing right was it quake champions your quake champions yeah that's what playing we've got a land room set up back then we play it yeah sweaty hands which okay we're out there playing but I'm just we're just playing but against each other okay for fun yeah man but it's not fun okay the problem is I mean it's a game with this very first person shooter know you've rocket launchers and railgun yeah it's definitely fun don't get me wrong but what's not fun is the amount of time that it takes and how I crazy I get where I'm like in the middle of the night I'm thinking about playing it like it'll be three o'clock the more I've come down here like I gotta do something I've worked out I can't like I'll leave my house I'll come down here to work out it I'll work out the gym and say fuck it let me jump online get out next you know I'm here for four hours just playing awake yes then Jamie knows he's seen it look he's laughing is it like you're Neil Peart is it monsters are real people outs it's you know robots and people with like you know it's cyborgs and shit with crazy outfits on but that's the point is it's a first-person shooter so you're in this 3d environment it's a mouse and a keyboard and you're running down these hallways and it's a lot of strategy involved a lot of fast twitch movement in an aim but it's very very addictive and it's graphically very intent beautiful little boys we are to Patrick yes what's up yeah one of the companies that makes one of the really big eSports games just announced that they're working on their first first-person shooter I think it's their first first-person shooter they did announce the title that just sort of showed a couple things they're working on it's gonna not that you're gonna get back into it but it could get you back into it right there man the product can't do it I had a quick cold turkey we were doing how many months where we're going out of everyday Solid 3 for everyday men hours and hours every day with Jamie like laughs he's like you guys put in more time me and Jeff works here we're playing so much we put in more time in like how it was yeah like in like three or four I had the game on my computer at home for about a year playing it just off and on here and there probably put in like 30 or 40 hours overtime playing they passed me in like three weeks but I had a problem like that with everything with jiu-jitsu Taekwondo with Muay Thai everything that I get into pretty much is a good trait but as long as you can handle it yeah you got to know how to handle it like for me it's like I gotta know when to cut things off if I stop stop stop stop stop so for me with the video games like no cut it out because it was just eating I don't have any time man and I have kids have family and I have three jobs I just don't I don't have a time for these fucking video games but I like them too much no I finally like I'm now I got that my phone on the airplane could be like literally like 20 airplanes is like this last couple weeks oh you play games on your phone like a castle defense I just like I don't have any games on my phone except my kids play games on my phone sometimes I don't have any fuck what are you doing in airplane you just sleep I read okay I read or write I write you know comedy material and stuff I write things about watch a movie maybe but I don't play any games I just I don't I just don't trust myself okay just get to a dick wait yeah yeah you should fucking play it with us sometime my god yeah man I'm telling you it's super dick I think obsession is key for any success yeah and I think every successful people is eccentric a little bit yes I'm fucking weird of yours yeah we're both crazy it gets important yeah yeah I think you have to be crazy to dedicate massive amounts of time to something and be obsessed yeah it's to acquire excellence in anything I believe it requires real genuine obsession where that becomes a primary focus of your life but when you have a finite amount of time like I do yeah cuz I already have a career I have things that I must do but and I don't want to I don't want to slack off and become a bad podcaster and become a bad comedian and fall apart in the other at things that I'm focusing on because I'm focusing on a game let's choose can you imagine yeah I know yeah it doesn't help me see jujitsu helps me yeah like when I train I feel more calm I get better perspective I feel like there's something that I am get I gain and also you can only do it a certain amount of hours a day you can't do jujitsu six hours in a row you can't but you can play video games ten hours in the world twelve you just keep going yeah this guy was like playing video games and they die people die they die they have fucking heart attacks and die it's very very intense like sometimes we leave and I don't even feel good like we leave and I feel all fucked up and you're sat at your you're unhappy about your cell you like why did I do this you wasted a lot of time and also like your system is so taxed because it's so intense you know and we're talking mad shit your service it's a lot of fun did you see that just made me think of this there an article about the amount of calories that Chessmaster burns yes I saw that I was saying like that they lose incredible amounts of weight during these tournaments in there well they're just realizing now that this is a calorie thing that your brain when you're under intense focus your brain burns off a shitload of calories that's why you lose a lot of calories I think you're smart car thank you yeah I really think that that's the same thing video games as well I mean I get out of your mouth fucking exhausted sometimes when we were in those rambling places you should go into that eSport a thing fuck that there's not enough lives to live you know that's why I understand when people say they're bored I'm like how can you be bored there's so many things to do true you know there's so many things you can get obsessed with yeah you know what's your opinion I wanted to pick your brain on that because I'm me my wife we have a pact okay and people are gonna think we're crazy but I don't give a shit we have since we met in 2000 you know 16 and in Thailand we never had a night apart we know nights apart okay and I loved it because I said I don't know we have only one life and I love her too that she's my life partner she's my you know she always believed in me I think she's the reason why I became champion because prior to meeting her I was just no no ambition no nothing you know I mean and then my point is is that the reason behind that is that I wanna you need more coffee yeah yeah I need to I want to spend as much as I can because you don't know if there's something after so what do you think I think you should be happy and if you're happy doing that that's alright I'm you're not for nothing about that I'm super happy with that that's my goal in life is to like to have as much as much time as I can and her but I mean do you think because it's so far it's helping know that this about the afterlife like I'm like I'm them for first like science I think a leads to that we're gonna just cease existing yeah but that's not science honestly okay well science is the study of how the brain works in the study of where you know where the memory is located in what parts of the brain are affected by injury and Studies on fMRI where they're measuring areas of the brain that are active during specific activities that's real science there's no real science about what happens we're not I mean your speculation I mean I buy your physical body I'm so we're gonna just like it's gonna die right and then then my point is I know there's absolutely no science about that but my point is I'm doing speculation is that if we do stop existing we do stop living and breathing what's our essence where is it going right where if is there's an energy there's a spirit what it's so hard that it's so hard to say well no one can really say it's pure speculation and I'm always skeptical of people that think they know for sure nothing happens as much as I'm skeptical people that think for sure they know plenty Givens it's just comforting for some people to have an answer whether it's the lights go out and that's it I mean that's Richard Dawkins perspective oh yeah is it yeah but other people's perspectives I never done psychedelics and it's like he's got this very reductionist perspective scientific based on what we know where he's adamant that if you when you die you die yeah but that's nonsense he doesn't know I mean you don't know I understand that he's a man of science and logic and this is how he likes to frame the world but the reality is no one has any idea and most people don't want to dear to that train of thought because it's very scary well it's also if you've done psychedelic drugs you know that there's a very strange thing that can happen to your brain to your consciousness when it interacts with certain molecules what is that the agenda well some people believe that that is a portal to the afterlife and that what happens when you die in during periods of extreme stress your brain produces psychedelic chemicals we don't know what the what the soul is what is that a real things that are not nonsense we don't know is your consciousness your consciousness is clearly affected by injury injury to the brain and your it's clearly affected by age it's clearly affected by deterioration it's clearly affected by some exogenous chemicals okay but is but is that you or is that something that your your brain is housing I mean what happens when you die does that does it transfer to something else do you does your brain you know house consciousness or does your body house consciousness or is consciousness a part of it and when your brain shuts off there's no activity this is a consciousness seat or you do transcend no one knows I really been Penn & Teller yes what's the big guys name Penn yeah I like is what he said he said we don't know that's the real answer the real answers we don't know yeah anybody's saying other thing that that is I mean I don't know maybe they know something we don't the hope but it's interesting it's interesting to think of you know and there's a lot of people that don't believe that you are the same person every day there's a lot of people that believe that when you go to sleep that you you wake up in the morning and you assume that all of your memories of your life they're accurate and that you are absolutely the person that you were when you went to bed the day before but you don't even know that oh Sh oh that's a great you don't know that you know that you have some memories that you you can call upon unless you record them like you do but even if you record them like who the fuck is recording it are you sure that's you okay I mean are you the same person and be this there's all these ideas of many worlds these quantum physicists like to bring up that there's a bunch of different interactions that are happening simultaneously and that it's so hard to even it's so hard even to even conceive of the possibility of multiple dimensions and then the the possibility of infinite universes the I can see them that we travel back and forth through all these different things and that based on the decisions that you make based on who the fuck knows Oh an infinite number of variables that your life moves in a bunch of different directions you know the idea of an infinite universe also means there's an infinite number of David ladoos out there I know that's what's really crazy there's an infinite number of young Jaime's there's an infinite number of you know fill in the blank Neil deGrasse Tyson's Mike Tyson the Evander Holyfield is an infinite number of them and they're all doing different things it's all slightly different lives how was it when you did that when you did the DMT I've done a bunch of times it's very strange I'm scared of that you should be scared okay I'm scared and what does it look like what does it look like it looks like well it depends on the purity of it when you get it really pure it's almost like a white looking crystal sometimes it's a little bit yellowish it's all more of a yellowish looking crystal it's yeah and you freebase it yeah that's something that our brain creates yes brain produces it that's one of the reasons why your body can bring it back to baseline so quickly your body knows what to do with it it has it it's it's a part of your your whole you know chemical system how did you come by how did you read about this how did you come up with this I don't remember how I first heard of it I think I heard of it listening to Terence Mckenna talk about it I think that was the first thing I ever heard of it and when you know when I first did it I couldn't even believe I couldn't believe that this is a possibility that this that this is something that exists on earth that so many people don't even know about did you like you need to lock the doors when you do it like you need to mean I did it in a you know I did it in in my living room with some friends about 15 twice sorts right it was like a 3-day thing I'm gonna no no okay it feels like forever and then instant it feels like it just happened and it also feels like forever but it's it's very strange it feels like you've been there before when you go there there's one yeah it's like you leave the world you leave this space and you go to some incredible dimension that seems more real than this it's very very dense we think it's like something that people should experience I think that's up to people yeah a good plan I know we have to be careful where we say to people but I understand but yeah I used to think people need to do it I just think people used to think people need to do everything I think you do whatever and also having children there's a lot of people that say you should have children I don't know about that man I think everybody has a different path I think you can be a complete person without ever having children I don't think that that's necessary for me it was very educational it helped me a lot I love it I'm very happy to be a father and a lot but I don't think it's necessary I think you can be a complete person without a lot of experiences I think what's more important is like what kind of experiences are you having with the people that you're around with and are you being fulfilled like if you inherently like inside of you you always wanted to be a chess master but you never pursued it you're gonna have that regret and that longing for something for you at that way if you didn't pursue that if you didn't go after that if you instead decided to get a job in accounting or something like that you would have this longing to do something and I think everyone has a different makeup a different psychological makeup different personnel and different interests and I think there's a lot of people that are interested in things that I have no desire to do and to them it's their whole life and I'm not interested in it at all but I'm not them it's like finding out what it is what it is for you what what is it in your life that attracts you I've been very very very fortunate and one of the things that I've been very fortunate is I um I would say I'm a risk taker but it's more that I don't I don't have any interest in doing safe things okay in terms of like I don't have any interest in like taking an easy job a safe job I know I'm gonna get a paycheck every week that's never interests me yeah that seems like prison yeah I really I've never been able to do it and I always thought that I was a loser because I couldn't do that because other people could work hard but they can get a good job and they would get security I felt like when I was young there's something wrong with me that I couldn't do that because I grew up in New England and then Boston everybody worked hard this is like a hard blue-collar sort of environment wherever I couldn't do it man I couldn't do it these guys all showed up for work every day at 7:00 a.m. I wanted to kill myself a little bit I did a lot of construction gifts and a lot of different small jobs but the reason the same reason why I left because I felt like it was missing something I see the world I wanted to be yes that's you though but look now you're fulfilled you're a fulfilled person you're living your life but that's you or other person that would be torture if you had some guy that really just wants to be a mathematician and someone's like no no no you're gonna go to Myanmar you're gonna be a fuckin left wait champion you'd be like what I'm not head-butting anybody the fuck you're not man better cuz I got a head but you know you're gonna fight in prison what's what I'm not fighting in prison up for the record guys I wasn't incarcerated right was in prison but that you know everyone has their own path some people like you know Alex Honnold is he's the guy who they made that movies free solo about he's the the guy who climbs all these mountains with no ropes oh yeah and he fell and he got disfigured but now it's healing up but he did it no rope how far to fall look I have to shoot a picture he was a bad fall it was about it looked like he got bitten by a dog yeah I guess they look for a rush that's an amazing rush Tim let's get I think so but uh Alex the way he described it he said it's not really a rush he said it's pretty mellow okay because if every if you get a rush like you're in trouble true you know it's like the whole thing but it's obviously there's something about that intense challenge that's appealing to him that doesn't attract me at all not even a little bit I have no fucking desire I don't want to even climb with ropes but this guy loves it did you do bungee before I did you try a bunch no never don't land either now fuck why not some people love it man I get it I get look my friend Andy he's a world champion he's that he holds the world record in flying one of those winged suits my friend Andy stomp that was a goal of mine for a while but he's had a bunch of friends have died man they've had to carry them off the mountain because they fucking hit the ground you know guys who have jumped and then they hear a crash and then they realized that guy just slammed into a fucking tree about there's a really horrible video because slamming into a bridge oh she's trying to go through a bridge he was trying to make it through the gap of a bridge and he misjudge and he slammed right in the bridge while these people were on it filming it you see him come in and just misjudges it and bam he hits the bridge it's horrific man if he has a strong neck he's fine see I think everybody is different some people are put on this life to be a poet some people put on this write to be an author describe put on this life now I mean whoever you are okay how you feel what is what is the thing that you're drawn to for some people its architecture they want to build houses they're fascinated by the construction methods they're fascinated by design and they're just really drawn to want to build houses yeah some people want to make music some people are drawn to lyrics and they're drawn to musical notes and bars and changes and that's their thing everybody has a mean some people have many things you know and then something something for some people that's their problem is they have so many things it's hard to focus on one but really the key I think the happiness is life is fight being honest with yourself and finding whatever it is that's attractive to you yeah whatever it is it draws you whether it's animation or sculpture or making clothes but it's everyone has a thing while you were talking there I felt like I was another dimension I felt like it was like I lost myself really yeah that's the effect I was on I was like I don't know I'm thinking I think I'm I think I'm crazy yeah you're definitely crazy to be really great like you're like you're doing something and then you have the feeling like you don't know I don't know you carried away yeah you're getting carried away and the thoughts yeah I have that all the time that it's a crazy life yeah it is a crazy life but it's a really crazy life if you follow your passions yeah and it's a fucking crazy boring life if you don't well said and there's a lot of people out there that unfortunately whether it's their family yeah sometimes your family they'll try to influence you in a way to get you to do something that's safer I mean my own family did that there was always trying to get me to big one was graduate from college graduate from university get a degree you know have a safe you know don't just try to hide you do comedy because I know Gary Vee is a big proponent of that like you know quit school and I might and how do you do like because a lot people are stuck with the parents think so you just said fuck it I'm gonna do it regardless yeah I think my parents gave up on trying to control me very young you know like they didn't even want me to do martial arts when I started doing martial arts when start really heavily when I was fifteen I started when I was fourteen but really heavily when I was fifteen that's when I just became obsessed with Taekwondo and competing and and you know at first they didn't want me to do it but then that was like the first thing that I ever did that made me feel like I wasn't a loser ya know I was like the first thing that ever did that I got really good at like good at and like started getting recognition from it and started winning tournaments and then I realized like wow if I focus on something and become obsessed with something I can get really good at it yeah so that led to learning how to do that in applying that sort of same energy to other things in life you know I think sometimes people just have to find a thing whatever that thing is that really floats your boat and then find the time find the time to pursue it and set up your life so that you have the time to pursue it and now they're scarce elevator if I do this isn't it there's not gonna be income around just a percent and money will come and yes yes everything is possible I think and it's crazy but I know that I kind of lived it it's true you can do it you can do whatever you want well now you do you live in Myanmar no no now we actually we lived in Dubai for a year so we lived in Thailand for three years then we kind of kind of left fermium are for a few a few months what brought you to Dubai's yeah I went to me I'm are few months trying to open a gym so I want open the first lets with gym it's on the ice for now it will happen when they let Circle it with gym but for now this and then like it's very poor rights it's like 50 years behind that line it's it's a it's a beautiful very raw very rich country has not rich like meaning the culture yes and then we kind of got there there's a real-estate bubble there so the place we had was a two-bedroom apartment $2,000 a month whoa in Myanmar and it was not even downtown it was like outside a bit and so I was okay and then electricity cuts happens all the time you need a big-ass generator and and then when it cuts you don't have Wi-Fi I was like my wife she's Russian she she really raised her standards of living and living so I had to I have to I want to give her the best life possible right so then we get a call to do a seminar in Dubai we go there and she's like I reading season is approaching Dave and when it rains I don't wanna I don't wanna be in Myanmar because then everything stops right okay so imagine like and then I I paid a deposit on an apartment before leaving the the seminar so it's like you're in Cleveland and you just you pay for a place because you're there so you wanted to borrow seminar I said all right well stay here for a little bit yeah it was the body's very nice right yeah yeah but it's a bit like for me it's a bit like fake like is everything is a concrete jungle meaning the best way to put it nothing grows there nothing nothing organic there you get the raspberries and the the parish in a few days like it's so late it's the desert really yeah nothing grows yeah but it's cool if you want a party like me waiter you just go there any party and why does Mayweather party in Dubai everybody does rapper I've only been there once Wayans yeah there was a fight there's a fight in Abu Dhabi and we had the weigh-ins and Dubai and we went there for a day but I remember seeing no I didn't go to that one this was several years ago when Anderson Silva fought Demian Maia okay and I remember thinking man this fucking Ferraris everywhere in Lamborghinis and Rolls Royces a lot of money yeah do you buy us a lot of money you know that it's this crazy thing is that you get a nice car like I get us I have a sponsor there I drive cool cars I'm not a drunk McLaren you got a McLaren at me is the my yeah sponsor which one add the three twenty-something yes even know what it is I don't care I'm not a materialist guy like what I found my sandals on the floor like I still round them I don't I don't like I give all my mommy somebody else's it was it was the I had holes in it so I don't I think he actually I really don't care about including like this is a t-shirt from a Noah fan and I anyway I'm not a big very big material so you have a sponsor they gave you a McLaren to drive yeah when I'm there yeah so now we actually left there and then we bye yeah now we bought a place in we have a house that we want to grow there in Cyprus so now we live in Cyprus where site is that's outside of France it's Mediterranean so next to Jordan Egypt Turkey it's like the most Eastern country in Europe in you what brought you there you know what and it was I wasn't Dubai weren't like I don't see we can have kids here it's a bit like you know everybody they're gonna grow with bad values I really it's all about materialistic about link you know everything is about the money you wanna win a car you need to pay like to have that one one one it's a million dollars for that like it's all just bad values I believe from oh you mean their license plates yes 0.11 license plate so it's not enough to have a nice rule source you need to have the one footer oh so that's an extra million that's hilarious they pay a million bucks for license plate what a bunch of dip shits think that is the dumbest fucking thing who gives a fuck what your license plate says a million dollars that's when you're just running out of shit to buy and you start you know like people buy exclusive things there's only three of these purses like well they should make more it's so not important in our human life like it's so not important this the license plate thing is so weird you know they have an issue with that in the United States they have an issue with people from other countries that bring their cars over here okay like really rich people from Saudi Arabia oh yeah they call it Saudi Arabian summer because in summer and Saudi Arabia is so fucking hot that summer bro in America seems like nothing so summer in LA which gets to be 105 degrees they fucking spit on that they laugh at that like that ain't shit yeah so they bring these expensive cars like Lamborghinis and Ferraris has shaved them from the summer and they when they bring them over they bring them over here with Saudi Arabian plates so they have like embassy plates and they have like consulate plates and you know it became an issue in parts of Beverly Hills because like they're not even registered and they're they're not even registered I don't know what the fuck but they're driving these things around like I was at a hotel in Beverly Hills I went to a restaurant there and there was a car that was parked there like a Lamborghini that had a like Saudi Arabian license plate I mean this is crazy mm-hmm like how do you ever Saudi Arabia plate in America how the fuck the guy was saying no it's like the whole thing about license plates it's like it's like a sign of opulence then they're able to ship their vehicle from there not buy a car here and register it here but ship it are you from you drive their own car here that's what they bring it over here on a boat oh my god yeah so they they put they load their shit up on boats have it brought up here they pick it up at the document driving around with Saudi Arabian plates like status I guess there's when you deal with things like oil money I think it gets to this level that you and I will never understand no level of money that just doesn't into it - yeah but like again I'm also a bit grateful because know the highest suicide rate is in trust fund babies people are born with too much and they never worked for it so then they're unhappy so I think it's okay to work for your goals you know you feel more happy with it so to go back to what we said like we just Google with my wife we were in Dubai with this Google so where we want to live so I said what's important for us no snow yeah so we just Google what's the best weather in the world we have we had the luxury to say that so I said cool we googled it it give us Spain Cyprus and Costa Rica Costa Rica is a bit too like bugs yeah monkeys Cyprus so what's it like in Cyprus it's like amazing what languages they speak Greek and English it's it's a Greek and actually Turkish invaded four years ago so half the island is Turkish Wow they took it back from like years ago they set out it's our part of the island so they took half of the island and the other half the the north is all Greek beautiful so did you learn Turkish did I learn Greek no it's English yeah and actually half the people there's a million people in the island that's the country a million people in the country and most of it a Russian so my Russian good house in your wife speak Russian as well she's born there other that helps but actually thought me so uh wow that's you you lived an international life my man the nomads yeah all over the fucking place you to you yeah but so now when you're training are you training you're training in Cyprus do you have yes done my part that's the hard but right now I would like my last training camp I came back to Canada and Montrell coach but Sifu Patrick and we train hard and then now my where am I gonna do my next training camp you know I have to fly maybe it cuz this the high level striking in Turkey you know glory I have a friend that fought and yes sounds like maybe I'm just gonna fly the guy for a month train with me in Cyprus and then fight you know oh but now if the fight is in June in the States I will actually probably do my training camp again with my bad note guys yes I think I will do my training cabin moncelli that's good too because it'll be the spring would be fairly well yeah true I don't want so man I grew up in Boston I get it which is a lot yeah not as cold as Montreal though okay your your area is Quebec is quite a bit colder yeah I remember thinking that Boston was cold and then I went up to Montreal and I was like what the fuck man this is real cold that's next level cold yeah you don't have a Boston accent no I got rid of okay myself on TV I won the bass state games when I was 19 and I heard myself on TV and I was like oh my god that fucking act like Boston Park ha okay where can really had there's like a it's like it's a weird accent it's a strain every accent is we Australia's word - yeah yeah everything I think everything foreign to us is weird but Boston is particularly gross when women have that accent okay it's just like you know some accents are hot with women like English is hot you know George Georgia Texas that are shot Russians hot Boston's gross yeah it's gross you in New York is better than Bob but something about Boston is just like when women have it men can have it it's cool it meant reminds me of my friends I like it yeah I like when I hear that man but I hear on women maybe that's what the problem is it reminds me of girls on a date well that's oh you touched it right there that's where you going hey yeah so when you are that will be definitely your next fight when June June in the states I'm so excited for this you have a lot of time to think about that man we're only here it's not even November yeah November yeah so I didn't actually know I'm in the middle of the look my you said oh my angel I called it the David Lisak experience well I stole the Jimi Hendrix Gary he had before I was born you know I mean Hendrix had the Jimi Hendrix Experience okay in the late sixties it's good yeah good yeah you're you're it's a worldwide brand now it's amazing what you've built it's crazy congratulations thank you I don't know how it happened just happened well you're a personal and you know personable guy everybody loves you deserve it well I think it's uh it's just it's one of those things you just keep doing it if you just keep doing things you just get better at doing it consistency and I need your advice on that because I started to think all this with Tuesday I did thirty five episodes and while I was in Asia and I was killing it and it was pretty cool but then I what is it visit on YouTube yeah YouTube yeah yeah decent amount of views and not your views but is it instructional is it so I was it was when I was doing my first fights I was teaching you know ten watts and about culture and I'm gonna start it again but is it on YouTube right now yeah it's go Andy how to build your hands they might like this one build your hands like it's two-minute video what do you do so it my push-ups I'd it's basically you can do some push up on your knuckle with some likes micro jumps to create something like my get used to fractions yeah and then a finger finger push up for all the tendons the ligaments what you're doing that you're doing it with these knuckles you're not even doing it with the front - yeah I guess it depends I'm doing it if I draw my tricep it would be those - yeah with addresses on the tables hard to see that's the thing about there we always they would always tell you in karate or anything else when you're punching these if you're gonna punch with your knuckle they get hard as shit are using anything - you look on my Kawara or something pounding on something I just do I actually want to save my hand as much as possible riiii-- they're getting so much fucked up for the fights I put my hands in the ice bucket every fight so I just like say them but I do nation but then these and then on the wrists yeah we try these ones yes yeah that's pretty cool it's hard yeah so you have a fingertip push-ups knuckle push-ups and wrists pushing more so this is that's a cool video too though that's that's too - that's me just let this roll Jamie so we could see here some of this yeah so headbutt right there boom boom did Cyrus trying to headbutt you did he couldn't I was it was a one-sided fight completely so he didn't did he prepare for yeah you went to me I'm are before me so that you know he spoke about it last time I think that would mean - that's my fake roundhouse - sighs all right super annoying that's a good move man fake roundhouse your sidekick for especially for a long tall guy like yeah but anyway so that's what else that's the push-ups so do you punch the bag bare-knuckle a lot with no wrist wraps or anything yeah exactly actually that when they see the good quality of view that's Jeff face is that Justin Lee was it was here with Israel these rails personal guy Oh Rhonda Sonia yeah who met - me and Jeff and tiger at the time so I was I missed those high quality videos now I would do it in my phone I think what's interesting because you're one of the only guys that speaks English that's talking about this that's talking about this sport and that competes in this sport as a champion of this sport I mean as far as like the history of the sport you're probably one of the really the only guys is an English speaker that's been a champion yeah so the ligament that the the push-ups on their hands I think it's a very hard way I do it in my seminars people have the hard time doing it and I think it's key because if you do like you fight with no gloves would only have gauze you really can feel you can feel it fucking training yeah basically you know if you hit the teeth or something you need to have you know you don't want to get this because the why starting duties is because I fight in Japan and my second fight in Japan and I was always like a dream of mine because a street fighter alright then supernintendo street fighter Japan you know I was always thinking like either a guy'll they're American or Sega and then yeah that's the one that's on the knuckles so you do some little jumps and the way I'm gonna tell you I think what is that surface is not concrete yeah that's concrete yeah therefore the craziest stuff like this is not it's not very pleasant this one but interesting and you're not using the front two knuckles well I guess yeah I mean the big one touches if you have one in the middle but not the not the far leave when I fight you're right when I fight it's only the big one that pops out anyway I know but and have you broken your hands fighting that way no no I actually that was going there so when I fight in Japan I for a second at the second round I dislocated my finger no it was pretty badly broken dislocated and my corner man he's a former golden belt guy doesn't speak a word of English again and I'm like pop it out so I can at least at least I can close my fist and finish the fight right so he doesn't work doesn't understand nothing and you can see like it's pretty sturdy bad so I ended up fighting the whole fight like this um I couldn't close it so I'm like okay and then but I'm thankfully happened because that was the first fight I landed like my elbows and my first head butts first like solid because you had an injury I had no choice I couldn't do my cross anymore I so elbows head butts at try to pull it out yourself I didn't know at the time I did I tried it but it was the doctor required needed used a lot of force to do it oh I think it wasn't I was so I didn't want to make a big scene out of it because all the Japanese people watching it they knew about it because the commentator was talking about it yeah it's like they David son fingers but my Turkish opponent he didn't know so I was like I don't want to you know so but yeah I was finished a fight and it was a now I'm late and never will happen again I starting training these so what do you do in the offseason so if you're not if you don't have a training camp so if you don't have someone coming to you together and prepared for a fight you never fight until June yeah want to stay sharp so what kind of work you're doing well that's funny after we done today I'm gonna go with gook or I'm gonna do a private with him interested I like I like to stay sharp with this so you learn leg locks and or school apat know martial art is actually affiliated with gook or highest an Academy in Montreal and got go cars Academy is one of the very first around this area and even in the country that was concentrating on leg locks a lot of those guys were killers and a lot guys yeah I think my nigga Brian and I think he trained Rhonda Silva as well and yeah so I really like him and he's I think he's 56 six days still arrested competing still competing Khokar still competes you did like the Masters anyway so I'm gonna go there but I I tried to yeah right now like on the tour special on the tour and I can't even I can't even I did some weights in the hotel everybody we did literally we do a state every day oh wow so you just worn out so tonight we're leaving for Texas then New York then we get back when you get back to Cyprus so what what do you do to stay sharp because you don't have a gym there right yeah do you have a gym that you can earn a place in in the basement we have a full-on gym like private not as cool as you right there not as big but we I have everything I need and then but you don't have sparring partner don't have someone to hold pads yeah I would have I'm gonna I'm gonna because we just literally moved I bought the place I'm gonna go a month ago we drop the luggage and we left for the - that seems so crazy though for a guy who's a world champion and a professional fighter to not be in a place that has professional trainers these fighters right because I want the I I am a big proponent of like I want to really I want to have I want to relax I wanna I want to enjoy life growth with my wife Shore so I feel like this is the best one of the best I mean America is an amazing country but I feel this is the best country like because it's very there's no traffic LA there's a lot of traffic right you think crazy huh so no traffic good food you walk in the streets in Cyprus and you can pick olives literally we made a test olives and I gave it to my wife then a date then a fig then a quanta everything we had about a million fruits in a ten-minute walk it's free on the street just growing off trees yeah organic so I'm like this is cool you know it's it's fresh and it's any also I studied because I wanted to I want to live as long as I can because again we don't know what's gonna happen after so I'm like in Japan one of the islands has one of the highest you know this did I late yes so because there are near a body of water and they have a lot of seafood Brian so I want to be on a body of water and this is an island so yes what sounds like the quality of life is beautiful there but I just the only thing I wasn't going to concern with is done training I know and then and and also sparring partners you know and some of the whole path someone to coach you you know may that's what right now so far it's been amazing like I said I've been in Dubai and yeah all my training camps back in Canada we're good and now you're right after in January we go back I'm gonna fill my Academy like my videos which is also gonna take a big part of it and then I have to stay sharp so I'm gonna have to look around and see what the gyms are I didn't even look at into it yeah I know I know but I'm Turkey has a lot of high-level fighters it's a lot to 30 minutes Leiter's yeah and even wrestlers and a lot of so it's a 30-minute flight to Turkey well I do that yeah and maybe you could fly people they'll come to you but that's yeah one thing it seems like you now that your profile is getting bigger and people would probably more willing to come to you to train to learn and then to train with you just the thing is like I've I realized all right I put on a high high esteem quality of life you know I want a yes fighting is cool but it's I'm 27 and maybe I'm gonna retire at 35 let's say right like I'm gonna do as much as I can but like the rest the other 70 years after that if I live until 105 right there is it it's not gonna be it's gonna be suddenly be I'm not gonna be competing and ring anymore so I valued that a lot that's the biggest part of my life right yeah I've only been fighting professionally favourite since 2013 so but yeah I all the goal 35 is it the goal I think it's perfect good more than that I think you may because I'm actually excited to see when I'm gonna hit 30 my testosterone like you know I'm gonna be stronger at 30 31 32 cuz well you definitely be smarter smarter in terms of life experience you know you have enough I mean they say the best fighters are really in their early 30s because their body is still strong but their experience level is much higher okay so like when you're 20 you're probably you might be stronger or faster but you don't know as much you don't have as much experience you don't your technique is not as sharp and as you get older you just develop more experience as long as you're dedicated and focused yeah but then again the thing that I'm saying is the one thing that I would be concerned with is the lack of time training in a high level environment yeah I think is one of the most crucial things yeah so so far I've not had that problem but when I'll be when I'll be like actually moving there I need to I need to to fly some guys and yeah but you got to let us know when you do fight and it's in the United States will promote it we'll let everybody know and and hopefully you'll have an opponent that yeah people recognize Julie I wanna I wanna I wanna would be a good fight yes I did yeah yeah but it was so what's your okay perfect yeah yeah I actually have something you know Jamie last time you did the the chin long video the you shared a video of two guys kicking the balls over oh yeah yeah yeah that crazy Zwarte it's like it's like volleyball with your feet yeah yeah so this is like it's Southeast Asia and they have that I have the ball with me for you oh what's the ball to use oh that's it wow that's crazy see it that's the ball of the kick yeah and why and you get it looks strong it looks hard but you can headbutts with this oh yeah I'm sure because that's what you do you can use all right yeah traditional Southeast Asia sport sit back taka man it watching those guys is incredible intellect dexterity you know what is the game called again it's Amy amar skull chin alone when they go in circle that's effect Tech draw wow it's amazing watch those guys oh they're playing on a court yeah I've only seen it played like on the video ass and outside oh my god these fucking guys that's incredible look at the fucking flexibility that's insane no oh my god that is incredible um Wow look at this de Foix it look at that kick that's Malaysia wow so it's super popular in Southeast Asia and the reflects it and you can use your head through wow what a sport so they Myanmar like it's part of the culture after every every training we go in a circle and we do that we do that so yes you can you know like oh yeah and your flexibility I'm sure I don't know if you can see on YouTube there's one it's with it's Dave it's in my video it's like David miyamura and I've tried it and I only I can only do my like with my right leg the Hat like a hacky sack and my head but that's it you can see maybe David Miam or something there's in my and yeah there they use the relaxed like crazy and I think it helps you I think become a better fighter I would imagine I mean yeah the leg just the dexterity and flexibility and range of motion yes guys have I mean they're almost like it's like watching a ballerina slash kickboxer play soccer with their feet but they're playing volleyball yeah I mean and this this is plastic yeah usually it's made of a rotten okay you know like some kind of bamboo yeah and yeah and but at first so you know yeah it doesn't hurt right but I I know I'm I can enjoy it like guys time I did a seminar and I actually like I made them play a little bit it's just part of the culture because it's cool yeah it's it's it's pretty wild game and that's a very popular game over there yeah yeah everywhere industry I usually when I'm walking my wife and she's like oh not again I see a couple like you know locals playing and just stop I drop everything I put my laundry up because I always wear my lungi and I start playing with them and they're all excited because oh shit like they do some pictures and so you like a big celebrity over there like they walk down the street do people recognize you yeah yeah yeah they love us there it's pretty cool but I again we I really I really like them they're so kind like honestly travelled in Asia yeah Thailand and that's how I felt everyone was so nice that day well but the imagine like 40 years before that when they were untouched by tourism uh-huh you know even let somnium yeah yeah so they kind of Lichter they shake your hand like look at this yeah that's my video I was I was in the forest the dam and there guy in the in the red was he's sponsored by the country to play that Wow instead we're gonna see that yeah he's good that's a wild fucking game this stuff but that's the laundry you see yeah I tied it up but then you have to lift it up like this it's so cool that he had that that video and you lift it up and then if you have your like that then you show your war war tats right ah I say so then so this is before you I'd like that's - yeah before I look look naked almost Wow yes that's the only strike I can do in I did they play that all the time seems like there's a steep learning curve to this game yeah oh yeah headbutt right there yeah pretty crazy yeah man so that's the can you see the Tanika under skin then yes this is a specific from EMR and it's like it's a route that they break up and the it's good for SPF and it's really and it makes your skin better so it's and so they rub it on their face yes and they have such a like your soft skin it's crazy I think it helps it helps like my skin yeah but
