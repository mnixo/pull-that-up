the girag and experience and I've known you forever I knew you back when you were having a real hard time with stand-up which to me is fascinating because you the only guy that I've ever met that was having like a really hard time with stand-up and then out of nowhere like you hit a switch you went from having a hard time to stand up to being a fucking murderer we would it was almost like you you like you fucking pass through a doorway or something like within two years of you working at the store you just figured it out he's figured it out one night and we were up on stage and we were in the back rather and you were up on stage we were watching you you're like damn Joey Diaz just turned a fucking corner you just figured out how to be funny you figured out who you were up there it's really weird when you are you get into anything there's always that Jesus I'm not improving yeah I'm coming here I'm showing up and this is just isn't working and then one day out of fucking blue pow pow it just starts working and it's really weird with stand-up you don't want to go to sleep you want to go home and keep writing yeah and writing and your I became infatuated from 95-98 but had so many other things going on you know saying that yeah so many fucking things going on that I couldn't really focus focus and then I moved to LA and I had all these distractions you have all these stupid distractions when you first moved to LA in your economic agencies this that there's that and then one day you just something hits you and it goes these motherfuckers don't matter nothing really matters I gotta go up there and speak what's in my heart you just start with going and little by little once you find your voice you become a savage that's in it's like a it's like a shark tasting blood it's like anything else where you get that taste and you just go after it and you know the comedy stores the fucking Comedy Store man once you get in the Comedy Store to me that's like you know John job that's the Comedy Store that's it's his John Jacques Machado if those up a high level that that's it it's a high level but it's especially in the 2000s were down there there was there was some intense comedy that was good something for your conky already coming up there and you coming up there it was a really intense time and you you go on stage you get this weird conference but it's this fucking thing you just get stronger and stronger and the more people you go up in front of because then in the beginning they make you go up in front of people you know you know go on up in front of Mitzi shore is nerve-racking and going on after they put you on after a lot of guys that are really fun yeah you going up in front of Mitzi sure you have no idea what that does to you at the six year mark going up I cannot describe it I've thought about it have written about that experience thousands of times and nothing was more like I blacked out I had a blackout to go from the Mitzi shore because I knew it was it for a gallon man admits he sure turned me down you know what I was going to go back to bold and probably stab one of those motherfuckers it without come on I was just winged getting out now I would have been institutionalized there's no turning back from that it would have crushed my ego her who her taking me gave me another five-year reprieve in my life I knew I got something to do for five more years before I go to jail for killing somebody like that's how I felt did you really feel like you're gonna do that because when I met you I never got that from yeah yeah I was I didn't get that that's what part of the part of the the jump in my comedy was the day I wrote her the letter and I said you can't scare me boy you want to take the kid take the fucking okay what am I gonna fucking wrote your wife is I'm not call her up what they told okay I know you're talking about yeah I told her that it you know that at the end of the day and I was being this you know some people really can't handle truth and sometimes you have to tell him and I had to talk to her and then talk to her again in 99 when I took that change it was around 2000 you met me in 97 it took me about three years but one day in 99 before I went to bed I was cleaning for a couple days maybe three days and I went to bed early and I had my wits to me and I said I'm not gonna fuck with this no more it was one of these things that I was going into the lion's mouth I had a walk on a fine line with her because I wanted to be a part of that kid's life but it wasn't looking that way and I was gonna take a shit no more one morning I got up my son Errol and when he got a calling card like all that motherfucker and I just laid it out to it I told her the opening line was enough forget this that listen between you and I and she knew me I said you know if you own fire would not piss on you we contact I'm having with you is because of this child right so I'll pay for a separate phone in her room I don't have to talk to you no right cuz she wanted what was killing me at that time what she wanted to take and change the child's name right and my position was when my father died my mom remarried my poor dad that died how to keep his fucking name there was just something in my heart so I always felt that that's let her become 18 let her decide what the fuck she wants right that was eaten away I mean when they had no value a name didn't have a value to me in this whole situation didn't have a valley to me once I analyzed it and said fuck this bitch and what she stands for I turned that corner because I dropped luggage off there's nothing sometimes in comedy sometimes in life you're just carrying around some luggage man that doesn't let you move yeah the box is 5 feet but the door is only 3 sorry motherfucker and you got to drop that shit and until you drop that fucking box you ain't gonna go through that door too many people get locked into those relationships whether friendships friendships former ex well you know ex-wife and husband whatever you want to call that relationship exes but they're like two deer with the fucking horns lock together and they can't separate and they fucking every day is a push-pull they fuck with each other on purpose you know I've known people that went through horrible divorces where you know you could tell that like they would they would like be setting up each other like you know fuck him make him pay more you know let's let's agree to one thing and then change the terms just keep it keep the bills coming in and like I've heard people talk like that's it's a horror show it's crazy and it's airing and this is this was the bad end of it Joe that this is two already I had the job in Boulder that paid the most renown educated schmuck like me I was working for a sports advisor and then you can make anywhere from 20 to 60 thousand a football season six but you can make some cash that's insane there were some guys that make a hundred grand I had a month in December I made 25 grand working the fucking phones God you just got to get some fish to bet and send you money believe that your is you're gonna take them through the fucking bowl season listen bro you want to make 50 it's gonna cost you 20 go to Western Union 70 20,000 and we'll talk about selling so they're basically buying your knowledge on your knowledge but you're buying your bullshit it's bad karma also really but this is what I was doing so I knew this I knew this alright I come to LA bits he sure don't past me maybe The Improv passes me my dream was Mitzi sure who the fucker you can my whole thing was the store from day one people told me to go to the fucking store that's your house that was my fate if she turned me down I would have probably gone back to Colorado probably gotten to work over there you know you there you done sets in Seattle you were doing down I couldn't go back to go to Seattle I will go back to Colorado and try to be a dad in one day though I know me one fucking day the car breaks down the snowing out you get one of those bills overdue bill and that's it he bump into this fucking book and he gives you that attitude with his flip-flops on I was gonna run over this motherfucker and I was gonna do 50 fucking years yeah so you know what as much as I the comedy store has that much power in my life your life it came along at the right time came along at the right time do you think the people create that I mean that's like the big big hippie New Age argument about lives that you create these possibilities in life that you you're responsible for all these different events that are happening - they're not random events these are invent events that are sort of created by your own intentions yes do you feel that sometimes absolutely one thing I learned was that until you take responsibility you in a mu fo mm-hmm there's motherfuckers that get off the stage bro the audience sucks the sound yeah yeah I was a guy Egypt the type of shit invented that was never quite fuckin bomb yeah and that's it and everything else and until you come through that you can't really and that was big for me that I believe that yeah listen I go to bed now I go home I put my feet up i watch the news and I go to bed like none you know 20 years ago I didn't go to Beth Leila I had to shut my window a certain way close my door some way and I couldn't leave the light on at night because I owed money to a drug deal I robbed somebody I created all those scenarios I didn't I didn't make that kidnapping up I went there with a gun I knew what I was doing but it's funny that how quick the turnaround was between like 99 you know like it's it all just sort of stopped it all stopped loving and it kept stopping you know it kept stopping kept getting better what you're telling me is that I never did blog get after 2006 that's you're trying to tell me who me that's what you're trying to tell me why I say that don't you say what do you think I'm crazy that's a weirdest way to phrase that sentence that saying so you're telling me I haven't done both so once that one day I saw what they I would look like arguing the chick so one day I went home and just stopped doing bullets you try to tell me nevertheless I want exam I'm saying about being a crow no I'm busting your balls I can't believe what I'm fucking telling you that's night 2006 one day I went home Brian one day I went home and just stop doing cocaine no rehab no hug I didn't call nobody I didn't pierce my ear I didn't give my life to our channel oppa game there was nothing shit hope okay whatever the fuck that shit is he never died was nothing whatever the Faubourg a fucking shit so my point is that was I dropped I kept dropping the pain that I had and that luggage that I had I forced it out I just didn't fucking stop doing drugs I overcame whatever was making me do those behind drugs Society wasn't making me do drugs Obamacare for these that they found heroin in the Bronx with Obama campbellot Boston Massachusetts Danna hysteric it said Obamacare on it without heroin Obamacare people were just we create everything in a lot of ways you know this is random things I broke this sometimes people wake up on the wrong side of fucking bed they come at you and you understand your fucking ground then you gotta say no bitch and people get their feelings hurt yes but no I created a lot of shit that happened in my life there's no fucking way you also have to stop silliness or it'll invade your life and ruin the quality of life like if you don't get upset at people sometimes there's times where people are infringing on your happiness their little shit that bullshit or any like listen man you need to learn your own for your own good you need to learn that what you're doing is like socially unacceptable you're passing it off on other people you're passing off this shitty reality that you're trying to promote something you can get locked in a person like that as we're saying before with like bad relationships and then all sudden like every day you're dealing with this person's nonsense distortions and lies and you can never trust like who was your fault never your fault right and it's never your fault it's always somebody else's fault and when you deal with people like that on a regular basis and you communicate with people like that it makes it incredibly difficult for you to live your life because you're constantly you're constantly like debating or dismissing bullshit like is this bullshit might be bullshit then that somewhere along the line you realize well fuck this man I got to stop hanging out with this person it's persons an asshole you know that person doesn't give a fuck about the truth they don't give a fuck about me they just and I've had a few of those in my life and you just cut them loose and when you cut them loose like you're a way better person you're like your life is free and easy like oh it's not that I'm like constantly engaged in conflict it's that if you surround yourself with the wrong kind of people you will be constantly engaged in conflict whether you want it or whether you have that intention or not like it's not just about having the right intentions you got to make the right choices as to who you put in your world because if you put a bunch of shitheads that don't care about evolving they don't care about getting it together and all they're trying to do is pass off their nonsense on you oh you got a fucking you got a shitty Road you got a shitty road ahead of you you know I used to love guns I the gun nut like your buddy but I love guns I loved having them I love them and the same thing one day I was like and we thought my carry gun there's a problem let's put that out there almost right it's like a magnet for other guns and you're not the only one that says that it's like a magnet I'm telling you what I carry the gun I carry the gun for a very short time because I didn't like it I didn't see the purpose for it it's a nice thing to use to try to be a tough guy but all it's going to do is get you in fucking trouble because you pull that motherfucker out twenty motherfuckers gonna pull them on you that real tough guys and I knew that going in I fucking knew it I wanted to fire it at somebody but I'll tell you what man it was amazing how I used to go home and I know what the fuck just happened to it why did I have to go for my reach of my gun filler why were there six other people in the room and a coke party with guns because guns attracted but they're like fucking magnets and one day I got rid of all those guns it was like I lost 80 fucking pounds of drama Wow same thing 10 years ago this phone would be ringing with people that were asking me questions about you know how do you get roadwork you know why don't you take me on the fucking Road you know you get all these fucking people calling you with these questions and at the same time they have no concern for you they really don't they're just trying to pull you down especially in this fucked-up town if you let people pull you down be I I don't know what you're doing it's not happening for me what do you what do you want me to do you got it right and get on stage every fucking night what'd you do ask me wrong went to my sister's wedding well go fuck your mother then go to the fucking wedding you were one of the last guys that picking that out - yeah it burns my fucking core that people come up to you and put their lack of V I thought I saw somebody but I started Comi with at the store thirteen years ago I was going to screen some stupid movie that my buddy resent my wife was sleep I said let me go down there and as I was walking around the corner I heard Joey and I went up I go I didn't know what and he was telling me what he was doing in front of there how he was working here about this what he was telling me you know what he was doing there he was where he was working and I drove back to fucking Studio City with like tears in my eyes because he had every opportunity I had he was a good-looking newly worthless fucking town but to him he used to go to the store and drink and everything was iie and now I'm supposed to feel guilty on the fucking 101 cuz his fucking Schmucks got a job working til fucking 2:00 in the morning parking cars or something you know I mean we all had the same opportunities here well there's people that feel like those people in your life to teach you that lesson see people fail and have regrets and see people not give a hundred percent or not give it all their focus or give it all their honesty you know give it give it who the fuck you really are we see those people and that regret is almost there to let us know like don't ever let that happening as I was getting in my car he made a Chloe and he was one of those guys always had to have that one comment at the store hmm they may like a fucking comment I just when he say some about something it must have been nice doing blow all those years like something just you know saying like he's one of those guys that he's gonna put you down right he had a and I just got the call and I said you know this is why that guy's parking cars yeah and you know I'm on the fucking road work and at least try to make things happen this is why this guy's bought him fucking car there was a guy that we I want to mention his name but you you'd warned me about him a long time ago long before it ever went real bad for him and then one time I was back in the East Coast and the guy had done comedy fucking a couple of years and he's like trying to get a hold of me to open up for me like what you just you just gotta get back on stage after a couple years and open up at the big show like really that's what you're gonna do are you fuckin mine like what kind of weird request is that you have a none comedy in two years you want to go up in in front of a sold-out club like that's that's ridiculous like why would you think that you could just do that like you get but that's what they there's a lot of guys that didn't make it in comedy that felt like they didn't make it because nobody helped them and I've heard that so many times I've heard that stupid argument like I wasn't in the right group or if you're not even with the right group it's very hard to get road work like what are you talking about what do all you have to do is be funny if you're funny people find you it's it's one of the easiest businesses of all time you get proven on stage for sure easiest to understand this is how easy it works you go onstage you get two people to laugh people notice then they start offering you work it's that simple when you prove that you have a certain amount of time and you proved you can consistently perform really well people want to give you some work they give you a little hear they give you a little there you make some connections you start networking the next thing you know you start you know moving in your area a little bit getting a few gigs here and there and it takes fucking years and you got to keep doing it if you don't keep doing it then you really didn't want to do it but if you do keep doing it you get to a point where you're Joey Diaz and if you're one of those guys that didn't really want to do it and one day you see Joey Diaz and you say almost been good fuck do coke all those years who you're there you're like a living lesson like that guy's like a little little stop on your job broke my foot book it broke my heart of the drive home I was like wow and when I had the same opportunities we both walked into that store he used to get spots he was good he was decent yeah yes show potential whatever 9 o'clock spots couple belly room spots and now you're out here fucking the 11 o'clock at night and you're like wow
