the Joe Rogan experience strain by Joe Rogan podcast by night all day [Music] baby and we're live in paradise ladies and gentlemen to my left powerful bit O'Brien lad how are you wonderful top of the morning to you is less powerful Sam's lost the major of the great basta huntin booth to his left powerful John Dudley Archer extraordinaire and teacher of many great people and to his left big wave surfer Shane Dorian we're all here in the nine we've been on this epic bow hunting trip and we figured we de gr√¢ce you fine folks with a podcast we've had a call little beverages we're out here enjoying the beach and having a great fucking time boys an amazing time pair can't say enough about it what are you Instagram England or John Dudley's insta storing this we're going to do what's called swap cast so this will be available on my podcast and John will get a copy of it too so it'll be on knock on which is the premier archery podcast if you're not listening it's probably not really swinging arrows are you well they'll swing it just not doing correctly I had a had a guy and he tagged me you and cam in this picture and he had evade ahoy type of both you saw that picture but he tagged us both and he was holding up this pup and he said it's a pup get about ready to get F and serious and he I mean this guy never shot he finally got one off the you Bay Rd the JRE listeners they are getting into some bows so ebay low prices are going up neighbors insurance policies are also going up there's a lot of dogs that are high down to the porch and the bass note and based on this hunt error prices broadly try to get we're all going out so let's explain this place because this place is a chain you talked about it on my podcast and it is maybe the epic bow hunting destination on the planet Earth the gaps going to be out of the bag after everybody here is on that's the problem right this should shut up we should say listen whatever you do don't go to Lanai as it sucks people are not friendly the weather sucks it's ugly to look at there's no deer just zero deer they're out they ran out of beer like two days ago they ran out of beer Mill is gone and the Killman comes in once a month and they bring in a rowboat it's just in shooter size yeah and an angry sailor drops it off at the beach yeah just to go get it yeah it is like one of those tricky things where it's like you have to you have to like think of how much do I really want to talk about this well if you're a hunter you appreciate it if you're not a hunter in what the hell it's Google talk about it but it's you know when I came when I flew in I actually asked a guy on the plane I said is there any cool places to like trying to surf I said because I'm actually wanting to get some lessons on how to surf and the guy said well I don't know if you're going to have anyone good to teach you on this island I said well I've got a pretty good guy coming in and he said well if there are good waves no one here would actually tell you where they are it's relevant to what we're doing right yeah I mean you have a good thing that's a problem analyst you want to tell everyone how cool it was this is him what's that guy's name he had shout out his name wouldn't say your friend Gavin your friend Gavin analyst buffer sir hilarious good for him yeah your cowboy with the bow yeah well friends gather 50% beauty as a writer yeah Gavin just gave you a big shout out bro as for getting in archery that's legit don't shoot your neighbor or though yeah definitely go to a safe area well there's not a dust really a problem there's not enough safe areas I mean you would think that la with a place as 20 million plus people plus Mexicans I think there's is this shit to the numbers like how many humans there should be more archery spots there's a few spots there's like maybe in the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area this might be four or five impact archery is a big spot you go down there right at San Diego I go to prom yeah it's running one call performance Archer Oh performant where's impact with all again what's in cock archery can impact is a traffic named mad once laws that Vegas yeah that's bomb bra oh ok performance is that the Vegas spot this is a terrible time to like really pin you down I would Google it but we're recording this podcast and my phone I think that's the place we go to in Vegas I'm pretty sure it is I don't fact I mean feel free to get impact archery in Vegas burger I live in Austin Texas we got one bow shot before thing yeah I think you have a new place though right just marry spot sorry your country it's been around for awhile but son a new ownership it's pretty crazy pretty good but I mean this milling do you not have the Google app here I'm looking at your phone I'm so confused cuz I'm used to my phone just go to Safari look nice on the top that's the mess okay people are arguing anyone goes isn't listening really in Joe Rogan's rim yes making out there's a pair of binoculars here they suck which actually suck yeah but we're looking if we look across that way like two thousand watt how many miles to six thousand miles fifty thousand miles yeah I'm sure glad we have shane dorian in here because he's he's got the tree logistics last night we had an amazing beach cookout if i can't say enough about that we probably should tell without really given the whole motion but i details how this became a thing like how the hunt oh game yeah we're a conversation begins again i'm gonna play this because okay let us deficit yesterday so here I'll go to go way back waiting for this what you're about to hear and we apologize for what you're out here Jane and I hunted together in New Zealand last year yeah around this time and as we're pulling around the deal and hunting he mentions like what we're talking about Hawaii were talking about elk hunting we're just kind of covering all the best spots in the world he said something to me like when I is the best deer hunting you'll ever find weight bar none there's nothing different and you're like bullshit and I'll bullshit wouldn't check it out I'm checking it out and then you said the same thing on his podcast and then and Dudley heard the same thing so Dudley and Joe and I were having a nice dinner in Vegas yeah lovely dinner with Joe's friend a nice Tom shout-out to Andy for crashing her dinner in the most epic way possible so we're having dinner Andy orders about mmm I want to say half a dozen tequila shots we get a little bit excited any other any words a half dozen more tequila and any finishes are off with six more asakusa so at that point we came up with this this was actually our face time to change oriented then we've really really didn't answer so we actually recorded we wanted to send a message so here was the message to shane dorian listening to that while fairly sober it's amazing how slow my voice was i was clearly like if i was talking to a cop but i would just about the college threw me right in jail you were wrestling those syllables like a crocodile crocodile the two grippy it would be more like a some sort of a climbing eel I had this someone sent me this message on my phone years ago it was a cartoon they redid they cut the original remember the Rudolph cartoon or the original read all thing that everyone wanted watching then they made it was yeah where's the bottle over they I mean that's just Apple yeah look into a bottle opener it was a play animation of that Santa Claus being pulled over for drunk driving but he had a bunch of coaching his sleigh has never seen it no he's like what's wrong off the first it was hilarious but that's pretty much how this whole hunt started a little bit okapi well we're we were in Vegas for shacho and one of the cool things about shot shows you get down there and there's a bunch of other people that are in a hunting and everybody starts talking like man we got to do something we got to figure out a hunt and look this is we got one more day tomorrow morning this couldn't be or you guys are going to hunt this afternoon I can't I'm here with the family I have multiple obligations but um sixth time I might have to leave them behind I didn't say that Jessica you're losing them I think that this is like one of the coolest places on earth we could Beaumont it really is it's hard to be it really is I mean you can begin this emptier quiver in an hour [Laughter] this epic right tons of deer about the action perfect going terrain yeah all seriousness once you're here you feel like this is important place like this you know the kind of places are important for hunting yeah yeah there's just not a whole lot of spots like this on the planet that are like pristine I mean this is it's hard to get here that's one of the beautiful things about it it's like it's easy to get to Honolulu it's a little more difficult to get to Maui it's way more difficult to get here you know and that's what keeps people from coming I guess because that's a cool story though to the island down the island was originally you know really the revenue came from pineapples and it was a pineapple plantation yeah and when we're like my knuckles are bloody I don't know if your guys's are from crawling around the knees and my knuckles are bloody but everywhere you go there's like little one-inch wide plastic pipe on the ground that was all the irrigation all the you know all the irrigation for the pineapples and he told us today that they actually they buried that plastic a lot of the black plastic that you see where they've now ground because they took the pineapples out he said the plastic was seven feet under the top of them under the top of the soil so that the moisture stayed between the top of the soil and the plastic so that the pineapples would actually grow don't interested because everywhere you walk you do see that blackberries are coming off he says they've I tried to get them yeah they tried to get rid of it but he said it was seven feet under the topsoil like my own good pineapple Isles dadless yeah pineapple island is what you know the references for the you know for the island but access meat historically has been argued as the most pure case full meat on the planet it's so delicious just what they serve at the hotel those those uh access meat sliders off its Berenstain because here at the hotel when they say venison burgers back in the States when they say venison we're thinking whitetail but here when they say benefit is it specifically is axis that's native to the island and everything that they're serving here at the hotel is axis yeah let's talk about that real quick because when you get venison in America you're mostly getting it from New Zealand you're getting venison that is commercially rainiest a tremendous amount of elk and venison that you buy in America comes from New Zealand does they classify it elk is an innocent suit yeah I think they do sometimes yeah deers then it's an all deer I didn't know that but okay yeah when I went to a restaurant I went to a restaurant that's near my house and this guy there's a really nice restaurant and the like we have elk from New Zealand are they making it like it's a big deal myself I mean it's brought it all the way over there poor lker and some high fence bullshit operation okay congratulations as I said hey bring it over a slave that you shot in the head Tommy they're the red deer and the stag and it's not elk in New Zealand it's rich red deer yeah dang they're farmed over there like cattle yeah in their shift not only to the state less to the states and more to Europe in Germany places like that well one thing that that plate has in common with this place is no predators New Zealand and inland honor there it's a very strange situation where they brought over these animals that are not native whether it's in New Zealand there's the stag and then there's red deer and a few other different dip takes in New Zealand oh yeah they didn't they do now yeah all those animals are invasive so they they go crazy and they have to you know we'll get a richer older populations when I was down there I returned by the difference between the states and here and they are talking about their needs you know the outfitter community there wants to make money of course but they also want to conserve and protect that population in wildlife their problem is the population on that island doesn't value the wildlife it CMOS farewell you may see they see chamois and they see talk and when so are and they see red stag as feral population or a non-native mammal that they again shoot and gain wholesale you know and they say they jumping a helicopter firing I shoot these animals and what these guys are saying is at this point they might as well be indigenous I mean these are the animals that we have here when you protect them and treat them like a resource and value them which gives them a better chance and a long well the tourism in New Zealand how much of it is based on hunting it's got to be quite a chunk of it good chunk of it but what they've done over there I think method put a negative spin on anybody they take a lot of like a lot of our American sensibility because I think most clients that go over there some European but the bulk of American they've taken our American sensibilities and they've kind of turned it against us a little bit there's a lot of high fence red stags yeah a lot of like come down here and shoot this $20,000 animal which is akin to throw them back to our trophy hunting but they're only a lot of public land there's a lot of awesome places to hunt more folks are starting to find out there's a lot of that's just kind of a very little secret of there's there's a lot of high fence again every single one of those really big red stags that everybody sees in Wow because had the New Zealand stags it's the same thing in the South they're their own farms yeah yeah I'm sure all like not do you know this bread that's it's completely a negative thing but like but it's weird it's weird it's a different mentality and it's also in the same time you're looking at an island that has so much diverse place I mean it can be in the center of the South Island it looks like high desert Nevada you go to the east coast and it looks like the Brooks Range of Alaska where we were last year Shane yeah and then you go to the west coast and it looks like Jurassic Park and human they don't have any tags and you can kind of like you can hunt a goose with a rifle rifle bag but yeah there there's there's no tag there were some areas where there are some paradise stuff yeah that's because what's a paradise duck so it's a really cool-looking water fowl bird that like a ton of the major water Fowler's like go down there to shoot those specifically it does you they go down they want to shoot the pear it's just bad that I want to eat one when I hear its name my paradise you dogs are on the menu my table maybe I'll be the judge of that sounds totally you know but it's like here I mean it compares to hear that Islands these eyes are closed ecosystems yeah whatever you drop in here stays here and let's ease you let's ease access there in this case or the Red Stag learn how to swim this is a big 140 square miles oh look at that duck that's crazy Jonah paradise guy very good yeah this is this is an audio only podcast of the rare audio only podcast please jump that's a cool looking duct oh man yeah that looks like a chicken fucked a duck like a rooster was like bitch I'll show you who's boss around the world I want to treat that thing in New Zealand okay it's big Duffy's a big thing hanging up for sure we were there last year when the opening ducks in accidents way cooler when it's in flight because you get to see the full well how beautiful these access deer amazing I actually hide it well Sam you're a photographer yeah I mean it's like photographing them is next level I mean I'm shot to make chocolate is a ton of elk and deer like a whitetail and mule deer and all sort of stuff but like it's so hot that the first so thin just like the entire thing looks sleek and like the spots and everything is just it's crazy and for a little history on Sam Sam and Ben and I met up in BC was almost three years ago right there just closing on we were talking about some simply had a great time we had a great time in BC but that epoch for a cover of Peterson's hunting magazine with me carrying that elk Allah or the moose legs you take that picture yeah yes it did it was a badass hardly for my view I want like a signed picture from you oh yeah that's the one I want I believe that I would love that cover the robot Sam what's your Instagram page she's got a lot of Awesome photograph yeah just my name's such as a stencil s Oh H o LT yeah so whole yeah so Holt and you need to see the the epic bus Sam's got the bus rolling yeah that is so cool explain that bus because that bus is so cool we're talking about it at lunch today I bought a 1993 65 passenger Bluebird scuba gear matter if I do things like that well it does is a story is it rather tell you got a sweet deal George Bush's second term no yeah I think it's we found it on Craigslist just south of Fort Collins Colorado and basically bought it directly almost directly from a school district but they had totally rebuilt the engine and transmission so it's like ready to go yeah how many miles and have on the rebuild go on the body was one hundred and eighty nine thousand and then 20,000 miles on the rebuild so would you have done any suspension work or I have goals or I mean it's pretty stiff Oh shoulder hump yeah we're really where do you want to go he's got long way over here I wanna go see I'll be able to sleep five in the bus yeah I'm also going to have a ten by twenty Walton that sits up next to it so we can sleep amazing long and the wall tent you're going to have hot water that pumps into the wall temps you could actually take showers yeah so I may have a wood stove in Walton to keep to warm it up and then the hot pan with hot water heater will be connected to the end of the kitchen and I'll run it out the window so you can take a hot shower and a heated Walton and you talked about this while we're in BC yeah so the buff idea oh the bus idea so the original idea was to do like a twelve state turkey tour in a black my brother his business partner my what came up with this scheme and then like it just ate at me like that like I need to get a buck how many people have ever said that I need to get a bug there you know I can be driving on the road like one would drive by and like everyone up it's such a good idea though for getting around going hunting doing hunting trips and yeah and it's going to be like ripped all seats out and totally converting it into my little hunting Shack it's an awesome onto that so spend the next year in a bus it's not funny how like when you get something in your head that you are really into and then you start walking into it other people like what the fuck is wrong with you yeah for me it was like 1990s 80 series Land Cruisers because it's the last year's where they have the front and rear solid axles and those trucks can drive anywhere and they're not glamorous they don't look good but those fuckers never die go everywhere you see a t-series Land Cruisers they're indestructible and it won't years now yes of course there is it was a solid ass dude you'll find them on eBay with fucking 200,000 miles on them and their 50 grand yeah you know or maybe plural I might have exaggerated it yeah well but they are man I mean that there's something about those and so I'd be like that's the 80 series my - the fuck is wrong with you so old Toyota am I done around so old landcruiser do you understand like there's a time when they were making these fucking cars that will go on forever and then they figured out like you don't make any money make a car to go on forever people driving for yeah that's the same look figured out in Europe though when it comes to like gas you go to the you go there and like our Toyota's there they call them the Toyota Hilux yeah whereas we're driving to Tacoma or you drive Tundra down it gives like 60 miles with a gallon and they have a diesel engine yeah I'll over here you cannot buy that Hilux Hilux I think it said to you it did hi guya l ux i got all of it you look whatever you can do whatever you want man think it's up to you be the biggest one here you can do a fuckin watch well it's a high level what they call it but yeah we know Neil or you know you know Neil Young he has a farm in Northern California and he makes his own biodiesel and he runs all this yet he runs all his cars on biodiesel she does now let's talk about new young motherfucker Neil Young's the reason why I quit concert security I was working as a security guard in great woods all the people that did martial arts with me all got security jobs in this place and I got a job there too and during a Neil Young concert this place called great woods great woods is an amphitheater so there's a there's covered seating and then the back the cheaper seats are this lawn area and in the lawn area it got a little chilly so dudes started fires and the security guards had to go in and shut down the fires and riots broke out and people start punching people and got crazy and I'm like fuck doing security like quit in the middle of a Neil Young concert I put a hoodie on over my security jacket and I fucking bail serious yes I did good I was like dude I am NOT fucking getting my ass kicked or getting snapped for Neil Young board Neil Young fans bring it back he told me that sorry BC that's all dude is crazy there was fires people are lighting fires and when one guy saw positive shit I want to fire Holly humming fans just started fire we're talking about it I mean I don't know how many people great woods in Mansfield Massachusetts seats I got to think it's someone it's you know it's a a big ass concert place like I saw Sam Kinison there and Bon Jovi's like 15,000 seats oh and you know 4,000 of them were on fire honking hey Reba I mean this is like I was 19 so this is like 86 and you got better crazy hey Chou's nuts man we all hear that Nederland damage done another man ready to make a fire oh my gosh it was dark man it got crazy I fucking bailed out of there a lot of people don't know I used to be a fireman when I worked at Matthews you were fire me and horse got it you have reassured about people that I sense before I know you know force wor force go yeah yeah like the one that every time I need a happy movie yeah I do a story like you could like super slow but really good a pimp I was in fire man super spy really good honor 30 and yeah we might on this fire call for this lady and man her house but the promise the thing that you encounter a lot as fireman's you go on fire calls where a lot of the houses are not kept up at the little bit most people would keep them up I guess that's politically correct way to say it Porter's Harder's yeah looks just great oh I went on a lot of kindling I've disabled the old paper yes I think wrong time to store gasoline in the bathroom open on this one and I mean I wasn't impressed by her as a woman I would I would classify earn more as a cat lady but she had a vast collection of books meal tapes oh I remember a tracker cassette Dave yourself what is a cassette collection along with a lot of cats and cat turds oh no where's this in the house and how many cats does she have not as many as this did evil with that well we went to a cat sanctuary out here is 500 cats well yeah yeah why not yeah the cat thanks you are into like Cajun yeah yeah how do you guys do other things besides honey I'm family bro when you have little girls you have to do other shit you have to this is the only I could balance this trip out I have to do a con game fast and say we're gonna hook on I know you can we do it we're gonna Hawaii yay where's daddy uh-oh it's murdering animals Shane like Shane's anxiety level when he's not hunting isn't off the chart if X is my area hi yeah super ten yeah we would really edit well it's so drawn off here dude whoa whoa whoa are you pouring Red Bull and your wine got it fuck are you doing before tequila into his Red Bull and wine somebody be a first what do you got an addition what do you call that trash bag is a new concoction let's call it the cat lady I won't worry but I've had one I've created a gang before yeah you guys created rye brain which is a combination of alpha brain and whiskey now Stan may be served I drink it everywhere back when he was a bartender no before the firemen I Meredith the bartending me and Sharon won the bartending thing at the Traeger like National Convention in Salt Lake yeah we did a we did a smoked grapefruit Tom Collins that freakin one well this is something that you do that I have not tried but I do want to try John Dudley I will take a bucket of water yeah he will smoke his ball he takes a bucket of water he puts it I'm not joking takes a bucket of water puts it in the Trager smokes the water right then take that water pours it into these ball of ice ball holders what do you call those things Bowl cause there's like a little cone like yeah yeah yeah well you make a ball you make a whiskey bottle whiskey ball you can smoke you can smoke water is like musky or Apple you know apple flavored pellets or anything you want and then you freeze them and if you have a crappy bourbon you can drop that ice the smoked ice ball in and you can take a real like crappy bourbon and make it season that's it come orders and triger tomorrow I'm a crappy bourbon drinker I mean Jack Daniels considered a crappy bourbon what is that considered we might hit shot we said that I would say more like anything under 7 bucks a bottle this go from a guy who's drinking tequila and wine and restaurant a house the cat lady in one cat ladies and gentlemen I like it I'm not sure that his mixology is over item we just fucked up my mini bar by the way I don't eat in here is the radical bear-hugs versa booze when my family comes back here I'm gonna have fucking some really shitty looks well cuz we're all gonna be laying on the floor again baby they're my friends they're family here let it go let it go thank you sir for man in my bed you got to let it go these guys welcome you're all killers they've killed things let them they need to blow off some steam they got PTSD from the rage trypan ladies excellent it's a very good drink Shane try the cat later try the cabbage Ellen a little kind of get it get it on that come on man yeah I needed a little a way I don't like the cat lady I'm missing enough years ago oh okay wait this listen is the gentlelady not at ladies they get any excellent it's pretty good it did I do that it should be it is good it's a strange cacophony of like anytime you can say cacophony on the podcast you win enough when you're drinking tequila wine and Red Bull I could sell comes out let's talk about how goddamn fast these deer are I killed one and I killed one because he didn't know I was there every deer that saw me and he stood still and I shot an arrow at him they ducked that motherfucker like neo on the matrix I mean it was so amazing watching an arrow going and I switched arrows because John Dudley made me two builds he maybe Eero build with 625 grain arrows that go 245 feet a second and then 496 group 496 and 493 486 don't slack 1603 gray the lighter ones yeah I think they're still 196 anyway they're still fairly heavy but they go 275 feet per second I have switched to the 275 paper second arrows because these these deer would see the arrow coming at them feel like bitch and just not even come close so with the 275 feet per second arrows I was catching hairs I got a couple of hairs when they were looking at me like I would like get the arrow and I'd look at eyes of the hair on this arrow or I literally would give them a haircut no blood there was just duck under it and it would just like catch the like the top of their head or the smaller back or something we need to get you like a 380 great arrow so then I'm from a meat head there's this actually a podcast with winky about this we did a whole I mean we talked for a long time about speed versus energy she's a big speed dad you know he's her arrow duckers here explain who Winky is to the people that only he is a whitetail expert white-tailed deer expertise you know a very very well-known editor or writer and he's got a great guess online webisodes yeah once a semi live online hunting show yeah midwest white hail after like the world of hunting very well respect you and we had this ongoing debate which is really cool because when i have a lot of my guests on my podcast i like to get into things to where it interests me because it's a lot like you there's I wouldn't say argument but there's debate between this you know a versus B and build he's very successful and he has a very good following and he has a very valid opinion but his opinion on an arrow having a lot of speed in order to avoid and you know dear dropping verses like say Adam green trees opinion of having just a super efficient very heavy arrow that is maximum penetration to where regardless of what it hits its going to do this job and by dropping what we mean is when what today is a perfect example the deer hear the sound trigger inland I lanai in particular the deer hear the sound of a bow launching an arrow and they bolt Ben and I were talking I mean talking like this we were just talking we're shooting the shit and there was at least two bucks to go and a couple of those bedded less than 20 yards away from us and they weren't even reacting and then I took how much should I take this bomb I should launch this bomb on this dump so some data that's a fair and he gives me a radio seventy yards I'm like fucking up I'm gonna go with this I brought back seventy yards and the dough is really like bitch are you serious she slides to the left like she's in some like 1990s fucking breakdancing efficient electric slide right manipulation I gotta have little food a nice shot exactly where she was standing and she was nowhere nowhere by the binder and I told you after that Eric Moreland you hit exactly where you were aiming in the ten ring yeah that deer was swimming to Maui before you're different so fast there so something as though like at seventy yards if they're looking at you in there they react it's not like you're missing them by inches or millimeters they could be like feet six feet away from me oh yeah imagine if EF C fighter said the instincts of an axis you have enviable you have to watch it in slow motion no what the hell went on Mighty Mouse Dmitry's Mighty Mouse Johnson the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world might as well be an access deer [Music] and real for real for real I mean that's like literally talking about like people who fight Mighty Mouse they probably feel like a dude who's shooting and an access gear who's looking right at them there's no chance but for bow hunting it is probably the best training you could ever have and we were talking about this because this whole thing was put together shoutout to Yeti coolers greatest coolers on the planet er Ben O'Brien big executive coolers this is this whole thing with whatever the plug is coordinator homeboy this this this whole thing was put together and while while we're here we're thinking like this might be the ultimate destination for bowhunters to prepare for any other hunt yeah yeah I get the experience at all yeah you get their experience spawn stalk a diversity of train and then in the end you have a lot of opportunity and animals that don't let you fuck up yeah you also if you do like 15 is later yet another group right but that's a beautiful thing it's an amazing training opportunity so bill Winkies debate speed versus so the drop means the deer hear the sound of an arrow which is like to hear the sound of a bow going off and they they literally ducked out not duck because they think an arrows coming they ducked because they're preparing to lower themselves and launch themselves forward yeah yeah a lot of times people think they're ducking the arrow but what happens is when someone gets scared it's a lot like sharing my wife is bad about this I'll come around the corner of it I hate it and just yeah and nothing deer jumps astray an exact in the stream I'm on your jump on the street I'm just trying to say hi she's a strange effort um what happened is the deer they just picked the legs off ground that's the cool thing about video is when you video your hunts you actually get to relive those once again you can slow down watch them and really you know it's a reaction of they're just clenching up so they're lifting their feet off the ground so gravity is dropping depending on their body weight it's dropping in at a certain certain speed oh so they're lifting their feet so that they can go forward yeah they're just picking up as a reaction like ah and then once they spring they're going on but the weight of their body is actually dropping that down so you know to like with an elk obviously it's a lot more mass so they'll drop at a faster rate than something that's lighter but a lot of times their legs are just coming up to the body and the gravity is pulling them down so what is a bill Winkies philosophy he really thinks speed is more of a benefit than momentum or kinetic energy but in saying that bill is also very focused on a medium game annual so when we talk about you know a white-tailed deer is a lot different than they'll pair a moose so you know momentum first which is a heavier arrow traveling and maybe at a slower way to speed but it delivers a lot more energy it's a lot like when Foreman used to fight you know when I watched Foreman or when I watched a lot of his older fights he's never looked like he was hit anyone hard but when his glove hit someone their whole body was taking a tremendous amount of energy because it was a big freakin fist and you know why or you you feel like he wasn't hitting hard because you weren't there there's something that's lost in film like there's a lot of people that I've seen hit people in person and they just have there's there's people that are built weird and George Foreman's a perfect example George Foreman a guy I've never met him personally yeah but he has hands for the size of canned hams there they're fucking enormous a big Lesnar's probably in the neighbor Brock Lesnar could have been those he's a freak he could have been the greatest heavyweight of all time if he was fully dedicated he started from the time he was in high school and went straight into MMA but agree he spent so much time in pro wrestling but if you look at Brock Lesnar's column by a Columbine look at hello cat lady look at Brock Lesnar's combine numbers his NFL Combine numbers they're insane he'd benchpress 225 pounds something like forty five reps his fucking vertical is off the roof his long jump is insane for a guy who's almost 300 pounds he's a freak I've never I've seen a lot of athletic freaks I've never seen anybody's more freaky than Brock Lesnar but that freaky athleticism what's beautiful about MMA that freaky athleticism does not overcome technique and long term training in the particular disciplines of MMA that's why Cain Velasquez beat the shit out of them whereas Cain Velasquez he's a freak - but he's a cardio freak different kind of freak not power didn't look like it exactly but he it's one of those things you got to be there to see him if you saw Cain Velasquez fight in person you'd say general right second wave but it doesn't matter sir but he's got a mind like a shot though when we hit someone it yeah they told ya for ages he's got a mind Cain Velasquez has got a mind and I like his lungs like lungs like one of the things they say about hunting is that what kills animals is legs and lungs yeah elk especially because like being able to get to where the elk are being able to like that okay being able to like have the cardio so it is like it's not and it's not like coincidence that a guy like cam Haynes became a psychopathic endurance athlete because he's obsessed with elk hunting I mean I talked to him about it he's like the whole thing with me was I had figure out how to get to those elk you know like how do I get to those up I'm tired like how do I not be tired I'm going to start running how do I get more endurance well I got to run longer I got to learn harder at a run Hills I got to run mountains and it's the same thing with with fighting like if you're like an explosive super fast athlete but you run out of gas you're you're fucked you know like you have a short window of time to get the job done and if the guy who you're fighting can survive that storm you're kind of fucked you know because then you don't have any gas left and that's Brock lesner Brock lesner never really developed into the type of like fully evolved MMA fighter but what he did have is this freak athletic body that's the same thing with George Foreman when you watch that rumble in the jungle George Foreman came out of the gate storming hit Muhammad Ali with his body shots like even a better fight is watched George Foreman vs. Joe Frazier we literally picks him up was it shot he hits him and you see Joe Frazier's body go up in the air from getting hit the form was so powerful but Muhammad Ali was skillful enough so when the punches were hitting him it was sliding just a little bit out of the way just a little bit out of the way we need to punch absorbing them but moving with them so it took a lot of the energy away from them and I think that that's a lot you could say this is this is like this is like an analogy to like arrows and and and a heavyweight arrow which goes slower or a fast arrow which doesn't have as much momentum doesn't have as much kinetic energy but it's quicker because if they both connect on point a at the same time Foreman is definitely doing more damage sure so if you have Mighty Mouse versus George Foreman this is at a certain point time I got a bet on George Foreman I mean until we get to like we looking for more calories more rebel a Red Bull more vessel full of my cats waiting what there's another refrigerator in that Allegra mock their attorney here the he house for sure like that air of comparison is and we were shooting just today like we a Honda we were messing around talking and we're side to shoot this treatise to see yeah it's probably the name of a tree so Joe is pulling by 1895 86 pounds of pounds in his arrow ways how many with the grain somewhere around 500 grams that's a heavy arrow my I'm student 68 pounds of my my arrow is 300 grand so roughly half weight and much less drawl eatin you he shoots this tree dead centers this thing and his broad head sticks right in the center industry in the era stay then the broader disappears I brought in dissipated right up right to the insert yeah actually de treated my air deflect off the side of the tree and the brown had decided the broad head the third blade and brought he did stuff in a branch and he looks me you have your arrow some shame is the stream FHS arrow again but it's true I mean that's what he would have has Miley Miley Cyrus is a the name that John Dudley gave to my 625 Green Arrow set up which it goes slower but it does horrendous damage so Joe sent me and boney said dude build me something frickin extreme we've had a conversation we're trying we're trying to figure out like I actually downloaded a gift a gift file of Meyers Miley Cyrus on the wrecking ball I was shooting at 85 yards at my mouth and when air when his arrow would hit my target the next time I would shoot Google my all I can see is dead wood elf horns moving on my target because it was still shaking from the arrow that I shot before it so when Joe said dude how's that setup doing because I told actually I built like three different options but I told them I said man this thing is hitting like a freaking wrecking ball because the target would just shave and by the time I drew back again and would be aiming for the second arrow I can still see the horns moving from worst arrow so that I'm not downloading a gift of Miley Cyrus riding that wrecking ball back ignores the draw cycles you hear the limbs creaking pulling back this Lincoln Log no wonder though all the times we go to the Shepherd Africa when Eragon playing we've always hated software a bunch people all right we need a Photoshop work of Joe Rogan set on Miley Cyrus right now big uns are crying this is not funny it's not it's not a good day no I unless you bring a cat lady what's the Molly back oh I brought five extra hours today I have a seven Aero tight spot and I brought a five arrow extra quiver because I'm like today's my last day when how do you bring on this trip Jo fifty might be some kind of record Kirill came all from that kind loving we must clarify this when when Joe says training like we're not training on these animals we're talking about the training of spotting an animal snapping it in making making what is an efficient shot like with you know it's a very ethical practice but training just means like opportunity after opportunity after opportunity meaning that you could get after these animals and learn how they move how you you want be quiet yeah we had duck when dipper ologist pregnant is that an event or a single day of hunting here I mean you have more opportunities on spottin stocks then the majority of guys are going to have an entire hunting trip on maybe a season maybe agent on this there I mean I think I you will deer elk anything like that I think I had to film in the first day which we will talk about island time a little bit first day singing sounds enjoy the balancing rock talk about island time they got it right you're an island boy you guys got it right this is the way to live the way I live is bullshit it is bullshit you know everybody's all fucking nervous worrying and stress I come here Mike I'm so relaxed my kids are relaxed my wife's relaxed I'm like we're so relaxed Mike hey wait a minute why shouldn't we just be relaxed yeah it's what day's last 40 hours still bright it's Friday and we got later what we got here Monday and it's Friday and all of us are saying the other day we feel like a guy for a month yeah happy when I get one of my son's gonna be like the 17 years old shot out the trigger for shipping a fucking grill oh yeah happy birthday young dad Tyler yeah happy birthday oh yeah my god your boy Chad Ward has changed the way I fucking cook meat if Chad worn a 20 best barbecue in the Instagram he everything well we didn't have a chance to reverse here last night because we were actually trying to just chill out on the beach but we ended up we cooked Ben and Remy smooth long backstraps because going to mouflon explain what a movement a move on is Hawaiian chief really really cool oh my little bit by the way I've never listened that song before you sent me that and of it I knew she wrote that song but I really how many know she wrote it she sang it shut up Miley Cyrus he's had more he's had more that time like 30 minutes we she has my biggest a.m. dude I don't know what you're talking about yeah Miley Cyrus our last night out it's like everything he made was super legit and I was blown away how I've eaten a lot of Mulan's actually but I was blown away by like that side-by-side comparison hugging flan she converted after zeroes I was mean I was devastated I actually threw because what's what's kind of sucks about this whole trip is I wanted the one thing I really wanted to shoot was a move on on Hawaii sorry a change playing my little violin as painted I had a lot of opportunity to shoot booth long and states that didn't have native mouflon and I always said if I want to shoot a move on I really want to shoot it in Hawaii just because that's me as a hunter and a free-ranging right and I had asked the guy that they had me upon and said well yeah but it's really tough to get up there and little did I know that meanwhile Ben and Remmy Warren had secretly arranged a hunt up and move on territory which literally looked like New Zealand and they went up and I can't believe you got to that's amazing we got we would have had more than two I miss one at 30 yards a good one - I really want a giant one we needed a fast I needed any sort Foreman what do you you know you needed a mighty mouth I need to my mind so what do you this whole thing about Bill Winky before we get off partnering for the archers out there where do you stand on this do you think this like a comfortable medium like maybe a tyron woodley it was a powerful 170 pounder who's also lightning fast I think I really want the Conor McGregor where mmm I'm gonna say he's like basically like analyst but tyron woodley would disagree at our last part our yeah he is but I'm sorry I mean I know countertops and crafty the last press conference but I actually liked that arrow that the animal thinks that he knows what's coming but then when it hits them it's like what just happened right got there too quick because I've been it a couple different fights that you've invited me on thank you when Connor his people they think they know what it's going to feel like that then what it does look like when that first left hand hit them their face really changes like I think they expect what it's going to be like but when they actually feel it yeah it's a totally different expression I mean I've been that way with in competition which I you know I've shot professionally for a lot of years and then when you meet someone in a match and then they actually stand next to you and compete with you it's you can tell on their face that they're experiencing something different than they prepared for right I've seen that when Connor his people and all sudden they're they just they're face changes like oh I think that's what every competition right is that the same with surfing like you around some people and you see under estimating um well not not only that but like like maybe when you're coming up like you see someone who's on just another level and you go wow okay there's that too when you know I mean once you experience some live where you're like wait a minute yeah there's a lot of guys who just don't like really like sort of like the same way you're saying that like it doesn't translate like yeah my applies to film right you know that cycling is pretty badass but in real life I can't believe how fast and how powerful people are you know like that was surfing I think it's like that was any sport where it's like you know you're expecting to see this guy who's you've heard of or read about or watched films over something and then you see her like feeling you got to be there live right yeah my amazing using the embarrassin to what we're talking about here like maybe like a cell I would go to operati but you have a good look at that they used to get a Google how to have enough like this is God is this heavyweight named Francis in Ghana who's this African heavyweight who's in the UFC was like one of the best fighters in the heavyweight division Roy nice fucking terrifying and Francis in Ghana but this guy in Ghana does that there's something crate he's just first of all he's enormous he's like 260 pounds Lee I seen him stacked built like he said built like a brick shithouse yeah not done Andre laughs get one punch but there's something about him like literally when he's walking into the cage he's like his production is different like his body is like dead monitor at the death is shaking quickly go me just go what in the fuck but it's a lot like Foreman's like you got to be there if you see him hit people you go the guard can't take a punch on Burnham you got to be there man you got to be there and did the impact like when in nineteen like 96 97 I watched there's a guy that is one of those underrated heavyweights of all times things Pedro his oh and pedro rizzo was a like a real pioneer in MMA and then muy thai and he he was training one time this place called Beverly Hills jiu-jitsu he was kicking this heavy bag and he was a 1 he was kicking this bag and I guess if you saw a video it would be kind of impressive but when I was there live I was like Jesus can Christ feel it it was just like three or four levels past anybody had ever seen in terms of like the amount of power they could generate with a kick and that that's like the same thing with in Ghana that's the same thing with a lot of people it's like there's there's something about seeing something live this you can sort of like get an idea like I'm sure you if you saw a guy surf in a video you'd be like oh that guy that's a bad motherfucker right but like for the average person you kind of got to see something live yeah there's a little detail that you can you know you know sort of really recognize it you know it really really well whether it's fighting or surfing or whatever anymore anything even hunting yeah talked about this guy's like you know Brandis not here with us now buddy was here always hunting with us perfect example garlic lemon Warner either green tree to her feet analyzer a cut from the same cloth or campaign okay and REM you ate a shot on the mouflon your earmuffs John earmuffs when he made a shot on this mouflon 57 yards it seems to me like the arrow made an X pattern to the ant-like to what essentially it was was a gain lobes eyes was cantaloupe size target that he's shooting at at 57 yards and he shot you like six trees from a knee within like a out of like a 45 degree angle is so I would like to tell you about a shot that I saw John Dudley shoot a couple of days ago but I need permission going back let me just say we're gonna check our Callie it tells 1 billion people let me just say I saw some shit let's business let's just move on I saw his shit I saw some shit that I would never attempt but it ended with a perfect heart shot and ethical killed an animal to died in second so that's what you're talking about right we'll see us up in live look you can get an idea of how hard something is until you see it live exactly catch my look does the king let me tell you something what God said we saw with John Dudley have you ever seen Will Ferrell and he said what just happened that just happened that just happened I never my that's what Jill Rogen space was like when you turn around well at least I knew what you can do the guide was like holy jesus holy jesus he just shot that I told you he was gonna kill it or you had to be there but it's like there's levels to everything there's levels to writing there's levels to singing there's levels to poach I don't know I don't believe that but this levels of surfing for sure there's levels to everything right cat lady yeah I can't ladies a couple of noes have a role yeah cat lady's good good drink I like it I was skeptical first skeptical Cathy but he didn't bring her claws out she bros would be listening it's a tally minyard's on 2013 what for those listening in yo in the water it's a boat I just uh kidding no it's a room service bar a good one it's a red line it's a three-part red wine with a one part tequila patron and a one and a half part Red Bull sugar-free what do they call room service but what do they call the room bars maybe any bars rainy bars rape my dancer rapist we've gone a long way trying to figure out but whether up the wiki is right or out of Maine trees right so I'll say just one thing about their weight or sleep so there's at a known distance air weight doesn't matter right so if you know how far you're shooting their way doesn't matter I'm all for shooting a very heavy arrow because on that but at a known distance I love it so you could rain something you know what I think I like blues and it won't move rule that's obvious right yeah I'm sure right so it's great should have your hair bringin faster arrow comes it has an advantage in the when something comes running in and you have to snatch you at it right like that's it I think 37 yards and say it's a 30 but if you have as fast your arrow you're only going to miss but your missed by a lot less down there it doesn't drop as long as the drugs not actually this much much less farm splatter yeah I'm so flattered right after I think you're to answer your question I think there is a happy medium you know so like for you you're shooting ahead of your bow so your arrows like a heavier arrows going to go faster and people with longer draw length their arrows going to go faster and they can shoot after your area like wouldn't you agree though that's like my knee 90% of like art like archery hunters will shoot like a medium arrow though because of that my person not that many like campaigns or Joe's it want like a really heavy air with a heavy broad added there's not that many people to do that what do you show other than like people who like exclusively you can help or excluding on moves or we could we unloaded buffaloes run genius to different errors in this crew what do you shootin a shoot um I shoot elite I forget what they're called there are eight point one grains per inch they're elite my wine drawn blinds how many grains who you're pulling into victory yeah was it bass yeah yeah so look at early armor-piercing no no minor victory elites of the help gotta yeah victory victory archery weeks now there were eight point one grandparents yeah I'm not exactly sure with that so for people listening like five hundred grains is about one ounce so correct John job what call you mom texting I was actually trying to refer back to a heavy hitter that is no the actual for sub I went to Arnold Classic to compete in like it was 2005 so competing is what kind of complication is that aggressive and what are you doing actually I was bowling but I want the Vietnam War I liked when I was canoeing and edited leach it actually won 200 classics thank you what's an Arnold clapping Paul tank Abbott was fighting Wensley walls whoo that's not answered the question whether the Marvel are waving epic John wall's good Leslie and Wesley knocked him out with the need of the face nothin anyway no I was with that stop stop stop violating it stops a hundred percent rate for what organization it was for the Arnold Classic they had UFC in no novice Ohio listen to me tank Abbott was never knocked out by guy named Wesley walls this is incorrect what year is this is it with Lee since 2005 or 2004 two placed in the second round tank gavel has never knocked out with indeed he was insect literally the Bell wrong but pull up tank Abbott's a Wikipedia page under my good eye shirt is good I'm so excited that I know something that joke you definitely don't forget deputy you won't be exciting a few moments you will fight it already the power of 1988 what's up remember the fight that tank ever got his knee kick in oh yeah more each much more some I think I can walk out of his way listen yeah this isn't a lie this is not cat lady talk okay so when I went to the Arnold Classic I was invited there by Arnold and Frank saying I went there I did win with in what when she did her archery I had on a tree archery to army a clap yeah and then after the second year I recommended to Arnold did you guys wiki my mom I recommended the Arnold that they actually instead of having professional archery they have the NASS Ohio state finals there so that they could have the high school NASA program have their finals at the Arnold Classic which I thought would be better for the sport of archery but anyway I went to the UFC fight it was the first time in Ohio that they had that at the u.s. at the UFC style MMA fight at the Arnold Classic and tank thought Wesley walls I believe and what paint all right yeah no cabbage that's cabbage Korea when it's probably wise but I mean we check that out I'm going to this is true them now do not got cabbage was a k1 one feel when I by the way I mean I don't around the highway to you know you definitely have to think you're incorrect no keep other percent I saw well anyway I'm ringside corner so where the fighters come up the aisle to the to the ring I'm right at corner what year was this first seat I think it was 2006 maybe it was 2005 on to look at my trophy but that's true but anyway I was sitting there and I was all excited because I was getting to see tank Abbott I eat beef Wesley cabbage Korea and it'll knock him out with one punch and rumble on the rock in Hawaii no no that's definitely right it could to Arnold Classic okay let me let me okay horrify you lost get Arnold Classic mm it was nice he fight you're right is that were saying here's a problem but just it were at the Arnold Classic sweetie by the time of 2005 rolled around the tank wasn't in the UFC anymore right in 2005 he got knocked out in rumble on the rock or he knocked out excuse me Wesley Correa who is from Hawaii cabbage this is a name he got knocked out in rumble on the rock in Hawaii and that was a BJ Penn promotion BJ Penn was a promoter for a while before that is he fought in UFC 45 and he he lost to Wesley Korea he got tko'ed and that was in Connecticut so that's Wesley Korea before that I can tell you right now he got submitted by chemo before that he got submitted by friend near I'm gonna go hold before that he got knocked out by Pedro his I think that was in Brazil yes it was thank you before that he beat Hugo Duarte was a very tough guy that was 1998 diamonds all shit no let's clear this up get on a little phone yeah everyone listen uh what happened there's certain things that I would refer I would defer to your judgment UFC fights are not on that list well isn't it crazy wrong well you definitely not going to but good luck listen I've seen every cabbage or every tank Abbott fight ever I know who beat him I know I know who didn't beat him you know I was I've been there for a good percentage of them I'm gonna say this as a friend as a friend I want to take advocate knock down you might have thought it was tank out I know because tank Abbott has a goatee that's this long yeah a lot other guys do too all I'm saying is tank came out and what I was going to say is a lot like Brock or whatever I was excited to high five tank and I was on the inside corner of where they come out right and I like tank came out he was coming out to his music and he was jacked and I was supposed to shoot the next day for the tournament and I put my hand up like this for him to high-five me as he is coming down and he was so jacked for the fight I literally think he possibly ripped my shoulder out of the socket I didn't how hard that dude hit my hand and he was like yeah and he freaking hit my hand so hard that I actually thought like where's my labor man someone open the third road have that thing because they can't hit so forgive him the Wikipedia page where I'm working on the Hat lady is a motherfucker I'm not kidding I know you're not I also did it so when you walk back to your hotel here on lanai at the port of your gun in your face paint camouflage your bottle with our arrows and then you just roll in the force users village well here's the thing they're super friendly they're like did you get one to talk about Hawaiian accent how'd you do today well I think about that if you did that I was on the world any other four seasons for sure yeah four seasons in Beverly Hills look what the fuck it's a terrorist attack accompli this has become John Dudley China researchers will Onias yeah yeah yeah Bukh I know you are so he was Wesley walls I don't know who that is exactly that that's why I'd be right no no it's anyone well Ben had the fucking Wikipedia there's no Wesley Wally about 2005 right now listen by time 2005 rolled around tank wasn't I don't believe you is fighting in the UFC I believe his last fights in the UFC were against Kimo and Frank Mir I think Frank Mir got an ax toehold I think Kimo got him in an arm triangle I had an arm choke um I think that was his last rites in the Upstate shout-out to tank Abbott if you listened don't no disrespect well thanks he definitely didn't get killed by some dude that doesn't exist yeah he is shit mm aeon that one that was my talk yeah that was Maurice Maurice Smith Maurice Smith was world champion kickboxer and one of the first guys to how in the hell he last kicked ball as early he was in white compression shorts he was how many grab ladies of compression trucks and we're healthy how many cat ladies did you have and how much peyote was mixed in Russian Shores he was juggling to barely stay alive in the first and in the second he literally came off the bell with this huge flying knee and frickin clock tank oh here's the eye and he was down to the mat and the next day I saw tank and Lou Ferrigno and freaking everybody else at the Arnold Classic and he had this huge freaking well and he was knocked out at one kick one knee to the eye boy I wish this wasn't in a podcast so we can well I believe show you the arm classic scene is amazing so Saturday gorgeous Saturday I don't read knows what it is

definitely not right listen he needs me I've called more than 1500 fights I've been working for the UFC since 1997 I'm definitely right yes yeah I would I've watched every single one of cabbages and tank Abbott's losses and wins seem long I've never seen any cabbage spikes cabbage the bad motherfucker had a hell of a chin he could take ridiculous punishment the Andrei Arlovski fight was a big proof of that so is a Tim Sylvia fight take some bombs tough guy tank advocated him in Hawaii I know that all I can tell you is all I can tell you is you three cat ladies in with that one not in that litter box time's up last - I'm just telling you right now Wesley if you're out there wasn't a grip you have make a success we're going to make him dislike handyman Sims well he welcomes weapons would be Frank Mir that might have it was where they going to stop them Leslie wall is actually I don't think what very marked in my house and oh my god oh my we gotta cut them off folks we got to cut them off we gotta kind of all let's move on to other things that are more important that we want to talk about to over this Wesley wall guys is it it's going to be a Wesley walls it's going to be a new character that starts trolling your Instagram I'm not a rematch tank Abbott and I know why won't they race you from the records you lose the naughty scrubber platter polymer squirrel I'm down a wall in pain that's quite a blow to platters nobody land on the fucking moon I'll tell you that right now your dinosaurs aren't even real Joe and I had an interesting conversation to change the subject earlier today it was discussing like what hunting does to your psyche yeah I feel like that's pretty interesting to talk about while we're here in the midst of the table full of booze and great people that hunt so like talk about what we were about today I think it's the ultimate struggle I think that's why everybody at this table who also does very difficult things is attracted to it so much because it's such there's such finality to it I mean everyone at this table has ended the life of an animal and there's and it's very difficult to do and like we were talking about these animals jump in the strang and these animals like so tuned in to what you're doing in your movement and your intentions that there's an accomplishing that struggle and getting through that struggle you know it's very it's very compelling and I hate to use the word addictive because it has so many negative connotations attached to it but it might be the best word to describe to it because it becomes becomes a part of who you are I don't know Shane you got this issue right we all do right that she got a bad but there you can see him pitches he's like me like drawing and he's open an accuracy or walked out of the quiver and I mean we've been talking a little too long he's like starting to get like what addictive is not like they're the addictive is not the killing part no the addiction is the challenge to yourself manically mentally physically so the things that you can do to just to come up and give that ultimate challenge to you know it's a singular event like I'm going to see this dear whatever type of deer it is or I see this animal and I gotta go get that thing yeah those singular events in your life there's not a whole lot of those things like your daily life is is super complex right you're challenged on a lot of different exponential levels yeah this is like all the layers of humanity strippers things away and it's also constantly changing and moving it's not like bowling like you step up to the line the pins are set you roll the ball you hope you knock them down you know it's it's so complex there's so many variables you're stalking did I step on a twig snap the deer pumps are set up and lips out you are blown it's so many ways to blow it yeah so many ways and it's never the same like sonic bowling or baseball's those things you're trying to literally repeat the repetitive motion of that there's there is a repetitive motion in the process of drawing your bow and letting an arrow fly but there's no repetition in what that situation requires like whether you have to shoot from a knee or the answer did an angle or whether you have to wait or go quick drop your butter off the tree yeah there is no repetition in the actual experience of letting arrow five-year know which which is the most housing thing because there's almost no way prepared and then the reward is also like so primal you actually consume the animal you're eating it it's the most help and here's the crazy thing it's not it's bad for you it's not like you kill a bag of cheetos it right you're killing them eating the mo Tricia's animal that you can eat it's literally double the protein content per ounce than domestic beef I remember like at one time I talked to Andrew Zimmern for an interview like obvious how we met just for an article for a piece of timing saga dandy Zimmern about it which chef traveler and he's like man I really think of like killing the deer like plucking a tomato out of the garden was just right amount is just right is clumping red it's ready to eat like I think of killing deer like I think plugging that tomato and down in the kitchen you know that that experience of growing that thing and slicing it up and feed your family it's similar to going out and killing something it is and hunting has made me want to garden and have chicken to do funniest flip the switch for me to understand it like the feeling it takes to eat something that you've not only provided but you've worked for training for and yeah and mentally suffered for some level physically too well in it's like a major you have that real connection to your food which you don't have otherwise you still like the same thing whether you're you know growing your own veggies or whatever you're doing your garden or or going on getting your own meat you know it changes what your page is right now you'll know that cellophane yeah like a day but dis imagine that like just imagine the story of something okay you're a predator your line well years down the road you're still a predator but somebody else is going to deliver that that antelope to you well then you're not a predator yeah you know the meat consumed the gawking you're you're a lion is your welcome to a whole food it's going to be like all the African animals and tell me what you really I'm still a bread runny issue I'm still alive I'm gonna it but I don't my I'm taking off my clothes and I'm just going to eat it to something clear for me not only ever going to feed it it's going to be different nice lighting the wall was presented in such a wonderful way there'll be a sticker that tells me what in it we crushed my space little sticker for telling you what's in this man you're so wonderful like you imagine how ridiculous that would sound that somebody presented like our predatory history of a human like presents that we evolved from cavemen throwing spear the things or cavemen going and eating the leftovers or whatever lives killed and 2 million years ago - - the same cake then two minutes later walking around in a whole foods peeling off the stickers of a piece of pork and thinking that humane even okay it's also it's kind of a cop-out because people hate it when you say you have to experience it because until you experience it you really don't know what we're talking about but there is such a radical difference between eating steak to eat by the store and what that experience is and eating the backstrap of an access deer that you had to sneak up on you had a crawl on your hands and knees you got to wait for this thing to be cresting the ridge for the perfect opportunity to pass in front of the bush where you draw back your heart is pounding you're centering your bubble on your your rest your on your your site and you're just drawing back and just making sure you don't fuck this up and you see that arrow launch and you see it slam into his ribcage hey like fuck I got them and you see it run they see it fall over on its legs kick and then you cut it up and then you cook it while you're eating that thing you're thinking about what happened you know how that animal died you were there you know you understand this was this that you respect it in the winds that no one ever respects anything that comes in a ground beef package wrapped in plastic sitting on styrofoam laying on crushed ice this drop the same it's just not there's lot people that are on this table all of us are accomplishing our own things that we do and work hard at what we do only we all have families and we know we all have lives but we are all eaten up where all of us think about this that moment you just shot all the time it's almost all I ever think about it's a whenever I'm not doing there what I think that's what planning on doing a game changes like that but maybe worse than some people have every slice is good it's a good like they're how powerful it is probably people I'm he's from Hawaii I'm from Maryland you're from Davidson lost long way grew up in nature born a Jersey girl live in California you got Iowa South Dakota like always been from diverse background live in different places find a connection that same thing like that experience is so powerful that brings people together from all these crazy things when some people say why do you hunt like that's part of it there's a myriad reason but that's one of the things like sitting in a room with people that all think the same way about that experience crazy power I remember listening to a Jim shocky commercial with Jim shock was talking about hunting and he said when I'm not hunting I'm thinking about hunting I was like what the fuck is wrong with this dude yeah I had never hunted he can't relate I couldn't relate that was like honestly because I had watched a bunch of hunting television shows a bunch of hunting things before I ever got into hunting and I remember thinking that what I wanted to do is I wanted I was so disconnected between meat and the death of an animal so disconnected so I was like wow I need to see it happen or I need to do it myself it's something maybe I need to hunt so I started watching these hunting shows I would go to channel 605 on fucking Direct TV and my voice reads up to strange little you know area of the dial the channels where I never go to and then I started watching Jim shocky show and then I watched Steve Rinella the wild within and I watched Ted Nugent's spirit of the wild and I was like what is going on like what did he think I loved to do you know and I've got sort of this like weird desire to try this and it took forever before I absolutely finally did it and when I finally did it was with Rinella but once I finally did it I shot a mule deer and we're eating it by the fire my I'm doing this forever yeah this is immediately like I'm doing this forever we first met me and Sam where we shot a moose and two couple hours later we were in the tiny little house and British Columbia you were cooking the liver and onions of the Mussina shot and the heart slicing of the heart of the moose you just you're hot and we're eating and I just sitting on a table thinking like here you guys been through more than I'll ever go through here's the guy who's experienced more life in a lot of folks he's like discovered this thing and not only discovered it but jumped into the into the into a book feed an eating heart and liver I mean I know a lot of hundreds that one don't want to experience that you know don't don't open them eyes to experience these organs or or whatever but you jump into that thing you say like I want all of it I want every piece of the experience and I don't want it I don't want to miss anything and once you start to do that I mean that's three years ago yeah and how much has your mind changed about hanging in those three years a lot well in those three years I went from being like almost exclusively rifle in the beginning which is probably a way to get started because more more reliable to like being almost exclusively archery and one of the things that struck me about it is one of the things that struck strikes me about a lot of things about this crazy life that we live is that I don't think most people are seeing everything and I think that we live life with blinders on I think one of the reasons why we do that is just life becomes more and more complex the longer we live we have more and more responsibilities we have family and they have more more responsibilities we're involved in all these responsibilities we accumulate debt and we accumulate all these different tasks that require our attention and those things chew up a lot of your time Seraph and somewhere along line you forget a lot of things you forget that you're an organism you forget that you're an organism that has unique ability to communicate and share ideas and because of this unique ability to communicate we have this I mean this we're doing right now we're sharing these ideas and these ideas resonate with other people and they elevate the way in expand the way other people look at life and they're their words their ideas expand our our concepts of life and I think that when you stumble across something as intense as hunting or even as archery you know which is it meaning even without hunting I've said time and time again if you're a vegan you should do archery just the same for the same reason you should do yoga for same reason meditate but I think that when you stumble across something that is a real gamechanger it's almost like your responsibility I feel like in a lot of ways what I'm what I do with my life is I'm like a little bit ahead in terms of life there's like a path a little maybe ahead of where I should be and I'm like God you not see this come on it's safe you know I almost like my come on come on dude I'm telling you come on over here look at this and I really feel like that I feel like we all do that to certain extent I think some people are very hesitant to do that because they don't want to be Brandon fucked up bran is our fan but I fucked us I forgot to put my phone on airplane that I think that hunting like a lot of things in life is it's not for everybody and you don't have to do it but the experience is so intense that most people who do do it feel required to let everyone know that there's something else out there that this the the life that we live inside these barriers and these this civilization confinements the walls and the structures of cities and of language and culture all those erode when you're on a spot stock in Hawaii and you're sneaking up on some deer that just wants to stay alive and no I mean it's it goes back to your role like to your role as in humanity but also in society like I feel more accomplished as a human being because I have the ability to shoot an executor though I don't I can't I don't I don't think someone who can do that is less accomplished but I feel like as a part of my skill set as a human skill set of my you know my evolution is a person that has been a tool for me to use to to have to gain perspective we're talking about some trips I've been on like there's no way like yeah maybe there's some photos on phone social media or some things to denote my accomplishment or like what I killed or what the mountains I climbed or the things I've done but the perspective you gain that you take on with you that it kind of bleeds out at your your work life and your social life and all the things your interactions with other people like those things can't be measured so there's some level of measurement that you just can't get for money and when we do stuff like this together as a group like there's some level of I go to shacho go to the biggest hunting trade show where we we had that video of us getting drunk and screaming and people's I think sometimes people have never visited that show they don't realize with the people that I see there and that Sam she's there w see there and that you see when you come and st. for shame like there's like a certain type of a hug that you give that person that you've haunted with like there's a bro hug that like has more intensity no but you just know yeah you may have had a drink with her at dinner but sometimes like when I've been somebody I've hunted with like we freaking we roll how how they we will you embrace each other then who does look that shared experience like man I'm finally good to see it there's a little bit of energy back in the room from that time we would access here honey yeah so that I would say that I would say that's proof that honey connects people as much as does anything else oh you'd connect officers as people yeah and if some people have wanted to go away you know there's some people that want meat eating entirely to go away and they don't want animals to be consumed but I feel like where we are right now I mean I understand this longing for some utopian existence where nothing has to suffer nothing at the dock but that's not currently available it's not currently available in the wild world it's not currently available in the human world I think we have the species should do the best we can to be nice to each other but we should also understand that these animals they they do not have the capacity to understand they do not have the capacity for reason for calculation for coordination of resources these things don't exist and lanai is one of the best examples of that it's infested with deer it's great for someone once come on and here in DFO hunter it would be terrible if you are plant and or manager if your plan be read you'd be like what the fuck so every mean they had to kill off all the goats because they brought so many goats on this I on the ghost ate all the vegetation at a point where there was no more rainfall you know stop and think about that shit they ate everything it was a fucking desert they have the people that lived you like hey man we got to kill these goddamn ghost to the water comes back you know and you can't just like kumbaya them and hey guys guys gotta eat only your fair share of lettuce it doesn't really work that well so he said I am a wildlife management expert but there is like these islands like this you know coming from New Zealand last months and coming to this island of Lanai you just realize what happened to that closed ecosystem like a place where there is no opportunity for things to move on and then there just is an opportunity for for and biodiversity is like one of those important things but yeah that's you could have here so when you have one or two species dominating the landscape that's trouble yeah that is trouble and so what do you do with that point you can't like you said you can't snuggle these deer off the sign and they kill them you bring a shell of arrows yeah you bring shit look there yeah 50 area mile in a big ol Yeti good wildlife biologist and well the Department of Wildlife in California is done a very interesting thing and it's very controversial but what they've done is they've outlawed hunting predators you can't hunt mountain lions so because of that that's very few deer and because that you really don't worry about deer accidents you know deer and car accidents kill I think it's a hundred and fifty people a year and there's I think it's actually 200 people a year and 1.5 million accidents I think it's I think it's about that somewhere around there which is insane and John where you live I mean you're the perfect person talk to about that what I can be your place dude we were there during the rut and we saw a deer bouncing in front of the road left and right we saw a dead deer on the side of the road left and right I mean this people are constantly smashing and doing right oh yeah we did that on the podcast with you it says an estimated 1.2 3 million deer-vehicle collisions occurred in the u.s. between July 1 2000 in June 30th 2012 crossing more than 4 million and vehicle damage 4 billion four billion and vehicle damage according to the State Farm I'll be like damn less that's a cheap accident Wesley long 1.5 million car accident so I cross 4 million cast is amazing - what kind of cars we may develop America not an easy goddamn tanks I'll travel around Miami later later knocking these faggot deer up the road wow that's incredible 4 billion dollars a year 200 deaths and 4 billion year yeah that is truly incredible but that's an imbalanced ecosystem that's too many deer I mean it's great if you want to live in Iowa like John Dudley and wacom to zackham yeah for sure but I mean unless aliens come down spaceships and start fucking setting up lines really long I was I was not lacquered why would they come to flatter the same reason why we come to one I they can do you hesitate alien support engineer with the target Richmond they have nuclear slingshots when they like to take us out from the fucking skies oh my god like hide behind clouds can't leave indeed yeah we just got to get really good at like bobbing and weaving and the dudes of good Headroom would have 11 you hear sound very much industry how comes I'll come to whatever for year they set up okay but it looks like it in Alberta speeder like and it's like I don't know angry man all these years all of that yeah millions made in-n-out burger imagine imagine they start looking into in-n-out burger like there's no one who formed this corporation like we've gone deep it is like they're the only person have a bun all my paleo people are going yeah yes in shape actually physically superior people or they figured out how to attack the rutting elk no dams the rutting bull elk some of the humans are those big truck and some the whole food thing on the light post nothing no your burger pussy now we're like shit man all we all humans do is consume always and wait over morning consume and produce and produce I mean we look at the negative side all day but were the reasons why there's irrigation and cell phones and satellite dishes and what is good and bad and that's big-ass TV that big-ass TV that wasn't made by the world that's true I argue because all the time those hunters return to the same thing as them like they're trying to control our consumption same as you I think vegans mean well it's really good I think most of them mean well and I think most of them look at us the same way a lot of people look at a lot of things that they're ignorant to you know they did they cast these judgements on it and it's not because they're bad people it's because they just don't understand the full complexity of all the variables that are involved in this equation that is life you know emotional attachments their word Ward view like veganism is part of their emotional view of the world but the many bars that beings will open that beer with a fucking custom knock on knife ladies and gentlemen all right I before I get yelled at by my kids I got to wrap this
