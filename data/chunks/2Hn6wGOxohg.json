four three two one boom the lost art of knife-making it's still alive how are you man I'm doing good man I'm so coming down here appreciate it fucking huge I really appreciate you having me down hey listen man you've made two awesome what for awesome knives for me but this one is one I use all the time that I've posted on Instagram that people freaked out as we were talking about before the podcast it actually has meteor in it yeah meteorite what's meteors a big one meteorites a little one is that the idea do you know I guess the knife maker so I didn't actually make so I made the knife I forged a knife but the steel is a very special kind of steel that very few people can actually manufacture on a small scale in the world and that was made by my shop mate Peter Forsberg and so the meteorite is kind of a small element in the whole matrix because most meteorite is all nickel or all iron or something like that and this one particularly is a lot of nickel and some cobalt and if you're gonna make it actually usable steel out of it you can't really use a whole lot of it in the overall mixture mmm so is there any meteorites that are made at all iron yeah definitely you just have to find them you gotta find the ones yeah and they're their impact sites all over the world like they're hitting the world all the time where is it can you just take them like when they land is it yours if you find it you don't have to report it to NASA or anything yeah no hey bro found some space junk most of them are so small that they by the time they get here hit the actual Earth's surface they've completely disintegrated or burned up so it's the really massive ones and this was part of an impact I think in South America oh I can't remember where it's just crazy to think that this is a piece of space in there Bucky and Ian there's dope pattern I'm really into craftsmanship man I always have been I of handmade pool cues and this desk which is a handmade desk and I feel like it's one of the things that I really appreciate in this modern digital world and I also feel like unfortunately it may be one of the things that's slipping away it definitely is slipping away I think with um you know with technology technologies have been great for us in a lot of different ways like we couldn't be fucking talking into a piece of metal right and it's recorded on my computer like it does a lot of great things but in doing all those great things it actually has taken us away from really creating and working with our hands and so like you know even this whole like farm-to-table movement or people even grow on their own vegetables you got your own chickens you there they're laying eggs for you like knowing where this stuff is coming from having like firsthand contact with that just having that relationship in general with it brings so much more value to the overall experience of eating those eggs or using that knife or sitting at this fucking table right and it seems like a fairly recent movement in that direction right like it feels like things got so digital that people like whoa whoa whoa with the Facebook and the fuckin Instagram I want you know I want a wood table yeah I want to saw this band myself yeah yeah I don't wanna be your master yeah I want real stuff and there's something about handmade things whether it's a handmade pair of boots our handmade bag like this like there's something about things that are made by hand that people get a like a deep appreciation of from for sure well and I think I think it also kind of goes back like I was saying like as technology is advanced we've kind of grown away from these kind of what's considered like blue-collar work yeah a craftsmanship kind of work but I think people really are driven by a sense of achievement and when you're doing data entry that literally millions of people fucking monkeys can be trained to do it not today like diminishing anything that anybody's doing but literally like to be able to go into a craft and to and have a hands-on experience is very very very very different and that sense of achievement even when somebody comes out of something and maybe I taught a class on how to make a knife and it looks like a fucking turd they're gonna think it looks like the most beautiful fucking knife they've ever seen in their life because their hands and their creatively they've touched their energy their their sweat and pop probably some of their blood is put into creating that thing and that brings that much more value to it yeah I think that's an issue with people today that have jobs that they don't feel are very fulfilling is that there's no real thing that they're creating at the end where it's like if you make a table at the end when you're putting the final sanding on and the final you know layer of stain and you're looking at it like I fucking made this like this is a real thing that I can touch that I made just like human beings in our current form we have a there's a deep connection to making things physical things in a booth and and and an appreciation for things that people have made whether it's a rifle that somebody made or a knife or you know a hammer or that's that someone's made there's something about that that we we just have a real appreciation for if you can buy us a knife from the store that's made in a I mean it'll work you know some knife that's made some mass manufacturing process it'll work and it's fine I mean you appreciate it but you won't appreciate it like I appreciate this thing like every time I take this out I'm like super careful with it and you know and then the handle the handles made outta this is a moose antler an elk antler right there right at the top and the moose at the bottom so and I saw your conversation or listening your conversation with Guy Ritchie and you brought up that it there was I think actually Jamie pulled it up and it was like bog oak and Guy Ritchie was like bog Oh what bog are their American bogs there I don't know if there are any American bogs it was from a bog in Russia and it was carbon dated to 5,400 years old geez essentially it's been sunken and about that's the other knife that you made for me yeah that has a handle me SOG that's house one to get a hold of bago so people are raising logs like there actually was a show I think it was on Discovery Channel or history where people were their job was raising logs out of the bog swamps down in Louisiana and and using making use of that wood for table projects and projects like this so that but that's happening all over the world and some of that stuff are these ancient logs that have you know it's the right and conditions where the log the tree falls over it just sits there and steeps and you know that's a big thing for the pool cue shafts Lake wood shafts they like to take these logs out of the bottom like Lake Michigan or something right and then they dry it all out and then they make shafts out of it and there's something about it being in the bottom of the water for so long it does something to the to the way they feel what do you got there Jamie that's ancient bog wood artisan dice oh yeah that's that's nerd shit right there sunny super polished up that looks cool are those dungeons and Dragon nerds dice sortie and ice melt decided yeah yeah now what would that was only for a game right you wouldn't play dice dice yeah they're actually like value holders for the most part value holders would yeah so like sixteen so they count down with the Dyson so they have an actual placeholder sitting there that says 16 15 20 or whatever oh you understand Dungeons & Dragons you might be a dork brother my brother-in-law is Magic the Gathering oh that's super dork that's for people that get kicked out of the dungeons of Dragon it's different iteration of chess really I mean it's just it's all strategy he's definitely not that what is this oh that's a beautiful handle you know I'll baring mean that kids in Montana really good guy he's a nice kid mmm met him a couple years ago in in Eugene actually they do a knife show there every said that image he just showed Jamie that's bog oak that's some other like big chunks of it that they pulled out Wow interesting so there must be the community of you people these these knife making people yeah there there are quite a few people who have started getting into the knife making knife making the world making really they're the the resurgence of kind of crafted hand forged knives kind of started back in the 70s and it was a stemmed off from I think it's a custom knife making Association or yeah custom knife makers Association and then it stemmed off to the ABS which is American bladesmith society and that was all about the forged blade and kind of the mission to retain that knowledge in that history and and the skills that go into actually taking a piece of metal and forging a blade out of it like your blades they were forged to shape they wear a one approach is to just take a bar steel mm-hmm trace out of line cut that out or a stockman it's totally valid way of doing it forging the forging aspect especially if somebody doesn't actually know what they're doing they're just like heating up a piece of steel they don't know how fucking hot it is getting they don't know how when to stop hitting it they may be hitting it too cold they may be overheating it and hitting it while it's way too hot they could really actually do detrimental damage to the material and turn out a piece of shit so the forged aspect really just brings kind of an aesthetic and kind of a depth of story to help bring kind of more to that product well it's another level right yeah it's just another layer of it yeah it's not just handcrafting something from a you know just a piece of metal that you bought you put all the pieces together and polish it down and sanded it when did you get into this so I that's a kind of a funny story so I got into this back in 2008 is when I met Bob Kramer at the time I was working in a restaurant actually in my hometown of Olympia and I was working a restaurant I was moonlighting as an assistant salsa dancing instructor and doing like like community performances and shit like that and I was 24 and I didn't know what the hell I was doing with myself and I didn't really have much of a direction in my life I was terrible at school you know I had maybe 40 credits toward his towards an a aim but I don't even have him like an actual certification or a degree of and so anyways I was I was sharing this with my dance partner and she had just started working for this guy who was a knife maker and she's like oh you should meet him he's really interesting you know you kind of feel like you lost he's been all over the world he's even like he was even a clown at one point his framer yeah he should be a clown he was a clown I think for a year for Ringling Barnum Bailey and from what I understand it was a great experience and he loved it and but anyways she's like you know I think you guys would hit it off I think you know maybe he could help bestow some wisdom as to where you're at and where he was at and maybe what kind of choices or options you have ahead of you and so I met up with him at the brew pub that I was actually working at and got some beers got some fish and chips sitting bullshitting and it ended up turning into a job opportunity neither of us really went into it knowing that that's the direction it was gonna go but he was anticipating he had an article coming out in The New Yorker like in a month and that was gonna really like blow his shit up and he had had a couple big articles like in savour magazine and he was featured in I cook still Illustrated at one point and each time like there's a huge influx and so I think him and part of anticipation for that he's like look you seem like a nice guy you don't really seem to have a direction maybe we could work something out I can't make any promises to you that I have full-time work for you so he just took you on as an apprentice essentially I saw a video with him Anthony Bourdain that's how I found out about him he was making a knife with meteors right meat with a piece of meteorite in it as well same kind of thing and I remember thinking like wow crazy is this this guy's hammering this thing together and put into that that was like one of the ways that I got interested in custom knife making sure him an ID always had knives you know like pocket knives you know right and I always like kind of thought they were cool and enjoyed them yeah but until I watched that video I didn't realize that there was a lot of people out there there it is yeah him and Anthony I didn't realize there was a lot of people that are out there doing this from scratch and then you know then I was like oh I gotta get a knife and then then I saw your page on Instagram and I remember thinking wow this guy does some wild shit and I don't remember how you and I got to chatting I don't remember I just remember seeing your stuff on Instagram you reached out to me on email and I was like was it the email was it a yeah Instagram message actually not sure I think it was the email email either way from your website yeah yeah yeah oh you had seen my email in one of the previous conversations but I was like this can't be like the joke yeah and then as the conversation continued on and I was like because you also your picture for the emails like this goofy picture of you doing like kissy face or something like that fucking hilarious and I was like holy shit I think this actually might be Joe Rogan this is crazy and but it's doing this craft and doing this work and and finding and connecting with people who have an appreciation for the actual like the actual work that goes into it and appreciating that value has been you know I met like even five years ago when I first started under my own brand there's no way I would have thought I'd be sitting here hanging out with you guys it's kind of a been a crazy ride for me well that's crazy right for me too man all of it is life's crazy but like I said I've always had a deep appreciation for artisans you know for for art but I think this I think your knife making is art I mean I really do like look at this as jamie's pulled up an image from your website it shows this incredible blade design now this is what I've always wanted to know like is that Damascus steel is that what that is that is Damascus and this just a quick note this is actually a post that I did to celebrate another maker his name is Julian you can actually kind of see it there on the right margin now he's a South American kid the blade the blades that you made that you have here today that you had that you're bringing with you for an auction those the patterns on those things are fucking insane how do you do that like how do you make these because it's not just steel for people that are just listening to this like that one is a great example right I would really love for people who are just listening to just please go spout go spread out go back to the page Jamie so I could see the headline shame it's stuck what do you mean you can't shrink it what happened oh the touchpad these goddamn we got an old-ass laptop there ma you ma s fire arts and ma si si ma you ma si fire arts ma Massey fire art so get stuck again Mau Mau mas I fire arts if you go there that's his page you'll be able to check it out and order books are closed you're fucked yeah yeah I'm I'm at 3 years right now and I just kind of like I had to shut it down because it's kind of at an overwhelming point yeah bit like it's a good problem but it's overwhelming because it's ya know and balancing doing the work with now that you know like the marketing and branding maintaining relevance through social media and taking the time to create content on top of all that it I mean especially when you're first starting to do it the content part side of it it fucking time time consider that's a crazy like long waiting list man three years yeah and really it's actually in at least in the knife making world it's not uncommon for people to actually wait longer than that it's the same thing with the pool cue world right this is the exact same thing a lot of these famous pool cue manufacturers like Southwest or sugar tree and then they have ten year waiting lists and it's just because they do it right it takes a long time everything's done by hand right they're highly sought after and because of that like you could buy a pool cue from you know a company that makes them through you know computerized process and they're fine they play really good just like a knife that you'd buy from a store that's a you know made by a machine and it's all done mass manufacturing it'll cut your meat it works great yeah it gets the job done yeah doesn't feels the same thing doesn't fit it's crazy like you can feel the difference yeah between a handmade thing and a machine made thing yeah it's it's bizarre it trips me out every time well this little something that people leave in things that they make I mean there really is I mean I think it exists in everything that people make whether it's clothing a jewelry or furniture or anything I mean I think there's a little something that people leave when they in in the thing that they make what there's something you talk about sometimes about how animals inherit like passed down through genes like watch out for this plant I'll watch out for these predators or shit like that like passing something on like that kind of in a way like where I'm toiling over something like that for you know 40 dedicated solid fucking hours making sure it's as perfect as I possibly can make that thing at this point in my life mm-hmm the skills I got and I I think there's something to that I mean even if it's just a thought even if you just know when you touch it like if I touch this knife I know that you made this you know when I'm when I'm cutting something with this and I'm cooking I know that you made this so maybe it's just even if it's only in my head it's still it just feels different you know and I uh I don't know I mean there's there's Rupert Sheldrake who's a I know exactly kind of scientist he is but he has this bizarre theory and he's a really interesting guy to talk to so I would never discount it he thinks that everything has memory he thinks he just you just can't access that memory but he thinks there's things that have memories and he thinks that our idea that memory is something that only animals and humans possess is is just it's probably not true and that that's probably one of the reasons why people don't want to buy a house where someone was murdered you know like the idea is that a haunted house even if it's not really a ghost like maybe that home has memories yeah you know maybe yeah like my dad went to Gettysburg and he's not whoo-whoo at all he's like as fucking straitlaced across the board no bullshit as against and he said man you could feel sadness there he goes you just think of how many thousands of people died at Gettysburg and he said when you were there it's just it feels sad like you feel death care yeah I don't know if that's real or if it's maybe the knowledge that you have that there was a war there I mean I don't know I I used to do this thing where I would walk through cemeteries um just interested like looking at people's names right and like when when did they live and what do people have to say about them or what you know what's left behind and just walking through cemeteries like sometimes I would even do it on Halloween to treasure and it definitely feels weird in there yeah and I used to run through cemeteries I just a run through them because I would I would want to be reminded that life is short get something done may have something happen yeah tell all these people that aren't here anymore but the thing about cemeteries it's like they're dead when they get in there I think like the memory thing is like you know if you're on a boat and someone gets murdered on that boat you're in the boat and you're like fucking freaking out there's something about like things like if you had a thing if you had a wallet that Mike Tyson owned you know what I mean you'd hold it like damn you know there's something to it morphic resonance okay that's Rupert Sheldrake's theory according to a theory developed by Rupert Sheldrake British biologist paranormal influenced by which a pattern of events or behavior can facilitate subsequent occurrences of similar patterns oh that's right that is that is not about it memory that is that was his other theory it's referred to and a lot of other ways memory is inherent in nature yeah yeah I think that's a part of it like I think what I was talking about is part of his theory of morphic residents but morphic residents I think he's he yeah is here it says that hold on scroll back it's called uh so the process whereby self-organizing systems inherent a memory from previous similar systems so when he was talking about with morphic residence was how mice if they learn like say if you have a pattern and there's like cheese at the end of this pattern and then they go through a maze if one Mouse figures out that pattern other Mouse can figure it out quicker and there's something somehow or another they learn from each other right and when chimpanzees were observed using tools other chimpanzees on the other side of the world started mimicking that behavior without any interaction with those chimpanzees at all yeah yeah yeah very strange that's like fucking butterfly thanks well it's more intense than butterfly effect because it implies that there's some sort of collective information pool that they're sharing through the ether that there's some something that they're sharing through some unknown method as crazy yeah well it's been a it's it's actually been shown that there is some sort of there's something to this and there's a lot of criticism of it so if you're one of those people right now that's like a strict materialist and you're screaming out I get it I get it someone who's a real rationalist who just wants only science provable the thing is it is kind of provable because there's there is there has been some tasks and there's fierce opposition to this which is anything that has like some woowoo attached to it or some fierce opposition but Rupert was a really fascinating guy and he's also a rare scientist that's he he was he was Christian is that what it was he's really into it he has a certain level of Christianity that he accepts and adopts because he feels like it's beneficial to him very interesting guy yeah that's yeah I did a podcast a few years back yeah he's a trip him and there was a mathematician and Terence Mckenna who's the other gentleman they were it was the trial logs they had these fantastic recordings it was Sheldrake McKenna and one other guy was also brilliant and they would go back and forth they had these ralph abraham abraham Abrams or Abraham Abraham Abraham and they they did these series of talks and this is one of the things that came up like McKenna was the most whoo-whoo Ralph Abraham was the least whoo-whoo and Sheldrick was kind of in the middle right yeah interesting stuff of your yeah fishing around yeah the trial logs there it is there the recordings are still available somewhere I think our friend psychedelic salon I think Lorenzo has them are they available online oh there you go BAM sound fun yeah they're fucking cool man actually play it I don't know why you can't play it yeah that is the case look I got it removed mmm yeah someone's probably selling it yeah it's really cool though they're you know you get to see these guys in the 1990s pre-internet was it pre-internet might not have been it might be like 98 I think McKenna died around 2000 - he died post - honest I see he died like 2003 or something when did he die why am I asking this this is all about memory and things this is we went on the fucking deep rode off was here but anybody who's listening mm yeah so he made it to y2k and then he kicked the bucket anybody who's just interested in really cool conversations it was something to listen to yeah that sounds very interesting yeah just three super smart dudes kind of debating ideas and bounce them around off each other you know what I've actually gotten into recently is listening to old recordings of like Alan Watts oh yeah oh he was great reading Joseph Campbell yes like ya know just absorbing it and trying to figure out what that means to me today mm-hmm and this like the hearing world yeah yeah Watts is a fascinating guy Plus that accent made him sound so much cooler yeah drone I would and remember you know he's actually the first time I ever gotten to a good like like a meditative space was a meditation led by Alan Watts from I don't know one fucking room like 60 70s and just the way he explained it for me like it was the first time it ever made sense how meditation should he's like don't try to not think of anything but just accept them that they're there and but mm-hmm also ignore them at the same time yeah it was weird and then I just totally like I felt like I was above myself watching me it's just sitting there listening to this recording as a trip well you're such a heady guy the sound of his voice and just hearing his thoughts when you when you hear a really deep thinker like him one of the things that it does is kind of gets you into that pattern of thought and you realize like oh I can probably kind of sort of think that way too I just allow myself to be guided by his words and sort of try to pay attention to how he's doing this yeah he's um he was an interesting guy because not just was he a deep thinker but his the the influences of those people it's it's very different like there's very few recordings even back then for them to listen to you know this stuff was based on reading and their education and their actual life experiences so they were very unique and original they were really the cornerstones for a lot of these deep philosophical ideas you know and so then when you hear in Alan Watts recording today you know maybe someone like me or some other people that listen to that they might might share those ideas or reflect on those ideas but clearly these are not my ideas these are ideas that have come from these intense Cornerstone people whether it's McKenna Alan Watts or something like that do you get a chance while you're when you're working do you listen to shit or do you just yeah I got all the time to sit in the headphones or because yeah it seems like it'd be loud as fuck yeah so I just got a hold of these like Bluetooth head head like earbuds and they have like this memory phone so they are memory foam earbud like tips so helps reduce the amount of noise that's actually coming in so it helps protect in that way just kind of in general like a normal like in inner ear plug would work but also because it's reducing the amount of noise that's getting in you can also listen at a lower volume so you're not like blowing out your ears to be able to hear mmm whatever you're listening to went through normal ear buds right he's so loud in your shop yeah yeah so much noise it's whenever I'm working like especially if somebody happens to pop by the shop and they want to see and like they're just curious and so we have stuff going on or we can heat some steel up real quick and do quick demonstration usually I don't take the time to throw all that stuff in fuck it is so loud I actually feel like my hearing has become more sensitive since I started in making knives than it was before probably your ears getting beat up well not always have earplugs in I always have hearing protection and so so my hearing is always protected so I feel like it's become more sensitive I've a better sense of here I don't know if that's possible to get your hearing back or whatever but maybe you're protecting it and it's doing better because of that yeah I just I hear a lot of things like all the things it feels like whenever I take my hearing that you're in hearing protection out I'll be at home or something and I'm like what's that noise my wife's looks at me like I'm fucking crazy what is the case and what if like maybe it's like you know people don't use their hands and then the hands get soft you can't gain it back okay but you might be protecting it longer since your have a sensitivity issue maybe since it's quieter all day so if you blow it out for my concerts and shit like that that's it I saw there was a lot you can do is get a hearing aid little some shit because it's literally what you're hearing with is a like a hair follicle it's vibrating yeah you blow that shit out they haven't synthetically made those yet or hair regrow them yet I feel so bad for those old rock stars it didn't know any better and now they're just fucking Huey Lewis can't play anymore all of a sudden that's the Lord's work just kidding just kidding it's hip to be square yeah man's fucked up like the dude from ac/dc who else yeah Angus is gone oh Jesus Rain deaf yeah fucking everybody's going deaf yeah they also probably didn't protect themselves when you should have nobody know you better back then have you ever seen that documentary it's an older one Oh older one it was like from the early 2000s but this woman she progressively got deaf our endeavour as she grew older until like I think she in high school or something like she was like practically completely deaf but she's a percussionist and she's like a world-renowned percussionist there's this awesome documentary is called touched this sound and she hears through her body which is a trips me out but the tones that she's able to achieve the control she has over everything whatever kind of instrument she's playing it's it's like awesome documentary Wow but she has almost literally no hearing she hears everything through her body too so it's kind of interesting to think like if Angus could figure that shit out then I mean he's holding the fucking thing that's handball but just Angus the lead singer right who's the what's the lead singer's name fuck's his damn second lead singer Brian Johnson never forget that he's gone deaf to Angus in Brian and and Angus is like always head banging what kind of CTE does that guy have I mean fucking Christ you shouldn't be doing that God you were talking to DVD about that the other day yeah I was I was thinking like all through high school like I played football from seventh grade all through high school and like all the stuff they're learning now I'm just like Jesus yeah fuck was happening to me to see any use we always led with our head mm-hmm of course yeah my neck was always all kinds of fucked up mm-hmm and you know I definitely had some serious concussions I'm sure and yeah sometimes it scares me and worries me a little bit like what does that mean for sure how will you know 34 yeah man just turned 34 um it's scary you know you're lucky stopped when you did I know I know a lot of people with brain damage me too I'm sure I have some I'd guaranteed at most I mean I don't think anybody rides for free I think you get hit in the head enough you got some brain damage you know I got in the head on a regular basis for most most of my younger years from like 15 to like 22 yeah I got hit in the head all the time it's just nobody knew any better you know and back then you thought that like once you got like once you're slurring your words and stuff if you just stopped like he's a little punchy should stop right that's how people thought but they didn't realize that it's regressive and then like you don't even really show brain damage like ten years after the initial injuries right that's when you really start showing damage so some some CTE just compounds it until it just becomes unmanageable for these poor people yeah yeah well it's I actually I can't especially after watching concussion and and seeing and reading like articles about the real life people that this shit's happened to I like I have a hard time watching football like I used to watch football all the time I've never been like crazy into sports knowing all the stats and every stuff I enjoyed watching like a good contest I never really rooted for anybody but now when I see like even kids signing to the draft or signing up from high school to go to a certain college I'm like man that's somebody's fucking baby yeah fucking tearing themselves up like is that worth it yeah I I would like poor kids fighting way before I would support kids doing football and both of them might be nervous about and you know I mean there's other stuff like X Games type shit put her into extreme sports and you know people that are in the snowboarding snowboarders wipe out all the time and crack their head open what can you get a scholarship and martial arts of any kind like college just wrestling I mean that's like a big that's a big driver right there though right breast that's where the my wrestling certainly a martial art it's probably one of the most important martial arts probably right yeah that's it I mean judo maybe is there a school that has judo they used to have boxing in schools I mean him back in like fifties and sixties and shit there was but boxing was a legitimate sport in college but not anymore yeah yeah yeah it just I can't really watch it anymore I mean you have to be careful like with your hand-eye coordination and your fingers and shit now you know I mean you you gotta think like when you're working with hammers and hot metal and you must always have to be kind because everybody that works at machine shops missing that fingertip something's fucked up there's crazy stories to like buffer the buffer like Luffy little things yeah one of the most dangerous things because it catches an edge just like if you're snowboarding you catch a bad edge man it it bites the blade bites into that and it acts as a hand and just rips it and flings it wherever oh it's thrown knives right back in the guys and fucking kill them oh fuck yeah my wife probably hate me see that right yeah yeah I've done I've actually done a lot of work to get away from using buffers because of that and I'm still like doing great work I just I have a lot of friends who just they'll never touch a fucking buffer and because it's just terrifying it's scary what does it look like for pigs i don't ii put up like what would you call it maybe shine like a a buffing shit i don't know usually it's like usually it's like a benchtop thing like a bench grinder usually has like the hard wheat round stone wheel on one side of it that's it right there those motherfuckers yes it's not one fucking nice you're just gonna go that looks like something so if you fucked up and you got that blade to close you know kick it and then so that one is is what's called a sisal wheel so it's it's made from a type that type of rope but the ones that are the most dangerous are the softer cotton wheels because they want to grab that much easier they have more give but yeah it's and what's interesting is I've actually been cut less working in a in a metal shop than I ever did working in and burned less than I ever did working in kitchens I worked in restaurants back a house like for seven years collectively and most of that has to do with other people not calling like hot coming across fucking I turn around they don't call it I turn around they're there with this fucking saute pan right in the side of my arm I'm ready to fucking drop it right but it's being in a metal shop like you said you do have to pay so much attention you have to be focused at what you're doing because literally everything in that fucking shop wants to hurt you or kill you the second you're not paying attention the second you're not paying attention it's gonna grab you like there are horror stories of people working next to machines and they have long hair and it just fucking reps scalps and like straighten terrible stuff a fighter and the power tool last week oh yeah you got a power tool stuck in his balls who was that yeah yeah Brian Wilson yeah drill that he lost his hearing due to not putting in ear plugs at a car race not music specifically he there was a quote Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys Brian Wilson from the Beach Boy I'm sorry he this article has him at the top Brian Johnson Oh Brian John SIA from cars yeah well how the fuck does he know another fuckers in ac/dc I mean wouldn't you think that'd be loud too bro Angus Young says it he lost a little bit but his quote says that he never really had a problem with it that's why it was running around on stage so much too it's never in one one place that's hilarious concert oversize ac/dc I wonder if people are more susceptible just like some people are more susceptible to CTE yeah remember Rhonda Patrick was talking about certain genes that you have what is it apropos I forget what it was called but whatever genes that make you more susceptible and more likely to get C teehee from concussions yeah I've been out to be something probably makes sense now when you're in that shop and you're you're you're you're doing all this grinding is there any concern about chemicals like is their chemical ingestion or smells in the air it's like that because you're you're dipping things and got all this stuff that using yeah specially for you were working with synthetic any any material that you're grinding you're making it it's airborne like any of it can go onto your lungs I'm almost always wearing a respirator oh wow especially when I'm grinding and it's like double can always like does it work does a respirator filter out all of it it makes a huge difference in fact where I have my facial hair right now even this a little bit what you got even that little bit is enough to create a little gap and they can get through that so you have to shave your face move yeah usually I keep it pretty well now how the fuck do you create those patterns like Damascus steel what what is that oh this doesn't have too much about it's not the Damascus steel fortune yeah it's beautiful now what what does create those like that how do you do that we're looking at a crazy image that looks like it almost looks like someone drew on it yeah this is this is a pattern that just came up with recently it's called I call it the braid mosaic for lack of better term but it just looks like a braid and it's something I've been wanting to create and finally figured out so essentially what to create pattern-welded Damascus first off Damascus is kind of a blanket has become a blanket term traditionally and originally it actually referred to the steel that like thick type of steel that your knife this knife the meteor knife is made from and it eventually became a blanket term for all kinds of kind of pattern steel in general whether it's it curls naturally or if it's kind of forced and created the way that braid pattern was made so that's pattern welded steel so you have to start with at least two different types of high carbon steel ideally Steel's that heat treat in a similar range when you heat them up and squish on them they they move at a similar rate and so most commonly people are working with ten eighty and 15 and 20 those are just codes for two different types of high carbon steel but essentially you bring them up to a high temperature you you squish them either under a big hammer or under a press you can even actually do it by hand but you have to do kind of a smaller billet to create the patterns and get it to stick because the trick is really getting getting them close even evenly squishing it out and it's like if you've ever like rolled out dough or anybody who's never made like pastry dough like you would use in a croissant you tear open a croissant you see all those layers in there and that's from a piece of dough being rolled out full it'll rolled out and so it's kind of the same fucking thing but with metal but you have to have the kind of the right kind of temperature environment kind of you you want as little oxygen in there as possible because the oxygen creates carbon or not carbon but iron oxide that help kind of is detrimental to creating solid weld bonds and there are different ways to achieve that but once the 1080 is the black steel the black color and the 15 and 20 is the is the silver color and then what's the difference in the way those Steel's perform harder or more durable they pretty much an edge more they pretty much form perform almost exactly the same they're they're in fact chemically speaking they're almost exactly the same except for the 15 and 20 has a high level of nickel in it 0.2 percent by volume or by weight and so that steel is traditionally used in saw blades especially large big mill band saws you know like an organ there's like one of the oldest and continuously running a wood saw mill is still there and doing its thing with these giant bandsaw blades that are like 30 feet and I are in circumference and they're like foot wide and there's monsters and foot wide you mean like thick no no no like they're only like maybe a sixteenth of an inch thick because you want a narrow soccer so you're not wasting material but they're why to help out of it okay flexion so the bandsaw I'm thinking of a circular saw for some reason sorry yeah bandsaw so the circular saw those saw kerf SAR usually probably around Ethernet H to a quarter of an inch thick but it's the same kind of idea is that they're trimming down these giant logs so they mind a big fucking saw so whether it's a grind and break man it must be a fucking nightmare yeah you don't want to be standing right there when have you seen an original samurai sword I've seen a few actually this one's from the 1500s check this shit out that's it oh shit this is the one that I'm mister and Neil deGrasse Tyson was closing what the other day yeah that's an actual real samurai sword right right from the 1500s let's see the race skin is nice yeah do you know when it was made exactly I don't think they know they just know it's from some time period in the 1500s but there's a certificate of authentication they came with it explains I'm just looking to see what the hormone activity thing so the hormone is you can kind of see this line that runs parallel to the cutting edge and that usually indicates where the soft material stops and the hard material starts and so the idea with these kind of the challenge with any knife is making a knife that takes and holds a sharp edge right for a good period of time what's the key to that but is also tough which means like you can drop it and dry on a break so I give you one of the hunting knife or something like that so a hunting knife that's commotion I blow away knives those are harder working knives so you want to actually bring that hardness down you don't have to bring it down a ton but just a few points will make a huge fucking difference look how's Mike here yeah exactly what's the difference in the way that knife is made and this knife is so they were tempered they were heat treated the same so they were brought up to like 1500 degrees for people don't not listening not watching this one of these knives is a hunting knife that how does that feel by the way it's great man I love it yeah but it's it's made very similarly if you look into the the video of it the handle is the same and it looks it looks very similar it has a different knife guard though it's pretty cool oh yeah the guard keeps yet keeps your hand from sliding up yeah I like that we made the handle too it's an interesting handle curved and everything yeah where'd you get that pattern for like yeah so I'm sorry to the first question I'm sorry I remember like what is the difference okay yeah yeah so they were hardened so the heat treating the whole process is essentially heating up the steel make it hard and then you put it back into heat but a low much lower temperature to kind of toughen it up mmm and so you're pulling some of that hardness back so they were hardened the same way but they were tempered at different temperatures because one is a hard used knife while the chef's knife is not a hard use what is the difference between temper and what like what does that mean so the tempering so essentially so I hardened it so I bring it up to 1,500 degrees which is like a dull glowing orange color and then I dip it in a special oil that I have that's designed for quenching materials not just in knife making but all kinds of different industrial applications punching materials oil sorry quenching oil what does that mean so that's cooling the this hot steel down in a very short period of time and you wenching it oil so is it a cold oil no so actually the depending on how the steel needs to be heat treated you actually want to heat up the oil so that it's it's thinner and it also there's this thing that's called a vapor jacket so if you've ever like been next to a wood-burning stove and you drop a little water on it and you see that bead water dance around on there the same thing happens on the surface of the blade except for the blade is the source of the heat right you put it in that oil all that oil is dancing around on it so when that's the oils thinner it it's not as large of a jacket because when that jacket is large so Jack in encasing that steel while it's trying to cool down it actually kind of acts as an insulator and ruin or could potentially ruin so not only do you put it in the oil but you want to agitate it to kind of break up that jacket so it doesn't get a chance to just sit there all the way around the blade and if it was cold it would it would be thicker and so it would make a larger jacket actually and also the it probably wouldn't be as efficient I guess in cooling the steel down because ideally like for most Steel's you want to cool them down pretty much as quickly as you possibly can so these have sorry so we keep going I was gonna say you you essentially have depending on what kind of Steel you're working with you have anywhere from half a second to like five seconds to get it from 1500 degrees or sometimes higher to below 800 degrees and so this knife would be more durable durable yeah tougher so in in knife making commonly refer to it as being tougher so it can withstand coming into impact with bone you could chop with that thing a lot more efficiently with a tougher knife because this hasn't been tempered at it as as high of a temperature it's it's much harder than this one even though it's a few points those few points make a big difference and so if you were to take this out into the woods try to do the same job as this one just snap the cutting it it wouldn't necessarily snap but parts the cutting edge would blow out probably blowing chips I actually recently just from time to time it's good practice as a knife maker to make sure you that you're still doing your thing every your heat-treating stuff all right I take a knife and I just beat the shit out of it first I chop through some wood and then I actually took it to an antler and beat the shit out of it too and it's it is amazing that if you're doing things right you know ten thousandths of an inch is enough to really to withstand impact of chopping through wood pretty well of course unless you're coming into contact with like super yeah nail or super dense knots that's crazy because it's so thin right it's one that's actually at least especially along the cutting edge that's probably twice as thick as it actually needs to be Wow which is crazy but it just it comes down to the material mm-hmm not everybody are a lot of people mistakenly think you know steal a steal a steal a steal or whatever but they're not steel is made for many different applications and they're actually very specifically designed for those applications so like a structural steel this kind of stuff that you know buildings are built out of very different from this it doesn't have very much carbon in it at all that way so the carbon is what helps make these really hard so lacking that carbon it allows it to be way tougher so you can bend it all fucking day long so now exactly right so that's why you want it for buildings in LA where the earthquakes hit they wiggle a little bit yeah yeah this is much thinner than a lot of other hunting knives would be which is interesting you know with your use of this exotic metal and now your methods you're able to do that well and also part of the reason that you're able to do that is because it's high carbon steel it has a which means it has a high volume of carbon comparatively then other kind of kinds of tool or cutlery steel what's the benefit of high carbon versus carbon so high carbon allows you to especially for the the meteorites deal it's it's a kind of crucible steel called whoot and so the patterning you've seen there is actually strands of carbon or carbide material so all the extra carbon floating around in the matrix the iron matrix of this steel jumps on to these bands called carbides and there are different elements and vanadium is one of the elements in this steel that draws those carbon that carbon in so what you're seeing are thousands and thousands of all these ultra hard carbon bands floating around through the iron matrix do you watch Game of Thrones I do when they have like swords that I made a Valyrian steel just you're pissed off you the fucker you fake magic no well and what's interesting back in the day the shit was fucking magical right they didn't understand what was going on now how did they learn I mean what is the history I mean obviously that sword there's from the 1500s but you know from back in the Roman gladiator days and I mean how did they understand how to do this so the steel that they were using in Europe was not really that great it was not the best shit Japanese Japanese were pretty fucking good yeah as well as the Persians and the Indians Vikings material wasn't the greatest wasn't too barbaric no it's it's just it comes down to what they had available to them right yeah so who was like the pioneer of like really durable badass sword material was it Japanese so probably so the Japanese and the Persian / Indonesian Persians swords are probably the most legendary we know they're the ones where like it could cut through silk floating in the air and shit like that why is that what did they do different so it's so the Persian steel is still very very very similar to these meteorite so it's a crew so it starts it's called a crucible steel and so essentially there's this clay jar essentially called a crucible people mount all kinds of stuff in it but you can male melt steel in it as well and so they were making these ingots of crucible steel and then forging them out and they really really very heavily relied on these carbide bins floating through the material because unfortunately they didn't really have a very advanced way of quenching that steel so that not only do they have the bans but they also had hard iron matrix as well that those bands were floating in so they really relied on those that banding so they just learned from trial and error of thousands of years of experimenting with different materials and different locations they got the iron from and different things that they added to it to make steel yep absolutely and that's why you know you even watching Game of Thrones or other kind of medieval or movie set in medieval times you know there were very specific makers who were the best who could really make this shit happen and it's just because they had a tradition passed down to them and you know all that a lot of that stuff was very fictional but in in the real world that was the same thing you know you had very specific lineages of people who had the you know of essentially the most advanced technology and skills and techniques for creating the most highest performing weaponry essentially of the time which was like the currency of the fucking time somebody went to Japan fairly recently and and filmed them working with a high-level sword maker for a television show trying to remember who it was it was someone famous but it was really badass they they went to this sword maker shop and you know I mean he's doing the whole thing hammering it all out and and building the samurai sword from scratch the way it's always been yeah there are a few of those documentaries on YouTube there is you got to do something you got to do a little bit of digging to find them I actually just watched the a few of them like in the last five years I do not recall what they're you think you're gonna make it samurai sword one of these days I might do it eventually just I mean I'm always gonna do chef's knives because that's what I like that's the tool I know the most that's what I'm with the biggest like market right there's a giant I mean poor super foodies yeah you know well it's not only that like but if you think about it like no Mouse we murders you know there's a lot of mystique around Japanese swords or even the american bowie knife as well as you know Viking swords and but nowadays you know people have that shit made but you know it goes on a wall the things that are really getting used are like a hunting knife and a chef's knife yeah and you know cooking knives are used like almost literally in every single household around the world every day brian year-round yeah and it's what's interesting is because of its ubiquity to our everyday life it lacks that mystique because we see the shit every day mm-hmm we don't think much of it versus a Japanese sword people walk in here and they're like pork well I tell you one thing man when people come over my house and I'm cooking and they go where the fuck did you get that night that happens all the time I mean it's either this one or the other one when I show them the bog oak one the same thing they're like dude now in terms of like this one or the other one that you made me the other hunting knife that you me out of Damascus yeah which one is like tougher more durable so they've been heat-treated to perform very very very similarly so the basic you dissin you to essentially have to destroy them to really determine which one i'll perform this oh you have to stick it in a bowl and try to break it yeah essentially use it how it's not supposed to be funny and but it cut it keeps an edge so well man it's crazy I mean I get nervous every time I touch the blade I mean this thing slices through things yeah now there's got to be an art to actually sharpening things too right oh for sure and how do you know like the right angle to approach sharpening its I mean there are a lot there are actually a lot of great information online there especially in big cities like Seattle la New York Austin there at Portland as well they're super reputable people not only who will offer service but usually offer lessons as well I suggest like if you can't afford it you know you can dig around you can find the stuff online but it's not the same as having essentially having a coach next to you saying uh or yeah that's great that's perfect that's where you want to be doing that you do you sharpen both sides I do so you sharpen the top and the bottom I'm sorry you mean the sides of the steel like would you sharpen it like this and then flip it off yes yeah now what are those things and they have those metal things for people Shang Shang Shang yeah so those those ones seem like I'm like that looks brutal I wouldn't do that to a good knife it so my right thinking that way well it depends on the the type of Steel that your knifes made from and then what the material is that those rods are made from so those are commonly referred to as sharpening rods or sharpening sticks but the reality is they're not actually sharpening what are they doing so they're more accurately referred to as honing rods so what's happening at you I'm sorry at the cutting edge of your knife is you have all these micro serrations essentially if you go take take it under a microscope and look at the cutting edge it looks like a saw blade mmm but they're like they're fucking microns I'm micron is a millionth of a meter like they're teeny tiny so but what happens over normal use those teeth they bend over they flex over or sometimes they eventually wear out and fall off and so what the honing rod does especially if they've bent over see shown right there yeah yeah you want to ignore like those long streaks and you're just like the tiny little thin block yeah that's the shit right there observation you know it's like someone's doing it to your instruction but that's a YouTube video crazy yeah that is crazy I was like are you doing that should X magnification yeah view from the top hmm yeah so that's what's happening along your cutting edge and what happens is those tiny serrations where it bent over like I was saying or break off and so but as they bent over and it's just normal shit that honing rod by swiping across that honing rod and you don't just do it willy-nilly like you got to do it at the right angle and all this stuff but what it does is it realigns and hones those teeth back into alignment so people mistakenly call them sharpening sticks because all of a sudden their knife is sharp as fuck afterwards but the reality is that it's honed those teeth back into alignment so it can do its job again now what's the purpose of the leather strop so that's just a gentler way especially for things that are super super razor sharp which essentially have been sharpened to a really high finish like ten thousand grit or higher so those micro serrations are even smaller which means they're even more delicate which means they don't need as much force to realign them so honing rod or or sorry a strop is that's a human hair yeah Jesus Christ so just to give you some reference a typical an average human hair is about three thousandths of an inch whoa yeah and to help put that a little bit more better perspective a sixteenth of an inch like a normal measurement 1/16 of an inch is sixty two point five thousandths of an inch so that's like one I can't do the math Ram 120th of 1/16 of an inch which is fucking teeny-tiny what the hair yes I shaved it yeah literally yeah there's a big debate in the world of bow hunting with broad heads with what kind of steel to use and there's there's harder steel that some people use but it breaks and there's an issue with that and there's there's like this big debate harder versus steel that is less hard but will Bend more and give slightly more you know and then there's there's a the broad head that I use which is a carbon steel broad head from a company called g5 they make this broad head call it monde tech let's pull up g5 carbon steel Mon Tech context es they call them so you're talking it's just the head like determine just what a triangular or is it even a hunting the one that I use yeah it is it's it has three points or four points yeah that's it oh yeah sure so has three points but that's that's a carbon steel broad head that's what I shot my elk with last year with and that thing is virtually indestructible yeah there's a crazy photograph I'll show you this crazy video oh I put it up on my Instagram find it on my Instagram where my eye was fucking around with something on my bow at at full draw was trying to set something in the book the bow went off and he hit a cement wall and it stuck into the wall like a cinder block or saw it's a solid cement wall and didn't kill the broad head I still have a broad head back there it's stuck into the broad head look at it did it's stuck into the broad head the shaft yeah look what it did to the to the arrow now look at that yeah that brought it that fucking thing's got my bet for life yeah those things got my confidence forever because if that does that to concrete what will that do to bone right you know that will go through anything that's gonna kick some ass so but one of the things I would say after seeing that especially that first image is the geometry of the blades that the actual points mm-hmm they lend themselves similarly to how your hunting knife is sharpened differently from your chef's knife mm-hmm like the chef's knife materials thinner but they're also sharpened at different angles because they have different jobs they're supposed to do and so the broader essentially are sorry the more acute that is the more easily that will break as well as the thinner the thinner of the material that that that geometry is living on is more susceptible to breaking that first image that Jamie pulled up the geometry looked like it was pretty robust hold it up again yeah as well as like it looks like it's probably at least 30 thousandths of an inch thick which is you know that's about if not more and I'll the original image Jimmy we see the actual broad head and without the yeah my friend Brian Stevens turned me on to these he he yeah shot a bear through the head with one of those G's was from ten feet away it was coming at him and yeah he's got an image of the skull that he sent me where you could see the outline of that broad head through the bear skull that's crazy yeah and it killed the bear and didn't even fuck up the arrow I'm like that was crazy yeah and so a lot of like you see people doing these incredible feats like hammering through nails and shit like that with their knives like what the fuck the thing that most people are used to are chef's knife and they think they did that with their chef's knife it's up and 100 percent pretty much wood but with the right thickness coming up to the cutting edge as well as the actual lead cutting edge geometry like the actual angle that is sharpen that you could do that shit all day long now when you sharpen a blade do you use something to hold it next to the stone so that it reaches the perfect angle or do you do it by eye I do by I actually if you'll hand me over to me one of the things especially when I first started learning I would use my finger as a guide mm-hmm so that would inform me as to the angle so when the edge of my finger would touch the top of the stone that told me that was about the right angle and then when I flipped it over to do the other side I'd do the same thing with my thumb and essentially experience I just know from experience they do make sharpening guides that you can clip on to the back of the knives as well as little ramps those are all great especially if you're starting yeah the hardest part about all of this is the muscle memory portion it's figuring out how to lock in and maintain that angle without wavering and bracing your wrists and all that country and that just it's it's like riding a bike or any other anything you've ever had to learn in your life with practice and repetition you'll get better what do you think about that Moto's machines so it's like a little they're like little like they're the worst fucking thing ever really I I have a like a almost kind of a conspiracy theory that like the reality is like they're designed to destroy your knife so you have to turn around and reinvest again because most people but one because the knives aren't usually sold for very much money that are being used with those things mm-hmm and when you're not selling them for Mary Mary much you're relying on volume and what better way than to create a thing that does the job for a little bit but ultimately destroys it and you have to reinvest what about those ones where you stick it in the slot it's a little slower process but you you'll notice the problem with those the real problem with those is that you can't sharpen the whole edge you usually start at the heel or just a little bit in front of heel and then you do the major work I strip myself oh this is actually still pretty sure um and so the problem is because you're not getting the full length you'll continue to dish this material out just in front of heel and then when you go to cut there's this little bit of shit there that's not doing any work it's not doing anything especially when you're relying on that cutting board when the knife comes down to the cutting board to do some work it's not happening I cut my lunch with that today nice oh fuck axis that axis axis deer and elk oh my god that was killing me well that gamma died probably didn't say but yeah man you know well I learned how to cook I mean I I feel like there's some real art to that as well from my friend Chad Ward whiskey ban barbecue on Instagram he's a like a pitmaster like a legit true world champion barbecue master and he's the one who taught me how to cook slowly at low temperatures and then sear it after you're done I always thought you're supposed to just put it on high heat cook the shit out of it and then eat it you know yeah I mean it tastes fine that way too but you know when you're dealing with what I really had to learn especially in particular cooking with wild game is very unforgiving because it's low in fat yeah it's got none it's your basically eating a sprinter [Laughter] yeah so that's the end I reverse sear it in a pan with grass-fed butter you hear that pain beautiful listen to that sound [Music] that's the last of my back strap I got a I gotta get some more meat mm-hmm I eat the I eat so much meat it's crazy yeah suab super healthy though bitch it looks like it works no it's well you know what - there's deer something really magical about wild game and I don't know what the fuck it is I really don't and I don't think anybody does because I don't think there's enough people out there that are eating it but it has it has a different effect in your body it feels different when I eat even just beef like if you have a race fed beef yeah like total like pasture raised like oh yeah oh my god the difference you know about butcher box I'm aware of that yeah yeah dude that company's the shit they'll they'll send it to your house frozen grass-fed pasture raised like the pasture finished and it's pretty cheap - it's a good deal the future monsters of this podcast and I use them all the time I think it's amazing it's brilliant no I in the few times that and it's actually I feel embarrassed saying that I've only eaten really good beef happy beef essentially only a few times yeah yeah it's hardened yeah well unless in some place oh my god when you take a bite like they even just that first bite it's just like it's entered a whole different world and it's like what the fuck just the flavors everything I have my friend Mike Hawk rige he lives up in British Columbia like the real British Columbia look way the fuck up there and you know he's a hunting guide and got him some tickets for the fights in Vegas and he and his wife came down and then afterwards we went out to eat and they were eating steak we ate at a restaurant and they're laughing looks like they're used to eating moose you know like this beam is like it's like this poor little sick animal right it's all mushy you know it's like if you eat a piece some wild moose meat it's like whoa you eat it you're like holy shit it's like filled with flavor and it's right it just it feels like like it gives you energy it's crazy I'm totally by that yeah yeah it's like the what is that people are trying to like inject young people's blood into the trying to make themselves feel younger like eating putting good well source like it's those two things no but I do think that there's I mean there's got to be something to consuming an incredibly healthy vibrant animal versus something that's like raising a cage right I mean this does just make sense but I don't think this is something that you can I mean they have absolutely measured protein content and the protein contents off the charts if you look at the difference in the protein content of chicken or regular beef versus moose or elk it's much higher right much denser in protein like like I think something like six ounces of axis deers 48 grams of protein right which is incredible you know well is it interesting I think about that to get to get that same amount of protein like you don't have to gorge on you just just eat that little bit yeah good little 6 ounce piece and you're good even less if you want to stay in ketosis if you're like in the keto diet you really need less than 6 ounces you like 3 ounces right you know food is just to me as especially as I've gotten older I've you started doing a lot more cooking and it becomes a different thing it's not just I'm hungry and he stuffed my face right like the the preparing of food much like we were talking about with craftsmanship like there's an art to making food and I mean I'm by no means a chef but I can cook a few things really good you know and I take great satisfaction that absolutely love it you know I'll take my wife used to hate this but we would get home and we're like more hungry gonna make some food two hours later she's like she's like yeah and a lot of people are that my brother is the same way like I'm fuckin hungry now I need to eat now I'm gonna rip your fucking head off well what you need is set up some cheese and some like salami err so that's what I started doing putting out some snacking while I'm working everybody just relax we're we're like I could be starving I'll get done with a long-ass day grind and I'll go home and I want to I'd like I have this thing locked in my mind that I want to eat I'll take two hours to make the bucket thing even though I'm starving and I haven't eaten since like 1 o'clock in the afternoon it's a nine o'clock at night do you find that as a person who is a craftsman and artisan that you try to have that approach with like other things in your life to like what you're just talking about with like making food and yeah sure is I mean I feel like I don't really think too much about the fact that I'm doing it this way it's just kind of the way I do things and I'm a little bit more methodical and I guess not necessarily more thoughtful than anybody else just like when I'm go to when I approached these challenges or these things they ought to do I take my time to do them right and try to do them right the first time I used to actually when I was working for a bob we would have to mock up stuff or build machines or six years or shit like that and you know he was a very his mindset was quick and dirty we got to do this get this done as quick as possible and if it doesn't work the first time we'll make some modifications and we'll try it a second time it still doesn't work second time so and so forth so on and so forth until we got it right where I would just think it through a little bit more first time I was all I needed mm-hmm but I there was a long time I used to do a lot of woodworking before I got into metalworking and I was I always had measure five times and cut twice right yeah and so I started getting to this point where like I really had to think shit through because I just to me it felt like a huge waste of time and energy and materials really to go through all that process and then so there had to be a long learning curve though right - like really learn how to especially I would imagine the forging aspect of it it's probably incredibly difficult yeah well and when I was working for Bob the only forging we did was forging the Damascus to make the patterns and then we would like cut blades out and go from there I learned forging about five years ago essentially working with a gentleman named David lish who's also he's a master bladesmith he used to work at Seattle he's down in Olympia area now but he you know he did he's a blacksmith by trade that got into knife making any fucking skill he's super talented specially when it comes to bowie knives and hunters like he doesn't really great work and especially as Damascus patterns are really great but to watch somebody move and manipulate material and really like I said before like stock removal is a very valid way of doing it because the cost of the actual materials is very small compared to not the immovable stock removal so earlier I was talking about taking a bar and then cutting out the blade shape okay yeah because you're literally removing stock from that from the start and you can do that would you take what's left and melt it down you couldn't melt it down you could turn it and Forge it into other stuff it's it's a really interesting practice it's actually it's kind of like you know people refer to yoga as a practice and you know we're gonna be perfect like there's never gonna be perfection and blade forging but there's always an opportunity to learn something and the practice it and so when you see like you have a decent little chunk you know you start smashing on that thing and see what you can get out of it to economize that material and again like I said you don't really need to do that because of how inexpensive material is but if you think back like even a hundred years like this high-quality material is fucking expensive you had to get the most out of it as you possibly could and so that's why forging was such a big deal and then as that price went down people change the way they manufactured just because then the time was the thing that cost the most not the materials and so they turned around and made it easier to manufacture they didn't give a shit about the waste now how did you learn handle geometry like the handle in this hunting knife so yeah yeah so your as is very unique it is unique and actually fits my hand perfectly yeah it fits in your hand oh and that's that's the goal a friend notch here yeah a friend refers to it as the knife shaking your hand back like it fits so well feels like you're holding here for people that are just listening there's there's an initial smoothness in the front and then there's like this little bump and then like a little sister at the bottom yeah and it just locks in your hand and so I was inspired to do that by a maker named Claude Bush movie he's a Belgian maker I first met him WOD long he is a he's a belgian maker he the first time I met him was at blade show which is a huge knife exposition it's the biggest one in the world that happens down in Atlanta every year the first weekend of June he was my table neighbor and I had never told him a story but uh the first time I saw his knives I was like the blades and everything looked great with that the handle looks fucking weirdest shit this handle yeah it's very similar to that handle his his has more of like a nice gentle curve around to the end instead of kind of held that one's kind of at a clip or a tangle and so finally like on the third day of the show this really great maker that I look up to came over and he was just like doting over clods work and I was like all right there must be something and I had me I'm feel like such an asshole like I didn't even touch the stuff I was just looking at it and judging and I picked it up I was like what it was it was a toll lead like what the fuck right cuz - that same feeling that you have when you're holding knife it feels perfect I was like it it totally shifted my entire mindset and paradigm around what I thought handle shapes should look and feel like and that has definitely inspired continued especially for like hard use knives like especially like for a bigger blade like a bush knife that you're trying to chop through stuff with a handle like that is gonna benefit you immensely because it just it feels like a natural extension of your hand and is this your your logo yeah into the boss my insignia so it's my name is marco mal massey it's two M's kind of swirling around each other and it looks kind of like a flame dude I'm such a dork for this shit I love it it's so interesting man and that the handle too there's something about the the handle being made out of antler like the antler the feel that it has in your hand to the organic materials yeah organic especially antler and and bone they have this kind of like I don't know if you've experienced it with these especially cutting up things like the greasy meat but it from from Mike it does it stays grippy doesn't become super slippery or anything the handle on my bow is actually made out of antler you had it custom made my friend John Dudley had these ones made from a bull that he killed on September 11 2001 like it's the 911 bull and he had these handles made out of the antlers of this and it does the way it sits in your hand it's like it's got an even if you're sweaty or right you know there's something you know it's raining out it just has an extra grip to it what an especially something like that like if you're skinning and breaking down an animal in like it's important but it's not gonna like it's not like one of those moments where you relying on that grip for your life right when you do need that for your life like right you're trying to do ours like you're digging in the ground you're falling down the hillside and you're trying to jab in you know get it a hold like that's gonna be really important but obviously that's a very rare yeah incident when that what happened well it's just something cool about it too well and just like the tactility yeah it's just again it goes back to the essentially the user experience like what does it feel like how is it different like it makes it really does make a difference yeah and one of the cool things to me also about antlers is that they shed them you know that they lose these things every year and that every year they grow a new one do you know that it's the fastest-growing organic material on earth no I didn't know that that shit right there that giant elk antler fucking dad throws in a couple months I didn't know that yeah falls off right they lose it after they're done rutting so after they fell off and they just kind of immediately started like kind of slow like they grow the whole thing back in a couple months it's radical see if you find a video that shows elk antler growth time-lapse cuz it's crazy how fast it grows and it's all just for war I mean that's all that is its to show off for the ladies hey and it's also for war that's interesting dear yeah that guy look at my rack yeah he had that rack just so he could fuck people up or fucking people but also elk yeah and definitely people you get close to him fuck me up but look at that the following photos were taken about a week apart over a period look at this April 1st now check this out watch just just have it play out there it says over four months they show the incredible growth so April 1st watch this is like at a farm that looks like it is looks like it's an elk farm just let it play out April 8th boom so 7 days later look at that April 15 bang look how big that shit is oh shit April 22nd it's getting crazy boom April 29th that's nuts boom May 6 nights May 13 what motherfucker May 20th material yeah May 25th yeah June 4th boom great he's ready getting ready to go to war June 10th he's thinking about pussy look at that now I'm thinking about so pussy June 17th I will fuck a dude up comes near me June 24th look at that and then July 1st that is crazy I'll have to 5 it's quick it's crazy and that's not even done July 8th July 15th now he's basically still in velvet right and then July 22nd that hard horn to me that looks like he shed his velvet and then July 29th isn't that nuts bizarre so by the time August rolls around they're like right now the beginning of September they're in hard horned and they'll go to war and they'll keep that shit for you know till the end of the probably December I think maybe January and then they'll lose it so this is the fastest-growing organic material yes by volume weight yes okay yeah I think by all those things because it grows so fast it's so heavy I mean that's like 40 pounds just of antlers and it grows over a couple months yeah it's fucking nuts man this seemed picture made that up about the fastest-growing organic material but I think it's true look and it says the first fun fact I found it they can grow ten pounds of velvet per year that's just the belt just the velvet yeah hmm yeah but that's probably because it's a velvet farm you know they use that stuff for human growth hormone I got a lot of baseball players we're taking on it yeah a friend of mine my friend John rivet shout out to Johnny rivet he lives in Alberta in his one of his friends had an elk farm up there in Alberta and he grew elk not for the meat but for the for the velvet because that stuff that grows grows so fast and it's so so ridiculously potent that they would take antler velvet and they were turned into a spray that would equal the effects of human growth hormone how could you do that across species like that I don't know but athletes were taking it athletes were taking this stuff and it was having this just for like growth hormone reaction in their body aches and like superficial year they like really don't know you know I'm too stupid to be answering your questions but there's something about deer velvet that was for quite you know I don't even know if it worked but it was a big thing in the the supplement and fitness industry that people were getting deer velvet the new vet I bought it you spray it uh-huh and it's supposed to give you a growth hormone how'd you think of that holy bear did you have your hand only beer before yeah I have it's great man it's great Olympia yeah is this from Olympia Washington is that what it is uh originally yeah I think it's brewed in Milwaukee now what the fuck I know everything is being sourced oversee I mean what you are from the Pacific Northwest but now you live in Connecticut the state are shit on the most there's a whole video out there of me shitting on Connecticut like people have made a compilation of me shit okay sure I'm sure plenty of its warranted yeah there's all of it shout out to my good friend Tommy jr. religion Connecticut I finally found it so I think it's just antlers in general are the fastest growing tissue in in any mammal yeah and then elk antler is the fastest growing out of all of them because it's the largest so it grows in the same amount of time that a deer would grow its antlers but it's far larger you know what give you that we've been more massive than it than a moose uh no no deer would be a musubi bear some moose yeah yeah they're the biggest they're the biggest of all of the deer species like by far you know I think like a full-grown Yukon moose could be as much as 2,000 pounds a really big Rocky Mountain Elk under normal circumstances is like a fucking giant one is pushing a thousand Gianna it's a giant though that'd be like a four hundred inch bowl like that one right the the inches the measurement of the size of the inches of the antler look at that you see that one that's in the fryer yeah that's considerably bigger than this one that was the one out in the front it's 382 inches that's a giant bull she's and that fucker was about a thousand pounds he was you huge moose is bigger Moose is twice as big hips would see that thing go shut the fuck up gotta go and you start running but moose think they're the weird thing about a moose is their antlers are like a door you know it's basically like right there so fat it's not like pokey I mean they're basically like they're hitting each other in the head with doors they're like big old gloves yeah and but you see have you seen I've seen a few pictures where the especially the moose they're their antlers get locked up mm-hmm and they're fucking stuck more deer than move yeah because the design of a Moose's antlers is like it's not as intertwined but with deer it happens all the time because there's a little bit of flex to the bone sure and so they'll clash and in the force of the two of them slamming each other they get stuck CTE well they drown they've they've fought like that and then you know wrestled and wound up in the water and wound up drowning there's a horrible video I saw of two deer that got stucked and one of them got killed by a coyote not just a whole pack of them torn to shreds they tore him and they eat them asshole first as I've documented many times in this podcast just like a lot of animals do go for the butt first well yeah lions do a lot of them but the that one deer was still attached to his dead friend and these hunters had to help it get released they saw one of the antlers off the other deer was dead deer and freed it and then this other one ran off like what a nightmare that guy's lived through right now his buddy it's his asshole torn apart they literally eating him alive while he's stuck to the guy oh my god probably fight yeah kicking in and it could mean talk about could have easily been you I mean literally could have easily been you there's two deer one of them gets eaten alive and the other ones just sitting there like living with the horror right of Hizb and then these people come over and he can't get away from the fucking people and it's like these people are gonna eat me and they don't even eat them they let him go and they're hunters they freed him up and let me loose crazy yeah got that oh there's one let elk got stuck with a dead elk that's a dead elk that's an elk head that's stuck on this other Elks but see I don't know what that was that to me makes me think that that could have very easily been like an elk found a dead elk and just started head-butting and ripped its head off and got stuck with it they kill each other all the time right now I mean all the time jeez dude when you hear them fighting like one of the first times ever went elk hunting we were coming over this hill and it sounded like two dudes slamming baseball bats together just crack crack crack crack and when we came over the top of the hill these two giant elk we're just running at each other and smashing each other it was a magical day it was like one of the first times I ever elk hunted and there's a thing that happens when you hit a peak rut and when the peak rut happens they just go crazy all around you they're all screaming and it might only happen once in a season and you just if you might be there for that couple hours when it all goes down what's insanity yeah insanity there's all around you screaming and head-butting each other I can't even imagine walking over the top of the hill and like fucking stumbling across just so vulnerable yeah just what a hygrometer a scene that's right now and they're screaming and they're so big man it's a scream yeah there's two going at it right there and you hear them they just clash and slamming each other oh yeah you hear that it's dogs bark man and they don't even know he's alive right now and this and they kill each other all the time well in that the hormones they got going on yeah like anything else yeah my friend cam came across one last year and he crept up on it he thought it was bedded and he shot it with an arrow and it didn't move he's like what the fuck and he got over - it was already dead and another elk had stabbed it they stabbed it through the heart and it laid down and died right it happens all the time there you're there always finding them that other other elk have murdered they don't crazy fuck they're just yeah is that a monster 2 months just a month maybe a little bit longer there's a second rut sometimes in October when another female will go into estrus and they'll resume the rut yeah it's magical times yeah I can't imagine stumble across that it's a pretty cool man it's pretty cool you know the real wild the actual real wild well you are in Connecticut man you got to worry about two things hitting a deer with your car and Lyme disease the Lyme is okay so that's something that we didn't realize we were moving in oh man I wish I told you because you and I were going back and forth we were about to move right yeah that was definitely one of the things that we're like wait what they're everywhere and you've got everywhere ticks in if you're listening this anywhere in the East Coast especially New York it's got it really bad there's a Lyme disease map and you see like the instances of Lyme disease and the East Coast it's horrific man yeah and I know fucking at least a dozen people that have it and it stays with you for life yeah and my friend Jim Miller he's got fights in the UFC he's got to take a giant fistful of pills every day I mean he's got everything real bad real bad and he's still fighting yeah still fighting in the UFC and those deer - I've been worried about actually when we were especially when we were moving out because I was driving through Pennsylvania I hit Pennsylvania and like we drove across country at sunset and drove from there all the way to Connecticut in dark and all I could think is like I'm gonna fucking hit a deer you see so many of them right eye you see so many dead ones on the sign the fucking Road yeah blows my mind but the biggest issue has been actually other Connecticut drivers is this big the biggest concerned my wife and I both have been t-boned in the last eight months people in Connecticut just they're just given up man there's hitting the gas and closing your eyes well what's crazy is like I've driven I've driven in LA I've driven in New York I've driven in fuckin Oregon Seattle all kinds of crazy places but they all have like a culture about how they work and I could not figure out Connecticut and a friend finally explained it to me he said they're driving as if nobody else is on the road I was like holy shit that makes perfect sense the what the choices they make it are as if nobody else is there I'll be coming up in the passing lane somebody's in the lane to the right of me there's no exits coming up there's no other cars for like half a mile I'm cruising probably like five ten miles faster than them they change lanes right from me why you know why because I say if you you're let's let's say there's a thing that you're making like an epoxy right when you're making an epoxy there's several ingredients then you have to add to it all right maybe that's not the best example like say maybe there's electronics just whatever it is that you're making so if you're making a thing and it requires ten different ingredients if you're a person in Connecticut you have eight ingredients you don't have those of the two and you just do with that without you just deal with it you're just missing two things you just hit the gas and just drive places yeah and no one knows what they're doing and this it's not a real state it's just not well in with also bunkers that we weren't expecting is that like unless you're driving 15 to 20 miles over the speed limit you're going too slow or like a stoplight and stop signs are suggestion people used right I don't even know why you're speeding man I don't know where they're going where they going this stays so small you could drive through the state in two minutes out we're missing all sorts of stuff they just they're so confused no and I'm not trying to say here shit on fucking connection it's just that those things haven't been a serious culture shock for us yeah it's despair despair they hit the gas what's crazy is fucking beautiful state it's just yeah especially in the summer terrifying giant your hair around that time get out of your car you get bit by a thousand ticks and you fucking can't walk anymore the humidity too I was not expecting that it's great on your balls right okay ball sweat yesterday I was in my shop I wasn't doing shit like I could have just been sitting here like fiddling around I was sweating yeah my Coast Florida yeah well you're used to you know that Pacific Northwest doesn't really get that hot and the summers are glorious like Seattle and more against summers god they're glorious everything's fucking neon green and the Sun comes out it's amazing it's almost almost makes up for the winter but not quite the lack of winter well just the rain just the right not rain there is a winner it's just it's not it's not frozen its tempered but it's just separate just and doom and you're like I could do this I could hang in there and then the summer comes like hey it's gonna be fine but you like like a beat wife waiting for your husband to come home you know like hey he's not home now I got a great house yeah he's coming home he's coming home he's gonna be home for eight months yeah I'm just gonna piss on your hair eight months it's just eight months of fucking craft beers and just everybody's shooting themselves it's dark up there man I don't think people are meant to live like that I mean I think it's gorgeous and there's benefits to it for sure yeah but uh I had a buddy of mine he tried to convince me to live up there it's hilarious my friend salami he moved to Portland that's his name okay he tried to move to Portland and he did move to Portland he's teaching jiu-jitsu up there it's like dude I love it it's fucking great up here it's fucking amazing I go you don't mind about the winner you don't mind about the wrinkles now he goes to the people are so fucking cool the restaurants are amazing and the summers are so good three years laters back in LA I go what happened he was I couldn't do it man couldn't do it anymore I go I see so it's a theme it's like you hang in there for as long as you can but you can't hang in there forever that what it is but some people can I can hang I've you know a lot of people have it what is it depression syndrome or some shit like it's cuz you grew up there I don't think so cuz my sister and my mom both grew up there - my wife even they can dilate if they hate it especially the wintertime the wintertime when it is that dark gray like it doesn't snow it just rains just is dark I guess I think part of my issue is like I said I always worked in restaurants or in fucking and we're in a shop so it's like I'm in a virtual cave all the fucking time I'm not experiencing that except for the drive home or to work what's up Jamie just said sad and as I was looking up seasonal affective disorder that's the acronym they give it yes that sad I mean they probably called it that on purpose I mean I don't think they needed to call it seasonal affective disorder that's not the best feel like shit because of the rain disease well something isn't it something about like the lack of vitamins so I'll tell you what though that's right there's light therapy take it over Connecticut all day I'll take Seattle over Connecticut Oh all day you know I dream about sometimes is dead live in Connecticut I lived in Denver for only a few a few months people that live in Connecticut right now I go what the fuck dude actually running gay folks I don't really care no actually when we first moved in anything Denver's fucking beautiful fucking loved Denver loved it loved it what was when I first moved there I thought I was so I grew up in Washington right at the base of the Puget Sound water around and actually used to like sail on a racing team and stuff like that Wow I'm gonna miss the water so much and it was so green too I got there and I was like I don't think I care about the water I care about the green but the second the spring rains hit everything turned green all the trees started blossom I was like holy shit and it was beautiful mmm the eautiful yeah the only thing I hated about Denver everybody had a fucking dog and nobody cleaned up the dog shit that was everywhere lazy bitches I just didn't understand it's probably worse now all the legal Park it's everywhere but you know what what it has that's amazing man is the view of the mountains there's something about being right there and seeing those Rockies that just like humbles you it puts it in perspective well that's what that's what being in Puget Sound's like as well yeah cuz you always got Mount Rainier right it's crazy like the road the cities were engineered so like you're coming up and down hills and like boom mountains right and it's a monster no Rainier is out monster yeah that's amazing man we went up looking for Bigfoot up there once me and Duncan yeah yeah we found him we just didn't tell anybody um that yeah that area too is so densely wooded it's really incredible when you go walking through the woods like there's you don't make any sound when you walk you don't leave any footprints because it's just like feet thick of pine needles and the models this is so soft and it's interesting and lush and filled with elk man there's elk everywhere I'm there and you like they run they run like 30 feet you can't see him anymore because there's just like so many trees fucking guy my my in-laws they live south of Olympia and they have 16 16 here's out there within and like three or think it's like four or five that are like cleared for like a field and a barn and the house and stuff rest of it's all wooden then they got black bears that cruise through their large cats like bobcats and links and shit and elk for sure and they have an orchard and the elk are just up there standing on their hind lightmap that shit up mmm they're beautiful the cooler watch - yeah that's I mean that is a lush tropical rainforest up there it's so wild it's it's so it's so interesting - when you when you're up there you realize like how diverse it is with life when you're walking around in it and you see just elk shit everywhere you go walking through the woods there it's just yeah marbles yeah yeah it's like there's so much life up there you salmon there's so much salmon there's eagles up there means it's gorgeous man like in Connecticut mushroom hunting there's all kind of like you know really live off the land there's some great spots Kochan trailing in Olympia area sure love getting out in the woods and just walking around it's it's actually been really cool ticket especially when we go back in the summertime and especially in the summertime to go visit family to take my little dude my son's 2 years old he just turned 2 and so walking with him and he just fucking loves walking through the and you don't have to worry about the fucking ticks bright you can get Lyme shit like that and go out there roll around all you want but going up they have a nice little like quarter mile trail goes up through the woods let me just walk through that thing he just marches along the whole fucking way and just that experience of stopping and listening you can hear the red-tail Hawk crying over the top of everything else and then you they have great horned owls from time to time that crucifer was there you can hear their little chipmunks and squirrels you hear the fucking crows and Steller's Jays yeah everything and stopping and telling him stuff yeah you hear that he just stops he's so intense and it's it's wild to see a little kid who's so fucking rambunctious he's in the house but you get a mountain and it's the woods most senses you just listening this or it's so cool yeah isn't amazing to looking at through the eyes of your child just watching them experiencing all these things it's it's like you can almost see like the little no it's amazing that's one thing that I didn't anticipate before we had children it's like watching them learn like oh wow like there's a crazy trip you get out of watching kids learn you know this is something about like you learn watching them learn and it really sort of reinforces this idea that every human being is essentially I mean they're not a blank slate but they are most certainly subject to the influences of their environment what they experience especially yeah there is crazy like we have he loves map so we got maps maps yeah we got you know how like a lot of kids get those like bedroom mats that have like the roads and stuff we got one of the world like the globe and none that countries are marked out on or anything but we knew some of the spots and so we started teaching but he knows we're like over a hundred different countries are like he knows that he knows where they're at he can point out the difference between Cambodia Guam Vietnam Nepal Russia to know like Russia China pretty easy but then you go over Europe he's like hungry turkey Greek he like he he knows he knows where Portugal is he knows pretty sure I know the difference in Australia New Zealand the only reason I know them is because I'm playing the game with him so we got more maps that have like the world again but everything's marked out and he's starting to learn all the different flags he knows he knows like at least a dozen different flags they're so open you know children there I mean they learn language so quick they're so open you think about kids learn language by the time they go to school they already know how to talk yeah they don't learn in school learn how to talk and when my might has her master's degree at the university level for teaching English second language so she's been all day long and so she ain't hurt she comes from a family of teachers her parents both of her parents her sister her great-grandmother I'm sorry her grandmother all educators this must be amazing for her to be a mom then yeah I'm so sure I mean she's with the dude all day like she fucking loves the shit of him but you know like you try spending fucking day in and day out with a little dude like their little the little fucking numskulls running around and trying to learn how to interact with the world yeah it's fucking crazy but it's so cool and and with that background understanding how to interpret what's going on in his brain a little bit so to help nourish it essentially to help like you know just make things that much more salt like it's fucking crazy and he speaks you have a blind auction yes you why don't you go grab those dives so we can go grab those grab him real quick and we'll tell people about the auction but he's he's got these fucking killer knives that he's made these chefs knives the one that's going up I think so look how beautiful that is we're looking at his mousey fire arts Instagram page and the design the pattern on this chef's knife it doesn't even look real folks I mean it looks like someone's it looks like someone put like one of those crazy cartoon filters doesn't it is that it that's the knife right there that one so people can see it holding it up so this knife is for auction no actually it's not that one is not this one here in the case is you can pull that out and how could people auction so this is for benefit for Alex's the Alex or sorry la loves Alex's Lemonade Stand which is for childhood cancer research and so online smells again if you go to my Instagram profile Malmo see fire artists on Instagram I have a link actually in my bio that goes straight to the auction page for this knife now these knives are right now my current prices this one knife is $4,200 but right now I think the bidding is it like oh there is 2,100 so there's a chance that somebody could get it for less than what I would normally when is it end the auction ends on Saturday the 8th so that's when the actual event is and I'm actually gonna be there at the event hanging out if anybody's got any questions about it talk about it or you know just kind of hang out and that's done folks but you know it's interesting like doing this kind of work is the first time I've ever had anything that I felt like I could give back with mm-hmm cuz otherwise like I always just did shitty little jobs but this is the first time I feel like I have something I can offer so and coming up from very little very humble beginnings this was an opportunity now to feel like I can give back and so that's very try to do this from a very cool for sure well this man I'm glad we finally got together absolutely thank you for making me these awesome knives I will cherish them forever so you're like I'm an amazing craftsman it was cool to do this thank you thanks for being here all right folks we'll be back soon you fucks bye [Applause] [Music]
