you're all tell everybody would happen so no offense to hilarities which is a great comedy club we stopped there Saturday night after our show in Cleveland we went over to say hi to our friend Jessie Mae Peluso who was headlining there and boozy at the dudes named Andrew Andrew don't know Stamper funny guy yeah so we say hi to them and they graciously the owners the club graciously asked if we were hungry we said sure we could eat they have a nice menu why not so I had the prime rib it was excellent and you had a steak with some vegetables that's right I had a bunch of vegetables I'm sorry probably around midnight mm-hm and then we get on the plane at like 6:00 in the morning we are flying back home and I pass out and then the lady wakes me up it's like a movie the lady wakes me up then I look over you you're like dude I'm not good I'm not good I'm not doing what happened like we we had walked through the airport cracking jokes like we always do having a great old time everything seemed normal he didn't seem sick at all he fell asleep tell everybody what happened I fall asleep I woke up like in Fight Club when you're like when you when he wakes up he's a kid on a plane like my breath caught myself and I sprinted to the bathroom and I was like soap out of it and I think the head rush had got me all fucked up and I sat down and I blacked out and passed out for a second and I woke up and I'm throwing up I mean I am her woke up throwing throwing up just a la la I'm spitting and I'm like holding on to the sides like I can't believe what's like I'm so disoriented and I walk out and I grab the flight attendant and I was like is there a doctor on the plane like I'm something's fucking wrong like I don't feel good and right then my stomach was like burbling again and she's like oh my god you're like pale as a fucking ghost and I always be I'm like I'm like this bitch this is what I look like ginger she goes go sit down I'll get somebody this nurse was on there this guy Garrett super nice and he asked he was and he was right in front of us I could row up and he asked us which seats with Jo and he sat with me and I was her land dude I would do for the first time my life I puked in those bags you know when you're like nobody poops in those fucking bags I did I watched like three times and he saw undigested food unzip undigested I was pretty sure it was food poisoning because I've I had a food poisoning before and there sometimes it comes on pretty quick you knocked it on the nose well that's what he thought it was too he goes he was asking me he's like what did you have last night I said I had two drinks at the show and I had a couple of beers after with jessimae and her friend and he was like did you take any street drugs yeah that's what he said he said you take any back-alley drugs I said no man I swear to god he thought about it and he ditched drinking he ditched drugs Forest drugged me sewer shit so I told him the truth I said dude I don't take any drugs last night and he was like okay and when he told me he looked in there and he goes so you have undigested food which means your body's rejecting it without processing it so it must be you got a bug of some kind because dude I was like when I talked when I grabbed you and I go bro something's wrong like this is not he's very nerve-racking because I was out of it yeah totally laid out and I was so confused I was like how but you were okay yeah I'm like did he have a stroke dude it was repiy I felt for a second in the bathroom like something medically was really really wrong if my instinct was oh I must be like sick or something's wrong but then when I kept like having this urge to tough yargh I was like something's really going on like it I was assuming that it was the vegetables because a lot of times people get it from poorly handled salad yeah yeah people get it was bad if they don't wash the leaves and everything real good people can get food poisoning from salad it's apparently one of the most common ways people get food poisoning was from salad and just yeah well dude it was just I you know and the guy was so nice he sat with me the whole time but he could tell he was like are you doing okay in every couple of minutes I'd feel like I had to throw I think what when water can't stay down I think that's the key when you're like chug and water chug and water eASIC don't chug too fast like why he's like because and then I'm Joe like was that because of that bro fucking puking up water but the old red feels fine I feel fine now I would just that fuck me up bad tear and it's five hours from Cleveland so wasn't it wasn't a quick jump late for the food poisoning sucks it was all had and four or five times in my life it's never never good that's the second time the first time I had it was in college it was the worst thing ever it was way worse this was both ends this is when your mouth and backdoor when you're packed it's like a cartoon I had in college from movie theater popcorn what that's real shit movie that's real shit mm-hmm here's how we knew we me and this other dude we had totally different meals all day and this other friend of ours too and long story short whatever we both woke up sick at the same time like in the middle of the night and we had asked when I went to the doctor finally the next day because I was sick all day and the doctor was like would you eat I detailed and he goes oh yeah sometimes the butter can be spoiled or rotten Oh actual butter yeah oh maybe that's why they use that fake ass butter hell yeah what is that fake Gasper I don't fucking know what the fuck is movie popcorn theater butter made out of it's not real butter because most places don't have real but Jamie's laughing at my sicknesses no movie popcorn what do you think it is it's like it was it was weird yeah wonderful butter flavor that's not butter what is that bullshit well they say bad that stuff is for you people used to think margins the way to go like if you butters parable for you have some margarine margarine non-dairy it's me know it's fucking horrible for you but I'll process oils you know they're finding out from those fake meat burgers they've wrestled rats they're giving them liver cancer pull-up what would it would it would the study was yeah yeah yeah one of those is beyond meat or impossible meat or not really meat whatever the fuck it is just yeah not meat but looks like meat we're trying to make it look like me it's processed oils with grill marks on it why do they do that shit shit it's mostly oils yeah it's like oils from vegetables it's very string a lot of soy and shit like that that's like those processed vegetable oils are terrible for you yeah you know what's good for you olive oil that's a good vegetable oil avocado oil is good for you but like all that other shit like canola all that stuff fucking is my question is it because it's not naturally occurring feeding studies suggest the impossible burger may not be safe to eat scroll down this is GMO science it says hold on a second make the little are rats fed gym rats what do you do make it bigger that's just going up rats don't just stop stop moving go back Jesus Jamie it stopped go back go back it's on back no no it's not there thank you thank you rats fed the genetic know the fucking text there buddy rats fed the genetically modified yeast derived protein soy whoa say that word LaHaye gamma globin no the himalaya hemoglobin hemoglobin it sounds like an Irishman Danny hey globin he's a good boy he's very key ingredient developed unexplained changes in weight gain and significant signs of toxicity and signs of toxicity why did I put the word significant in there wasn't in there it felt right it did I'm an editor okay unexplained changes in weight gain and signs of toxicity and it said the impossible burgers a plant-based burger the key ingredient which is a protein called so late a hangover hangover slh derived from genetically modified yeast a rat feeding study commissioned by the manufacturer impossible foods found that rats fed SLE each developed unexplained changes in weight gain as well changes in the blood that can indicate that the onset of inflammation or kidney disease as well as possible signs of anemia holy shit yeah impossible foods dismissed these statistically significant effects as non adverse or having no toxic already intense it's so funny you can just dismiss things they just make it a real study and they're like not real well they're dismissing it because it's not convenient real simple I mean the do rat studies doesn't necessarily mean it transfers to people but that stuff isn't okay what's the ingredients let's let's find out what the fuck because it's not the only thing that I've read I've read things by actual nutritionist they're saying look you want to be on a plant-based diet you should eat real foods you can eat healthy on a plant-based diet you can eat real vegetables and avocado and you know there's plenty of good stuff to eat coconut oils all this stuff is healthy for you but we you start making shit look like me that's when shit gets squirrely because you're finding all kinds of your your they're adding all sorts of processed food why'd you take that off the screen I want to be distracting while you're talking oh no that's okay so what the fuck is in their top five ingredients calories four ounce serving which is pretty skimpy clocks in at 240 calories that's in the range of a beef burger depending on fat content and cholesterol the impossible contains no cholesterol to compare a regular beef patty contains about eighty milligrams grow up scroll up scroll up scroll up scroll up fat 14 grams includes eight grams of saturated fat which generally considered less healthy than unsaturated fat that's not true it's it's entirely dependent upon the source and it's entirely dependent upon like how you're eating like what you're eating yeah it's the idea that saturated fat is bad for you this has all been debunked this is comparable to a beef burger mostly due to the coconut oil which is healthy for you fuckers this year the impossible replaced a portion of the coconut oil which is the highest of saturated fat goddamn it puts on fallow or which is way shittier for you which is an unsaturated fat god damn this you know talking to Trishna Sanh this podcast has been so enlightening but so confusing well you see the way that people still want to eat low fat you know and they like they don't understand like fats are important your body fucking needs him they're good for your brain they're good for everything omega-3 omega-6 is that was the revolution of like I remember as a kid everything became in like the ladies and 90s everything was lower fat but it was higher sugar content right so it was just like less fat less fat but they were just increasing the sugar it was like 1% milk that's the biggest joke when they put sugar less fat yeah but they substituted it with tons of fucking sugar because it tastes terrible yeah it tastes like shit without the fat all those monsters have put low fat milk in their coffee who the face of shit who are you the trick got tricked they got tricked by this idea that you're supposed to have low fat find out pull up something what is the impossible burger healthy is it healthy well here's because here's to think they were pushed that article obviously was siding with the impossible burger because they cited three four items and it was like soy protein coconut in something else they don't really tell you how the process is that they make those that's the thing they won't say well here's how we derive these things and fuckin process I was gonna say as before I even look this up I don't think that they're even marketing as being healthier it's just an alternative for me for people that really still want to eat it yeah exactly right but is it healthy for ya I don't think that there's nothing bothering ya it's probably less healthy for you than a fucking McDonald's cheeseburger which is barely meat anyway not meat I mean right they did all the studies about Taco Bell meat and they were like well fuckin barely meat Taco Bell meat has they have an acceptable amount of filler but they're allowed to have a just on sense it's some nutty number like pull out what's the acceptable number of Taco Bell filter I had a friend that worked at other fast-food restaurant not gonna name and their name rated meat was like G I believe it was G grade which is lower than dog food or something like that like shit still tasted okay I mean if you're hungry you'll shove it down your fucking long I can need it what did you see what happened at this World Series game the other night you see the news no they introduced Trump and the first lady and they got booed do you know this yeah it's he's two different versions the story I saw yeah when n was saying that they were yelling out lock her up but then I didn't hear that I just other thing was saying they were saying lock him up yeah so lock him up I think it was lock him up as whatever he and then had it where they were saying people were chanting lock her up I said the other thing too is he was generally the president throws out the first pitch yeah and he didn't do that because he's already thrown one out somewhere and it's been it's very good yeah fuck you want to talk about those we got some clips in the vault of people that can't throw baseballs on the first pitch at a Patel it's my favorite fucking clip Gary Dell'Abate him 50 cent there's a few people fucking no I can't right now I'm good will you stomach yeah um I don't want to fucking I don't wanna fuck yeah it's fine but I don't want to fuck up I don't want to dance on the edge did you see what I tweeted I tweeted this morning uh BRR and CNN's I typed him lock her up it's just just put him back lock him up hold on Burr and burr and and cry sure have a podcast now called Bill and Bert podcast and I made fun of them you should pull up the image for it because they fucking they have a cigar and a glass of whiskey and their icon but I go what is up with this cigar dick you guys got as your fucking image look at this thing look at that what's up with that cigar cock that is not hey yo you got to get someone to reanimate that bro that is a weird-looking cigar it looks like a fucking dick why is it all rounded off at the tip it's not a set the bill bird podcast whoever you're hiring and all things comedy pay him some real money they're mad at you they're mad at you these guys are things like dicks just fucking wave so what did it say did it say block her lock him up or lock her up his lock him up brain lock him up was not as soon yeah they booed the president has that ever happened at a fucking baseball game no people are people are very riled up man they'll a yeah well here was the other thing that I saw they had a connected thing article you know that I was reading with that that said 51% of America is pro-impeachment but I was like where does that fucking pole come from yeah whose do they ask you know they didn't ask me so what the fuck sells poles here's the problem the only people that answer poles are assholes right right if they call you up and go hey cheeto what do you what do you think about this yo this is what I think don't call me yeah leave me alone fuck you who even candy can you see who conducted that poll that that nonsense of the impeachment part where you called because I've seen very relevant opinions about this impeachment if we go back to Nix and really take pay attention makes administration it's arguable that Trump has been more egregious with his breaking of the Constitution so exhausted I wish there was no issues huh this is what I wish I wish there was no one trying to steal there was no one trying to cheat on their taxes kill everybody was just doing their best and helping each other out yeah it's a nice small healthy vibrant communicative community of people supporting each other Fox News poll 51% of voters favor impeachment and removing President Trump from office that's not good that's a Fox poll when Fox says that yeah that's fuck it's kind of cool in July was 42% but I'm saying we're from where though I'd like need to know where the camera look at that impeach but not removed in July was 5% and now it's 4% now most people favor him being removed again that sometimes there's good stuff at sporting events so the other funny thing that happened was the those girls showed their tits did you see that that was hilarious these two girls are behind home plate and they're both flashing their tip they both got banned from Major League Baseball for life and she she tweeted and she was like worth it yeah two of to her in this other girlfriend hers I think somebody told me they're starting a smut magazine or something that was their promo for them get a nice brother breast cancer awareness yeah somebody said they started a magazine or something though no okay that they got a company on the rise on plate how many girls make a living just showing their body to like patreon Instagram is all is all dancing dancing on the line of like legal picture prostitution well the best case of it is Twitter because what if they allow you you can take it in the ass yeah on Twitter there's a lot of gals yep that I have to be real careful if I hand my kids one of my phones they don't open that fuckin Twitter app because in the feed daddy somebody messaged you dirty dirty girl yeah this felt like take it right in the keys I love that twit Twitter doesn't give a fuck that's my favorite part of my sweater if they couldn't care less I like go for it well here's what I love about them Kyle Dunnigan when he did that that animated thing with Michael Jackson do you see that I saw a lot of amazing Instagram pulled it out Donna getting the funniest fucking guy on Instagram yeah they pulled it off of Instagram but Twitter did not yeah shout out to Twitter hardcore Twitter cool for that shit what was that would you show me the like the patreon website it's called only fans that they some of those people use not everyone but this is like showing some of the numbers that they've already been paying out a million registered users 70,000 content creators paid out to creators a hundred and fifty million dollars paid out to refers three million referrers so you cheat oh I think if you prefer I think if I refer I get I gotta pay I get a kick you get a kick hell yeah three million dollars five percent five percent commission on all referrals pay-per-view messaging and tips live streaming feature that's interesting see who could have a problem with that if you if you ever if you don't have a problem people being naked I don't you don't know if you don't have a problem people taking naked pictures I don't you don't do who would have a problem with that now that seems like the best alternative to prostitution for a lot of these guys I think I think in the world of sex work I think that's the makes the most sense because this is a this is a legit protected legal way for them to go hey do you want to see me get naked at my house yeah give me some fucking money and I'll do it yeah and no one should really have a problem with it right there's nothing I'm in what could be I don't like what could be the debatable problem with it it's like you smut people that people that think it's dig eroding yeah fabric of our society Westboro Baptist Church man yeah I think Kanye West would have an issue with it he doesn't like well he doesn't like cuss words now - he's done with that no cuss words now on the album's well he's starting a new cult yeah it's clear he's on his way it's probably gonna be huge you think it's gonna be like a Scientology sized thing at some point where it's gonna be like people going on lazy it seems like he's doing it for free though you know I mean he's got a shit ton of money and so does his gal yeah but so I mean he likes business opportunities he does but I mean I think it probably opens up the doors for his other businesses like his Yeezys and his clothes and all that shit that merch wasn't free the show is free right yes I'm saying it opens up the opportunities for that stuff so so he does the show and then people like you know what do I have to do to be in the cult yourself a pair of xi yi zi just got show buddies will let you in yeah that's all it is you buy your way and you'd get in you love that shit I could get a few people and I think you support all that shit so much you love it it's kind of easy to start a cult these days it really kind of is well there's so many of them now like this there's so many semi cults you know there's like there's people that have followings right you know that they you know they're somebody could argue this is a cult though you people could argue that you've cultivated a cult you could argue that however there's absolutely no membership rituals right whatever the fuck you want no one's calling in a cult no I'm saying like some people call it a cult like they say they'll say like hey this is Santino nation where people do stuff like right this is a nation right they'll use their name and they'll say nation which is whoo this is the Santino army your part since you know army yeah yeah we're in very subtle but whatever he says very very suspect thinking like that kind of shit well it just it just gives wait people obey people's word a little bit too much without knowing shit so they just start like it's something to hold on to so maybe if their lifes are shitty and dull and boring they hear something and they're like I agree with a good amount of that and then they fucking latch on to it that's where it gets scary because then people can convince you to do anything we were talking about those guys the proud boys shit we were talking about that this weekend yeah this if you start a group a thing about groups is you're you're now if you're saved you the leader like let's let's say you start the red Boyz yeah okay the ginge boys you're the leader you're the founder and the leader of the red Boyz yeah but you just let any ginger in the group there's a lot of wacky gingers out there just really people and yeah when people join groups and you start this group and they are saying I'm acting as one of the red boys well you're now sort of in some way connected to whatever the fuck they do yeah so if they decide to get radicalized and do a bunch of really fucked up things you know and go after people who don't have red hair or whatever the fuck they decide to do you are now at least somehow connected to them yeah because I started the shit jazz I mean that's yeah that's creepy though it is fucking there's loops there's too many too many but but I think like the influence online is what's creepy to me as people can you know people like remember meetups meetups have got somewhat gone away but like at one point people are doing these meetups where like kids were famous on Instagram they just loved the idea being like come meet me at this park at 12th and fucking thousands of people would go well you see what Kevin Hart used to do used to have people run with him know like meet me we're gonna do we're gonna run a 5k shut up what do you do that strangers oh yeah so stupid you've never seen that why would he do even got a video of it Kevin Hart you could do it it shows like say if he would show up in Milwaukee or whatever and he had a concert who's doing there he would set up like a 5k and they would all run no fuck that well he's trying to he's a positive guy and he's trying to promote positive things like health and fitness and just getting ya act you could do that without inviting people to run with you I don't want anybody fuckin run with me you don't run anyway yes I do do you home every two or three days really yeah where do you run in the neighborhood no shit I run a minimum of minimum of four but an average of like maybe five or six I don't go I don't go near eight you're a silent runner you don't tell anybody fuck no I do everything silent Kevin Hart running by a lake that's a beautiful lake nice that's cool it's a DC look at all those people yeah everybody seems so happy yeah they do healthy running that girl the bottom right I don't think she's running no I want to know how many people were there that didn't run that were just like we showed up motion yeah but look at that that's a positive thing right there Nike gave him a fat check for this you think so this is all Nike fuck yeah oh there's a Nike logo my keeper this is Nike calm yes this is all Nike dude oh this is some executive at Nike I'm not so excited have we got yeah yeah forget about the fact look he's a businessman is a smart it's a smart move on top of it I want to know I want to show you something this I saw this on the toilet this morning made me think look at how crazy this is this guy you could look this up this guy they pulled a cop pulled him over thought he was drunk and he blew he like blew and he turned that he was brewing beer in his own yes I heard about this early this morning I want to know is like growing alcohol in his own body it's a rare syndrome called Auto brew auto brewing something you have you have to look it up it's fucking insane no one believed him when he said he hadn't been drinking then researchers found his body was producing alcohol that guy on the right it looks like his body's producing alcohol yeah right now swollen and taking shots interesting man the research is at Richmond University Medical Center in New York eventually discovered that the man was telling the truth he wasn't downing beers or cocktails instead there was yeast in his gut that was likely converting carbohydrates in the food he ate to alcohol in other words his body was brewing beer that's fuck auto-brewery syndrome auto-brewery syndrome said common ABS known as gut vermin gut fermentation syndrome how many fucking people have I've never heard of another lady two years three years ago whoa women claims her body brews alcohol has DUI charge dismissed but was she hammered that dude in the previous article was two and a half times the legal limit this was four times the legal limit she blew she blew it right but was she feeling the effects of it or is it just in in her blood no it's in their blood they know he doesn't feel it they it just I don't think you exert any symptoms of being drunk I think it's just really are you guessing yeah I think that's what the article said I'm in touch with 30 people believe they have the same syndrome about ten of them are diagnosed with it said Panola College Dean of Nursing Barbara Cordell who has studied the syndrome for years they can function at alcohol levels such as zero point three zero zero point four zero when the average person becomes comatose or dying yet these people are function part of the mystery of this syndrome is how they can have these extremely high levels and still be walking around and talking well this bitch needs to talk to drugs we know a lot of people we know a lot of people who could function who do you know that fuck Bert Kreischer Bert Christ she probably does everything he does it like 50-point 0.50 imagine if you also had this if he had abs and he drinks like he drinks see my Instagram picture Bert today looks good he looks fucking great it looks really good legit yeah you know Whitney was like what did scram filters this like unless he's doing with one of some of my wife's friends do my wife's friends are fucking there they're cartoonists you that were there able to like Photoshop taking pictures they're cartoonists yeah these bitches run filters on these pictures and they shrink their legs down right and they fuck with their friends like they make their friends but a little smaller or their arms a little bigger that's so diabolical man do weird things did you ever think that they need to make their friends changed they definitely do that to each other they do and they call each other up hey take this one down I don't like how many ways looks you look great oh you look amazing that bird picture by the way the lighting is pretty fucking good I'm not gonna go back to the picture there's almost nothing you could do about the side now but that lighting I'd save it look at his side these sides wait that looks a little manipulated they're not manipulated it's not manipulated trust me Bert is not that guy he's not smart enough to do that no no no no that's not what I'm saying he's not a liar like look Bert would not do that that's what he looks like he's been fucking working out hard he's down to like 225 look at it re re wrote there he's raising his arms and sucking News belly tone to post an interaction side shot of him on stage all right such a hater well they've got some beef now after the dosa guru says yeah well Bert should have beat not re yeah are we fucking dosed him are we sure he's just mad that it didn't land as well the well he is what the way he wanted like our he's upset that Bert didn't like laugh it off and have fun of it who the fuck laughs off getting dosed with trust me dude I fucking know but dose me would be fucking I think they should fight it out let him fucking slug it out a little while I think Bert wants to fucking kill him for that who'd you win who'd win that fight a fun fight to watch because early early re squirrelly he's got that like he's like lanky and long and fuck he could put up a good fight Bert's got the bird scout probably the Brits got probably you know there may be a reach on him I don't how much taller he is well re is very tall he's tall he's what is re like 6-3 he's Jitsu background to a little bit right a little a little bit a little bit a little bit I bought him a year he probably went he went until he got staph and that was about basically the end of its when most people would quit he got a bad staph infection on his knee man it was horrible swole up like he was walking with a limp that she can kill you oh yeah he didn't even know he had he thought it was a mosquito a spider bite and he just let it go for when we were playing pool and he was walking around with a limp I'm like what's wrong with your leg and he goes I got a spider bite and you know obviously I've done jujitsu forever and I know that sometimes people think it's a spider bite and staff so I said let me see he pulls his knee up I go dude and I unscrew my pool cue I go go to the emergency room right now I go you have a bad staph infection yeah I thought I was fucking with them he's like he's serious I'm like I am dead serious this can kill you I'm not kidding his fucking knee was all swollen yeah get up like a real clear staph infection I'm like dude you got I'm telling I'm not a doctor but that is fucking staff and then he was angry and he had a really good point he's like why don't they have signs in the gym yeah like you take jiu-jitsu and it's up to everybody to tell you what staff is because um Junior dos Santos just pulled out of his fight he was supposed to fight Alexander Volkov but he got nasty staff in his leg like his lower leg like his calf area yeah all swollen and red and funky cuz he got a staph infection the same thing like he's like why is it hurts it's like painful like you thought like maybe like you know sometimes you clash ends I'll sure do it a lot but you get a cut and then it just gets infected yeah Marissa you know Marissa is yeah that's the worst it's the worst that's the worst version of stands like staph turns into MRSA well it's no it's medication resistant staph right Stafford costs whatever the code face but it's like the medication stuff extreme version yes what's with staph that you find in hospitals unfortunately right because a lot of times that kind of staff is immune to medication he doesn't even know how he got it but I mean it's that stuff that can you can fucking lose oh yeah yeah my one of my wife's friends got staph and she went into a fucking cone started having seizures she got it from a gym from a dirty gym just like lifting weights and shit sitting on those machines doing like lat pull-downs she'll scratch something happen next you know she has this infection doesn't know what it is it gets systemic and next thing you know she's fucking going into shock you know what's why when I use budget like the gym I go to is like immaculate clean and I still walk around like even the bathroom and fucking flip-flops I'm never ever since playing high school sports you learn it's like my dad was always like don't be before him walking around those lockers you have cuts on your feet of shit splat you're you're bound to catch something someone asked allen's friends wife's died from it from of infection under half they were trying to go all homeopathic they were like trying to cure with like fucking parsley and herbs and shit smacking it with leaves Cowan went over the house and she was bleeding from her gums oh my god I was like what the fuck is going on you got to get her to a hospital yes she died they just refused to go to the doc I don't know man I don't know the whole story count old to me years ago he told to me when I first got staph and I was like what and I remember I was on heavy doses of antibiotics to the point where like like I was fuzzy like everything was fuzzy like everything was like he couldn't think straight oh my god my brain was dark ship because believe it or not your gut like what's inside your gut affects your personality it affects your ability to think your energy levels and when you're on when you have staff they fucking dose you ups on ya with heavy-duty antibiotics and I would I couldn't believe that people fight on that sometimes they fight on antibiotics when they have staff cuz you're just not in you're just believe it I could barely make a fist I'm like how the fuck could anybody fight like this Luke Rockhold beat Chris Weidman for the UFC middleweight title when he was on staff medication which is like totally fucking incredible function on it fucking beat Chris Weidman fucking insane insane I have no idea how he did it he had like a nasty staph infection he wound up actually getting a chunk of meat removed from his from his shin and it's it's fucked him up so bad like to this day when he fights and he only fought once with this he has to have like a rap over his entire shin and he had skin grafts and all kind of shit didn't totally take so he has to have he was like an open wound on his chin like forever so he has like this big bandage over his shin and then everything's wrapped up and then he puts like a sleeve over it like a composite ech the skin a compression sleeve over his calf and shin I was now there's so much of that shit that's in sports like all right what's it what's it called um it was always around high schools always worried about people getting from like water fountains and shit do you know what I'm talking about crabs yeah her bases meningitis yes I know a kid in high school that had many guys he lost a hand and a foot from meningitis fro but from high school shit cuz you're around all these kids with all these fucking diseases and sicknesses and woman incubator her kid got paralyzed from getting meningitis from one of those fucking water parks well that's why usually it comes from something water what happens in water a lot apparently you know you get that water gets in your ears and gets in your fucking mouth there was a comic who died from meningitis do we fuck yeah god damn it redheaded kid really nice guy me no well that's it from New York goddamn it he was flying out to do Fantasy Island Jerry read Wilson Jerry Wilson yeah he died from meningitis he was apparently in the doctor's office but it was taking too long to get seen by the doctor he's waiting for like 45 minutes like fuck this I'm getting out of here and he left him on them dying holy shit yeah how'd he get it do you know how he got it do not know he was a nice guy - man funny kid - and his career was just starting to take off this is like in the 90s I knew him from New York yeah we knew each other from the clubs and then he came out here I had been living down here for like a year or so and he came out here and he is like shit was pappad for him he had a development deal to do a TV show he was doing the new Fantasy Island you remember when they had Fantasy Island I know they brought it back he was doing the new Fantasy Island and and then he and then he just refused to suck and he got on a plane he got on a plane and I think I think he actually flew to Hawaii to do the show and when he got out there he was fucked by the time he got there he was far that's always sad when you hear people that like I don't know if he hadn't struck you know not that but you know when you people have to have instructions to not get on a plane this happens all the time people like fuck that shit and then they die because of it it's like that dude that was in Dave Matthews Band what happened he took he had surgery you got to look it up to make sure I'm not fucking out of my butt but he making things up yeah making it up yeah I think he's fun to make things I remember the old days yeah you didn't have to worry about ends up yeah right drinking beer talking shit people just tell you lies and you're like whoa I didn't know you can get cancer from that yeah yep sure can give me another beer Jimmy yeah he died he I think he had surgery and he got on a plane right Leroy more right you were more and he got in a fucking plane after the doctors told him not to fucking fly and he did and then he died 2008 because he had some kind of weird surgery right yeah accident on his ATV right punctured lung right maybe was that cuz there died from that Wow Oh pneumonia blood clot he got pneumonia was so different he died from a blood clot the coroner's office to determine his cause of death to be pneumonia Wow fuck but but I don't know if it's gonna say it on there I'm almost positive that they told him not to get on a fucking plane and he did any row how much does it take how many years is it take off a flight attendants life I mean they they look good they all look so sad now they look sadder than they did when I was young why is that dude they all look so fucking sad did it get we did the pay get worse it can't be good no it never was good but the bet people used to do it usually because they were like I could fly for free and smoke and everybody in my family but now everyone I see every flight we take they look fucking miserable maybe it's you you're handing out barf bags and shit are throwing up all over yourself in the bathroom clean this up even the ones that like even the ones that I'm I have a good feeling about even they seem like bum the fuck out yeah I don't I just like even when I'm like hey how you doing the like hi do you want something before we leave I just feel like that's a it's a tough tough gig man that's a tough fucking gig to constantly be like you know what it really is because people are such pieces of shit and we're we're becoming more pieces of shit like nobody obeys any of the fucking rules about like overhead space and any of that stuff and I think it's it's extreme now because people are like I'm not checking my and bag I'll stuff it in the roof people do get a little kunti though some lady and this guy got a little Kunti with me on the flight over because all the overhead bins were full and I was in one row when they were like four rows behind me and I went back down I moved some stuff around and put my bag up there and the guys like you think he would use the bin that's above his head right oh my don't you think I would if it was he didn't even look like look at all these bags he always bags people people are people cop attitudes for and they get mad at the this was insane we were in Denver coming back and a dude they had cancelled the flight and a dude was losing it on the gate attendant you know he was like you fucking you fucking asshole I like going off and everyone's kind of like turn like pissed like if I can piss that this guy's losing on just asshole in a public space like this for no reason and this dude is sitting on the floor and I can tell he's like kind of bobbing and he's like reeling and then finally he pipes up he goes eh go fly another fucking airline it's not this guy's fucking fault and then this guy was like oh what do you care about it he's like dude it's not his fault if you got an issue with it let's go take a walk and then you could tell his his alpha fucking step up scared this dude to death and he was like don't fucking yell at that guy that guy there cunts guy who yells yes some flight attendant or someone who works the desk it's not her fault they don't get to make the call their employees the kinda desk he is nothing he doesn't hit him by the way he doesn't care he's like dude I get paid one fucking hourly I'm barely here right he's not pertinent pretending he runs Delta but I love what the guy said he goes go fly another fucking airline cuz the guy kept saying he goes you guys do this all the time and they do it on the ground goes go fly another airline but there's a ton of them if you're so unhappy wow it's like don't fucking yell at those I died that really it with the conflict in the heat in the air it was thick it was nice well I went up to him I was like dude that's

yeah table read like everyone's in the room that means like executives producers Yeah right never got in the script before felt like he was fucking his first time on that boat but I was like what it's going do be it was of the for the studio that's great I'd be crazy that'd be crazy for him to never see that scripting gonna do a studio table read I shouldn't even have said that mmm fuckin whatever I'm not in the movie yeah it just felt like he was like I'm just saying the difference when you meet people in in in in this industry in the television television and film that are like just really really good right it's just it you see it right away they're on their fucking I bet you the rock is phenomenal and table reads and table reads are important because the studio gets to see it they get to kind of write you're selling it a little bit you know I mean the movies gonna get fucking made it doesn't matter yeah but it's just like it sells you more to all of these other sources to feel like yep this is the guy we want to get behind yeah because I've run into a lot of great actors and actresses in the business and like you can fuckin tell dude the way that they handle things sometimes you're like oh man that's why they're good they just are like ready for it it's like it's it's like a good it's the same way a good comedian can just turn on you know we can be having this conversation seconds later you get on stage and psych and you just know you know when to you know when to per maybe he already got the gig and didn't know that's a bummer I guess I get maybe he was

loved it I'm gonna tell you what I told you this morning to try together I nearly lost my shit oh I hear I hear in the middle of the film in the middle like a really serious scene I hear someone go there punched in on his face I hear a woman go did they photoshop a harelip on him I almost threw my popcorn I was almost like that's it I'm out of here I felt like the way I felt when I first saw the movie Natale in theatres here things like that you hear things sometimes like you hear things like out of nowhere you heard I heard a girl say in the ass is okay but in the ass and the mouth no fucking way I heard a girl say it's right she's right but it's just like that kind of that combination of things you wouldn't you liked what you're like I'm sorry this is Jimmy Jones can you be a that's fine but in the acid in the mouth no fucking away like what was the context of that fucking conversation then well there's a site that's dedicated to that called overheard in LA overheard in LA and all they do is talk about bullshit that you hear in Los Angeles that's like stupid LA only phrases you know yeah and that's got to be one of them this place it's you're out I'm checked out because it's on fire no no it's on fire the whole fucking place is on fire Bel Air is on fire right now yeah Bel Air yeah yeah well you got girl dressed as a cat I'm almost 30 this Halloween is my last chance to fuck a guy dressed as Harry Potter how much those writers though that are writing that kind of course yeah I'm sure I'm sure it was birthed organically I'm sure some some dudes started it for fun and then it just you know kept going yeah I'd like to fucking I'd like to go away from the fires Northern California's even worse than we are I think we complain but they're really listen Ouma's on fire yeah they get it bad it's bad up there yeah that's where Henry sued almost burnt fucking burnt to death you can catch fires man everywhere that's dry and LA is dry as fuck in last year we got a lot of rain in the winter and everybody predicted that all this rain was gonna dry out as soon as the rainy season was over the grass was gonna grow really high because of all the nutrients in all the water and then boom because the nutrient when we have fires and then water it's a terrible combination because apparently all the carbon from the fire actually helps all these plants grow right and then it just look overgrown and then now it's over then there's all this dead shit it's so overgrown yeah so when the the areas where I run weeds were higher than I'd ever seen him before right like fucking six foot tall weeds and all that mustard grass shit yeah that stuff yeah yeah yeah that fucking shits everywhere yeah and then when that dries up it's over what are those things called that like my dog gets somewhat foxtails you know the oh my god everywhere and that shit's dry and fucked up every my dog gets America he has long hair yeah cuz Golden's are bad and he runs and the fucking bushes he loves that shit he's crazy takes forever we took my dog fucking camping that was the worst shit on earth because she was just rolling around in that shit and she gets back all happy and I'm like god dammit I gotta pick these fucking things I get a brush them yeah brush that's the worst yeah we're on fire I want to go I wish we could go where would you go you'd go to Chicago go back to Chicago yeah I would if I really could I would if I could just tour from Chicago and then do whatever I wanted to do every once in a while why couldn't you so much to do here there's so much shit here so what's the problem hmm friends yeah friends like you and Diaz and all our friends that are here you know I love the fact like last night I did that benefit for Kalyn Kevin's friend yeah yeah I go there sobs they're normal Donald's there we're all having fun towns there we're all laughing and hugging each other we have a great time Chappelle Lacey was there we're all laughing it's so fun I'm like I love the fact that I could leave my house I left my house at 8 o'clock I'm there at 9 I'm home by like midnight you know not even I think I was home at 11:30 I was only there for like an hour and a half but I had a great time i recharge of camaraderie and friendship you're not gonna get that if you leave and plus it was cool to do you know we did an arena Saturday night and then you go to do the main room it's like you feel the difference to those two rooms so definitely you you know you ought to talk about is how fucking we were taken back by the Fox Theater was fucking insane in Detroit oh yeah people you can see it on my Instagram I took videos of it and some photos and it's the most beautiful theater and I've worked at a lot of beautiful theaters yeah most beautiful theater stunning man when they the the staff is so cool they took us out afterwards the show was done we had chilled for a while me and Ian Edwards and Joe had gone back down to the stage and holy shit yeah they're gonna fucking look inaudible that is it's crazy and this is from the 1920s and they restored it did he see in the eighties yeah the 80s it got rich fuckin a this place is beautiful and the staff there is proud yeah like like that dude that I forget I don't remember his name unfortunately really nice guy that yeah that gave us all the and then they turn the lights down for us so we could see what it really looks like and then turned the roof light on because they had all these spotlights on so they could clean and get everything ready and they'd turn those down for us and turn the house lights on so we could see all the ornate gilded woodwork and just like you can't build a place like this and the way you can't you can kind of see on the top row there's faces carved up there yeah and he said they're all hand done I mean it's just it was fucking unreal oh he said he said they redid it in the 80s and five guys died while building it while while fixing it and he had said when they had a guy up there cleaning they found a helmet and like a like a pickaxe almost that was like placed and the helmet was on the pickaxe and this bozo comes down he's like look at his shit and the guy was like hey put that back that was a in memory of one of the builders that died during the original construction of it like they had put it deep in the rafters they found he found Emily was cleaning it was awesome he's like this places and he meant right away of course I knew was gonna go there after me and Joe are like oh yeah fucking yeah this is amazing and then he goes and he goes and you know it's haunted I was like I knew that was coming I could tell from that I could look from his face he wanted to tell us that so bad your mother's pussy song your mother's pussy he said somebody George Lopez no he said some comic was there and could hear the knocking apparently there's like knocking in the roof and he just bitched about it half of the show was saying like he kept hearing the knocking while he was on stage and I was like really the last one subdue the fucking bomb and bro dude you can hear the knock something about the knocking that's bothering me well do the other night you said it at the improv there was a cricket inside yeah it was amplified like you could hear it so I was so loud and that was both shows yeah right yes Wednesday the first show I didn't

couldn't really hear it in the second show I was so loud I could hear it must have been up in the roof and something no it was over near the piano so the pain is over right underneath the fucking who's amplifying the piano piano Joe Joe is loves the piano at the Hollywood improv this is my favorite the fact that it takes up seats I love the fact that it gets in the way of the people that are sitting over there they don't have a good view of the show I love the fact that it's fucking useless and no one plays piano there they say Craig Robinson uses it preg Robinson has his own fucking keyboard reboard brings and everywhere he goes yeah whenever he does shows it's not hard puts in his trunk you know they have one there for him too no that's stupid fucking piano then they have two stupid fucking pianos you have one upstairs in the green room yeah like what are what what what you know bud love bud probably loved pianos that's all channels and monocles my mum pianos musta fucking loved to buy to piano it is an old idea did its did the story used to have a feel right next to the stage in the main room like when you stand west if Jeff Scott would play a piano like he does in the main room yeah do they still play piano in the main room or in the old war rather keyboard in the o.r keyboard over there yeah yeah well these two have a piano in the main room yeah I can your piano

doesn't taste great or you put the dissolve tablets they have now and your whole tongue the composition of your tongue chin so like you could eat a lemon and it tastes it tastes sweet Wow yeah it's fucking miracle mirrors all right fruit it's an SCM deliciou for some soon ESPA Lum doleful see emphysema look at you you're really good with Latin don't for see you do you have a Latin education yeah plant known for its berry when eaten causes sour food subsequently consumed to taste sweet the effect is known is the fact is due to miraculin your acumen sounds too close to mescaline yeah what have you ordered one you got the other hey well still have a good night interesting yeah it's wild man a good friend of mine did at a dinner party and we were because a lot of people are skeptical they were like no he said could you try it so then for appetizers he would give us this and you know they had a platter of different things to try out that were usually sour and it's insane how sweet it tastes what about a sweet fruit like a melon with autism well everyone has when you taste sugars it tastes different on everyone's tongue when you're on this fruit so for some people tastes dull and other people it tastes kind of like off like it's not oh it's not the correct flavor profile so like some people take like for me sugary stuff tasted kind of dull or like nothing Apple days dull mmm mmm apples not sweet enough like a like an orange like I said orange slice but I mean it just takes kind of flat flat yeah flattens weird interesting I never know about that I never heard about the more you know the more you know but that's so that's tough I wish there was more shit like that for food when you ate it that like makes it - yeah that makes different things taste better that like that gets rid of the one part that that's nasty like I like blue cheese but then sometimes if I eat it I taste too much of the of the fucking oh I love that stuff I love it a giant bar of blue cheese I love blue cheese it's just in small doses I'm okay with it but if it's too much of it too much of the guffy cheese stuff like I enjoy steak as is yeah I don't need anything on steak but I've had steak like a filet mignon with like a blue cheese crumble on top phenomena we had good steaks at dinner that Jamie missed because he couldn't come see he fucked up Dork Jamie losses Jamie got one them cool front wallets a ridge wallet which I have - they're the best but and they have RFID protection but it's never happen to you is anybody ever scanned your credit card I was been wondering about that if people I mean I remember like Dateline special people couldn't scan you when you're walking by you can do that but did anybody ever do that I'm sure they do definitely think they have done it okay but how do they do it do they have to be right on top of it like how does it work they have to be within a certain amount of distance because like just like on the bank scanner same thing you know yeah I've heard they have to be within a few feet of you that's pretty pretty I think Subway's places like that or more so something where you're sitting next to someone for a long period of time and they're right near you runs walking by you has got to be so hard check it up well so Jamie has his Ridge wallet but he also has sweat pants yeah also had his feet up on the chair in front of them birth and his his shit fellow his ID credit cards no cash though right okay I get 20 bucks on that yeah and your ID so you couldn't come see us man you fucked up bro he might he might be fucked up so

you try to get a passport I so there's a couple of things that you I thought you could do apparently you can't do so there's a confusion on what that is about the ability for that the actual card is now on the way in the mail flick through the state so now it's just in the hands of this you get in a month the time I ever lost at my in Ohio you could just go go back and get it right away so like I know a days yeah I don't know when the times have changed on that I don't think the birth certificate I have is certified because it's it's an actual photocopy of my real birth certificate which I used to use that was a good thing to have back in photocopy which sorts of shit now I don't even have that my mom's gonna help me get it dude I don't know you even know where any of that stuff it's gotta be in my mom's house somewhere but I have no fucking idea where that stuff is oh Jesus Social Security all ways bring my passport as well just in case yeah that's the smartest yeah but also

President Elizabeth Warren it's gonna bring you into a room shut your mouth show you all the things it's gonna be Peter Budaj and you note is that some some governor from some local some local uh South Bend Indiana he's like we got we got we got a fag runnin in the office he mayor Pete but he say some homo we got some homo running for president who said that some dude it's of local government think city yeah he was all mad he's like and some woman left use like I was so offended anyone people like even a good job as mayor that's no dick yeah remember when although there was a cop that shot someone and his response was inadequate and so they had all these fucking people saying how the fuck are you running for president while you're the mayor yeah which I don't understand either no I don't understand how the fuck you could have an incredibly time-consuming tax taxing job like being the mayor Ralph a major city not major but it's a city a city there's a few people over there where you're supposed to be running that and you're also running for president it sounds like you're slacking yeah right yeah it's like if you had a job and you were the fucking CEO of whatever fuckin Heineken right and then in the meantime you're out there campaigning to be the CEO Budweiser yeah Hanukkah will pull you over hey fuckface I talk to you for a second to you what are you doing what's up dude you're not even here you're eight hours out of the fucking week you're off going doing Budweiser shit yeah yeah but that's a great gig I thought was a really good kid I'd like to keep the Heineken gig while I try to get the Budweiser gig if you don't mind if you guys are cool with it yeah I hope you guys are cool with it how did you find it you laugh even more look at that widely spread video a community commissioner County Commissioner Warren Hearst can be seen giving minutes long speech against what he sees as an American changing America changing towards liberal values arguing you need to make his jurisdiction a gun sanctuary meaning that resources would be diverted away from enforcing certain gun laws whoa in the speech Hirsch lamented well we got runner for president in the Democratic Party saying that better candidates could be found in jail he continued we got a clear running for president if that ain't about as ugly as you can get referring to but we got it we're running for prison only gang you can get what do you think would happen if he became president how bad would the homophobia be in this country through the fucking bro fucking holy shit it almost would be worse for gay people in the short run Yeah right yeah it's like yeah the homophobes would mate they would be so adamant it would be so it'd be dangerous for Buddha could you did you could what a judge Buddha checks would set up but he doesn't have a fucking snowball's chance in hell I mean he's not even remotely close no you know who kills means that beta or rope or work yeah it seems like a joke yeah like someone said luck dude here's the sketch for the next 24 months you are gonna pretend you're running for president and I just want you to like skateboard and say a bunch of dumb shit speak Spanish I feel real clumsy with the way you talk about things but tell them you gonna take their guns just say it openly say fuck the Second Amendment I'm taking your guns I mean beta beta or Roark I'm gonna be alpha Oh Santino on the next time I run it's like you know how you know like you know how Ali G like yeah he has these characters yeah Sarah Sacha Baron Cohen yeah you know he has the fucking Borat character he has the gay character it's almost like a character yeah like I made like a fictional person of a super like emo sort of did Sam Triple E had a picture of bado on his Instagram saying don't ever forget this when this guy runs for president it's him covered with letters like letters all over his body this is like vegan feminist it's like writing all over his body and I said to Samus is that really him just like fuck it is I don't know if Sam really knows yeah it's just gotta Sam's done any research Sam and I say man I have endless endless arguments like open nowhere perfect I almost hope it is him I don't know I'm looking for that exact picture that wasn't the only thing I do know about him before this was happening was that he was known to be in this thing called the cult of the dead cow which is like a hacker group back in the day her first hacker groups you know like when the movie hackers anything like that time period I think it must come from that the cult of the Dead uncovered with all the word that's right I don't know what that know it's like him in his underwear with writing all over his body did you see that they fucking change the ABCs yeah how'd they do that thank you now they don't know it's not you know because our youth you know you learn lMNO lMNO so now it's not lMNO why they sing it l em and they changed the rhythm of the fucking song because they don't want kids to say elemental take it confused that those are not separate that they are separate letters I saw yesterday who's the they that changed I don't know I recorded a new version of song right basically that's getting is it going in schools that's the one thing I no everywhere that I don't know about that but did you did you find the beautiful picture I don't know I think I saved it my favorites I see a bunch of like older pictures of them from back then that or they save you on Sam no but did you save it on did you look at Sam's Instagram that's nice Graham right or you could ask Sam to send it to you I don't I didn't have it in my favorites I probably so disturbed by they didn't make it a favorite you know it's Sam's wallpaper on his phone I'm sure wallpaper house it's pretty far back okay yeah it's like six months ago yeah maybe too far back is he post everyday it might not be worth it I was gonna say just Instagram Sam Tripoli bade oh what a weird name to be late Oh Baby Doe is so close to beta betta Oh rope just said he seemed like such a silly guy and then that girl Katie he'll announce her resign mushi's dude and a woman yeah the ruppell's baby she was banging a guy and a girl yeah really well the girl she openly admitted to the guy she said was there was false rumors about their work sexual relationship that they never hooked up at work or some bullshit like that what's the problem that her husband that's probably part of it she's married but that her husband comma a problem one that he's being emotionally abusive to her by like releasing all this information about her cheating oh that's hilarious yeah he's being emotionally abusive imagine if it was a wife doing that about a male come on maybe I wouldn't know would say that you would never say that she's being emotionally abusive about her cheating husband nope that's Larry she said but it's hard this article that I read said he's being emotionally abusive about her past about her whatever infidelity yeah her infidelity right then he's focused cuz they got video you know there's video of her banging coconuts with these dude her cannot believe people in pictures and all this shit Wow some some comma kind of funny Wow tweet this morning that was like I just like the idea of a throuple is kind of hot but when you saw the picture of who she hooked up with you're like bomber Wow sometimes sometimes it's better just the imagination I found the picture Sam put update I know this is not a real picture of bado oh I caught it before it was the last day for it to damn it no never mind okay I was nothing I didn't think I was gonna find that either but imagine if it was real put the picture up okay I want to see I want to see a rib so triply there look at that look look look look look how nice atheist vegan naturist is that a word naturist ecologist queer slut hmm okay that's someone's boy and that's not a real picture that's a picture of someone but not beta but I've been out of beta but it looks exactly like it looks a lot like him I think Triple E thought it was him who's hoping the old days you could just say it's him yeah what is it show a picture I promise man you Brahmas yeah I miss it citizen Jason - what yeah when people are masons everybody freaks out I'm so ignorant I don't really know what that is but I see it all the time what's an ancient group that you could belong to and I know but they still have I know that but I mean it's still happening today I don't understand who's cool becomes a Mason today isn't Michael Chevelle owes a Mason and I think Pat Miletich is a Mason as well someone else Randall Carlson I do you right how do you go through it what do you do there like a fraternal fucking oh no I think it's like some guy explaining to me once in Houston some dude and he seemed pretty honest he's like that's fucking guys club you hang out yes like the rotary is like some secret shit it's gone on forever never he goes but it's nothing it's mostly just a place where guys hang out they say that that's how planning some fucked up shit though that's that's really where people plants everything don't worry about us it's not that government takeover type show yeah yeah yeah yeah who do we talk to in the car that said that they were saying they think oh that they was talking about Snowden saying that he's

hold me when I was baby and they groomed me didn't know oh yeah I didn't know oh yeah yeah yeah control opposition thing is when people on the outside you know have you ever had someone like come up with a theory about you that you read it you're like what I'm gay according the Internet that's my that's my favorite I'm gay because I said on a post one time that I married Chris D'Elia that we were like running away and like a foreign publication got ahold of it that like that's the English translations hysterical what do you think the original language was I don't warrant was her foreign just form just foreign foreign foreign but it just says I'm gay if you look it up is Andrew Santino gay it says a lot of things say I'm gay congratulations yeah I'm actually kind of stoked about if you get

these guys are it's unfuckin real yeah but it's an amazing way to exercise when you realize like look this shit look at this shit look at this shit this guy's doing dips but he's doing dips with his legs almost parallel to the floor behind him that requires like freakish control of your body there's so many of these guys too it's like it's an incredible way to work out like you really realize like man you don't need a gym to get a body like that like who wouldn't be happy with a body like that who do I gotta lift some weights that's about as good a body as you can get and these fucking guys are all doing it at the gym I mean at these you know these gym setups in the park you can get a fucking amazing workout it's just a lot of push-ups set ups and pull ups right that's the majority

white letters on it yeah just cause like there's a girl got mace in the face it just had to have this said make Bitcoin great again someone didn't read it they just really bother reading it fuck you with your red hat with white letters they may store right in the face the video of it now I'm ignorant but as this happened for any other president where this kind of thing had like did someone works for another president that was kind of cool no no no no this is number one phrases not only that dude how about what it says make America great again mm-hmm who's like fuck you we don't want it to be great fuck you it's just a representation in the context they just associated Trump so they like that's it it's also again like make it great again like what well was it great when slavery was legal when was it great and Civil Rights wars were going on one was it great yeah the phrase is inherently what things were segregated when was it great name the great time what was it great when we first came here and we stole it from Pete when it's great right now bitch yeah this is good has ever been it's not gonna get better than if you pay attention to like real trends forget about how you feel like forget about like your own personal experience if you just look at objective trends in terms of violence crime all the statistics that we're all really terrified about right there's never been a better time no there's never been a better time for humanity but it's always gonna be the United States it's pretty goddamn good good we always were our best critic you know fuckin Trump just went after Chicago again he just was making fun of my city because of the crime rate saying how we can't get it under control I was talking about the cops yeah cago cops yeah saying that that we can't get crime under control in Chicago well he's probably making fun of the mayor you know in some way oh yeah blaming it on the mayor oh yeah that's what it is it's your favorite mayor yeah I love her well just easy to make fun of she seems like a nice lady though we just get shot Chicago gets shots taken out at all the time because it's like they're like fucking Duvall violence it's accent all fuckin violence well that's what's even more fucked about it's a very specific area that has had extreme violence for a long time South Side no I said yeah it's dark max but then it's so much meanwhile scary that when you have a place that like it's where it's isolated you know where there's just like so much violence there then outside of it it's really nice like what but some of the nice areas we're getting even like kids would do these things they do these mob attacks where they go like a really nice area like Michigan Avenue where all the tourists aren't shit and they were just like robbed someone but they be like 15 people on one you know so they knew that a they were gonna get away with it and be how could you stop it's kind of so much K it's like organized chaos and they would run into a store and steal shit and just leave mmm because they figure you're not gonna get all of us Brian it's like maybe one person gets caught but rob from the rich you know I saw a video of I don't know how many times have done it right now but group so it's happened three times in California twice here is somewhere else [Applause] probably 200 people get on those scooters and just take over a street and then just go wherever they can go oh shit and the cops are trying to stop them but there's so many people they can't stop and the helicopters are on them do they organize online Facebook meetups or something like that Wow like what are those things called on one of those things call when people have like flash mobs flash mobs I have a flash mob for scooters yeah I haven't seen anything dangerous happening but I mean I'm sure it's speaking of dangerous what do you think about what Trump did when that guy when they killed the head of Isis and he said he died crying and whimpering and then he watched the whole thing on video I'm like Jesus he's like a he's like a deranged comedy writer like he's like a fucking sometimes I think he's like trying to be funny or clever and it I just don't it's like an autistic kid he just doesn't his tick is wrong but that just does not seem very presidential no something his dick is off I think he thinks it's normal or fun or or interesting or dynamic and people are like he has no one person next to him going do we is that what you want us that's the version that you want to say cuz he just I we talked about that on the plane is like the theory of how do you tell someone they're wrong when things have told them that they're right how do you tell the guy that's like I won against all odds to become the president when someone's like you shouldn't tweet that he's like really look at all the fucking other stuff that you know I mean like it's hard to convince this guy that he's wrong well if anybody feels I'm not to do things he fires yeah they're gone yeah so it's just kind of like he's a bunch of yes men anyway well he's treating the presidency the same way he treats running Trump Tower yeah but it's the same thing you fire anybody tells them what to do get the fuck out here if I had yeah I'm just doing on a large scale but do we expect deer friendly that's what's weird like what what would you expect different out of a guy who's 70 what is he 74 no how old is he mid-seventies yeah that's so old to be running a giant fucking thing like the presidency allows McDonald's baby doesn't how's my Donald I know loves Kentucky Fried Chicken what's this what was it say SME 373 did you see the photo what yesterday oh yeah there's a lobby where sent us is a staged photo yeah it looks it does look god this Photoshop och yeah I liked all the things aren't plugged into the cat five wires they just kind of laid them around yeah all the guys are kind of like looking in different directions fucking let that what kind of IT guy let that thing be so goddamn sloppy what is this supposed to be a photo of them watching that happen because they're trying to compare it to the one that happened now this the Obama one when they get bin Laden and everyone's around the world I'm how weird is it they all watch that's funny there's a bunch of photos go down there's a bunch of Photoshop ones that are coming out now they're making jokes about Sarah Palin they're back we suffered a this weekend a Hulk Hogan checking down some guy at a restaurant he was on crutches and some guy must have said something fucking stupid to him and he walked up to him and he was giving him the whole like like like like I'm a personality but I'll still bust you're like that's what I like about guys like that they're like you know I'm famous and like you know it's you can be like cute and hello and say from bye like talk shit and I'll still fuck you up like Hulk Hogan will fuck you up he's a big fella he said we were telling it we were saying that he lost like three plus inches of height because of all of his back operations yeah cuz they removed all of his discs and fused them all together so all the cushion in between his discs they're all gone it's fuckin nuts all the spinal columns are all smooshed together and bolted down in so many different places and it's all from Pro Wrestling that yeah so hard on you but does take such a toll on their fucking body as much as I think it's still goofball bullshit oh my god it's so hard physically so hard fist well that's why Dallas Page created DDP yoga I know I mean he really created that just to strengthen his spine and rehabilitate himself from all the injuries that he had heard during Pro Wrestling he's the shit he's a good days I great dude I just think that fucking workout is hard as shit yeah you see like in shape dudes trying it online and they're struggling yeah fucking hard man look yoga's hard and his yoga's particularly intense because he adds a lot of dynamic tension to it and right and you know that guy's mean he's in his 60s and he came here and he was doing some yoga poses like grabbing ahold of his ankle and lifting it up over his head he's in fucking tremendous shape I've never done yoga once it's great I know it's good I don't know I don't want to do hot I don't know Jamie best way cuz you stretch out but you're just ganging up on

coin how about $1,000 okay okay okay okay would eat what are we doing we plan I'm not one on one we're playing we're doing okay that's why you guys can't play horse okay I got a thousand dollars on

waiter okay good bran I'm in alright I can't wait well should we film it yeah we should where do we do it though I don't know Staples Center we should make a basketball court next door we might have a little bit there's a couple of feet right it's plenty of room man perfect or do you want to do a pool show and I've been talking about this Jamie and I were talking about this for how many years now all all of them that I've filmed a few times like one time we filmed Fitzsimmons and I playing pool was fun he's good at all right shit yeah 40s way yeah yeah who's the who's the best that you played Artie Lange Artie Lange can play yeah you can yeah you can play you can play yeah he can he doesn't have like so some guys are good at pocketing balls all right you know I mean some guys are good at moving the ball around I don't know any comedians that are really good at moving the ball around with a musician you have to have a stroke like meaning can you draw the ball full table length I know right no comedians other than myself that can do that no comedians other than myself that have actually played in real tournaments you know and I don't play that good now but when I was playing a lot I could pull it I was like a B player I know be level player legit B lever player like I've run four racks in a row of nine broken ran four racks in a row I've run 70 plus balls playing straight pool that's not like world-class not professional level but I'm a like a legit what they would call shortstop yeah you know and then what's our tease around that same level no no he's a little lower than lower then yeah but he play dama rare can play a little bit Adam Ferrara can play yeah yeah he plays pretty good yeah why don't you do a pool show I should do a pool show and why not here's the thing how do you make it entertaining you know it just will be maybe you just talking shit playing pool having fun yeah maybe we'd have to give people wired mics and we it would have to yeah I mean it could be funny it can be fun but I mean how many people can play how many people can allege it well here's one thing that I could do that be fun bring in pros and just get stomped that would be funny to watch them do tricks on him shit on your girl pros in have them stomp me yeah and you know what's that Asian woman into Black Widow Jeanette Lee she's fucking awesome she's very good but she's not the best no she's gonna stretch the imagination you know she's really good but she's had some severe also severe back problems she had scoliosis a bunch of back surgeries but she's you know she's way better than me yeah she's like she's legit could a pro be able to teach a comedian well enough to compete against you hell no that's actor it's like golf it takes years it would take years like I could not play for a year like I get like you could take a person that doesn't know how to play and they could play every day for a year and I'll still crush them just why don't you want to play golf because I'm scared it's such a specific wonderful you would love I know that's why I don't want to play it yeah you shoot I have a real problem with games I can't oh he would he would fucking love call it'd be two rounds before every show you guys go or anywhere I'd be like running out of time and I would yeah Ron White is the fucking King he loves it look at his Instagram it's always pictures I don't know you know two shows tonight right now I'm playing golf dude it's right up your alley the specifics the technique though it's so much like exactly what you like not interested it's one more thing on your plate that's too many things and it also takes a lot of time golf takes time you don't play 18 holes yeah but you shit takes hours no you would take you would just start with 9 is what you would do ok how many 2 hours is that - you can do it in under - if you walk it it takes longer getting that cart you can you could play speed golf dude you can knock out 9 holes in an hour and 25 minutes really yes absolutely it especially if you don't suck - that's a problem no but but but when you're especially learn yeah dude I'm obsessed right now with handguns ok yeah well most apps right now doing tactical ranges I'm gonna set it yeah but I got to back off it a little bit so wanted to go everyday yeah but why is that bad because it's fucking crazy I'm crazy I can't it's I can't throw gas on the fucking dry twigs and throw a match and run away I can't do you do do you take something out when you add something in or is it just pile yes get in the way of my writing get in the way of you know whatever the fuck it is yeah see I find when I play I when I golf it's my favorite time to think your heads clear you're in nature there's nothing going on right and you're trying to knock that ball and the whole point of good golfers will tell you that your head should you shouldn't be like having a million thoughts about you should be kind of fluid and in in the moment a little bit so that's like the best play you can play sounds like hot yoga I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it hot yoga definitely take so I'm gonna do it but it's in the middle of it I want to bail I'm gonna bail bale pussy it's not pussy it's just I don't want to sit in this honey room why does it have to be hot because it's hard makes it difficult oh it's not test your will it's more it feels annoying I don't like hot stuff I don't like hot rooms what about hot food I like spicy food what about a hot coffee I like ice better this is that old theories like would you rather be cold all the time or hot all the time I'd always rather be cold I'd be hot take hot see you what would you take well it depends on how hot I don't want 120 on this is my point a dress Alaska all year-round or in fucking in in by the equator all year-round would you rather live in Phoenix Arizona or or Enix is right great yeah it is and then the in the summer time you just find a place with AC I lived there it was it's awful in the summer it's the it's 120 is too much it gets rough but the winners amazing yeah it's beautiful but I'd rather be in winter a lot more than in summer a lot more do you crank a hotel room up or down that's a big difference oh dude it went in my hotel stay it like when it goes you know like six whatever can go down below yeah I go to low as it can go so you like being cold yes really wanted freezing but look at you you're like cold climate person cuz I run but I brought white skin you run I run hot a mad man always drunk throwing up everywhere plane that's what it was I was blacked out mmm i ply I just drink in that morning I just ride I didn't go to bed puking on a fuckin plane by the way for those that know puking on a plane is is exactly as uncomfortable as you would fucking imagine it do you bring your own golf clubs on the road you ever do that a lot of times if I'm going to a place I know I'm gonna play golf that's when it gets crazy no why yeah if or or or if it's a nice enough course I just will rent their clubs from them oh they have good clubs a nice course always has a good set of clubs yeah shitty courses have but I'm not playing any I'm playing nice courses if I'm gonna go and play that's a good move yeah that way you don't have to worry about it well dude FedEx does ship sticks and all this stuff they ship sticks it's a cut there's there's places that take your clubs they ship them for you and they're there when you get there costume it's that's a good move awesome yeah they don't have to think about it that's a good move because like when you get on a plane it's a fucking massive pain in the ass I live in the shit around us no no shipping homes wait let's check things and you gotta wait fuck the baggage claim and hope they didn't fuck with your club but I get used to it like when I four snowboards I have to bring my fucking snowboard everywhere cuz you don't want to ship that oh yeah I rent skis I always ask easy I don't like rentals shit cuz it's been but I have my own boots but I rent skis skis or skis yeah I guess I guess I sucked anyway like I'm not a good skier you're not no is anybody in your family good yeah my kids are way better than me they're good yeah they're better than me my my 11 year old she always wants to go to the fucking black diamonds she's a little daredevil fuck that I love that no I go rip she does jumps and shit and fuck oh yeah she's 11 sheet but at some point she weighs 80 pounds I mean not even fly through the fuckin D yeah she flies she flies and lands but when you go skiing D what do you stay on the easy Hill yeah carve a nice ass off I don't like skiing I do it cuz they they like it you don't like it nope oh god it feels so fucking good I love it this is where I go don't get hurt don't get hurt don't get hurt didn't get hurt the ulta and get hurt don't get hurt look at this fucking asshole Jesus Christ cut right in front of me because some dick wads there's always like some la douche yeah it's just uh just a little too cocky with the hanging and just a little too into it and probably on adderall just fucking whiz in his way down this yeah yeah it is nobody's got its listen the more I the older I get when I go do it the more scared I am because of how fast people are going now like dumb people are gonna stop in the middle of the trail and fix their ski like go over to the side dipshit - what two seasons ago I had I almost lost it on this poor kid I came over this hill and I you can't see on the other side and he was laying down cuz he had fallen he was crying and I'm coming over this little lip and I'm panicking in the middle of the area him oh my god I think I'm gonna kill him dude oh my snowboard is fucking imagine I think I'm gonna slice his face open and I and I'm moving my weight through the air as I'm falling and I eat shit I mean I eat shit and then I throw my shit off and I grab this kid by the jack and I like throw him although probably like seven or eight you know I mean Ruis oh yeah dude cuz I need him up yeah I kick my shit out in a little fucking bitch what'd you do I put him in a fuckin headlock I see fuckin say Santino is the best no but I threw him off to the side I was like dude you cannot be there you're gonna get kit you're gonna get hurt like he could have gotten fought only 7 he doesn't know any better but I know dude but that's why I'm like don't be on this side of the hill but that's the problem is like kids go on tough runs and they don't know what they're doing yeah that is a problem you get hurt bad I mean he could have got skis and some of the cons like no one it's not like like when you go on a blue or green no one tells you hey you're not ready for a green I know let me see your certificate yeah you should just i watch this lady eat shit I could see it I was like oh my god she's not supposed to be a here's how you know when you go to Colorado or you go to a resort and you see a guy on the gondola and or going up to the top lift with jeans on I'm always like I'm gonna follow this or he's awesome he's not gonna create fucking rare possible most of those guys know not to wear jeans listen I'm not fucking crying let's go skiing with Jean right let's jean jacket jeans jeans with song over the jeans yeah yeah let's do it I don't mind skiing but I don't like doing it too much it's just I know so many people that have torn their ACL broke it re broke his wrist one year and the year before that he broke his ankle he must be fucking bad I think he's reckless yeah he's reckless a wild person he wants to do he wants to push it all the way to probably on drugs do it that's yes I was just gonna say that's the other problem with Hills is like now people are so fucked up now people also get so drunk and go skiing yeah like midday drinking up at the top of the mountain I and you know how much I like drinking I don't do it yeah cuz I'm like I'm not getting drunken going down a fucking hill and then what if I if what if I hurt someone and I'm drunk no I don't want to do it but you see people at those mid Hill lit mid Hill like it like it dude let a gang me no one stops you nope no one stops you from that no one stops you from taking mushrooms my friend Audrey takes mushrooms for skis that's crazy maybe does better I'll take mushrooms after we ski back at the house maybe took a little bit and you'd be better maybe a tiny bit I'll take a little hit I'll take I'll get I'll get a little high but like I can't get I don't want to get fucked up and feel like I'm not in control when I play pool hi I'm better I'm like one ball better yeah do you think it's in performance-enhancing drug 100% it is huh yeah so what do you think about its way in professional sports Jitsu as well it is for jiu-jitsu what about like compat like what about basketball and baseball I don't play basketball but I would imagine it's similar to pool and that it's a feel thing like my feeling should be illegal for professional sports no no I don't think it should be illegal because it's like it doesn't make you faster or stronger I think those are the things that should make you illegal but it I think you could be just as focused without it but for certain people it enhances your focus it kind of gives you tunnel vision so that's that but I mean that's all I'm saying that's the argument as they say that could be an advantage I could see that it I could see you would say it it's an advantage I feel like it I am better at jiu-jitsu when I'm high I really do believe that like you better form better yes I perform I feel better I feel like a more intuitive I understand positions better understand where I'm going better you ever lift weights huh yes and uh you know it's funny I hate running high I like a lot of people like to get high and run love it no see I get I I can lift weights high but running high I don't that's not my favorite yeah yoga yoga hi oh my god okay so that makes more sense it's the best you feel like every fiber of your muscles you feel things stretching you feel where you're pushing too hard like where things are starting to pop right you feel it yeah you like the runner's high I get from running alone I just feel like it's its own kind of like waterful little drug right but lifting cuz they're because I'm such a DD guy that lifting is easily distractible you know you're like there's so much to do in the gym and so many you're like what am i doing that you know yeah I know I like it I like lifting high there it is just baked out of your fuckin mind Oh what's the one thing you won't do hi Oh commentate on the UFC have you done it before yes and you were high and if I you felt like it did you eat shit no I didn't but I this is my worry I've never done it really high my worry is that I wouldn't want talk about the fights I'd want to talk about other things it just turned into this and we started to talk warring fight like it's first of all it would be extremely disrespectful if while these people who have dedicated months of their life and years of their life training and preparing and here they are in the UFC and I barely paid attention to the phone right yeah I'm subject to not pay attention to from hi I get that from hi I'm paid into the fucking lighting I'll be like how weird is it this lighting thing is above our head it's like a thousand pounds and never even thought about it yeah I could fall asleep how many people have died I'd be like how many people have died from lighting they'd be like Joe there's a fight going on right now no I know but fights come on all you see is like thank you for the lighting tips Joe we go right back to the fight people would be angry yeah it emit Liso it's a dick move that's that like that's that they're like certain people can be really baked onstage I can be a little high but I can't get too high and get on stage I don't like I just feel like my performance lacks it's really weird writing like the other side of it is enjoyable high like I love creating and writing and making high but performing high not my tell you where it's the best to be super high huh let's stand up on the spot show Jeremiah walked in show oh yeah well yes well let's greet it's all improv it's also a complete improvisation high as a kite but that's because it's a it's almost like a win-win for that thing is like even if you're not really coming up with like right shit that you you're like it's still in the moment of fun oh that isn't it move yeah and when you're performing fireball you're doing a fucking arena okay yeah no way I mean we do we've gotten a little hyper yeah I can't get I can't get ripped you know if I'm ripped I'm not fucking good I I've gotten ripped like the most ripped I've ever got is before podcast in the early days of podcasting we were talking about this the other day and I would be in the middle of talking not knowing what the fuck I was talking about yeah and I'd be like wait a minute that's not right what what am I saying what am I even saying it was so many podcast that if I look back on these cringy moments of things that I said I was like I was so high I barely knew what I was talking about right it was the numb is your number accurate for how many this is yes with it we're pretty close or were their numbers I got lost this matrix like things like podcast on a plane that I don't think while we're in the number group or the number was probably like 15 ish that don't have numbers and then the fight companions didn't get numbers what's the number at what are we at this is 1371 you know what you talked about that we never went through with well I don't know what city we were in what we talked about doing it from one of those cool fucking buses yes that's what we talked about and Jamie and I talked about this too was getting a Sprinter van and doing it up in the inside like a podcast studio and then taking it to gigs so like say if you and I did a gig in Irvine right we'd hire a driver Jamie would be in the back working the fucking the controls and all microphones and cameras and we're drive down to Irvine and it works so much better now that the shows not live anymore right it would be easy to do cuz you would just compress it all into a video file and then upload it's nice to still think we should do that totally do know we should do though we should get like three or four comics to go do like a big thing in Vegas yes and we take the drive to Vegas and make us you know like do like a podcast from there to Vega it's like a four-hour drive and then we do all four or five a so four hours if everything goes great sure yeah sure but even still I think that's a great Drive and then you can edit it and cut it down and then get to Vegas show the show and then whatever yeah and we could do it safe - we could actually have seatbelts yeah you know and you have a college it well you can get those Sprinter vans man there's companies that design them they do whatever you want out right I mean they can even put a screen up like that where Jamie can like throw to a screen and we can look at stuff but we would have to have some kind of an internet connection while we're in there well don't they have those um you know those you can buy dog shit are they yeah yeah the DIRECTV's good you can get real Direct TV and those things but your internet really slow what do they think you can buy those from like eight from the from the phone companies that the little tiny pods that you can get some cellular internet connection and I think Chuck our audio guy was telling us that we can they can combine two or three cellular signals and up the bandwidth so maybe we could stream YouTube on a television if you're gonna play whether your phone so you have separate ones yeah you would get separate ones that are dedicated and you get that's a correct yeah there's companies that have it set up so you can have like a backpack for like people that they call IRL streamers that walk around and stream those switches back to us what's going on my presidents they're listening this yeah it'll Snowden go to the whatever antennas working the best at the time you're there and it'll just like tether yeah but if you're in a place that has nothing you have nothing but if we you know drive to Vegas is pretty good most of the way I feel like Vegas is easy though because they because it's so heavy traffic that you need cell phone most of the way oh yeah oh yeah in like the 405 your head down like we had a gig in Irvine or something like that you'd you'd be able to wear like a trip up north to San Francisco would be fucking awesome yeah yeah oh that's a long drive rather fly yeah I guess that's true or let's take a private jet and do it on it do you like Tommy Saguna he's taking private jets all over the place he's hashtag balling balling dude is balling selim everywhere yeah he's over see it is like it's amazing Bert crashes make it fucking crazy money now yeah looking thin starts getting thin and sexy baby yeah everybody's murdering it oh you got a fucking theater tour I got a small theater tour yeah
