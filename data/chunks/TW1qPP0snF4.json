hello freak bitches poking the Pokemon games taking it to the next level yes explain what's going on the easiest way to say wet Pokemon is it takes Google Maps you have to sign into Google it takes Google Maps and all the information that's in Google Maps and it makes it the level of a video game so instead of playing a level you're playing your own Street you're finding you're finding creatures in your house and us so yeah so and then there's places like churches are called gyms that's where you go and if you go to a church you could like train your fighter to be stronger and stuff like that so you're using real world places and like like landmarks and you're finding things that like water fountains like if you go to the water fountain there's a bunch of coins there so it's using the whoa and what's crazy is like if you're at the Comedy Store on Google Maps you can like upload your own photos you know it's like like I was at The Comedy Store on Google Maps so it pulls that information also so if you're playing the game you'll be like oh there's a Andy Kaufman sign if we go to the Andy Kaufman sign we can get some treasures and it shows you the in Kaufman sign in the video game but here's the crazy thing in one like two days it's almost every single person has downloaded and played it I have not and the crazy thing I was thinking of is how awesome is it that it's connected to Google and we're sending because it opens your camera at parts of the game when you're fat battling and it's scanning your room your houses and sending it to Google York so this is like the best way that Google is now getting a complete map of our house inside it's not like it's a scanning every street in like one year your Google is going to be able to see every single inch of it every single place inside and outside because of this game how long has it been out like three days right three days already on more phones on Android than tinder and it's about the past up Twitter yeah I really think we should bring typewriters back I'm sorry and no one's thinking about this though we're just opening our camera recording our rooms sending it to Google man I'm this real Joe your are you just I was just looking up us I knew we're going to talk about so I pulled up some stuff already there's like a the interesting thing that's happening with it being on open GPS maps is those places those locations like there's a guy's home that's been turned into one of these gyms and he's just mad that people are showing up outside of his place it's because he bought an old church and so churches in the game automatically become gyms the people are hanging outside his house now but also interesting things like this has happened where the West boat Westboro Baptist Church has been overtaken by a gay friendly Pokemon and so people are like kind of I don't know necessarily trolling them and whatnot kind of like but then so by walking around and looking for things a teenager found a dead body somewhere in just three days day 14 and so we have dead body found by teenager hunting water pokemon yeah she found it underneath a bridge oh my god and this was it - I was trying to get a water pokemon Wiggins Holtz CNN instead she made the alarming an alarming discovery a dead body close to the Wyoming Highway 789 bridge a pod would have never went down there if it weren't for this game she admitted but the scary incident isn't deterring her Wiggins says she will continue to play the game I saw somebody playing by weighing the game on the way here I saw somebody playing on the highway oh my god it's bad enough we don't need to last night when I was waiting for my uber at my house I just three minutes I saw two different groups of kids like one on skateboards and one on bikes just playing the game and what's scary is like on that article now armed robbers are robbing people at certain places in the game because they know the kids are going to be there with like new phones like iPhones and stuff so they're waiting at certain places coming out stealing our phones and whoa the game allows players to drop a lower module in a real-world location to attract high numbers of Pokemon for 30 minutes the lure modules have reportedly also been used by business owners to bring people to their stores what'd ya say the derry-o so this is the next level yes this is this is what starts the next level this kind of thing oh the next level of what's an Internet augmented reality / yes as well is it and it's also scanning just like snapchat scanned all our faces using all these filters now and they have perfect they could 3d model all our faces now because we've been yeah scanning our faces now David they're scanning the whole entire United States they're going to have maps of everything inside and outside in like less than a year well didn't they didn't we think though that eventually that that was going to be inevitable and that was going to be unavoidable yeah there's the the technology is going to dissolve all the windows well this is the next is dissolving in the windows there's no more curtains that's also fascinating that it's an augmented reality like that's what got everybody in like that the augmented reality is what snuck everybody in and everybody's like I'm in let's play a game I'm part of the game they like what you're completely sucked into this very bizarre yeahmaybe world where you're playing a game wrapped around your own actual environment what are you sure this guy owns the gym of that guy's house so he's owns virtual owner of virtual oh it can be key honor stolen examiner son woohoo I meant the owner of my gym nice guy oh my god he's like uh yeah please don't tell anybody where Lily's get away from my apartment my house they're gonna get sued those Pokemon people are gonna get sued for sure there's gonna be a lot of lawsuits and about this game there's gonna be a lot of people dying nice like I said on the way here I saw somebody using it while driving cuz no what do you do do you think that dead body was somebody trying to get a water pokemon and just mist and know that dead time is probably somebody murdered or a homeless person yeah I mean it doesn't just say anybody could have been under there where's the water but there's somebody okay when you find something find like a water lures that what it was yeah not no it's a lures so what it's this thing that you can drop on the ground and so did someone drop it where the home where the dead person was no she was just searching for Pokemon like you go it's kind of it reminds me of like when you're a kid you know a bicycle bicycle and you're going around your neighborhood like playing adventure like looking at things and finding things it's kind of like that that makes you kind of go out in your neighborhood look stuff like I didn't know that there was like a Buddha across the street and like this forest by my house and I found out by this game because I was like go here you know there's some stuff here and whoa so it's kind of cool because I shows you around your neighborhood and stuff like that that you might have not known it's kind of like that old game geo-tagging game that people used to play where it's like go to these coordinates and you'll find like a present and you know dude if you are really cynical you'd be so you'd be it's like a it's like some sort of an alien talking to you going move around your coordinates photographs of everything so I created perfectly yeah it's really interesting to see what businesses businesses are doing like Dairy Queen like I said dropped something on the ground and it's like paying customers only can come here and get so this is hilarious love that's probably smart yeah that's smart first sound people yeah can you mad like me I grew up in South Philly we didn't look at anything and if we saw something we just kept walking that's it well I don't have to do that anymore Eleanor yeah she's you there's no more slaves and you have to ride a horse around oh yeah I'm gonna go taking pictures around my mom's neighborhood yeah all right so let me explain to me cuz let me understand how this works you're playing it so if you're playing it like what are you seeing right you see on the ground right now I see nothing I'm looking around I could see down the street there's some some cool places to get more coin or it's called pokeballs which you use to capture so these places exist how did just like it they just decide that the things are there it's random but what they usually do is they they take certain things in Google Maps like all the churches are gems where you go to work out and write stuff like that your pok√©mon's then they take like like things like the Comedy Store and they put certain like they know it's a landmark so they they there's a lot going on there like last night if you go to the Comedy Store now you haven't been there in a couple of days every single person is playing every single person working there's playing every comic there's everyone's just out there on their phones how this happen so quick it's it's it's it's huge man is it I just heard about this like maybe two days ago yeah me too two days ago I saw a couple teachers in schools Jim on YouTube this video of what look uh someone made a fake application it looked like this and it turned out to be a really good idea that someone to develop develop I don't know but oh yeah overnight it's doing because it really hits this nerve in your head of collecting things and when you're going like look what I've collected collected whoa and it's the perfect thing to do when you're bored like I was in the uber I'm just sitting there while we're driving by the Hollywood Bowl like oh there's some cool stuff here I'm good here so it's a good thing to do when you're you have nothing else to do what do you what do you mean get like you just found your phone it's like you're collecting virtual items it's like you're collecting virtual items okay whoa-ho c'mon chasing investors lead and Nintendo's go out there make just make it small send Nintendo shares soaring craze added 9 billion in market value yeah - gave me company while in Tendo was curtain what atena was hurting before this come on this is incredible ten oh yeah that's all okay so you're walking around explain this to me I'm looking at this person holding their hand up so they're walking around and they have like a phone open where the they see the image of what's in front of them yeah that Pokemon stuff is just sort of floating around yeah oh my god this is crazy and then you could grow eggs you can share or you can train your characters to be stronger and then you can battle other characters at gyms and and it's and this is by the way is just the first version they just yes you know they're going to be adding so much to this and what's interesting to note I heard a rumor maybe that the new Grand Theft Auto is going to be doing the same thing so you're going to be playing Grand Theft Auto using Google Maps so you're going to be at your house and your house is going to be your house and so this is just the beginning of this whole idea of taking Google's information you've got people outside yeah good oh yeah one one of the things is that they're already saying that people are like kids are complaining about sore legs and I could get them out there maybe this would be the video game that get expose people yeah people were to video games yeah I mean that's that's what's the only positive thing I see I'm a judge my god they're all just hanging around playing with each other oh my gosh yes is insane it's just like The Comedy Store last comic-con in San Diego is gonna be a zoo at this oh yeah I forgot about stuff like that this is fucking insane I can't believe I'm just feeling like I saw legs is that from being sore that sorry that's like come on I also heard that they banned it in San Francisco but I haven't looked to see if that's true or not like some cities are actually banning it because people are not paying attention just going into traffic and and I can say there was probably a lot of them on the 405 today yes I saw if you think about it this is probably just the next step in what we're eventually going to get which is some sort of a reality that we can manipulate all the time like this is one part of it we're gonna have little games in the regular reality but you're gonna have to look through your phone to see it but how long before that's glasses that you're wearing like that Microsoft shit we already coming up with that yeah what does it call again magic leap that's one I think that's the Google one microsoft hololens thinking of is are they both with goggles both augmented reality but they're both developed around augmented reality and suppose you magically is supposed to be awesome I don't want to say better but so no one likes regular reality I mean come on if you have a pair of glasses you just put on a pair of glass what's that you put on a pair like they live style I mean Jesus Christ they live is gonna be real you put our pair of glasses and and then you see and you see all kinds of crazy shit
