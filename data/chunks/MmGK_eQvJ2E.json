the girag unexperienced have you heard of a guy named Pierre Popov he's a pastor was televangelist guys what did he do blow somebody I saw him the other day I watched uh I was sleeping on the couch and I woke up in his he had one of the shows on paid shows commercials and I was amazed what woke me up because I was kind of like half listening to while sleeping what was amazed as how the the things that they say in it just seemed illegal like they were like you like oh you know we're gonna send you some miracle water this water is you know miracle water you're going to open up these envelopes and and then they start showing like testimonials like a people and they're like you know I sent in my I read the letters and then just out a week later I got a new house in a car and the next person was like I got $200,000 oh and then there's other ones like a guy just walked up and gave me a check for fifteen million dollars it was it was like the most fake of shit ever and so then I started really researching this guy and there's all these videos about him online like that like I guess he's been ripping people off for a long time and one of the best videos is one where he just goes up and he goes where's we're so-and-so so-and-so is here like let's say Tina Tina Fey where you were yet cut and it comes up guys I heard you have author itis and you're here because you want to get rid of this author itis and stuff like that the whole time his wife is just pump yeah there's no show yeah she had a thing on it was on one of those 20/20 or something like that yeah I know we talked about this in the past highway pretty sure maybe was on another podcast but I was amazed that he's still allowed to do this oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well that guy um just well name one that's not but it's almost like it's it's so ridiculous it's like the most ridiculous hustle ever it's like who are they tricking the only be with a trick in are like normals like mentally challenged oh yeah people with no hope when you're when you're just robots when you're down to being convinced that there's a miracle water out there that is going to come in the mail via the Postal Service and it's going to look it's going to change your fortune right yeah that's the one one of these things somewhere along the line they used to ask for donations but then somewhere along the line they they realized that they could sell things then they started like selling like holy water and like prayer services and and and and telling people that you would plant a seed so if you like spend $90 your last 90 dollars it would come back to you in 10 fold the Bible says they would come out with some crazy fucking was that uh that guy criolla who's my favorite because it's got a dollar in his name I mean you're a pastor and your fucking name is dollar what's your really all that weird names like that gives a good peter Popoff have you ever met any other Popoff's before this guy's got to have a different real name though he must have a real name what's his real name Wow his real name is creep Oh Augustus dollar jr. wow this is real fucking name get a Bachelor of Science in Education it's out there talking shit smacking people my favorite Robert Tilton you know he is he probably seen him the there's a viral video of him farting like he's like he talked to tongues a lot on a show too he go Chaka Chaka laka ma la una mala koola March in Molalla it's hilarious see if you could pull up Robert Tilton talking in tongues because it's some of the most ridiculous shit ever but one I'll never forget this one thing they said he said every time you write a check to me Satan gets a black eye Wow but but doesn't part of you think that if you're dumb enough to send him that money like so what so a guy got you with the dumbest trick of all time like you really thought that money was going to God you really thought that money's gonna give the devil a black eye if you really thought that you you're fucking stupid and looking after you right one of the things that this peter Popoff does he also sends you a barley cake from you know the Bible where it's like kind of like the little bread you eat and he goes he goes in this commercial he goes and we make it with the exact ingredients that they say in the Bible and blah blah blah well then if you look up Ezekiel 4:12 in the Bible it says and you should eat it as barley cakes and bake it using fuel of human waste so it no human way so so inlaid him in a way to run away no it doesn't you wanna bet we type in a sequel 4:12 ok gze that's Alaric hey I hold on hold on easy EK i.e le4 24 12 for 12 yeah you're thinking about the weed loss but he kill for 12 a long time since I read up on my good old ezekiel's this is all new to me bake it with dung that cometh out of man in their sight hold so he's saying hold on yes I can should our cook push it oh my god and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man in their sight well the team the Bible it's in the Bible mana you mean to study the Bible and cook him red with shit have you ever tried my poopoo barley can you fucking imagine how dumb people are that really hurts my brain you know Ezekiel Ezekiel might have been tripper because Ezekiel was also where the first depictions of UFOs came from hey let me pull that up yeah zekiel was known for there's um there's a Bible quote that people bring up all the times a UFO I bet people were seeing a lot of things after eating a bunch of shit mail yeah they're eatin fuckin shit cakes all day throwing up almost time it was a wheel within a wheel it was God's chariot there was guys with boats they had all the animals you think we should prepare the barley cake in a different way no no it's great I'm trying to funny what a stupid fucking culture yeah I cook it with shit okay dad should I write that down on paper I put something for thou up my son because I got so obsessed with this Minister that so when I found that out I had tweeted something like Olive Garden was like executive or 12 or something like that and all these people got pissed off that I was due out of doing bible scriptures oh that's hilarious well they read that though yeah they figured it out how do you not read that and just start laughing and you telling me to cook shit cakes the Bible says cook shit cakes there's just one more dumb thing in the Bible God and I'm so tired of people pretending that books awesome I'm so tired you stop that shit's stupid okay here here's here's a quote and I looked and behold a whirlwind and came out of the north a great cloud and a fire infolding itself in brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber out of the midst of the fire okay how's that EF Oh hmm that's somebody putting two points together I don't go together from oh wait a minute this still holdout was this also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man whoa after and everyone had four faces and everyone had four wings and their feet were straight and the sole of their feet was like the soul of a calf's foot and they sparkled like the color of burnished brass what a trippy book people like oh my god it's so real I hear God's words when you're saying these things God is speaking to me through your words please read on and they had the hands of man under their wings on their four sides and they had and they four had their faces in their waist somebody might have just made all this up and me like an asshole this reading is fake Bible clothes shitting all over the Bible and the aliens but guess what I don't care I'm not reading any further it's it seems like if this is if this really is as he kills it says it is god damn it I think it's all nuttiness they walked up with their four faces and they said why are you guys cooking things in shit and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning now as I behold the living creatures behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures with his four faces these guys were trippin hard eating shit cakes yeah
