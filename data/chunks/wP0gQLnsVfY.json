the girag an experience I do bad shows if I'm hungover I don't like my shows they don't feel good they don't have the flow to them you know and I just I hate that feeling I hate the feeling of being on stage and it's it wouldn't be my fault if I was hungover if I was hungover on stage like it's my fault that I'm working it like 3/4 speed right now or it's not clicking right now like that so well I wish I could just have one but it's not satisfying because you have one and then you want a hundred and then and then you drink a hundred and then you feel like shit and like if I just drink one like I've have one at lunch then it's like I I want to go take a nap it really you know a good hardcore four or a gentleman six and then I'm done but like I yeah you I feel pulled to it no is it like Gollum in the ring no I just I don't know what that means I just - yes I just don't fish no no no no like why it's us today it's precious yes I don't you know what that is I don't want you didn't would see the Lord of the Rings you didn't see that the Lord the ring I went to one of those and it was so fucking long and every time they would they would fade to black I'd be like just roll the credits roll the credits and then they would open up on some big field and it's just like Jesus get the fucking thing back to the guy so we can get out of here I hate I you know what I fucking hate all of those movies and I fucking pay people don't have a sense of humor about the bullshit that they watched when they were kids like adults who talk about star wars like it isn't a fucking rule with the movie now when you watch it I mean like how bizarre about it so I was making for the other night the other night I came home I guess I got free free cinemax which is the greatest fucking channel ever they either would 24 hours a day they're either showing the greatest movie ever or the worst fucking movie ever and it's all compelling as I watch like nine movies in heroics fucking channels unbelievable so I ended up flipping up uh because later night they just had some sort of you know soft for porn which is ridiculous now when you have the Internet so just was redone sorry I got off of that so I went on to vh1 uh and and they were playing this to show metal mania and I was watching all these bands in these videos that I just thought was fuckin sick and they're into the devil dude I was just by the end of it I was like how was this better than disco like why did disco get so much shit like I'm not talking about like the Iron Maiden's the Metallica's but you know what I'm talking about that middle of the fucking ground those people with the spiked fucking gloves and all this stupid shit Romney knew just it was horseshit it was fucking I watched it it was the dumbest shit of it was embarrassing that I I mean I moved granted I had all of that music still on my ipod I'm not I'm not above it but if someone were from this generation were to come back and tell me that music was awful and was stupid I would laugh there's like there's no way I could defend it isn't it weird I mean you look at like if you look at music or you look at movies that's like one of the clearest examples of like some sort of evolution or progress is going on with humans because like the the movies of the past like so many of them are there so clunky and the style of communicating is so artificial it looks it's it's such a shit you know representation of life and come on here's six a real good move until the sixty once they figured out you know like just acting on film like those people just learning how to do it so everything was was gonna be not you know let me tell you I'm very yeah that type of acting had to go away with the Brando's in the James Dean's and those guys and then you had to have like the there's a couple more like this movies back there like Jack Lemmon the apartment well the Hustle is way ahead of his time that the hustler is my name is Stanley Kubrick yeah that type of shit there was some deal that we don't hold up though but though the bad movies from the 60s in the 70s you know watch like try to wash like jaws 3d oh yeah no idea that that's a bad one this is this a bit but they've always had they still have movies on shore I mean oh yeah I think a lot of sure to this day that transformer shit even though I didn't see it but if you said I never I never vibe with sci-fi people like sci-fi listeners I always get trashed by them because I just don't I just don't get unless you don't get sci-fi at all know if it's like aliens like it has to be high-quality like aliens is like the good fellows of that side like on like top-shelf sci-fi I'm gonna be the Blade Runner aliens and that type of shit but if I'm just gonna go what you know oh we're in Hoth I mean what the fuck that's from what is Hoth is that that's a Star Wars thing and I don't know what yeah like one of those fucking things look the action figures of shit it's just did you like trains about it I didn't like I didn't like Chewbacca you know I didn't get Chewbacca it's like dude you're a Pacific fucking awesome gotta have around huge imagine you could party with Bigfoot I would totally party should be ripping somebody's arms off he's shooting a gun like he's a fucking psyches he's a badass living is how to shoot guns too he'll rip in fucking arms up but he can also shoot you from a distance bitch she's limited oh I liked you lot are worthy I would totally hang out you know what again no I didn't like about him he was a follower well started he started hanging out with all the humans next thing he knows he's sitting upright in chairs right right sipping little juicy juices right yeah I wonder if he can understand us could they understand him they could speak that kadai so yeah I think it was a language that we just didn't understand it so that's a really good thing every time not that many wookies you know it's like Chewbacca and like there's no other famous woman he was like the dodo bird that was no weird we're gonna be destroyed on Twitter because we are Star Wars knowledge sucks and never do there's a fucking million wookies there is a nation of wookies there is a federation of wookies you know not what you're talking about there's nothing better than just just having a gig fucking 10% knowledge of this criticizing because it's just driving some kid nuts you
