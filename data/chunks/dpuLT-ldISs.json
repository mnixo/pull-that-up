boom and we're live ladies and gentlemen what special guests well Jimmy thank you didn't think you was gonna be this is a total surprise this is awesome yeah I'm shooting something tomorrow and I wanted to watch the fights I'm like eat this pie I didn't think you'd be in town you're always off like every time I call he's like I he's away he's hunting he's unreachable and I was just happy that you got back to me yeah dude it's perfect timing uh you know we had decided a while ago well I was supposed to be out of town too and then I decided to come back and make it back in time for this I'm like wow we should definitely go fight companion so we decided to but uh Eddie was available should be what be watching the UFC yeah we are gonna watch two different things at the same time folks this should be fuckin complete the deal is that the Canelo Alvarez fight is supposed to start at eight o'clock that's what they've been pushing and I think they're doing that because they're trying to get a lot of people in the East Coast to buy it cuz after 11:00 p.m. you're like Jesus Christ I want to go to sleep you know because they were doing them a lot of times like 9:00 p.m. 9:30 it's fuckin midnight in New York yeah it's crazy you're tired you know Saturday people can do it but it's like it's it's tough to money goes on eleven twelve o'clock at night it's not wise especially with boxing cuz boxing has weak under cards not just necessarily saying that this is a weak fight but even if they have a good undercard what do they have like two fights right I mean how many fights they have you don't want to see more than that no I'm like a pay-per-view the worst part is when you when you watch one of these fights on the East Coast by the time you get out the arena get your car it's you have time for one drink maybe and then they shut down bars yeah good thing is because they shut down bars at 4:00 yeah New York Chicago you can go back to your hotel room take a shower take a little power nap and then you're ready to go to the after-party yeah it's over Lake tennis way better yeah that's way better I never watch boxing anymore either I watch Connor and Floyd just to watch it but I never watch but I think I watched last triple G fight that's it i watch all of his fights and I watched all Canelo's fights and you know it's weird when you watching a guy starts slow down like I watched Miguel Cotto's fight and he won please kidding he hit more than he used to get hit it's like 36 now you know I don't think they have UFC style testing though they don't have like you sada they don't have a Jeff Novitzky so these guys can get away with a lot more it's a little slippery with like I don't think they do steroids in boxing at a legal dude you know what you got to see be Kharis I don't know how I said it is it ikura sir I would say yeah I see oh you are yeah but I would say that it's one of those words that have only read so the documentary it's fucking amazing and it's all on this Russian doctor that was like one of the top guys over there for steroids and how how much shit they can give you and you still test negative holy fuck these guys are wizards this guy is they take this guy who's the the main person in the documentary and they they just pop them full of steroids he's like I want you to have a full CC of this and five with a mean shooting like six seven things in it they're filming an experiment yes oh experiment with this Russian guy who's responded the Russian athletes there was some estimate in the high 90s of percentage of people that are on steroids who wasn't on steroids well you'd still like to this day in Rio they were actually the Olympics we're thinking about banning the entire Russian team they like their anti-doping program is so sophisticated and so state sanctioned what can they pass you sada testing though could they pass that oh no I mean it depends they see the you saw the thing they'll show up at your fucking house you know like you have to give your whereabouts at all times yeah that will catch you and the other thing is they keep your piss and to keep your blood and they keep it for a long time I think like seven or eight years and they actually just busted a guy who won the Olympics I think in to say 2008 and 2012 or something like that but I think it was two guys I don't know maybe Jamie could find it but they they took away their gold medals these Russian wrestlers they busted them eight years later late way later they didn't have a test for whatever they were doing so that's what happens is like these guys are one step ahead but in the test catch up you know and then they find stuff in them they retro actively go and grab your shit it's like when they save somebody's head like Ted Williams hoping they can find a cure for whatever he died from and bring him back then what they freeze your body or freeze your hair right that's so crazy the freezing the head thing is so bananas you're like well listen for five dollars more we can keep your body now dude you know it's I'm taking a chance as it is let's just go with a head just a head yeah just the idea that they're gonna just keep your head frozen and then you need to get like they don't wake you up amongst the first people you get woke up after they figure out how to reattach heads to bodies right you get woken up way later like what but they figure I just had a reanimate dead bodies that won't be that big of a deal we then detach heads on a new body like that's a couple more decades let you talk to Ray Kurzweil's he thinks we're gonna have that boy in 15 years yes very wishful timeline is it possible to be such a famous fighter you have you're rubbing shoulders with the powerful the elite you're so famous is it possible for the for if I don't have so much fame that he has connections to the Illuminati nor the people that tells their steroids that he never gets totally Winky Winky certain fuck is that possible it's totally possible but it's just super unlikely because there's too many pieces involved too many people would know and it's also there's no benefit to them they would have to be getting paid shit tons of money it's just so sneaky like they in order if you have because you what if someone dies you know like what if someone gets a shit beat out of morons up dying and turns out these people got a hold of some money and that's what allowed them to not do drug tests on this guy this guy was on Jews and then he goes in and beat someone to death it's kind of hard to keep anything electronically a secret I mean the head of the CIA couldn't make a fucking email disappear this the Russian but no one got buzzed to return to different matter if it can get out no one goes to jail no no he had to step down because you have you say electronically you can't nothing's a secret anymore like we're not boys his name the other head of the CIA who was cheating and he got busted that stupid email yeah what yeah Petraeus dad address yeah and he was you know a war hero yeah he ran the the hole where they call it the the theater he do you know the story behind him though how he got caught I think Vesta gating someone else right no he was hooking up with a chick and the chick was a little mouthy didn't she write his book his biographer I think there was her and I think there was another one and the other one what might have been a part of some freaky marriage situation where the husband and wife bang other people or something because it got it got heavy enough where it was weird yeah and the one of the ways they got Petraeus out of there was like through some sort of adultery clause which is hilarious yes a morals clause right it is one of the best killers in the military and you're telling if you bang on the chicks will you kill people information it's coming from the mainstream you know what that is what they why they made him do that like what what pieces might have fallen into play Frank Underwood style that allow that to happen well who'd he piss off Eliot Spitzer pissed somebody off ten years ago and they went and digging and they got him well Spitzer went after the banks spits it's really a shame about Spitzer because in any other era Eliot Spitzer would have been probably like a big-time hero like some sort of a like clean him up cop type a guy who's like looking out for the good guy the problem is there was some serious hypocrisy because it turns out that he was actually targeting brothels as well as visiting them which is just yeah man you can't do that like it's just that's even that's it's one thing if he just got hookers sure but the fact that the guy was arresting all those going out of his way for yeah he was a real douche it's like that's why I love to see these guys who legislate against gay people get busted restrooms and stuff because you're actively trying to fuck somebody's life oh for sure it's always those people it's always those people that care so much they get angry at gay people you know it's just such a classic separating they're hiding they've been having their whole life that they're they overdo it just so that no one yeah sniffs I'm out it's such a classic clich√© that you see it you're like oh God so uh so obvious did a great documentary on politicians who are outed like who were anti-gay but got outed as being gay you know what it's like it's like that really scrawny type of male that's always like sticking out for women and saying like of course you are like it's such a cliche it's it's almost the same cliche right as the gay guy that's it hates gay marriage and hates gay people because he's trying to cover it up it's usually these guys that are like overwhelmed with lust the women seem so impossible to to get with that they they morph themselves into this like semi real human being that only looks out for women's issues all the time 24/7 doesn't see anything wrong with women ever you know that guy where it's like you're not even real anymore yeah get you to put out you could then your thing you're fucking allowed to walk among them and be comfortable and they trust you and they call you an ally yeah you're an ally yeah and they fuck the allies so ever want to be an of course just watch the UFC but man they keep punching each other oh it is interesting how it becomes way less interesting right yeah I haven't watched watch anymore well I watch Mayweather versus Connor thought that was interesting I was in Iceland for that it was like five o'clock in the morning in a bar and it was fun to watch because of you know again I wanted to see if Connor would do okay but Mayweather against anybody also have no interesting yes that was lots of fun dude I like watching that guy fight period I'm always I watched Mayweather even if it's a boring ass fight because what you're watching is some guy that just can do things that other people who are not able to do he's yeah he's great one step ahead I just don't enjoy him like I watched the Pacquiao fight and a boy yeah you can't really get one round from the next they look exactly the same what channel on 219 219 thank you sir so what we're gonna do folks is just go back and forth from the fight so you got so you're totally hardcore MMA fan would you consider yourself I love the podcast yeah I mean I don't matter no Matthew the UFC podcast Matt's like the expert and I'm like the guy who can do the more every UFC you're gonna try to watch unless you got something going on i watch most of them I usually watch them the next day on the on the fight path so I'm usually doing gig Saturday night Matt is great I love that he's such a great guy he that took Eddie and I into his gym when in like 2001 or some shit remember that he took us to his gym he picked us up at the train station we took the train in the Long Island he took us picked us up in the train station took it to his gym showed us his apartment in the basement we're used to pina jug cuz he drank so much water fighting sure so he would just carry a jug and put it right by the bed and just piss in the jug in the middle of the night it was hilarious Matt Serra is awesome yeah he's such a real guy like he's exactly that guy all that yeah he's great he's great what a great move it is to have him on that Dana White looking for a fight you know and to have him on your podcast well he was a podcast first and I think that they asked him a couple of people and when he said when Dana brought my name he's like yeah I would love to it because we got a long way so it's a fun dynamic I mean it is fun he says it and you guys got gelled with each other you know you gel yeah silly yeah but you can see it's like you guys are friends it's fun that's like a big thing man you know I think people underestimate that it's one of the reasons why these TV shows sometimes are so stale and flat they're stiff yeah well they don't like each other they're not friends with each other you know like you people like when they see people who actually like Goldberg and I like when we used to do broadcast together kober's my friend yeah like I really liked that guy and John annek same thing annex my friend Dominick Cruz my friend like I hang out with that guy he's interesting Paul Feld they're like I could hang out with these guys that's big man yeah you know that's why people like these kind of podcasts that's why people like you know anything where people get together and they can hang out and you feel like a real camaraderie versus like Entertainment Tonight store is back and boy is he angry yes he is Mike newest most amazing version of Thor let's take a look like those people don't they're even if they are friends you can't tell yeah it's it's unwatchable and it's unlistenable and it doesn't feel any physical effing you can connect to anybody I speak to like that exactly no one's gonna tell each other to shut up on that show I wonder if with Wonder Woman now at the forefront of ports and Technology and shut the fuck up yeah it's annoying they have like these priests scheduled scheduled promos that they do that feels so stale and everything's just stale that's why even on TV I go back and watch old Dick Cavett shit like interview Richard Pryor in 1985 I'd rather hear a real conversation with dead moments than like a late-night TV show now where everybody thinks they're on fire every time the cameras are on this is Terrance most of them these like entertainment shows it shows on entertainment like wolf that's hard to get right well you used to be that the the network's had all the power and there was a never a Content problem it wasn't like damn we need content that was slot so Thursday 8:30 Thursday 9 o'clock those slot there's just those slots that's it we got plenty of motherfuckers trying to make pilots you know that's never a problem with content now it's the opposite now they need content so more people can get their shit out now it used to be totally controlled the TV is always sucked you can't watch ad we watch TV shows that we grew up on because we had no choice you would I would watch TV gone ok what's the rule the best of this these terrible shows I'll just watch that fucking we just don't have to think some of them were good back then too right now watch the fall guy now watch appalled I now didn't have to be good at all the control no shit it has to be good and now unique content the Six Million dozen different world the Sasquatch episode we fought the Bigfoot douchiest thing ever on television right Sergio more eyes this is a great fucking fight komaru saman is a stud wrestler fucking serious athlete and mirai's is going to be the best jujitsu guys in MMA today yeah for sure tapped out Kron Gracie in his first black belt match he's legit anybody that he's the guy that set up that mounted triangle right nice and slow yeah you know what he said once about one of his opponents he said it would be more likely that he got me pregnant than submit me he was talking about the improvements in his striking he's like in striking I think I have the advantage and on the ground it would be more likely that he got me pregnant and he submit me that's how badass that motherfucker is but Kamara Oman is a stud and he is super legit fantastic wrestler with really good striking very strong guy very dangerous could be future superstar world champion guy seems like the guy you have to take out I guess Leon Edwards just like Edwards actually doing really well against him seemed like in the first round yeah and then like you know once he had him on the ground he was finished so he wants us he's a savage mashes ground pound vicious from wrestler he could do everything man he could submit guys he's gonna do today's you know he's a wrestler but he absolutely can do all that stuff his position American Top Team guy so he's like a black belt jiu-jitsu no I wonder what he is in jiu-jitsu I wonder like if he's ranked but you know like there's a lot of guys that aren't ranked like michael Chiesa michael Chiesa and my mind is like a black belt but he's not even ranked should that invite him stop you think nope definitely not never you don't stop chokes why would you stop a choke you let a guy go to sleep through the projection every guy's unconscious you clearly not unconscious guys get out of shit you got to give him an opportunity to get out of shit his arms were like this man yeah boy you're right you're right you know my sake stop because he knows let's move yamazaki stopped it early yes he sure to let him go out yes yes but a hundred percent Yamasaki everybody any black belt knows when a guy's about to go out his before he goes out his hands go like this and that's what happens a lot of times if you let go the choke you pop right back up and say you're all right totally correct but the buddy should let him go to let him go to sleep and here's the other thing this is absolutely also possible to some guys and they're getting choked they will concentrate just on their neck and they were tighten up their neck and they won't do this and fight around with it they will literally put all their energy and concentration on their neck and avoiding the choke by just squeezing and holding on their neck they think they have a little bit of blood flow if they could force a little bit of blood flow and they think that they can stay conscious longer than the guy can squeeze I don't buy it for the long haul on the long haul a guy like you know someone someone's a really good fighter like Demian Maia guy he's gonna fucking put you to sleep you can't you can't do that on him right the question is can I do it on Kevin literally but even good even when you're tightening it yeah but he's not blip if he's doing this okay this is his arms are here right so if he's concentrating on his neck his arms are here if he really does decide to stop doing this and just try to just concentrate on his neck it's not a good strategy but it might be something you wouldn't use if you thought you were fucked right if you thought you're fucked you're in a really bad spot and you really can't peel his arms off and go you know what I might be able to just power through and he might not he might had a tap or he might have went to sleep or he might have gotten out we don't fucking know right cuz guys have gotten out of some crazy shit in fact earlier that night a woman who got it right yeah she was she was gone who I fuck I forget that fight what was that fight find out what the card was on the Kevin Lee michael Chiesa fight but the point is it's not dangerous it's not like an armbar or taking punishment on the ground like when someone takes a couple extra shots on the ground that aren't necessary that that's bad but if someone gets choked out that's not bad it's not bad you got to let him get choked out you're not preventing any damage Glenn who did just that fight that should have been stopped on the I want to say with one of the prelims tell Gavin Tucker yeah Gavin talk like in Strickland that was bad yeah I thought Dana tweeting I hadn't seen the fight yet he's like this referee shot and then when I watch the fight like this must have been the fight he was talking well you know what the thing is is that it was a slow beating Rick was giving him a slow beating he just kept beating him out it was there was no giant big bombs but it was a cumulation of bombs and never ended it just he was so workman like in professionals a very very impressive victory is that why he didn't get I thought he should have got like a fight of the night or performance of the night I mean I thought that that was a pretty amazing and he didn't get anything for that which were the girls that uh almost choked the shit out of each other was a Felice Herrig and justine cush yes it was was that all you think ish and Felice Herrig if I was she should know who won that I believe Felice did right when did that happen yeah Phillies won we know that no that was a couple months ago that was a fight back yes a fight that Kish had that was allegedly well whatever happened yeah I don't know if she did or not it's supposedly that can be grounds to stop a fight now it's like in the rules like if you shit yourself it's too dangerous because there's all like scratches and shit yeah if you have cuts so you can get like the worst staph infection known to man and plus you may make a move to avoid being put in that that's gonna put you in other kind of danger or just your face moist and that you may do something right your neck and Jennifer's a very good point if someone's going 69 on you if you're in like north side which is legit position and this dude just shit himself that's super rude yeah yeah it's a bad place to be but a man it's life and death in there tomorrow Oman he would go that this is a good fucking fight this is like what's gonna happen here fight Dan merg leotta Dan slimming down yeah he's only 500 pounds now has gigantic Paul is a huge he's like at least six five and he's not like a tall thin guy either as a giant for real though he's probably 300 pounds easy very interesting 170 row 450 one of the first round 50 49 48 47 if you want to sync it up with us 42 41 where Rhys is missing a tricep on his left arm you know Sarah's got one missing I don't he's got bicep misery yeah what happened to the tricep he's our arm tour and he never got surgery on or if he got surgery it never came back but look he could see doesn't really have a tricep on his left arm doesn't so he got hurt he got hurt to the Bob oh shit he's in a lot of trouble he's he's in a lot of trouble get on top of yeah I'm look at that he's hurt and he's on his back and he won't get on top of it yeah but that's smart like make him stand out 14 to let off on him but he's on his back yeah was on his back he might have a chance to do something standing up he's getting tooled I'm agreeing with you Joe I'm just it's smart more than just me yeah it's smart I mean wouldn't you tell now if you kymaro's coach fuck yeah really don't go around this guy lit up kick kick his calf because Arthur's isn't that chance he's he's gonna wrap his arms around you and catch his breath Oh hundred percent not okay I might sweep you you might you might think he's more tired than he is you might recover quicker than you think next thing you know he's got deep half on you next thing you know he's swinging he might have a better shot on his back than he does standing hey how long before someone starts doing side kicks and front kicks to the calves and to the to the shins how long before like a shin kick comes back like in school remember when that hurt like a motherfucker kids would kick kids in the shins yeah but I think after that that silver I've been fighting so I toes yeah but now if you curl your foot back and like a front kick oh it's a legal kick right yeah I think it's legal if you could side kick the thigh if you could wheel kick the head how is anything too like illegal it's hilarious right yeah we the well in almost mean how many people that get hit on the back of the head that's one thing I was noticing about boxing tonight guys will complain while they're in the middle of it exchange if a punch hits the back of the head they touch the back of their head like hey you're cheating you're hitting me back here don't fucking hit me back here it's almost like an excuse for getting hit at all you fucking never see that in the UFC and stand-up you never see guys complaining about getting hit in the back of the head you hear about it on the ground you know like you hear about like sometimes one of the guys trying to finish someone they'll hit them all over the place and sometimes they'll hit the head whether it's on purpose or not they only know but standing up you never hear about it what did you think that referee is pretty taller oh wow he's out oh wow that was sensational I told you tomorrow Iseman his legette that that dude is seriously talented standing up was a smart move yeah he could be the one that guy could be a legit world champion I believe he's undefeated too he has won loss loses lost too it was like it was the second fight or something he's on a long long winning streak who's his lost to jamming kymaro's Mon I'm a problem Oh for some reason I thought it was like Nigerian he's like yes serious wrestler serious athlete thick his speed and the thing is man he didn't even start out as a striker Jose here s in college he got submitted way back in CFA 11 and his second pro fight boom dude look at the speed on that shit what about this shot whoa take that - is that is that Dan just giving this guy an extra second to stop his roll back I just wanted to see if the guy was conscious cuz if he rolled and then he was looking at him and his hands up he let it go sausage so you don't think she haven't stopped before you know what one extra punch it's a violent sport it could have stopped it but he could have recovered yeah like that was the perfect stoppage she got to let it play out a little bit and it's hard to do Dan's one of the best in the business though he's so good he's onto like you very rarely have complaints about Dan merg leotta fighters hate all fighters hate being stopped early you know they all do they know Gavin Tucker actually said that he thanked that referee for not stopping a chance but that's just the guy was too tough for his own good there's his first loss though I mean he's a really tough dude and like he there was no way he was gonna quit but is like orbital socket all fucked up I mean he's gonna have a lot of things wrong with him he got beat up yeah real bad it was a bad beating like he took a beating for I mean the first round it took a while before you know it got sort of lopsided but then from the second round on it was pretty obvious that Rick Glen wasn't getting tired and he's just pushing this crazy steady pace and just Gavin could not keep up with him and Rick was long and he couldn't get close to them and Rick just had this very workman Lee approach just kept on them and the dude just started breaking just a guy who knows like a guy who's been around for a long time he likes the way Frankie Edgar beat up on yaaaaaay Rodriguez been around for a long time who knows how to beat the hot young guy coming up well Frankie Edgar's on a totally different level because Frankie can keep this ferocious pace that so few people can keep up with like yeah err thought he could might keep up with it I thought like maybe when I get in there we go scramble at the sky I'll be able to keep up with them my ground games pretty good probably worked on getting back up to his feet probably thought I'll Surprise them I'll surprise him when we're kicking standing up he's not gonna be able to deal with my shit they just realized there's levels to this thing Frankie Edgar is on that world championship level is that what he's thinking probably is like there's no way Frankie's and get close enough to me I'm gonna be able to keep him away from me well or catch him coming in or Frankie might try to exchange with him on the feet and he has a chance to land something or maybe it's takedown defense it's better than you know Frankie thinks it is there's a lot of thoughts that go into your head when you try to pull something like that off but it was if you were as manager there's not it's not the fight to make it's just not the fight it's the one of the worst fights to make it's good to find out how you do against an elite wrestler but not the elite wrestler the guy who is a lightweight world champion now he's coming down to 145 the only guys below beat him is Aldo it was a decision I think right yeah I mean Frankie's goddamn world class Aldo might have his number I don't know but that doesn't mean if Frankie can't beat a lot of guys he fucked up Cub Swanson like easily is world championship level but sometimes like guys just for whatever reason can't beat another guy like Joe Frazier was always a world championship level boxer could not beat George Foreman if they fought a hundred times George Foreman would've beat him a hundred times yeah and that's got to get into your head after I mean Jones call me only twice and plus all the stuff that that but there is always that one guy that you just can't do anything against there's there's guys that have a solution to your style you know do you remember Sugar Shane Mosley sure Vernon Forrest Vernon Forrest just had this solution to Sugar Shane Mosley I believe he beat him twice you know and it was like one of those things were Vernon didn't look the best rest in peace he got shot actually it's a terrible story man that was around his car they tried to stop someone from robbing his car and they shot him the gas station in Atlanta is that the gaim thing yeah yeah chase the guy still you chased I can pop them up yeah and apparently he was a super nice guy yeah it's just a really really sad story but he like he could shine against in a way that he couldn't shine against other people yeah but then like Ricardo my organ knocked him out remember no I don't know if I believe Martin now my organ knocked him out definitely beat him I believe actually might shane mosley one of my first UFC events he was there I'm I want to say it's 2008-2009 I'm in a rampage fight 2009 mm-hmm it's weird to watch boxers and those things and how they react it is weird right watching Bernard hi step on a behind bug Bernard Hopkins and Healy had critical things to say but a bunch of guys rolling around it looked gay and then watching him and his trainers watch the guys on the ground that they weren't the but they're watching the stand-up they were fine but what they really got impressed with was the stuff on the ground whoo that's the stuff he can't do right so it's interesting to watch him kind of watch his opinion change as he was there right yeah I mean they have to talk yeah the problem is there's like these these camps like look at that boom look at that right hand good lord that was clean like you see him shaking his he's totally out of it there look at timing on this oh that's so good but you know people just get lumped off in two camps like it what sports better that's it's so silly yeah it's so silly because boxing at its highest level like tonight well we're gonna watch and just hopefully like five or ten minutes they're walking out oh shit that is very compelling do you know that's one of the main differences right there what you just saw it was going to do that's one of the main differences between UFC and every sport is the way the fighters treat the fans and interact the fans yeah you just don't see that in any other sport no it's true they and there's a lot of events where people get to meet fighters they do a lot of events a lot of signings and shit you can go meet them and hang out and you get invested in them and you get connected to them so then when they're on the prelims of the undercut you still want to watch them fight yeah there's a lot a lot of good things the UFC figured out that boxing had fucked up and now boxing is kind of tick picked up the slack in a lot of ways Rob font powerful Rob font he's marked ElBaradei's student very talented guy and they also figured out giving you the fights that you want to see yep let's just give you the fights don't make it wait five years like we did with Tyson Holyfield just put the fight together make it happen you don't have ten different promoters working on it yeah it's hard to do that with boxing you know sure I mean this Canelo Gennady golovkin fight this is a unification middleweight title fight let's go to right now it's uh it's very fucking hard to get these things to pull off it's all the behind-the-scenes people yeah dogs all right you think the bathrooms safe now yeah yeah I gave it the mandatory hour yeah it's a good hour all right let me try to find this Jamie what where am I supposed to point this fucking thing in there of that side okay now it's working big fight for branch huge dude that they give him Luke Rockhold that's kind of crazy is this his first fight in the UFC no no he used to be in the UFC a while back and then I guess I'm gonna have to keep doing this so 219 yeah it's not working okay this is the most boring part of the podcast ever what did you just ask me he fought gerald Harris way back in the day got slammed and Kayode this is like his first fight in UFC he was in Gerald Harris's guard and he slammed him and knocked him out cold so it was a good fight up into that moment but he was in his guards trying to work his guard and he got just body slam mmm and got knocked out from it yeah picked up in the guard like aronia a bitch Gerald Harris a stud he he didn't get picked up that high it wasn't like that that's the crazy shit of all Tommy that wasn't the guard that was a triangle yeah so yeah think of that crazy actually good hire oh that's terrifying that's the most terrifying slam of all time fuck yeah we watched that the other day you did yeah we watched the head the head collide as he slams into the ground and you see rampage his head smash into Rona's head didn't ya nobody could settle with rampage slam people alright folks so Gennady golovkin just walked out there all those belts motherfuckers a lot of belts wasn't he on like a 23 or 24 first round knockout streak to be soft and precision yeah something preposterous not the champion out there Bowl champions no heavier well cannot golovkin 'he's been fighting at a heavier weight class and Canelo fought Floyd Mayweather I think at 152 and I think earlier in his career he fought lighter than that I believe would never lay earlier to theirs yes he was a young guy with Yap when he went pro like really young what what's that he had 23 straight Kos in the first round good out of golovkin did is that were you're saying yeah 23 straight chaos but Danny went I don't think they were on they weren't hurt no okay their first I'm just understanding to his legend for no reason making sure most of them he would break guys down over it's about how they whether fight all the hype and the promo how it blew him up he's that like from that fight he's like a national hero Canelo was already a national hero not quite as big as he is now yeah I guess that may weather if I made it big but it wouldn't just beat the shit out of Julio Cesar Chavez Jr ah that's terrible it was terrible fight that was sad to watch yeah my mom didn't know who Canelo was before that Mayweather fight now she worships him I don't love the dad either to be honest as Mexican as it gets isn't it sad to watch a guy like Julio Cesar Chavez Jr fight a guy like canal like you tell one of them is did oh dude supposed to be good in the family it's not that good knockout just not gonna up he went into a defensive shell you just stopped firing back at all he was just getting tooled on you know he reminded me of the kid in the Bad News Bears remember the kid when he has you holding the ball and he's still pissed off at his father and his father slapped him in the face and he won't throw the ball home that's what he reminded me of during that fight just like fuckin just kind of stand there letting it happen it was hard to watch man I was like this kid doesn't need to be doing this like he doesn't really want to do it didn't it seem like he didn't want to fight yeah he definitely didn't want to fight they had like a panic attack no I just think you realized that there was just a level of come meant the Canela possesses that he just doesn't and he knew it in the there's like tells in their interviews like max Kelman does a very nice interview when he sits down with two fighters and he sits in between of them and they ask some questions and it'll ask him questions and they have this like translate thing back and forth but you could see like psychologically Canelo had a big advantage over them you know Canelo was just saying look you know his fight career has been a disgrace I fought the best of the best and he is you know his father was amazing and it was an incredible world champion but he's just never lived up to the hype and you could see like you know he was like well I will no yeah it's not a good comeback I'm gonna know that's a very poor comeback was he good though was he like before Canelo he's always been good he's always been a fighter no he's lost to some fighters like maybe one or two I can't remember how many people you talk about chances are he's one of the best he's just he just can't he can't get that belt he was better I think a few years ago but he was always been he's always been a very good fighter like he's not a bad fighter like Julio Cesar Chavez jr. knows how to fight for sure he's just not at this guy's lovely but do you think it's because like their fathers are both well I'm thing about Marvis Frazier two or guys whose fathers when you grow up with boxing money it's a little harder to be motivated than like that for sure you don't have that kind of confidence you know that kind of mean streak it's not a coincidence that so many of these guys grow up in impoverished situations but here's the thing Jon Jones I don't think grew up in I mean his family's still together I think he had a comfortable financial childhood I might be wrong about that but I mean his family's all together so it's it's it doesn't like some guys are just better at it yeah I think there's much more the other way then there are guys who grew up comfortably there's some like Bill and Baer they still in bed they said grew up pretty comfortable and wealthy and we're still like the biggest animal on they can totally happen you could have a kid that has all the money in the world but they just have some psychotic drive or they just want to be the best at something they want to prove they're not pussies it could be that or it could just be there's people that just really love testing themselves they just really love competing and they get so you get a few steps ahead right you do it for a little bit and then you really start getting into it then you get into it more and then it becomes you comes your favorite thing to do becomes your identity like even if you grew up with money you could still become obsessed with something sure and if you could become obsessed by being the best at anything it's possible it's just not as likely it's way more likely when it's a poor kid they grow up you know with a sense of urgency you grow up with like this knowledge in your head that hey man it might not always be okay like there could be a real bad time and a lot of times your motive for going after it is different too because you you really do remember what it's like to have absolutely nothing so your motive is to avoid that again yeah that's a very powerful thing it is a very powerful thing and you can't fake that by the way boxing has too much shit in the ring there's just too much business happening in the fucking ring stop it look at all these people and it's a very unnecessary thirty people yeah it's kind of like that music - because it the thought is that you have to grow up in in the same kind of situation you know impoverished or like just a serious broken family lack of love but then you have Chris Martin singer from Coldplay he breaks the mold like valedictorian you know brought up with money and just a happy lot you know he just it's just like the music yeah exactly Bayless that's hurt by the way the referee I think who was shitting on Connor and Floyd fighting who'd want to see that it's two different sports Kenny Bayless - yeah I'm pretty sure that's the ref that they that they did not want oh that's funny well you know a lot of boxing people won't like I was saying before they want to defend boxing they want you know they want to be on Team boxing and honestly I played a part of that a little bit when I had this thing with Luda Bella's right he's very good now by the way well I felt like it was pretty easy yeah it wasn't making very good argument the other problem is I mean you know if I really went to war with somebody I said yeah I got that guy it was a terrible argument and I'm a fan like that's the dumper I'm a fan of boxing like and I probably know a lot I bet if he and I sat down and we just started talking about classic fights Hagler Hearns you know Sugar Ray Leonard Roberta Durant like he would realize like really quick I'm a legit boxing fan I fuck love boxing coming around that Hagler Hearns go is that three yes yes draw a third Hagler Oh No yeah I don't know he had that fight with Mayweather though where Mayweather just Mayweather did a genius thing first of all I made him cut a lot of weight let him get down to 152 drained him up a little bit and then you know he caught him before he reached the level that he's at now like when he fought Aamir Khan America he fucked Aamir Khan up dude with a haymaker of a right hand and you know when he when he landed that bomb and put Aamir Khan to sleep you got to go okay this is a guy that's now at the fucking peak of his game so when he fought Mayweather Mayweather caught him all right when he was getting into it you know right when he was coming up and that Mayweather fight I think took him over the top when you fight a guy that's a slick and it's talented it fucking fast and the timing that Mayweather has and realize like there's levels to this thing is golovkin fighting it the way he normally fights out oh yes yes is his way man he's the king this guy's a beast I know guys behind look exactly like him - the good thing about this fight is what's interesting is gonna love Caen some experts believe that he might be slipping slightly and Canelo is coming up and the idea is that a year ago golovkin what a fucking hello up this is what a lot of people believe but now Canelo's better and golovkin might have faded a little bit what's the age difference I think golovkin is he's older for sure but I think he's 35 see if you can find that young Jamie I want to say he's 35 or 36 oh yeah well again is what 34 I think he's on Thursday 35 okay so yeah so that's like you know let is if unless he's Juicin that's the last of the squeeze eight years yeah when you're around no but I mean when you're around 35 like that's when the decline happens to almost everybody right 36 it slips 37 slips more 39 40 very rarely see a 40-year old champion it's not on the sauce yeah I mean not only now it's why Randy Couture was such an amazing you know it's really what Bernard Hopkins was the Mach Jesus yeah he wanted to his 50s yeah and he still was out boxing world-class fighters and dropping them you know I mean he got fucked up by Joe Smith but Joe Smith is a mom's final flower we get knocked to the rain yeah how dairy how old is he no 52 or 53 and he was 50 when he last fun if he was 51 or 52 and his brain is preventing him oh he's perfectly coherent like there's the I don't know how here we go round one ladies and gentlemen Eddie Bravo prediction I'm gonna go with the Mexican dude you got to go with you people Norton I got to go with golovkin have to yeah he's white absolutely I feel like either one of these motherfuckers to Choctaws Kazakhstan considered white well yeah I mean it's definitely white if you go to a black neighborhood and try to say the n-word yep that's all you need to know is it is are you white well can you get away with being in a black neighborhood and using the end yeah that type of credibility or do not yeah if you're Wesley Snipes dark you can get away with using it anywhere in the world right sure so Canelo's white Canelo is actually Mexican but he's got red fucking hair it's crazy freckles but if a Kazakhstan is considered white then why wouldn't Canelo be considered white but he is white for sure I mean he's Russian or you know part of the Versova the Soviet Union that's right China well you know a lot of these people have Mongolian in them a lot of these people right there well no it's like an Asian but it's um that's Genghis Khan I mean Genghis Khan they I think they said some insane number like five percent of all the men in Asia or all the people in Asia have Genghis Khan's genes Jesus he's dumping loads all over the place everybody and killed everyone killed like you know they don't even know how many millions but somewhere between 20 and 70 million people died directly by his hand you know what his daughter was now which one Chaka Chaka Khan I met her in a falafel place in New York me and Godfrey chased her down the street and Randy oh my god lovekins but in this one in 200 of the whole population in the world is directly descended from Genghis Khan look at that oh my god what years was he was he alive it was like the 1200 basically 100% of China yeah whoa dude this is a great fight huh golovkin just double jab him ooh that's a strong jab that might be a big factor he's used that jab before on guys and and shocked him and out Jap out boxed him Lemieux he did that with he came out and started popping him with the jab and a lot of people didn't expect that he can outbox his shit out of people you caught him yeah okay Oh block though those nothings happen in there those are getting blocked the jab is what you got to keep an eye on see in order counter right hand of Canelo he's a lot bigger whoo triple G yeah he's bigger he's taller see how that wire keeps landing his face is fucked up and it's the first round he's getting lit up with that straight jab he's gotta - he shaded a line well he gets angry at people and starts talking shit to him and he puts his hands down lets them punch him in the face when he was breaking this one dude down as he was breaking him down he put his hands down started walking towards the maleta guy punch him just move his hands slightly and then fucking digs in on him he's a mean guy man yeah this is a psychology that amazing though when you drop your hands a lot of times guys won't react immediately convinces a schoolyard humiliation of a guy doing that and you missing yeah that's really weird to watch professional fighters not always just go right in with some well let me help you out with that there's also reason when you drop your hands you don't know where the punches are coming from it's a different thing like it's very tricky when someone drops their hands you have to be very careful because things can come from anywhere it's one of the reasons why Tommy Hearns when he jabbed he kept his hand down here and hop it up in your face it's you don't see it as much you don't see it it's quick if someone's standing right here and you see this and you see that you see the hands a little bit more there it's a traditional pattern that you understand when someone has their hands down low and they start running their head shift can come wild from all over the place how many of you prepare cards has triple G headline only a few it's been mostly like an HBO fighter but because his his pay-per-views didn't sell well like one of them only sold one Gennady golovkin I forget it we fought but he was like 150,000 buys it's unfortunate because he's fucking mm like marvelous in there I mean those nice guys he beat Kell Brook cow Brooks very good and he broke him down white guy yeah no he's a black guy from England really bad ass world champion at a lighter weight he was world champ but I believe at welterweight and he came up oh look at this Cal I don't like all that it's a little wasted energy right there a little too much emotion he I mean he liked rooster him got behind that's a lot of energy just blue there that having a lot to during in Connor I'm a with a lot I think that was different though you know yeah these guys are way more identical in terms of skill and career but I'm seeing golovkin get the better of these exchanges well they just showed you both jabbed each other at the same time stiff you know the age could really be a factor you know Canelo's never really taking a beating he only had one fight City loss and that was that fight with Mayweather and he really didn't get beat up and that fight he just got out boxed was that a decision yeah unanimous clear Mayweather just showed him what's up but he didn't knock him out you know what I mean it's like Canelo's beating the fuck out of some really good fighters he's super dangerous puncher and golovkin has been in way more Wars than canal Canelo has Canelo's figured out a way to avoid wars and just put it on people it's just fucking really good man this is for boxing this is like as good as it can that is because Canelo is still getting better you know oh that's a sweet job I mean he's 27 now and this fight is gonna make him better too you know he's only 27 golovkin if Cannell managed to KO him and he's 35 could be the end you know or at least the beginning of the end he's not 25 but Canelo almost is and part of the appeal is that he's 37 - no there's something about undefeated fighter like those 3 G's on his belt that's dope well he's undefeated for a reason man he's a fucking mask yeah she should sponsor them just what we want to hear geez where the Freemasons just the other one put over your day just put put our Gees up top and then your G over the dick you blowed the watch company sponsored his dick look is that funny that people care about that like yeah like that the UFC what like didn't want that a lot of people felt felt like you they see too much of that on boxer shorts it bothers them I don't even notice it I didn't even help with sales or does it get into your psyche and you don't even realize it's in there it's a good question I remember back in the day cigarette companies used to sponsor fighters like boxers used to have cigarette companies on their shorts forget who did that you know what it might have been my orga did who fuck had a cigarette company sponsored them cigarette company sponsored boxers you ever see the old were they were sponsors of cartoons and they would show Fred smokey a Winston like they would have like fucking uh what's that I hate that show the Flintstones you hate the fluence I've fucking her makes me sick despise Fred Flintstone why I don't know I just always hated them why so it's a weird one I'm not a big cartoon driver that like you look at that left hook to the body son Oh boom gonna love him with a crisp straight right this is as good as it gets for boxing man it really is you know you got a guy in golovkin undefeated 35 and oh then blast and everybody wanting that big fight and then killing a little Alvarez this proud superstar steps up wants his fight and just they both call each other out they both want I mean Canales always said he wanted to fight the very best he's bleeding glove gun it looks like he's behind it Wow goddamn golovkin is good god damn he's good he landed some shots there man whoo that was an interesting combination the way through the left hook and then threw it again a surprising left hook the second left took in particular he's forcing this kid to box with I mean to slug with him that's his style of fight Canelo is a really good counter striker and what's what's going on here now is golovkin is just really coming to him and Canelo's this is like a perfect fight in a lot of ways this is like the kind of fight you would hope but this Canela want to stand there with him and trade punches well he wants a counter strike but I mean golovkin is gonna come towards him so he has his opportunities I mean it's it's a brilliant fight like as far as like what you know stylistically it's perfect has has glock had ever even really been in trouble in a fight not really he's been punched a lot though never been dropped no I don't believe so I've never even seen him like stunned he did have a really good fight in his last fight can you put golovkin's record ups like remember homeboys name he's had a couple of very good fights where you know people are coming to him very you know enthusiasm is that last fighting force Sherman was less I don't Daniel Dan Jacob Daniel Jacobs is the one that's that guy that was a really close fight awesome awesome fight but it was unanimous decision for Gennady golovkin but Daniel Jacobs is fucking for real white guy black guy he's super good so it was like it was a big win and you know everybody could tell watching the fight that Jacobs is super legit I mean we were to new it coming in but so even though he didn't knock him out it's still he's still one damn Canelo fierce fierce both guys are fierce oh that left hooks the bodywork and hello they're both so good man oh that uppercut damn see and they're the other thing you got to think of is age man the reality of age 35 with some wars behind on versus 27 with really no wars just smashing a lot of people real good trainers when the same trainer since he was a kid what are you showing me Jamie what's going on is that the UFC oh my god you're amazing how can we can't put it on that TV oh we got to fix that who would these guys fighting I'm triangle okay oh great gorgeou let's be Jason well folks we are we should be on Twitter at the same time we should be periscope hmm I don't use any of those live I want you know why I like my face I just yeah I know it's supposed to help but I just can't do it yeah just it sometimes it's too much he keeps going back to the arm triangle he lost it last time yeah likes it oh no he lost against look he's an under jacket again you go right back to it easy honest he goes right back to it look at that shit you could tell you know I knew he was gonna do it cuz he's so good there's no way he's gonna he's gonna wear him out he's got to keep him in the chopping that's right he's got to not try to finish him just keep him in the chopping block what do you think of that way of defending that was a nice way Dan when you grab you know that's the we like doing it the way he's doing it oh he's gone it's over yeah Pat what was that what uh with dos Anjos finished off Neil Magny with yes he did yeah smush them round four here we go this is to a DD having the FC play here to perfect time because you don't you rarely see an under Jack battle in the UFC like that yeah that was a battle he tried it three different times you rarely see that you don't ever see that that's gregor Gillespie he's a piece of fucking beast man Gregor Gillespie yeah that's a bad motherfucker right there at least has some good mount strategies he wasn't trying to beat him up he was trying to finish it you shot to the body oh man Canelo just hit him with a hard left hook to the body and go let's see if they show that these guys are going at it man this is crazy this is a fucking war man I mean like we were watching like an all-time classic boxing war right now oh look at that jab that hidden it looks like a mist under him popped him fast ooh mmm Eddie Bravo would you be watching this if it wasn't for us yes because he's Mexican uh did you know was gonna start at 8:00 there we start around 8:00 8:30 well I'm not usually they started like 9:00 they decided to start this one early okay just to make sure that people in the East code look at Oh golovkin with that Jam you think that was the thinking too like let's make sure people in New York and Jersey and Florida can order this yeah for sure that's what oh dude ooh this is distract he just did that thing by where he dropped his arms a little bit - yeah it's boxing him up he shook his head soon as they shake their head no that means yes yeah does that ever mean the guy isn't hurt when he shakes because why would you tell him you didn't hurt you're not hurt well it does kind of like you ain't got shit you could say got a guy but the problem is when someone actually hits you and really dings you and then you do it like never well maybe the know is saying no you didn't knock me down not this time maybe that's what he means maybe it doesn't seem like it most mostly what it seems like that didn't hurt like that ain't shit he didn't get me no one ever says you didn't knock me down yeah I step in like a Jake LaMotta movie that was exactly a great close-up on the Rings trying to fucking jab in that counter right together these guys are so well matched who look that tight left hook by triple G he's hurt triple G no Cannella you think so yeah what makes you say that because he keeps going backwards into the ropes I bought a shot that you were talking about right when that landed he looked at it his eyes he went oh shit you might be right might be right I keep forgetting these are three minute rounds and now they're weird right yeah you get into it you look out fuck the belt you know what's interesting about that it's easier to go five minutes boxing then it is to go three minutes of wrestling yes UFC is like five minute rounds and boxing is three minute rounds they just got used to it but one thing though is if you give shorter route there is a good argument for a shorter round that argument is guys can go faster and harder in three minutes than they can in five because they have to conserve themselves right do you feel like boxing over the last year making a comeback or not for sure okay I think boxing isn't a good place right it's making a little comeback yeah and it might have something to do with the fact that there's a rivalry going on between UFC and boxing like what sport is better yeah I think it's bringing more attention to boxing you know by the UFC fans they're paying attention to boxing because there's this debate that's good good argument maybe the UFC boxing up well it's also boxing's in a real good place right now there's so many good fighters chenko I mean these two gentlemen or do you really do a three minute round UFC I mean with jiu-jitsu and all that just so you couldn't work what I would think is maybe a five minute round a box and be kind of interesting but I think they're doing it right honestly because I think you know you could go hard and fast for three minutes and maybe it'll ensure a faster pace for the majority of the fight then if you made guys fight five-minute rounds how often do they give out ten eight rounds in boxing quite when guys get dropped quite a bit it's pretty common it was uncommon for a long time in MMA but it's more common now while it was good head movement there by Canelo I feel that a rule changes right yeah can L avoid it most of that he's good really good defense here his defense is tight good movement oh there's a good right hand of the body it's just like to get to this level so this what's exciting about this fight is that to get to this level there's so much shit you got to go through it's so rare that a guy comes out this good you know but there's so few of them at even rare they get two of them finally fighting yeah like this who else from the top pay-per-view boxers you're looking at it right in this yeah boys are tired Manny Pacquiao is not drawing the numbers he used to and his last fight he fought he lost to like a schoolteacher you know his time is basically done we fight that was Australia what about in the heavyweight division no pay-per-view there well Anthony Joshua was a huge star in London and in England and probably in Europe in the UK in America he's a big star with boxing fans but sort of like how triple G's a big star with boxing fans Canelo is a huge star with actual Mexicans like across the board and maybe you could say that about Anthony Joshua with England I'd you know I'm not in England could very well be this oh look at that right hand over the top he said no he said no uh-uh I don't know about the nothing boxing needs to do to keep the upward just hard it's just hard he got guys like Terence Crawford he's a bad motherfucker he got lomachenko you've got some good fighters you've got Andre Ward is one of the best in the world the UFC light or the boxing light heavyweight champion who's also the u.s. gold medalist in boxing he's a beast I think what you got to do is give people the fights that they want not make them wait for it for two years and three years that's easier said than done oh absolutely it's what helped the UFC I think so much do that and then shaking the hands at each other oh this is crazy Canelo swinging some shots he's throwing them hard man oh oh bill everyone our lovely Glove gun out a little bit maybe glove again daddy said come on Ken go love again Koloff Ken oh this is a good fight Oh dropped his hands you're popular Jack and Cologne on the back of his pants to be June by June or peaches yeah that's a Cologne this guy Norman used to wear it in a department store I wear for stealing here we smell good uh it's hilarious the smells yeah you smelled grams like what is it is like by June people are weird with their fucking colognes right yeah I have a whole fucking shelf Oldham do you yeah I I just I don't know why I liked him it's overcompensation I think I used to word your car oh god yeah it was great that was like fucking that was like Guido stuff in like like 1988 1990 who taught you how to wear it good late yeah girls like cologne capezios yeah I liked it for some reason where I love it like where it did away with their like I don't like a girl to wear perfume at all like I really don't like I like natural yeah I like the fruity smelling like the sweet look at this perfumes Oh son you know I don't like any I wanted to smell like a fucking gorilla Janelle shook his head with that that was a bomb that he got hit with it graved them it's weird male perfume it's weird that we accept that you know oh look at that right hand damn dude the lovekins pouring it on Oh golovkin is landing some shots man the sixth round this is just the six round I don't know Oh Canelo's fired back that's a hard shot to the body you heard him to the ADI he went back to it golovkin is in trouble he's hurt to the body he knows it yeah man he does know it he hit him with a right hand look at he's landing yeah no oh shit what a turnaround it's so hard to recover from that liver shot - you got to keep moving but you're diminished you've been hitting the liver Jim I know you've had to get a lot of guys leg kick you and choke you I don't think anyone's ever purposely punched me in the liver I've had a lot of things done they're all unpleasant but they say that's a pretty bad one it's horrible and the fact I'm pretty sure that happened just now that Gennady golovkin and you could barely tell watching him fight oh that hit in the chest there little high who's a good fight it's so back and forth yeah I punched a guy in the liver in the fourth grade then this shit yeah you got to work on new techniques on the 4th grade means you were nine are you sure you actually hit the liver totally bro crushed it it's a horrible thing to kick well people get a liver needle liver might be the worst that's one of the worst need to deliver is horrifying as Ronda Rousey was so good at that she would tie girls up in that judo clinch and then just knee the fuck out of their body was ruthless because she was so good at like upper body control she could tie you up so well from judo Hogan aji Colombia on the right hand of the body she would just get a hold of girls and then she started fucking nuking him with knees to the body she did that Sara McMann god damn this is good yeah this is really so tense right like anything can happen here fortunes can change the drop of a hat whoo Canelo is firing him huh oh he's at 44 49 to 40 for power punches god damn it that is so insane favor of golovkin his Ronda coming back you think I don't think so gonna wrestling I think it's over yeah I think so I don't think she wants to do it anymore you know for whatever reason you could break that down psychologically all day you know Matt Sarah had a great line that I never forgot he said a long time ago that everybody likes to be the hammer oh yeah but nobody wants to be the nail yeah and there's always if you're the nail can you come back yeah and there's always gonna be finders out there that you can't take down and you're gonna be forced to stand sure and the level of striking right now with the girls is at an all-time high and if you ain't top on top of your striking even if you get really good it's still Russian roulette these girls are some of the like Shevchenko and Amanda Nunez yes you know so dainty we can't the person down you have to strike and then it becomes a kickboxing battle how good is your kick box kickboxing batter where you hope and pray that something goes wrong and you get it to the ground you know what Rhonda has good striking it's not terrible but even if it was great there's a lot of great strikers out there so at the end of the day you're gonna be forced to win a kickboxing tournament at the very top it's gonna be very hard she didn't wrestle her whole life she's doing judo at an Olympic level yeah she has great takedowns she was able to ragdoll most of her opponents but right now man it's gonna be very hard for her to take these girls down right now she's gonna be forced to strike so then it becomes you know she could win some she could lose some how many people did she beat that or strikers as good as Holly Holm Nunez none none of them were as good as her the only one who's closest cat Zingano and she'd caught cat really earlier at the first round right yeah with an armbar cat just charged at her and got caught with an armbar yeah I think Rhonda said I think cat deserve better like she she knew that that was just their kind of a fluke you know what cat said that the reason why she charged at her like that is cuz like she took a furious beating in that Amanda Nunez fight she won the fight but she got fucked up in that first round like real bad and she's like I didn't want to go through that again but she was I just want to charge at her and get a hold of her I'm such an if Ronda Rousey decided to on the girl she couldn't throw or takedown plan B is that flying guard pool she had the guard for it she has an amazing guard mazing arm bar from the guard her plan should have been in my opinion to get the fight to the ground try to be on top try to use your judo if that didn't work we have to go to pole and guard a project with someone like Amanda Nunez is that's not going to happen I think you're gonna get eaten up with punches when you try to get close Amanda's got something yeah you got his arms in order to pull guard you got you got to pull off a legit shot to get them to react to get them to sprawl and that's when you pull guard when you're under him and they sprawl you time it perfect it's a it's a technique it's just like a takedown regards amazing just like in that fight where that surge Omar I he was on his back hurt and and his opponent wouldn't get on top of this let's pay attention to this because it has happening here golovkin cracked him we're still gonna be able to watch the Rockhold fight to who was so exciting yeah it's only 8:30 this fights nuts man he's really impressive off the ropes too golovkin I know Alvarez oh yeah well he's impressive everywhere they're both are I mean these are two legit world champions that's why this is so exciting I've even seen get off get off it on the ropes much at all this fight because he's been taking it to Canelo and that's his style and when that's what's so interesting about this setup is that everybody knew that Canelo was a really good counter puncher I just get really good timing he just seems a bit too small Canelo yeah that Jeff really there's a size difference man there's definitely a size difference but he's thick you know I just think frame wise I think you're right but I think the money is where he's at you know I mean I think this fight is a big big money fight don't know how many good fight so there are for him at 54 what big names there are I think he struggles to make that weight - who gloved in know Canelo I think he struggles even to make 60 and this is a what this is 60 I think 154 is a real struggle for them because that's what Mayweather got him down to 150 - maybe that's so smart I just was a little bit more weight we'll talk a little more weight yes a little more weight and the thing about Conor like what he did to Connor very smart - which was just make him fight make him work get him get him tired and then start putting it to him to start piling it up wearing him out piling it up wearing him out when you saw me with her unloading you're like oh yeah that's right yeah he's fucking Floyd Mayweather he's one of if not the best boxer ever and Conor's did catch him with a couple things only that jab son Oh No HBO paper you went blank for all good there oh they all panic imagine let's see what do you think here he's definitely losing the rounds but he he's putting up a good fight any thinking I was losing oh yeah yeah he's got 19 more headshots for coffee yeah they have golovkin ahead three to three run three points 65 to 68 but the thing is it looks like golovkin is trying to put him away he's not just content to beat him he's putting massive pressure on him here you know I mean and you saw Cannell take a big deep breath and as we get into the 8 9 10 11 12 Canelo fades a little he fades a little he throws hard power shots and I know he keeps working hard on his conditioning and he works harder than anybody but it's just that style is exhausting well go at Plus girl off he wants to put him away cause he hears people talking about his age too I mean you know everyone say as he does he have it anymore just blown down yeah that's the consensus Oh shots the body good shots the body by Canelo you might have heard him again he might have hurt him again to the body golovkin is not firing out up see Oh catching his breath yeah you got a grip to the body dude this is such a good fight this fight if every boxing match was like this boxing would be huge the thing that's genius about Mayweather is he managed to never be in one of these yeah he really did avoid everything did all of it he never got beat up they only got hit clean like seven times eight times this whole career and he's made the most money made way more than anybody else combined like double or triple at least right oh yeah I mean he's for sure the number one moneymaker ever Oh without a doubt yeah close this put him to a billionaire category in the neighborhood you know who knows exactly what the deal isn't but dude they got six point two five something million pay-per-views that's insane I wonder what he's saving up for I wonder what he wants that he doesn't quite know taxes to I think he owes money to Yoda little bit before this fight but he might buy a basketball team oh look at that uppercut the big thing is him not going too crazy and spending it all and blowing it all doesn't seem like I think they have one more my mansions and shit all sorts of Rolls Royces but well you know when he got quality cars he was like way deep in the tack oh yeah nice uppercut by canal he was definitely like in big tax trouble before we got bailed out with a fight in the past you think they rematch I think they rematch they should why not I think Connor would have to beat somebody good in a boxing match and he would also have to have a real training camp I think I think boxing is over for Conor oh I don't think so one more fight like that because people will buy it now Fenton I went to the 10th round he got fatigued it did there's still a motive for people to buy it yeah I mean look he he went the very first fight against the greatest ever there's so many you're right you're right you're right there's that too but the thing is if there's a legit big fight like say if Canelo Alvarez steps up and says that he wants to fight Conor McGregor [Laughter] I think Conor made me realize you got it specialized well absolutely you can't do both especially the difference between Canelo and Floyd the Floyd was just a brilliant boxer Canelo's a murderous puncher and he'll fuck you up he'll hurt you there's also a promotional difference to Conor and Floyd are pretty much they're very similar guys and they both understood what they were doing promotion wise I don't know if Canelo is that guy well he's not gonna promote it that way but he's got the whole loo that uppercut that's his genius it's he's got the support of the American people it's love Ginn vs McGregor oh look at that uppercut you would die I'm I don't know if I Gregor take that fight no that's not a good fight for him either neither Canelo or golovkin is a good fight for em it's a terrible fight for him those guys are different they're they're they're this you know I click it with the way these guys fight especially with this is how golovkin fights every fight I bring big drama show that's what he calls it dude I mean this is one of those fights we're gonna be looking back on someday look at those shuttle buses Nellie this is one of those fights that we're gonna look back on and go you remember when we watch that fucking fight holy shit look at he just shook his head on him golovkin is putting tremendous pressure on him he's trying to break him yeah he's keeping him against the ropes for 80% of the fight it's not just that like it's the pace that he's fighting at he's trying to make him wither he sees something you think he's he's invading yeah he sees him trying to catch some breaks he's still super dangerous but golovkin catches he's seeing Canelo trying to catch his breath and that's he displayed it on the seat in between rounds his feet we're all out yeah see if I if I know this and I don't know that much about boxing I know that Canelo has what people think of as an endurance problem and it's not you know it's not a big mystery he just kind of fades a little bit who we just got tagged he just got tagged he might get my god ooh it's not that he doesn't work hard it's just like his style is just so explosive and he's got so much muscle that he carries around that style requires you to be in fucking sensational shape well it does it does it mean anything that he's a counter puncher cuz they're always getting hit first so you got to take a little bit more to know not necessarily his defense is outstanding look at that look how good he ducked under that right hand his defense is amazing it's just like he's never been hit like this before and not with a guy like golovkin he's just putting it to him he's been hit by a guy like Floyd who just caught him with good clean scoring shots snapped his head back a couple of times but nothing like like a mule kicking in the face this is a different thing because golovkin is trying to break him he's not just trying to win he's putting himself in danger he's putting himself in danger to prove that he's the best and that's a different thing that's a different kind of person with he's not making the kind of money that these guys are making he's hungry as fuck see that uppercut yeah Oh baby and again he's not making the kind of like superstar money that he just saw Connor and Fleur and the only way that he can make it is to being big drama show and so he's just coming for deaf once again for this fire who knows yeah I think it's probably depending upon the pay-per-view sales yeah I literally have no scale for what these guys make I have no clue aliens Canelo is a superstar he's gonna sell I mean he would sell fucking a million pay-per-view series fighting a uber driver and I'm not joking oh so he's a bigger draw than Koloff Canelo yeah and I was getting 5g triple G's getting three nice two million more know if you know how famous he is it makes sense yeah he's huge like that guy goes Viva Mexico and everybody fucking roof almost falls off I'll tell you what man Mexicans and Irish that they make you reconsider the idea patriotism very very proud people like when you hear the Irish people that we're in town in Vegas when Connor is fighting you ever see that video of Mandalay Bay the whole Mandalay Bay which the fight wasn't even there okay the whole Mandalay Bay field I mean to where you couldn't walk with Irish people and they're all singing together yeah it was insane and that wasn't even where the fight was being held we saw that the garden outside in November it was fucking I was with Matt Serra's freezing outside these maniacs have short-sleeved shirts and tank tops no yeah didn't we walk to the garden together we walked there to the incoming leaving the guy it was freezing that night remember yeah that's right to his protest in front of Trump's apartment yeah that's right how fun was that it was awesome we had a walk little Jimmy me and cam and weren't you there young James was Tony there too Brendon mischief-maker was there look at that poof oh oh god damn look at those that left to the body that right over the top holy shit what a fight this is but we had a walk because there were so many people protesting Trump always done him he's not hurt go up got hurt he stumbled Oh canelo hit him with something oh look at that jab oh my goodness I caught it again oh my god this is my AK this is a fucking fight and this is the 10th round kids oh my god this is amazing every hole yeah pull them apart oh my god no these guys are going for blood golovkin is a fucking savage man savage he's kind of like 82% Genghis Khan bud right if you had a guess you're right the rats a good point the ref is not stepping he hasn't had a chance and there's no need to this is a war yeah especially the way Koloff can fights man what a pace he puts on you you just don't get a chance to breathe he's just on you like he stays in a phone booth no matter what and there's no breaks he pops a jab you stepped back you right back on you look at this he's just right back on them constantly look at this pressure right hand but you got to understand how terrifying this is when you're fighting a guy like this that doesn't get tired continues to push on you and like that's why Canelo has to take some breaks yeah then you start just trying to get out of his way he doesn't really want to be up against the ropes like this he has to fight like this he really doesn't have the energy to just meet him in the center and go kablooey at each other so golovkin's pressure and constant forward movement that's a big factor here he's controlling where this fight takes place another weapon yeah it's ring generalship he's completely controlling where the fight takes place and he's showing much more desire to win he's trying to stop Canelo Canelo's trying to catch golovkin as he's trying to stop him there's two very different things happening here doesn't mean the canal can't still put the lights out on him but which way more impressive is what golovkin's doing he's just swarming a man and could see canal grabs him after that see that that's right he throws that shot that he grabs him it's cuz he's wilting we see his legs just keep out there dude he's wilting he is he's getting fucked up he could still come back hard because he's a fucking animal and he's a world champion but the bottom line is he's starting to fade we're in the 10th round this shit's getting weird look at that you still got some good head movement though I'll tell you that that was nice the cardio is in tremendous credible tremendous golovkin scardiest will go up against another big bear guy is it yes he is what's a big bear guy goes to Big Bear to Train same as el Cucuy Tony's a savage dude I've watched that guy train for six hours straight Tony Ferguson his cardio is fuckin through the roof he's an animation see the shit we're doing up there crazy crazy she love Big Bear man said peaceful up there it's cool what are you doing just one you could work out there at a very high altitude low oxygen content in the air they say Eddie honestly the best thing to do is not to train up there they say the best thing to do is live up there and a train like down like to go down to like sea level like drive an hour go down a sea level train there and then go do everything else up up top because your body will adapt because the altitude especially you're sleeping up there but you'll have more work output you'll get more work in with your body and yeah what do I know I'm not a scientist so dear Tony don't need more work there Tony goes forever no I'm sure but I mean he could be even better that's what I'm saying I just think that that's what the science is I mean it doesn't mean anything Tony's obviously adapted to Big Bear well fuck that's such a good fight man such a good fight Kevin Lee yeah so Charlie yeah it's gonna be great Kevin Lee is it is a serious threat you know he's not taking him lightly very serious threat there but very serious look at their opponents Tony's been through some you know he fucked up Edson Barboza Josh Thompson Raphael de zhonya's those are big names big giant fine dos Anjos Juan was very fucking impressive very impressive that was a incredibly impressive fight and then the other one that was really impressive to me was the Barbosa fight cuz Barboza stand up his top of the food chain you know and tony was cracking him and then finished him in a crazy bloodied arse it was now all bloody and everything on that Darce yep yep and etson Barbosa is considered probably top three most dangerous strikers in the you see oh yeah that guy will light you up with wheel cakes head carry thing he's so fast he's so powerful he has the first wheel kick ko in the UFC you know in the highlight you could see Ari Shaffir in the background going like this yeah like as he gets hit and cracked Terry he hits Terry Adam with this crazy wheel kick is the first wheel kick ko in the UFC and it was the perfect one why all those stuff it seemed like Aldo I noticed it in the Frankie Edgar fight really stopped kicking or throws a lot less is he huh good question it's a very good question it could be because he's got injuries that don't allow him a kick anymore it could be that it's easier for guys to take him down when he kicks you'd have to talk to him I'd like to talk to him good but he didn't use it very much a max Holloway but if you go back to like the Urijah Faber fight it was like his biggest weapon yeah but I noticed against Frank yeah but he's not throwing a lot of kids yeah I wondered why I thought Frankie was probably trying to time those kicks in the rematch that made total sense to me what didn't make sense is how he didn't use him that much against max but you know max is a motherfucker man well he said he wants to box now jo-jo there yeah yeah I've heard that but that doesn't take away from the fact in an MMA fight right his kicks are one of the most deadly weapon and weapons in the sport in his prime man he was so fucking good but like everyone it's just like they reach a time Oh golovkin caught him with a right hand oh this is a crazy crazy fight man like you usually don't get these fights 96-95 golovkin power punches landed Wow that's incredible these guys are just landed - oh the good left hook - you know Caloocan I mean Canelo eller is absolutely a champion and that's the reason why he keeps firing back and he won't will and he keeps using good head movement but there's no doubt about golovkin is putting it on them one more round so exciting and then we get to go to see David branch and Luke Rockhold how are we so lucky look at this some Jesus shit go on yeah I don't know what that is that's got it all is that it's got to be round can all mom or something she was like this is got that moment come to Jesus moment um Duff's on just looks so much better at 170 doesn't he I missed that fight but he did get an arm trying I saw this finish put the smash on Neil Magny put the smash biggest leg let's a big giant he just looked massive yeah well he's filled in this is what he gives his body supposed to look like he was starving himself terrible idea I mean he was a beast at 155 from you smashing guys and running him over but he got to a point where he really could not make the weight anymore I mean he was really in real bad shape when he made the weight for Eddie Alvarez he's thick man so thick dude and at 170 I mean he's a fucking animal he kicked Neil Magny legs out from under him and then he got on top of him and just put the smooch on him it was just so high-level how did he get him down I got down with kick kicked his fucking leg out from under him and then jumped on him I just jumped on him dude it was a beating I mean it was in Ella's golf he has to know he needs a knockout yeah he's got it no twelfth round ooh behind the ear in the clinch look at that uppercut in the clench pulling the head down going MMA on the jab of fucking golovkin is so slick oh good now Canelo with the bottom oh shit oh hello with the combo golovkin caught him with a left hook they could cook goddamn golovkin has a chin man yeah that an unbelievable chin him he took some show shit oh shit oh shit what a crazy fuck this is on man oh my god this is amazing oh and Canelo LAN to the right hand this is a crazy fight holy shit look at that come out with a jab in the right hand real tight in the clinch constant-pressure a minute 30 to go does he take over does he take over does Cannell will have enough to sustain arms down swinging and missing trying to catch some blood in there throwing some punches that just don't have the steam on him anymore and golovkin McLaughlin has to know he's ahead he's still coming after him yeah he's a fucking spider dude he's like a spider trying to suck the blood out of a fly just on you like almost like just so predator like just constantly look it's not backing off he's not boxing this is not a boxing match he's trying to fuck him up that's the golovkin style that makes him so exciting man that's why Mexican fighters love him they do right yeah yeah Mexican fight fans are big triple G fans to the point where his last fight was um muchos Gracias he knows where because he fights like a world-class top of the food chain Mexican boxer a lot of ways god damn he's good this is fucking fantastic yeah those are just hitting the glove yeah Canelo's tired man he's real tired there's still 20 something to go but he's still hanging in there man that's that world champion heart still swinging it doesn't get any better than this for boxing especially like after the Conor McGregor Floyd Mayweather fight this is a fighter like hey this is how it's done yeah this is the real deal I mean obviously Floyd did it how it's supposed to be done but that wasn't two fighters on the same level if this is crazy these were that's absolutely Glaucus fight yeah these are both great moments for box you know the Mayweather McGregor and this are both really really great for boxing Brendan Schaub I should say this before the decision gets announced said that if golovkin didn't win by some ungodly lopsided beatdown that he could lose a decision because of corruption he goes because that's how boxing rolls and there's way more money in Canelo winning so that's fed now that we know that the contest sponsor that's true well apparently the audience is like half Mexican he's a superstar in Mexico so just a super-slim talking about Canelo yeah so let's see if Brendan Schaub predicted this correctly because we think it has to be gloved in the rap the the unofficial scorecard guy had it for golovkin by several rounds we think it was golovkin clearly although Cannella fought a great fight have there been bad decision if Canelo wins have there what was the last time there was a decision like that Tim Bradley Manny Pacquiao who who one that I believe Bradley one but Pacquiao should have won and then it was like a boxed him it was worse it was worse if I remember correctly so what was the look at that boom boom boom oh Jesus they're showing hello oh my goodness is the last round that was Jenelle oh just tried to put it to him and go Evans like come on come on come on I'm from cuts next time boom just boom over the top god damn just war here yeah look at that she only just paid back every punch he took in the combination it's a sharp jab to his jab so snappy okay change it give me a guess Eddie Bravo for sure globe again for sure unless there's unless this corruption like crazy to say that I doubt it we're saying this look at this they got it 116-112 for golovkin Harold let them in here Harold they gave that last so love can ran away with it they gave ten nine that last fight I mean that last round - fucking Canelo yeah you know what I really like I don't know why they did that I like how these girls just stand there and smile they're doing really good job they're always smiling it seems easy it's hard you got to be frozen and fucking clapping in the drives me crazy I hate it I love it I love the their focus they're focused on not being even remotely normal this really the job their focus their job is to stand there smile in a some psychotic way if they were a guy like if they were a guy if you're was if they hired a guy to stand there in a nice suit and tie and stand there like this could you fucking imagine how crazy would be if you hired guys to stand behind fighters with giant smiles in their face and just not especially if they were in their underwear just imagine that imagine guys in a speedo standing there like ripped like holding a Tecate sign with a big giant smile at her face that happens on Santa Monica Boulevard during traffic during a big fight on pay-per-view Eddie Bravo you silly goose one day when hey let's hear the volume let's hear it this is you know told you son Oh fucking boxing fucking stinks told you son boxing and fuckin is the sage Brendan Brendan Schaub is a sick fucking stings why is he mad because he knows he knows he got fucked you know fuck well he's gonna feel terrible now he knows he got his ass got to draw it's no way that's how is that a draw now it's a long second he's out gonna see it if he is happy then that would mean that he thought he lost so that the fact that he looks pissed that's smart he's the one I think he's mad because he didn't win he threw too much man he didn't win but he's definitely mad did he got outbox and they made it a draw hey there's 50 more punches yeah how the fuck is that a draw it's not in space it's not even close that though our punch is different though there you go that's the difference - very smart maybe oh the higher percentage I can't stand it yeah but it's a higher number landed to 114 and 110 and total power punches yeah yeah I want uh all right yeah absurd thing though when you're looking at numbers wise I mean it's one it's one way of looking at it but like one big shot that's a power punch and then another power punch that doesn't do anything they're both power punches you know I'm saying like one shot that really fucks you up and your legs go and you get wobbly that's a power punch and another power punch is a shot that lands in the same spot but doesn't do anything they're both power what are these colors mean what do you know I'm saying what is the blue ear mean no no look at the number of punches that landed on Canelo's face 109 on his right side and 95 on his left - 10 landed - 127 yeah big difference in how many landed to the head get a lot more landed way more humid said only four shots were landed - Canelo's body that doesn't make any sense is that what really was fed that's here see this horn say what happened tonight good move go right to the Mexican fans fucking smart move we probably can't play this without getting yanked off of YouTube so we're gonna go to by the way first of all that I didn't think that last fight was uh I mean that last round was ten nine Canelo no how is he not fucking angry about this I mean why am ia big drama show to 90s he retains his belt so nothing really changes for him and he gets all that mafia record and the rematch is gonna be insane the rematch will be insane about those dollars for good job man fucking a good call yeah nailed it the fighters were amazing but don't with the organization oh it just stinks Brendan nailed it can you hear this are you are you guys hearing this what no what am i hearing what he thought you know if he's not saying I got really lucky that they gave me that draw I don't wanna hear what he's saying if he thinks he want he's stupid still it was a great fight amazing I love it I don't you know I mean I do care but I don't care I do care the thing that I thought they're gonna go off in one but I don't care it's a great fight I like seeing great fights I don't decisions mean less to me as I get older because I look at it and like okay what am i doing I'm basing like how I feel about something based on an inaccurate assessment by people that don't necessarily know what they're doing like would I take advice on whether or not an episode of Game of Thrones is good from three people I thought were knuckleheads like what if there's like three judges for TV shows like well the Game of Thrones finale you know I gave it an a 100 you know let's go to these judges dump we decided it gets a 40 no fucking way right and you go to school the next day oh dude you hear fucking Game of Thrones final got a 40 bro he lost it got a little dick shut your mouth I loved it remember when they first escaped the White Walkers didn't like the water have something to do with it I got on a boat and for some reason they can't get in water right that's the thing right right if it's their ice you spoiler alert in the fuck something did something don't do this something about the water right they can't hang it there was a few whores and I feel no when who the fuck tied those chains around that dragon and dragged it up who went scuba diving and and tied that dragon up and probably have shown who had the are they that's wrong they're not that strong because those dudes are fucking them up they're not that strong who's killing those gigantic chains down there underwater tie up the dragon and drag it up whose name did well they're all dead so they probably give a shit on the quarter they couldn't they can't get into waters right so how did they do it I'll accept the dragon I'll accept it yes very good point - dragon I can accept that's a very little waste when they hit the water I don't remain on like water but but they don't like I'm gonna notice - dragon I'm getting two ships so islands I can keep him from going to an island that's why these other guys like fuck this I'm going to an island I'm gonna wait on the iron island possibly things down they they cannot get into water for some reason they established that several times and then all of a sudden they cut they don't show how they tied this goddamn yeah dragon up with the chain it's like one of those chains that you you hold Navy ships to port you know yeah and who tied them up they just cut to them dragging them out watching that dragon get pulled out I can suspend a little I can I can live with the inconsistency of the dead people dragging the dragon out of the ice water like in the water resistancy I can live with that but I'm with him I didn't even notice that when I was in the show I didn't need that they went in the water and I love Game of Thrones man I have an issue that just got me fucked up yeah they fucked up it's a big hole you're right there right maybe like in the last episodes they'll show how the fuck they hide that dragon up or maybe that big a stupid hole yeah and did anyone catch it and you know what you know is we're led to believe that these these different kingdoms like King's Landing and all they are like like like countries away but man they are traveling too damn quick they get from one city to the next city they're at the wall and then they meet and and and there's snow tomorrow in the Bahamas and then the water over mountains like dude this can take months it's almost like it's almost like that whole kingdom is like like Redondo Beach West Hollywood North Hollywood Compton yeah this right is Mike Perry it was supposed to be Mike Perry versus Thiago Alves you could get a florida right he's not what he said he couldn't get out of Florida Elvis is that without yeah he was stuck in Florida and Mike Perry said we came up early so I don't want to hear that shit is that really what happened I believe so yeah that's terrible do you ever think like when they show the armies walking through like fuckin no-man's land like who's carrying the fucking food and where where's the water at hey bro you're fucking my high what are they taking ships that's a good point like what kind of sewage system do they have just walking across deserts I'm not shitting yeah an ancient Rocha we dudes taking pisses in every scene in the background there was a big issue in ancient Rome like they people got diseases because they would shit in the streets let's let's talk about that let's bring that in make it more realistic see more shit you're right man add low C food like come on like explain how these fuckers are eating I'd love to see Khaleesi dropping a deuce off the side of that fucking castle how great with that figured that'd be great oh man maybe the Queen may be like she's I don't know shot those tight shots where they show Khaleesi on the dragon remembered the Superman TV show the mother of dragons you don't think she knows how to ride a dragon I don't I was barely going and she's like hold somebody watching you and a jujitsu match like oh come on man strangle that guy with his legs she gotta fall off the dragon every night someone almost wanted to drag oh no that was the Harry Potter rock you got to fall off she's got a fall off one or two once or twice come on she's like barely great those shots when they go to her riding the dragon it drives me nuts yeah I don't like some John Wayne guys are both gay for each other cuz I thought that was the most awesome I love the show don't get me wrong I love it I love it when she was riding that dragon I was standing up cheering because it looks green screen I can't look better without it kind of weird that all the rulers are women but what kind of some feminist shit just keep that murder coming I'm happy hold it out of that dragon do you know many spikes would be inside of her pussy right there yeah I mean well where is it safe to stick your box you gonna ride that thing between spikes mics look at the size of the spikes yeah how gross they are it's scary and pointy my grip strength must be incredible they never show her training dude rips strikes out of this world she should have like a rock climbing wall in her castle maybe she takes one of those spikes and she puts it down in their pussy just clamps and that's he goes the whole time she just has a spot that she could lock in it like a ball and socket joint how's this another really bad one but dragons way bigger than that hate the way she's holding on here our whole body's right by this is right when they show the dragon sometimes it looks small might be younger that might have been earlier days oh you're right you're right okay we're on did she used it to kill a bunch of people man some people know some of the last episode didn't she get a look how big it was there oh my god that's a full grown dress okay hold on a second look at that thing do that's bad the movement of the dragon is amazing say this I know that motherfucker CGI but we're not when that white Walker threw that spear I was like when it missed this is the first time my fool girl I know so I got I feel like you live Lee versus forgot me with the dragon i John Silver sees Borg again it was a virus though right that they kept him out he's missed weight a lot oh he's missed weight a lot great Borg has miss weight several times and I don't know if he got sick while he was cutting waiting for the people around him but it's just you know God you can't boy it's a big opportunity to get sick for and it can't happen for sure but yeah I guess they have to do it again they ought they already trained for it well well like one of the judges gave it 118 to 110 for Canelo later a delay bird a delay bird did that wasn't I mean yeah what about her record in the UFC terrible 118 and 110 for Canelo have a bird that's so crazy is that a woman or man she's a woman she's very nice lady wow he's not fucking bad she's gonna get torched for that now that's terrible I hope she stays offline and they have no but they have no accountability doesn't matter because if nothing happens to them they just keep right on being fucking horrible that that's terrible yeah it's not good I better piss jeez there was one woman who got she got in serious trouble for several really bad decisions and she wanted retiring because it was like people were threatening our life Mike Perry's a bad motherfucker he's scary it's hard see that Jake Ellenberger like if if I don't know casino owner or whoever is running like the gambling the guy at the top if he wanted to let's just say bring it in a different if you wanted to rig it would you go after how would you do go after the judges or the fighter I got your explanation to what explanation for the Game of Thrones thing okay multiple tweets have come that said that they can't swim but they can go and water they just sink to the bottom oh so they sacrificed them but who is carrying those chains they're not strong enough to carry those strength those chains were gigantic the Dragons home they just sink but we know they dragged the dragon how did they're strong enough to drag the dragon why are they strong enough to take the chains in do a lot of is making a sense there's still less holes now or whoever to put them down there he's still down makes sense he just sacrificed some let them stay at the bottom of the water they can't get out that doesn't make sense so they're just walking on me to chain them up even if you had cranes and all this shit to chain that thing up you have to have James Cameron down there with that little submarine trying to scope it out for a while Keith Peterson another excellent referee that would be way harder than a Titanic a dead body no it wouldn't be harder than the Titanic Titanic's like miles deep into the water like 13,000 feet down yeah it's something it's crazy but it's steel and as shit to hook on you could just hook it up this Harry look like that no I was going Jersey Shore for this fight his he's a ruthless guy though super powerful fucking knockout artist very dangerous yeah he knocked out Ellenberger I was like wow he's just real reckless and angry Allen Jobe and handle him though Jobe and did a really good he is one life smart I think that's a decent one I think that's his lost but you know that's a good fight for him Joe ban fought a technical fight and beat him and for a guy like Mike Perry who's super dangerous up and come and do that's a good fight for him learn something you know got leg kick there as long as they they just learn you know long as fighters don't get discouraged fights like that are always good for them because then you just realize there's a higher level and the only way to reach that higher level is you got to see it fuck this problem was this life I was live oh this is the Khomeini yes oh man yeah yeah kids fucking ferocious man look at that knee to the head look at this fucking fighting them off so good good more time right there hey good good muy Thai good clinching but most importantly like just relentless attack we're gonna bone that elbow on the clutch boom there's it that's it that's it what he dug up ruthless he's a ruthless motherfucker yeah the guy's relentless and it's just like all attack it's all attack all full bar all-out just trying to smash you all the way the guy this that's gonna beat him is a guy like Joe ban who's gonna fight a very smart technical stand up fight like Joe ban did a lot of footwork a lot of movement but he also made him pay he made sure that like when he comes charging out I'm like you're not gonna get away with that like boom moved catch him with some stuff and he realized I rule this guy can hurt me it was enough for you know him to keep Perry off a bull who this shit elbow and tight that's nice that's nice look at this don't limp Ville population 1 BAM hammer fist to the back of this guy have any kind of camp boom no it did not again you don't see a lot of Thai clinches well remember Anderson or Rich Franklin yeah I know 10 years do you think it's because because obviously it's a clinch that has a thousand levels and we need a lot of work do you think it's because most fighters don't specifically work on developing that clinch in controlling people tonight clinch in their training camps or it's just something that's low percentage in MMA it's not that slow percentage it's there's less of a chance of getting in an MMA because you're essentially allowing it got to get double underhooks on you I mean if you think about what you're doing when you're clenching someone's head Anderson was so good at it man he had such a tight squeeze and it's like anything else like you know how like some people just have a sick gable grip some people just have just a sick squeeze or fight or spending time developing therefore short in Thailand they know in Thailand they specialize it if they're working on it they spend time on it yeah you don't see it that much in MMA you think it's cuz take its low percentage well so you're committing to this right you're committing to this guys are too good you know you give a guy double underhook and he's tripping you and he's on top people don't want that and it's also guys are good at keeping their hands on the hips that's what Rich Franklin fucked up but there is a reality though that if the guy has like if you have your hand on a guy's hips and the other guy is like guy in a Thai clinch he can elbow you from that clinch while you're grabbing on to his hips and you're not really going to be in a good position to stop it if he's fast it's a very good position to be in you know if a guy is worried about your knees and he does commit hand or maybe even to to the hips you catch them with a couple of hard ones a lot of guys will just switch to elbow like right from here this bandits a ruthless ruthless thing elbows are so nasty it's so it's really kind of amazing that we cover up the knuckles because you break your knuckles a lot you never break your fucking smash bricks with your elbow no problem nobody ever breaks our elbow fighting unless you get kicked you know but like hitting somebody you might get like little chips like Anderson had a bunch of chips in his elbow that he actually had to get removed like bone chips and shit stuff that snapped off one thing with Allan job on serious problem with it with his elbow didn't Gerald I think Gerald's treatment had a bunch of floating around shit in his elbow too a lot of guys get that yeah I think he was the third choice for this so I think really yeah there was one guy they had and he couldn't do it and I guess I don't throw a second well you watch how fucking ferocious Perry is you realize why iago didn't want to take this with no camp or fuck with a fucked up camp what was fucked up about this camp didn't have a voice got to get out of Florida for the hurricane that was like a week before though yeah from the fight that's what they both came from sorry that that's I think what what the reason he gave was let me make sure that's right he's talking shit about Thiago right now I said that uh everybody wants to see me beat up Robbie Lawler look at him Wow everybody wants to see me be a Robbie oh what a crazy thing to say what a great fight that would be though good lord this is a fucking interesting one if he really does do that if Thiago doesn't fight him and then he wants up and cuz he didn't get hurt in this fight at all he just swarmed him and ko'd him he could probably fight again in a few months I wonder what they're gonna do if they're gonna read match or make the rematch remake rather the Thiago fight or whether they really do give this kid Rob about positivity oh that's a good fight guys that's actually who I thought they were we don't whine underneath they put him with Gunnar Nelson okay yeah yeah yeah we're going to the game how what do you give a fuck you just knocked a due to unconscious this is an enjoyable guy though yeah ferocious fight yeah just like his style is just marauding ferocious full attack reckless a lot a lot of confidence in his ability to take shot a lot of confidence and ability to knock people dead like boom landed that like that's it and then these great fight would be him and Alan Joe bond again with the history reman yeah it could be doesn't Joe bond have a big fight coming up does he why do I think Allen has a big fight coming up maybe I'm making that up I don't think I am though I think something was just announced I don't know it's saying that uh Yago lost his dog and was living with family with his family at the gym because the hurricane so maybe he but maybe didn't before camp right yeah fuck all that being at the gym with your family and he's got a kid a really young kid yeah I get it that clinching that is insane insane he's a beast then I'm and that's how Allen fights too he's got a serious question that's the picture on my phone I took my girlfriend off and put Francis and Ghana his hat I love it he's like et I mean up in that bitch here we go did they find anyone for him by the way or no Francis after dosti I disrupt that no they don't know what's gonna happen with Junior what the substance was they said it was a very small trace amount of a diuretic so it wasn't like a steroid but a lot of times guys use diuretics to mask steroids because it flushes it out of your system quicker so I could say if a guy is doing something he wants to test negative apparently you can flush some stuff out with diuretics okay cuz it just drains all the water out of your body you keep pouring more water in it flushes things out quicker I think I don't understand how that where diuretics are illegal yes hmm that's what Chris Cyborg got popped for a diuretic but then they gave her a use exemption because yes as a legitimate reason for using it like a medical condition whether they know what he took well they never know they know what he took well why the process of they have to it has to play out like what do they think happen what's the evidence like they're very very thorough about it there's one things I really appreciate about that Jeff Novitzky is that he one of the things he said about John Jones he said before you judge him we have to let this process play out he's right way out not yet I mean they got the B sample the B sample is positive as well but it was a lot of weird shit was going on like a lot of his chiropractor was tweeting that John passed the blood test free John and like this is so irresponsible because like anybody who looked into it even for a moment would realize that they don't even test for that stuff in the blood they only test for that stuff in the urine so it wasn't like when they say his blood test was clear of it it's because they didn't test for it it's a it's a urine test so like it was so disingenuous so then they waited they got the B sample they tested that yup same exact stuff so it's in there so the question is now not whether or not it was in his body but how did it get in its body there's a big issue with a bunch of sports guys what is it baseball guys that are getting popped with that stuff Brendan Schaub brought that up as well that apparently that stuff toran a ball a Torontonian ball whatever the fuck it is tea ball is in a ton of supplements you can get in a lot of that GNC over-the-counter muscle builder bullshit all those testosterone boosters maybe that could be but you're not supposed to take that shit you shouldn't take that she don't you have to come back off a suspension like shouldn't you be sending everything and that's that's it's crazy but they're tainted supplements are a real issue but obviously the thing is don't take any fucking supplements and unless they're absolutely approved and certified and you know and you can get supplements that are approved and certified and then there could be a random bad batch that's that's totally possible that happened to somebody I mean supplements where a guy never really took a steroid but got popped because something was in a supplement that happened to Tim means Tim took some shit from GNC just some normal shit that's supposed to be some stuff you could buy off the shelf like and he tested positive and he told everybody what he took they went to different stores independently pulled that stuff off the shelf tested it yep there it is steroids but he's still got I suppose it's six months suspension a year yeah he's not supposed to take that stuff like even though it's not illegal you have to approve everything and then on top of that they have a list they have you sod a list on the website that you can go to and find out what's tainted and what's not holy shit dude it is the craziest thing you've ever seen it's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of supplements it's like there's so much shit that makes you piss hot it's crazy what's the most common what's the most popular I think there's a most popular they start with like muscle Pharm type stuff yeah they're starting with a and they're working their way through PNC yeah dude I'm talking hundreds of things like Nowitzki pulled the website up and we were laughing we were laughing and how many things that were because it's so absurd it doesn't take anything any supplements do you know if any fighters or they sure most men so there's some guys that just take for fruits and vegetables yep like the ones from mom San Fran and son though are those are tainted Monsanto Raja she saw fruit and vegetables yeah those are tainted those are genetically modified they have a shelf life for 20 years he posted a Joe Hogan for mayor sign that somebody put up the word yeah he might not have somebody else did I guess and they were just talking about him Joe again but I think that um there's a lot of tainted supplements for sure but I think there's a lot of guys using steroids - so it's like which one is it is did Jon Jones take a tainted supplement or was John Jones using steroids those are the only two options at this point because that stuff's in his body no the other option is somebody dosed him didn't have I thought somebody could I find out well they have to do some sort of an investigation he has to come clean talk about everything that he's taken they have to if he took something that is not on their list of approved substances and he didn't claim that one you know when they it's just if that's the case he needs a goddamn babysitter if that's really what happened if it really was a tainted supplement just a normal bullshit from a supermarket health food section who the fuck knows if it's really just some nonsense he needs a babysitter he needs someone that's around him that he trusts and respects some mentor figure that does not allow him to take anything stupid and tells him hey man you're the baddest motherfucker of all time and you're about to get put on the shelf for four years over some nonsense Matt Serra raised a very interesting point about again it was just a speculation but is it possible that this was happening because all those fights happened before you saw Masada yeah except for OSP well there's always gonna be that speculation if someone pisses hot you always got to think well if they piss hot in you sada and back when it wasn't very sophisticated and the drug searching wasn't that sophisticated maybe they were doing it the whole time man you got out you got to wonder you know that's why I like a guy like Tony Ferguson is so fucking spectacular you know you look at a guy like Tony Ferguson and he's just got mad focus and work ethic he's just for worship he's just ferocious in his it isn't in his focus and his intent like that guy's needs steroids he just needs food and life you know he's just gonna keep going he just needs a place to work out and he'll build it too that's the crazy thing he's up there on Big Bear building gyms builds his own fucking rolling room he's got video of it and photos of it and shit they mad it out a room he nailed all the board's down and shit and he built a bag stand yeah like a workout little yeah he's why does he do that he just likes the act of doing it he's the kind of guy that if shit hit the fan and we it was an apocalypse like he's the guy that you're gonna want ya to hang out with he's gonna build your house he's a shelter area and all you got to do is just make sure everything's clean - I'm not that guy like a beta and I ha yeah well that's what community is all about supposed to have one of those guys one guy like you supposed to have one guy like Eddie I mean that's that's what a real community is the idea that everybody has to be the guy that could build a bag stand but he can he does everything man he cleans he hands the cabin he's on fire he's just always on fire he'll go for a run through these hills and these mountains in these streets and he'll have a crew with him running and I'm in the car cuz I have a torn ACL some of my car following them and he'll beat him by so much and then come back for him and then go and then come back for him and go these are all yeah professional athletes his endurance is insane he's a he's into doing extra credit if we're gonna do ten rounds of sprints he'll do 12 he's always gonna go extra what's going on with your knee did you want a CL tore MCL was it partially torn as I'm knows yeah it's not talking to doctor rowdy McGee he's talking about surgery and my doctor I we're talking about let's try to rehab it and see what happens first and then you could always get surgery later um he said has it you know with me I told you that all I did was just stretch out and I just stood up and my just just fell apart right it came out and I had to pop it back in and then I got her an MRI the next day and it came back partial tear on the ACL torn MCL you really don't need surgery for the MCO those apparently they just heal by themselves you just gotta stay off the AC I'm on the fence I could have surgery right now or I could try to rehab it but um what's what I'm not a CL is the anterior cruciate ligament it's an agreement that stabilizes the knee keeps it from popping forward I've had both my ACLs reconstructed from the same come from fighting one of them from jujitsu one of them from Taekwondo popped out three weeks later I was doing a seminar at 10th planet Oceanside right there in the middle of seminar boom I came out again yeah it's gonna pop out of it I'm just like if it pops out that much man I would go to a different doctor I'd go to rowdy McGee man just go go to him in Vegas I talk to him and we seen he seems totally legit but what he's talking about is the surgery you know the new kind of surgery that they're doing the new surgery only the healings only three months they don't use a cadaver anymore now they reattach and you're a perfect candidate for it because your shits not totally torn apart they reattach and they resew it up and one dude did it in five months later he competed in the Olympics the the the recovery time is so much different because what they're doing now is repairing your ligament whereas before what they were doing is putting in an artificial ligament and then that ligament would act as a scaffolding so it's not artificial but a donor like I have a donor on my right one cadaver from academia cadaver patella or hamstring I had patella on my left in Kedavra how's it left feeling both of them are awesome left is awesome both of them are apparently people are moving away a little bit from cadavers because sometimes you can get an infection like Benji Radek he had his ACL cadaver ACO and he got it got infected he got infected from the surgery he got staph from the surgery which is super common yeah it's common from the cadaver it's at the actual attendant well you know MRSA I know the doctors but I'm going to write the one who did his yeah but it's there's no way to tell whether it was from the actual surgery itself from cutting you open because a lot of people get it from like any sort of simple operation they get immersed he stopped doing he stopped doing cadavers he don't do didn't Jesus does patellas well now what he's what dr. McGee was saying is the most latest cutting-edge shit you don't even have to do that now what they're doing is they're taking this torn stuff and he had pictures of it and images of the actual surgery they stitch it together and rope it down and to like literally stitch it together and they have this technique that they do and then you're up and moving like you're up and moving and within three months it's a hundred percent instead of six-month what's the technique where they just kind of Cocoon it with a bunch of layers of stitches crazy looking like apparatus the way they were doing it the way they had it stitched up like some crazy fishing not but apparently it worked amazing because they he had some videos of this guy a few months post-surgery doing box jumps and I was like this is crazy do inside box jumps like hopping on top of things hopping on top of another thing jumping over things left and right I was like that is incredible for someone to go from ACL surgery do like that was a rat that's a recipe for blowing your knee apart three because I remember after I got in mine for like six months I was terrified to do anything like a night when I first came back to jujitsu I was terrified I was like huh huh huh like every time I roll is like please don't fall apart please don't fall apart cuz if you've chosen to wait six months so hard to do how long until you're doing it you're like alright it's not gonna fall apart a couple months like eight months and I realized I was like this is pretty good I'm feeling pretty good I don't throw any kicks forever I didn't kick the bag forever and when I did jujitsu like if anybody even went for my leg I would tell him I please don't don't yank on this one this one's still janitor and it was like I wouldn't like try to explode with it and push off with it I was real gentle gentle on it this fights about to go down Oh what do you think Eddie Bravo initial thoughts I don't know this Luke Rockhold get the same guy after getting Kayode by Bisping it's a hard hard winner calls been a long time outside the otter yeah Jim Norton what do you think you're the host of UFC uncensored I'm taking David branch whoo New Yorker goes to The New Yorker you have to moving towards him droppin some shots Luke Rockhold is got a powerful left kick yeah strong left kick and he landed a few times to the body already it's a legit kick and he catches you with it way outside and Luke Rockhold super hard to take down he trains all the time with Daniel Cormier and Cain Velasquez he's got all these monster wrestlers over there hobby you've never got met off and you think branch wants to take him down he might he's got a very good ground game since Roscoe have a spinning side kick Cayla finish no he got wheel kicked in the head by Vitor Belfort and then he got Chris Weidman tried to wheel kick him and he took Wyman to the ground and beat the fuck out of him yeah that was the beginning of the end right yeah it was crazy because up until that it was like a really competitive fight branch is sucked doing a good job of circling to his left to avoid that left kick he's not all but he landed it right there branch is doing a real good job he's putting rock hold in danger and Rocco oh he teed off on him oh my god Rocco is in trouble this is a real fight oh my god he's taking rock hold down that's how you know rock holds in big trouble I brush hard to take down should have stayed standing maybe but he lets him know he could take him down god damn this is legit and he just looked over his friend and waved and said I'm okay or his coaches corner but he didn't look okay he got hit with bombs man you never okay when you get hit with those kind of bombs you might not have gone out well you're not okay she's fucking him I'm a so much different than boxing these two fights highlight it like you do out you guys barely know who Mike Perry is right yeah but meanwhile he's so invested in that fight chaos right in this fight it's a fucking chaos in so many different ways 118 to 110 I'm not gonna get a room or a fucking weekend a delay bird she's very nice lady I can't say anything terrible but that's where it is she's always very pleasant show he's waves it says hello I mean just cuz I don't think I agree with her in boxing yeah not mad lady at what point do judges get removed for poor officiating two good questions that ever happened well back in the old days the Nevada State Athletic Commission wasn't being run very well bob bennett the guy runs it now as an animal he's he's on the ball he's really good and he's really smart and he's just a real easy guy to talk to it to and you know mission though yes yeah he's yeah he handles all that stuff so most likely he'll probably be looking into that let's do they ever get booted though if it's not corruption if they literally just think this guy sucks at making decisions do they ever get kicked out like you've used to many times good question I don't know enough about boxing about I know when there's a bad decision and I know names that I keep hearing but it's not like I know MMA judges that was it like that's it this is graceful score disgraceful and has she had her as another yeah they're just some terrible decisions in terms of what I think about the call oh look out for the knees son start a trip branch down Luke Rockhold super strong super-strong top game branch might be fading a bit here nope branch still looking a wing some shots one of the things that branch thought was a big factor in this fight was his boxing but he's got to avoid those kicks especially the left one man the left ones the big one for Rockhold and he'll do it off the switch oh that's a nice right leg kick he'll do it off the switch and he's got a nasty question mark kick his question mark kick is what he used at crack Bisping with cuz he hits you with the body shots like over and over and over again and then he gets you reaching so he throws one like this to the body and then at the last minute he whips it around over the top he's nasty with that really good with that it's like one of his best techniques that in his left power kick that left power kick to the body it's just so good he stopped cops to philippa with that left body kick as well oh he went jump it round kick him nice straight left he said no no he certainly looked like you recovered yeah you've recovered for sure oh he just clipped David branch with a right hook look Rocco does not want to go out like that Bisping fight see here's the clinch what you're talking about huh see it's just way harder to pull off this is still much scrambling in MMA and looking for takedowns and stuff Luke Rockhold get in the back get in the back oh shit David branch almost goes down Oh Luke Rockhold on top very dangerous on top super strong and branches tired as fuck man Rockhold looks like a surgeon here branch is doing a good job that protected him one thing Rockhold's gotta watch out for is his legs bridge is not in the hens Oh Gracie school what's his motive and put him up against the cage when he's madly smash through all that can't move he wants to just hold them somewhere in that makeup dude look at that shit yeah just smash him Rockhold came on strong towards the end of that round there's nothing more claustrophobic than washing that when someone's mushed up against the cage hmm like that could be by Johnson fight that it's probably most claustrophobic I've ever been watching a fight I was that was one of the worst ones ever there's an art to Smashing against that friends keeping him there and landing shots and wearing him out it's mashing them it takes you back to when you're ten years old like that's how I got beat up when I was a kid like you're just helpless in a corner dude that happened to me when I was 14 that's what hurt wrestling this guy took me down in the locker room and he was like gonna punch me in the head but he decided not to because it was so easy for him to take me down he just grabbed me in a headlock I didn't even know if we were fighting like I didn't know what was going on like we were looking at each other and he was talking some shit and I wasn't exactly sure like what we're gonna do and then all sudden we were grabbing each other and he just got me in a headlock and threw me on the ground and held me there and couldn't easily punch my face in to this day I owe him a debt of gratitude changed your life he did change my life because he made me realize like oh my god and then I had a friend my friend Steven art oh we know he was a wrestler in high school and I was already doing martial arts then and I just had no idea how easy it was for someone to take me down and we went outside we went outside on the grass and it was like I could take you down easy I was like no you can't he's like watch the boom I was like fuck that try again boom I was like oh my god I gotta start wrestling so those two events led me to wrestling class I wrestled in high school and I was terrible I was probably one of the worst wrestlers in high school history I got one one takedown I would never take anybody down I was always afraid that I was gonna catch a knee and my teeth so I would just sprawl on dudes that took down foo they try to take me down that was my game plan but regular people when I'd get in a fight I would take them down and I always felt like I was cheating but I didn't care because you use wrestling yeah I go you know what I haven't give a fuck if someone fucks with me I'm a double-leg them and then I get like twister cycle I'll punch their stomach I did that just a soccer player he was talking shit in school and I took him down how does he think that it would be cheating I thought I didn't think it was real fighting like then so when I saw hoist when I saw hoist no see - I'm like oh shit you could take dudes down and fight that's that's legit he's hurting that leg by the way Rockhold is really hurting that leg both guys are hurt in their legs Rockhold has been landing a bunch of hard leg kicks on branch - this is a serious fight no I think he's been he's been hurting branch is like oh yeah but Rockhold's hurt - man this is this is a real fight very good fight is it funny now like a fight where two guys take each other down it's like totally standard like you had no kids today would ever think that would be cheating that's how you fight mother yeah if someone takes someone down like oh shit ground a pound kids know the moves yes I control oh you see fight videos just street fight videos where someone takes someone down and they tap like that's like the understood move now it's little arias but look if people can tap in street fights the world would be a better place yeah because if someone he leaves you alone after you tap and they let it alone like you two guys agree to fight and then someone taps and then the guy who respects the tap that's good that opens yeah I hope it does I hope it happens more often I guess the fight to begin with though yeah you know you're not signing the contract some guy fuck you Geoff exactly exactly boom so it's a coup some of the craziest shit is girls fighting because it's so primal especially when they don't know how to fight yeah Nick grabbing hair and just screams come off realization of all is wailing at each other see the thing about Rockhold is he's so used to this shit because he's in the gym with DC and Kane doing this so like there's very few guys they're gonna have the kind of clinch game that Rockhold's gonna have and the kind of grappling like grinding skills that Rockhold's gonna have because he's been doing it with these fucking monsters yeah yeah a lot of fool mouch ah not good for branch super bad for branch let's see if he gives up his back and trying to get out that's that's super dangerous don't panic let's see if he panics he's got to figure out a way to defend himself look at the back give it I was back give it up his back it's gonna hang come from oh you got that back oh yeah a bad place to base flatten this is terrible plenty of time branches in a world of shit dude Rockhold does this to everybody man yeah he gets on top of you and he just smashes you it's so impressive mr. Vito look at his top mount no he did it too leo doe lyoto machida O'Brien to our wheel kicked him in the head member oh that's right dude branches in serious trouble he's gonna flatten him out that's a serious mount man that back mount is out of control his mount and his back mount or seize his top game it's just fucking ferocious all branches done yes done did he just rescues just covering up dan's given a lot of chances here he's taking a fucking bad be tapped out to tap to tap that's it tap strikes tap two strikes great fight fuck yeah that was a great fight dude Brock holds top game might be the best in the fucking division he might be better than Romero he might be black shadow yeah he's a black ball under who I don't know who they're um it's not um oh it's an agent Dave Camarillo how long has he been okay is the Camarillo still in a cave no I put a lot of guys trained with them still a lot of guys still go over there peace yeah wolf through it somebody that's a joy would you suck on that no I wouldn't would you put it in your mouth no I wouldn't girls would some girls would some girls want to get pregnant with that spit get your pregnant I used to defend the fighter boom I got a text message from Vinnie Sherman fucking Adelaide bird again a lot of people are aware that alley Birds doesn't have the best decisions boom boom boom boom she's trending Jamie knows was trending would you ever know who's trending never not ever with me would you ever had any idea ever who's trending what was that would you ever have any idea who's trending no that's Jamie can't you trace different ways to like locally like I've had you guys go dude you're trending but I'm not it's like a fucking local like in Jersey I'm trying to compare to other Jersey people nice which is how does it work how do you how do you trend in Jersey I don't know there's a way to do it location wise like we get your hopes up in your lies off snowing to fucking cares Luke Rockhold put the beat down but I'll tell you what man David branch made it a scrap made a scrap for the beginning till Luke Rockhold war on him with that pressure that clinch and that wrestling - I'm telling you man all those years with Kane and DC I mean you don't get any better wrestling than that you don't get any better more savage big giant dudes than those two think about it Olympic class wrestler and the arguably arguably the greatest UFC heavyweight ever well who puts but who helps Kane like that because he's obviously he's heavier than Croatian not much not much DC walks around all the time at 235 240 you know he'll he even said he was feeling kind of slim like this time after the fight you know we did commentary last weekend and he said he was usually he'd be like 235 by now but he was lighter than that I think he was like 215 or 220 or something like that but he'll get up to 235 so it Kane's 240 so when they're in the neighborhood of each other like 5 pounds difference with a world-class grappling like those two guys have they're just going to war constant it's always a problem though for big guys guys to 50 and above finding training part sure a tough Jitsu schools man it's tough we don't have very many big guys we got right now in my class I think the biggest guy 200 pounds it's crazy that's it what a fight man huh I'm not crazy Luke Rockhold I'll tell you dude when that guy gets people down they are not getting up he has one of the best fucking top games you don't see a lot of tap out student strikes a lot of people don't do it they don't believe in it a lot of people have said like that's a bitch move I don't think it is even even a little bit I think it's a smart move when you're getting hit you're getting fucked up and you know you're not gonna recover you know and the fights over there's no need to take an extra shot sure if you know that you're done just tap but it's seen as a c5 or service well a lot of people like George st. Pierre that's one of the things that BJ Penn was taunting him about how he tapped with strikes against Matt when Matt beat him Matt beat the shit out of him and clipped him with a big right hand early got on top of him Bangla and then GSP tap two strikes and BJ was like I would never tap the strikes but really maybe some of those career fights he should have yeah if you know you got nothing left why not yeah get out of what I don't know that's a bad try I'm thinking it's its best because he's saying it's his fight today I think he feels he should be fighting for the belt not GSP oh are you getting credit for taking that and so on in that first round yeah he was in trouble dude he was in trouble for sure that tight clone stopped the strikes yep this this is what stops everything man his fucking smush game look at that step over mount made no resistance and getting that mount he just overwhelmed branch branches couldn't keep up that pace you know Luke Brock holds I mean he's a reason why he was the champ he's fucking world-class November Madison Square Garden well he's so he's telling GSP to back out well there's people who would still think that GSP is not gonna make that fight yeah there's a lot of people think that GSP is crazy now and he's lost his marbles one didn't keep delaying it well because of the time lapse thing and the UFO thing that he kept talking about aliens like he was obsessed with aliens to the point where they wanted to leave it out of one of the UFC countdown shows no way he talked a lot about it yes yeah he's trying to tell us we're not listening there was some he talked about it on my podcast man talked about uh he thinks that like sometimes he'll he'll like be missing time and it'll like be somewhere else it wasn't comfortable listening to didn't you pointed out to him that that was some kind of a trauma yeah well that's one of the main signs of trauma you know loss of memories one of the big ones you know when you start talking about missing time and aliens like whoa okay why would you think it would be aliens when you got hit 800 times like he was hit more than 800 times in his UFC career was like nah I'm fine with that aliens are fucking with me dude damn it's crazy maybe it's true maybe it is imagine if we were like we're joking around about it I mean while every night while GSP sleeping his body freezes the room fills up with blue light little dudes like fucking walk right through the walls when he's like no don't take me again they want that perfect super athlete GSP DNA they take him there and then fucking they have a whole Under Armour lab and space and they do an anal probe in him and then he turns around and goes I am NOT impressed why is it always your but man that was playing with your butt but I think they it's like that's how they test the blood see what you're eating mmm plus tip I know it bothers us I bet you could learn a lot from the shit dude oh dude they started giving poop samples like that was more accurate than than piss I mean we have no problem with piss samples right oh shit shit okay shit cow pee in the cup everybody's alright can't believe you're making me do this but I'll do it like what if ups made you shit in a bucket yeah cellophane the top we found a new there's a new blood drug test but we need your shit it's the only way really no way you're gonna this shit and we have to have at least four pounds of it getting the friends to shit in the fucking cap the wall twice and you drop down like a fucking demon take a shit in my bucket and climb back up there this shit listen you been eating good like you eat a lot of fiber like you can you shit on come and smell they'll be like steroids sniffing dogs there's just a fucking bagel in they start eating your shit this puppy and when when he was little like as the shit would be coming out of his butt he'd be turning around trying to eat it like dad was cut he's like taking a shit with that no like puppies are weird man they smell shit and they they're so they're their babies they think it's food yeah they don't understand that's a bad move literally like soft-serve ice cream coming out of his ass is like a thousand times stronger than ours yeah but they don't think it's bad you imagine what shit smells like this smells so bad they like it it's like it just they just flips out of like it's a defense mechanism well no they like rotting bodies too don't ya dogs find like a dead beaver some shakes they'll roll around in it mmm they're like like it on their skin it's we're supposed to like it maybe we've been brainwashed and to not liking it because we're supposed to eat bugs where I was supposed to eat insects right what's a smart thing to eat right whenever you know I mean we wouldn't need to go to supermarket if we like bugs which is he bugs we just try we are only up to a certain point like once you can make shit there's no need to either many more well you don't think you know stealing insects yeah I was listening to a lecture about this what they were talking about okay no it was Terence Mckenna that's it was and he was talking about we used to be insect Devore's and so that reward system is still in our consciousness that's why people get super excited when they catch a bug I'll give you like that's why people like those butterfly catchers they're like they collect butterflies and shit and they capture I'm like there's a whole like group of people you know you can't truly eat them like no one like now you know I like people don't like trophy hunters yeah like it's gross you go over there shoot rhinos and put them on your wall collecting butterflies is totally fine nobody gives a fuck about butterfly they kill them once they get them right yeah well they don't last long anyway yeah so that's like actually like I guess the mindset but there's people they like collect them like serial killers all right and they have these butterflies pressed up on the glass and I've beautiful killing all these bugs it's like they're like trophy hunters but for bugs that's one factor on your well anybody out there fighting for bug rights well I'll tell you when it could happen it is possible that it could happen someday with with with there's a bunch of different people in different parts of the world that he crickets and cricket protein is like really rich it's very good cricket protein is very good for you yeah cricket protein powder right there people are starting to turn towards crickets for animal protein for vitamin b12 for a lot of things and a lot of people that might have like ethical issues with eating animal protein don't have it with bugs like maybe insectivore will be like a thing like people don't want to necessarily commit to being vegan but they don't want animals to suffer but they're cool with eating crickets like that that would actually be a good health move like you could get a lot of really rich protein like look at all the fucking look at all the shit that's in in like in crickets like how many crickets how many crickets you get out of a tenth 100 was the ten gallons of water they're gonna be in there anyways so for a hundred gallons of water you get 71 grams of crickets versus 19 grams of chicken I don't know what this means I don't know there must be protein protein verses or the amount of weight of body mass of the animal because I would imagine crickets use very little water right there are creepy little they used to create that much yeah as water used to create that much protein right whereas like cows drink water chickens do like they need actual water how long before some asshole comes out tries to defend cricket rights it'll happen and we'll stop with robots as soon as we start making human looking robots that do shit for us somebody will start to say you have to treat them a certain way it may or may not happen a robot right well you know there's a real problem that if we figure out that plants have consciousness and they know that plants do have some consciousness do they really yeah they know there's some communication going on between plants it's just not what we think of as consciousness first of all because it doesn't entail moving but there's there's some sort of information it's being passed on in fact plants have chemical reactions to being preyed upon like plants plants change their flirt their flavor profile like they'll make themselves disgusting for animals to eat just based on whether on an animals trying to eat them so if something eats them it changes the smell of all the animals around them or all the plants rather around them and then they change like for the acacia bush they've studied these things when they go downwind like one will get eaten by a giraffe and then the wind will catch the other trees and the other trees will become inedible to the giraffe it's files it's crazy there's I have my stuff trimmed off so I'm like that fucking did that hurt everyone want to smack me in the face I'm good plan it's a good question like what is pain though right because our pain might have to do entirely with movement in our central nervous system which plants definitely don't have so even though they're a living thing they might have consciousness but they might not be experiencing pain but they do know that they have some crazy rep relationship with fungus and that the fungus are extracting minerals from the dirt there's like mycelium under the ground and they have some sort of relationship with the root system and there's a whole community and this like exchange is going on and like these ecosystems of plants like when you see a jungle we think about a bunch of individual plants but they're all working together they're all like synced up in some way that we're too stupid and self-centered to consider plant it gave me the creeps I like a fucking creepy how the fuck out of a plant because this do this bugs there's so much about that I don't get in the fungus they really do freak me out anybody thinks the understand plants look at venus flytraps okay that's a plant that kills bugs look at this fucking plant in I want to say Ecuador is that where it's from there's this plant that looks like a flower and mice and rats go around the edge of it because it's it smells sweet and this smells like rotting rotting meat in there and they fall in and this thing closes up on them and they absorb it and eat it they eat rats that goes right there check that okey back that up so I used to sell venus flytraps you can remember that shit look at this this mouse is like man that smells good whoops I'm in there now I'm dead so it gets is it slippery on the side there's a plant thing it's just super slippery like the mouse it has a delicious smell it's an ax a frog bitch boom Venus flytrap eats a fucking frog son oh and how does the Venus flytrap actually eat it crush the death what I'm trying to eat it it's like just a react the just the reaction and they just die and then somehow just like fertilizer just feeds it but it's an accident like never ran the fell in that plant that could be just like a glitch in the design yeah just falling in and end up err ends up being fertilizer anyways well all sort of changes in plants or in animals is all like natural selection right so there has to be some random mutations and then some of them stick and then the plants one finds another rat it's gonna just smell the place up or maybe mice were eating it and slowly but surely figured out a way over millions of years to trick those fuckin mice and into can starve to death how they died oh they get absorbed by the plant where just is there I don't know some sort of a digestive breakdown I just digest the mother alive something I want a shit way to go it eventually dies in there with a frog at the with the Venus flytrap I didn't even know they could eat a frog that's a fucked up way to go ya plant clamps down on you as if you're walking John they need to try to breed gigantic ones of those two and why can't they if they couldn't plant them in your house that's something besides Rana that was the craziest I was thinking about getting crocodiles at one point new Venus flytrap that's gangster John breeding giant ones yeah big ones big one hire some scientists um some what do you call those dudes a botanist tree ologist yeah a tree side that's actually a great idea someone should do giant ones that's your security system you can't grow em here but what you don't as an animal what a dick you must feel like when a plant catches you so fucking humiliating badge if you were walking through the jungle it's probably tardes I'm caught by some plant that I didn't know about yet because there's like hundreds of thousands of different species in the Amazon and there's places in the Amazon that people just don't go this is no one there and if there are people there like these uncontacted tribes they find these villages like what the fuck are you doing here and they're like what are you like there's people to this day that are like these uncontacted tribes in the middle of the Amazon I read somewhere that 90% of the bugs in the Amazon don't have names because they just evolve so quick they just can't keep up with the evolution I don't know if that's sure and I know there's a bunch of bugs that don't have buttons but I'll tell you this when I went to coast I got tricked into cut going to Costa Rica once I thought we were going to Costa Rica party Cancun I was thinking King coming the whole time going to Costa Rica as a bunch of people when I'm thinking Cancun Cancun I didn't know we were going to the jungle we went to the jungle and went at night to sleep in the jungle a mansion in the jungle nice mansion I can help but still you're in the middle of the jungle and at night holy shit I just doused mice I bought all the off at the Navy after that a village and added like a little convenience store I clean them out cuz I'm scared of bugs and I didn't want to really let anybody know that I was a big pussy about bugs I got I got tricked into going I literally died I used off as gel in my hair and put it all over my face cuz I knew when that Sun went down it was gonna get nuts even in the mansion you worried about getting we're all hanging out outside of so hot and the mansion has open ceilings it's open air oh dude it was a complete nightmare but my point is at night every night we'd all we'd all sit in front of the pool and all first you'd see all the frogs coming out of nowhere and that first night it was so trippy the guys that live there good you're gonna love these frogs don't be scared they're the ones that are gonna save your ass all these frogs or everyone and all of a sudden the bugs just start coming out and it really is like Braveheart it's a bunch of frogs and you see him you're not the weight and can you just see him just going after bugs it's just a war and the guy the guy that lived in the house that was watching the house because you're gonna love this it's just chaos what's that therefore any for me any bitten by just eating the football what's preventing that I was cool they didn't even come around me but I swear only once did I ever see a bug the same species that were all diff that look like mosquitoes that look like centipedes that look like stick one they were all different and it was all open air - right so they were flying in your room and shit dude I could talk about this one hour but they tricked me it was a night I was it was a night mayor because the people that liked it they're the kind of people that have a giant like spider mouth lands on their shoulder don't give a shit if you would like Costa Rica if you want to move there you're a hundred percent one of those guys that doesn't deserve a net around you you slept in here so you hung in there but no one told me to bring a fucking net number now let us bring your own net what a shit the first I walked in there soon as up soon as we're driving in this bus through the jungle I'm gonna my yeah how many days was a nightmare every night wasn't night it was a nightmare but I had to keep it inside cuz there was girls and I was single and I it was like a slasher movie and so I didn't say anything I just knew it I'm like damn I thought it was gonna be like King Kong shit so we get we get to the mansion we get to the mansion I have and they go you're rooms they're your rooms they're everyone's got their own rooms there's a couple couples they had a room and as soon I'm already tripping out go fuck when the Sun comes down holy shit I'm a big gigantic vagina when it comes to bugs yeah like moths scared the shit out of me I'm a big pussy and we're going into the jungle that's all I was thinking about oh my god oh my god so as soon as I walk into my room I noticed that it's all open air and I look up and there's about 40 50 bees in my room 40 50 because a nesting in your room they're just flying all over the fucking place so I dropped my bags and I go downstairs and the guy that's watching the mansion old Vietnam vet white guy who left civil all those guys who live down there they leave their jobs they leave their family I try a new life than they hate it and now they can't go back now they can't go back as they look they left everything yeah but anyways so I went downstairs and I talked to this Vietnam vet I'm like is there supposed to be a bunch of bees in my room like I just turn on the ceiling fan on low don't turn it too high it'll make just you just want it to be uncomfortable for them and then in a couple hours they'll be gone they don't like that little breeze I'm like okay I'm thinking what about at night when the bugs just flood in and it's all you need a you need a net to sleep in my shit what do you get those it was a they're usually sold out you know and they were sold out there was no net so I slept every night every night I first of all I was complaining about the bees I told her how to let it out I held it in and I said dude that you guys have bees in your room they go yeah we got bees too I'm like oh my god so I started complaining about bees and then a girl goes okay captain be watch we get it you don't like bees and then at that point like fuck I never shut the fuck up no more peep out of me no sorry cause you captain be watch cunt is the appropriate response yeah yeah so I never said shit I held it in man every night was a nightmare I slept in a sheet like completely covered you could just hear the bathroom again if you like that you don't you don't care about bugs so they want crazy shit like a bathroom when you open the door in the bathroom there's no walls and there's no ceiling it's like an outside bathroom why they like that shit they like that shit know people that don't mind bugs if you like the jungle that means you don't mind bugs you're that it's like there's like I think 60% of the population that'll mind bugs 40% are terrified I'm terrified you're that guy that pets Hornets i watch videos inside that pet going on you - there's a guy who will gently stroke wasps and hornets he's like really fucking creepy fingernails but he touches B that's prime I great as fears be every night nightmare oh did you ever go to a jungle do you have again in my life did you stop a much off on me completely doused it so he actually does this point probably has it looks like I'm not stinging him like that what Pryor's dose there's probably and Japanese Hornet there away from the nest but this one may not have a stinger but this guy said he does it on the nest I've seen guys petting them oh yeah this guy kill em in Costa Rica no problem that might not have a stinger he fucking looks like a stand to me p-put those things honey on their finger and it just fucking it comes up the things trying to jack him man he's trying to sting him though yeah he's just avoiding it he keeps trying Jack I wish I had those powers I wish that was a pill that could make me feel like that why would you want though that I would take some pharmaceutical get forget rid of your the fear of bugs like you've got to be on it every day yes what if the shit hit the fan North Korea blows up the United States next day blows up North Korea we go to war with Russia we go to war with China this place is a disaster but you can live in Costa Rica still it's safe you just got to deal with bugs Eddie I would go I would deal with you know it good job you would adapt but I couldn't bugs it really it's a really weird I don't know how anybody can be comfortable around them I don't get used to it I have silverfish in my apartment they fucking disgust I was not with things that creep on your heart I was doused i doused myself every morning with fresh coat that make you feel creepy I don't give a shit no I mean like did it make your your body feel right no it's worth it bugs didn't one night I had too much on me maybe shower wait did I put it all over my face all over my hair in my balls I didn't want to get bit in the dick there's other stuff lot you know what lidocaine is like yeah it's like a numbing cream they put on I had a bad sunburn once like real bad I was in Mexico and I was sitting out on the beach and I was not paying attention and I didn't realize how bad I got burnt my back wasn't on fire I mean it was like serious serious pain especially if I start sweating and so I got some some of this lidocaine stuff and it says like only put like two pumps of this shit put on your back course I put like 13 pumps I put it all over my back because my back is in agony and then like an hour plus later I started feeling like shit like nervous like sketchy like shaky and I was like oh my god I've got like this is like almost like a like a cousin of cocaine you know it's like it's doing something to me it's not like getting me high like I'm like no no I felt shaky and creepy don't have sex I didn't want to eat anyone doing what right right did it go into your skin right bro but makes it numb that's like the thing it's a numbing cream my dick would wilt with it when I was a kid I my problem when I first started having sex young I was 13 my girlfriend was 13 she talked me into it I didn't want to have sex I was cool with dry humping but I was cool with that I was really aggressive it took like ten months to get to dry humping it took a long time but once I got the dry humping I would not she would not we were done we know they've got the automated a big wall we plateaued but my problem we ended up having sex and there after the tenth time she started crying and I asked her what's going on she was this is no one I thought it was gonna be like I know what the fuck I did wrong so I told my brother was older and he was really experienced with girls at that point and the first thing he said is well how long you fucking her I said I don't know minute 90 seconds I don't know cuz dude that's why she started crying dude you got to hold that shit so I had a problem I was premature ejaculation like that was my big problem so so uh my brother gave me this cream called it was called stay hard shops it was called s sta just without the Y hard and I use that just you know so I could last a couple more minutes remember guys would always say that there was talk about that so yeah the reason one of those guys could do that they put this shit on their dick so don't feel anything yeah that's why they could fuck so long yeah five minutes for me then my shit just went right through it first came I was fucking yeah I was getting blown me and my friend were hanging out and I had my dick through a Hulk doll and my friend is blowing me I didn't know what come was so I felt that come coming so I ran to the toilet and stood over it nothing happened it was a real dud this dude that I know that was in the porn business told me that back in the day they used to literally inject some sort of chemical into the vein and their dick average yet they use to make their what is it Java yet they still do that but it can fuck your dick up so bad it can turn purple or black because the blood doesn't leave Jeff I think I think it's cabbage yet yeah I've talked to guys who have used it and they said one guy said that his dick almost would died I know no no I think he needed to have the blood drained but he had a real problem with it he said he wouldn't do it again when I got so bad in the porn industry that they got their own like form of you solder the business would collapse can you imagine go back to those 1970s days when John Holmes had a limp snake yeah he's trying to like shove it in chicks or are molla remember are bola he looked he was the fucking the worst-looking guy ever but John Holmes isn't that the guy with the giant dick yeah a tiny they Johnnie y-yeah all medications have invented doesn't isn't viagra the most effective that's the one that works the baddest I heart it's bad for you I mean there's a side effect that you did work to get worse yeah but now wonderful mean but the side effects of it like pretty much knows yeah but how many people are dropping dead of that are people dropping dead by Agra was it's a you know a fibrosis from this coverage act is one of those ok rejected what is that what spin penile fibrosis that sounds like a decision it's like we would know what the fuck that is to form penis shaped looks like maybe it curves down that's good damn there's some chaos tonight I guess we missed a bunch of chaos so we found out the Brennan job is a fucking genius genius he's a soothsayer is that the word he's a he sees the future it's a prognosticator he's dead right he's right he couldn't he couldn't give it to golovkin unless he killed Cannella I wonder what the general public thinks about the decision whether or not they think it was a good decision yeah we're insulated I wanted to hear that interview but yeah he doesn't speak English anyways right now I forget what he thinks when I would have heath course I'm sure he thinks he want I would like to see I don't think he thinks would it be said but what if he says like you know what I didn't win he deserves it as a bad decision what if he said something like that would be ballsy that's a ballsy move guy someone said that recently in the UFC right yeah there was someone who was that mmm it was a he won a bad decision and he's like you know what I didn't win yeah who's that I don't know man I see too many fucking fights are you gonna be there on October 7th for sorry fuck yeah beautiful fuck yeah Vegas yeah hmm it's gonna be insane man he's training like a fucking machine I'm sure he is holy shit his jiu-jitsu is sharper than ever man you know it's gonna be a great fight it's very fun very interesting fight big step up for Kevin Lee yeah he's a he's an animal he's a beast he's explosive he's fast he's got a really good rear naked choke he likes getting the back and putting anacondas and body triangles he likes that he likes that we were super well-rounded you know yeah and surging he's like a surging young guy you know only like 25 but you gotta kill Tony to beat him you really do you gotta kill him he's a savage there's no way he's he's gonna fight to the death does he rent the same house every time when he goes up to Big Bear does he do it now at different now yeah never see Tito's place I think it was still for myself a while back we just work out at his house to just turn the garage out turn it into a little jujitsu room and we just fucking work she's still fighting Tito yeah he's got a couple more fights going on he's supposed to fight Chael Sonnen again and he wants to fight Chuck Liddell I think it's the interest in it yeah he needs that cash Tito used to have the sweetest setup up there he had crazy big log houses like two of them and one of them as fighters would stay in that he's training with one of them he would stand and he had a whole gym set up with a full sized octagon the whole deal was pretty fucking dope it was for sale for awhile I don't know if anybody bought it but Tito was one of the first UFC fighters to realize that I just fucking hit up the big bear man get that working up there it's worth it how old is Tito I would say now he's probably 37 38 I feel when you dope I going to hold or find a hole titles that I've been aware of like 38,000 you know when you do a camp up there you feel like you've done everything right everything you can so mentally for just being up there yeah right mentally yeah you think like I'm doing I'm up in Big Bear that's like there's nowhere else to go that's the spot right there's that as high as you can train in California Co it's smart you don't want to go any higher you like I said the the best guys now most of the time they try to work at sea level and sleep up high is that way for endurance is that what glove gun does he doesn't work out him big man no I think he works out whatever the fuck he does yeah doubt that shit because that guy went a hundred percent all 12 rounds and he wasn't tired at all at the end well for sure it's definitely beneficial the question is is it the maximum amount of benefit it doesn't need anymore it could be more max maybe maybe less we know what Big Bear does by watching glove good they're doing it the new way might be better but who's proven that let me see a fuck let me see a high level fight like that let me see 12 rounds like that oh you went down you trained at sea level and then slept I mean I could see that working but we already know what the glove kin style works we already know that you know that you know it's a good point
