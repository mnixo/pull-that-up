the girag and experience okay do they have a list of enhanced breasts for women's MMA um no II this I'll need to ask somebody this is this is too long of a google search I need to call up a Big John McCarthy or yeah you can't can't kick the bottle but you can grab it it is weird like you guys grab yeah guys do what they call oil check excuse me when oil check is sometimes middle the grappling the guy will literally have his fingers deep in a guy's asshole just digging in there and you know it forces the guy to move forces gotta move in a way to get away from that grip and I don't I don't think it's in I don't think it's illegal it's not I don't think it's illegal in wrestling either I'm gonna start making MMA butt plugs no that would just shove something deeper in your ass you have to have like a protection but what if you do a little at but the problem is you need movement like you're needed you're asking to be able to move so anything that you do that would like protect your asshole would be restrictive it would be like it would restrict your ability to move left and right it would be a miserable yeah yeah I would mess with your athleticism to oil checks legal what if it's like like this though like if it's a lie that's just a button will enter duck down no they explain dickin things in your ass I need to find out if this is yeah oh so what about this one oh I gotta go to the bathroom I care that here's one where he gets I checked yeah dudes do this all the time yeah Christoph's is in ski so I was on camera he says oops wait this is uh Rudy Ana yeah I even said something on the end of it um one guy actually got a rape charge from a wrestling match apparently what when was this seventeen-year-old Jerome hunt faces 21 counts of rape and attempted rape each count carries with him up to 25 years in prison Hunt's lawyer Mike Butler crank claims that complaints came from fellow parker wrestlers who were simply victims of a legitimate wrestling move Butler just filed a motion to move the case to juvenile court on that court document he lays out a a lot of information presented to the grand jury before they indicted hunt on the rape charges while he's indicted on the rape charges Wow former state champion wrestler Jerome hunts lawyer says that all but two of the incidents reported happened in the Parker high school wrestling room before the practice during last year's wrestling session before practice before practice before practice rape yeah it possibly came from a wrestling move called a butt drag or skinning okay before practice what is this black dragon before practice it's not something illegal or not being taught it's being taught all over one accuser even testified to a grand jury I didn't take it as a sexual move I took it as him just messing around well huh who charged him then a prude hmm this is interesting because that is the oil check is like a legitimate wrestling move if that's what he's doing it's like people have been doing whether or not you think they should be able to do that I don't think they should be able to do that but people have been doing that for a long time like an actual legitimate wrestling like but look up oil check right find a video for oil check wrestling because that's something that guys have done like for a long-ass time I mean I would even say that's like gladiator days I'm sure they did that well it's not the most effective way to control a person so it's not like something that someone does for a long time or on a regular basis it's just when you're in a wrestling match of someone what you're trying to do is win and if you spend time fingering is but you could have been doing other things that would actually get you to win the match so it's not like something that comes up all the time I call that a Friday whoa but um some people uh you know some people who don't know wrestling who found out that this guy's oil checking people and you know maybe being a dick about it hey Johnny's oil checking people know fine just what is this no no no not checking the oil crisis oil oil check off his image we'll check wrestlers checking beaches just listen google oil check wrestling that was about it I'm gonna but drag you so you ain't safe yeah yeah see not a maroon 5 songs I see she's a totally legal see how he's doing this and the referee is not getting angry at him and no one's going to jail see this is it is actually a legal wrestling move that guy putting his hands in that guy's asshole like that is totally legal not only is it totally legal it's so common who made this video like who it was like you know what I'm gonna go today like I said you it's it's common but it's not the most common thing like wrestling it is all about those yes it makes sense it's not the best way to control a guy all the time though so when it does come up guys do it but it's not like the only way to do it and it's not like if you if you concentrate on that when you should be doing something else you're gonna lose the wrestling match so it's not he's what he's doing is using it as a whole he's literally trying to grapple by holding on to the guy like that he's not necessarily pleasurable he might be sexual we might also be trying to inflict pain and discomfort yeah but it's been going on forever oh those damn oil checkers so to take this one kid and calm a rapist was that stop but the other thing was then said door before practice that's a problem with the before practice that that disturbs me like we have been waiting away in it like hours before practice like five minutes before practice or you're warming up you're in the locker room like hey check this out you going over techniques like what exact what exactly is going on and how many counts did say like it was a just one person think they said like 40 Jesus yeah it's sorta people or 40 40 edges well I'll read it again well I shouldn't talk about this kid by the way this was a several years ago okay 2006 actually but uh 21 counts Wow yeah that if you know I don't know what that kid did so I'm just talking out of my ass but if the kid did what's in those videos you better go watch those videos because there's videos of people doing that but drag or oil check forever it's been going on for as long as it's been wrestling it's just not the most effective thing to do always not in every man but shits pretty fucking common yeah you know minute but plugs that doesn't help dude stupid idea it's just gonna go deeper in and you bleed OH so I'm gonna stop the guy from holding onto it I get a little tail on the oh good idea make it a decorative but pull that out and the guy gets embarrassing to tap them yeah come be like a loud pop Oh pop cuz I sorry about that uh okay take that yeah well there's me did I hear that um Brock Lesnar's thinking about coming back to the UFC he adds bullshit oh it is yeah it's bullshit so there's one hype story where they were trying to hype it up because the WWE was saying that Brock Lesnar was in Vegas they made a big announcement but it's really just a publicity move to talk about Brock Lesnar's wrestling appearance so there was a little bit of hype on that some guys tweeting me that the butt drag does not go into the butthole um yes it does sir sometimes the butt track does not go into it but yeah they're saying it said there's a nerve back there no it's pulling yeah you're right but tell me that dudes don't sometimes put fingers in people's assholes hey man if I can for sure do because I've had it happen so shut your mouth if I haven't tell me yeah don't tell me that oil checks don't go in your asshole I've had it out snaky creepy fingers do the oil drag you want to rat on a ground well it's not like you're gonna like just
