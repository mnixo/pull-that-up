it's going on with all the cigars which cigars those are not cigars those are marijuana oh okay I figured might be something like that it's marijuana on the outside it's called a blunt that's what the young uns call it it's know the term blunt that looks like a look at me of course you know it yeah I'm not as schooled as you I'm not as cold as you and the elicits even though that's not it's not an illicit now speaking of illicit we've got some meat-eater bourbon some elk shank bourbon yeah pears with it's a good name pears us beavertail pears with you both of those things thanks to you elk shanks a great name for it because that was like one of the rare foods like if you talked to most hunters like said have you ever had elk shank on Cebu Coe they'd be like what most most hunters have never eaten that no I've been and it was revelatory to find out about it and then it's the thing that I became I started to proselytize you know I found out about eating it because my brother found out about eating it because he has this old cookbook called the LL Bean it's like the LL Bean wildgame cookbook by guy named Angus first name Angus if I remember right and he's got a shank like he's got a shank recipe in his book for antelope shank and so we started making it that's a for anything about wild game cooking the e4 I picked up on is that you could you could have everything or you could say like hey here's a recipe for a white-tailed deer heart right and someone be like but do you have one for a mule deer heart if I explained this to you before no well they're interchangeable and that's deer that's thing so obviously like when we did our cookbook I tried really hard to steer away from things that would be elk recipes deer recipes and just take it from a cut basis look is excellent but have you messed around with any time that's great quite a few things from it it's really great we got away from saying that like here's an antelope recipe or whatever because it's just like the cut is more important such as all these ungulates like horned and antlered game what it is is more important than what it came from so by putting elk shank on that bottle I'm kind of like going against my own advice but if I just put shank people might not like you're talking about well it could be lamb shank but it's just a cool name we're gonna do a limited run of those where we write all kinds of weird stuff in there that it pairs well with is it good just good stuff yeah it's five years old we get a taste yeah what's gonna get to get some ice and some glass you know I took a long I took a long break from breakin oh how long I just slowed way down on it when my kids were born started to be born and then gradually me my wife have gotten back into it gradually you know if she link yeah working together yeah right which is really crazy I know we haven't tossed it Yanis took a year off booze Wow for no just for like whatever Yanis whatever Yanis I came here he had some reason for it he had a birthday once and took a month off then he had a birthday and took a year off he's got four months to go for the end of the year and then he's gonna drink yeah but he says his family I think his wife was explaining to me there's a lot more disposable income around the house now she's like I have realized how much booze and takes up yeah how much all those fancy beers that what's fancy beer dad's up there that's an interesting thing yeah people don't think about that when you run your tab at the end of the week and then add that times four and then at that times 12 that's real money yeah and I know if you remember you probably it's when you're younger where like it was just it was an impossible you'd have leftover booze in your house you know cuz every just drank so much right right right like now we're like such grown-ups in our pantry we have like a little liquor section right and you have like all there's you know yeah I have a wine fridge yeah but in the old days you couldn't because you just drank it and it's gone right you know yeah I want to interview you I want to interview you for a minute okay okay how comfortable do you ever tell your listeners about about the comedy stuff you're working on or do you like to keep a big secret I tell them some things I don't like to give up premises cheer sir you don't like to give up premises I mean punchlines all say like a subject working on you do or don't give up subjects well I want to gauge you about a subject that we were texting about about the yeah missionary yeah yeah yeah I just don't understand this is good I know that you will I like it I know that you will have I'm knowing you and how good you are at what you do I know you'll have done it but don't understand how you could have had a novel thought about the missionary yes who got killed just to refresh people's map desert there's the island East Sentinel what's right by my fish Shack there's an island called Sentinel island really yeah no one lives on I've been past it many times and if you haven't been shot at it's North Sentinel island goes north sorry north central islands and my Shack is East Sentinel North Sentinel out you know better so you should tell people what it is I want to go to your Shack a little bit really yeah let's let's next one instead of a hunting trip let's do a fishing trip I would love to have enough talent come out there we'll catch some halibut so you weren't you're not interested bringing your family yeah we kind of take a family approach okay more and more no well you could flip it over you kids like flipping rocks and some of the rock my youngest loves fish loves it Rock flippin she loves everything yeah she's really big enough how young is the youngest nine oh yeah perfect but no I want to get like I just can't I can't I've thought about and thought about it and I can't think now that I don't have faith in you I just can't think of what the take would be yeah the problem is if I explained it what the take is it would fuck up the bit for people that haven't seen the bit I'll show it you night tonight I'm going tonight I can't wait to go see but I just wanted to explain off air I'll explain off air okay yeah are you feeling good about the bay yeah yeah it's a fascinating subject you know the guy commander Maurice of Adal Portman you know who that guy is no mmm he was the the pervert that traveled around from island to island measuring guys and taking weird photos oh yeah Roman soldiers I read the I read a big piece about this which actually sent to you to see if you'd read it too yeah I read you said you read everything about it yeah I read quite a few things about it because there was a guy on Twitter his name is respectable at respectable law and he posted a whole series of things he he'd actually been studying this case or this this place before because of this pervert guy and so when this man this missionary showed up on that island he was murdered like he knew all about the history of this island so he made like a chain of posts on Twitter which were really interesting informative and then I started going deep into it I've read the guy's journals the journals were hilarious my life the kid that got killed know the guy the pervert the English the English pervert in the 1800s probably wrecked like that whole area for those people because they had this idea of what white men are and these people don't have a written language and they they just have stories so they probably still have stories of these white men that come carrying diseases and want to touch your dick and measure them yeah so this is a guy he was into that's one make sure I remember this right he was in like skull morphology but with sexual organs well he was it's hard to tell what he was into but it was it's so obviously perverted like it's it seems like he was doing sexual stuff with these people trying to legitimize it by yeah I mean like yeah just measuring them and and and doing detailed descriptions of their sex organs and know who's really into that that seemed very important to him and he sir he survived the island I can't say I wish to go with my new uh my new Laird Hamilton turmeric coffee or the whiskey I'll mix it up back and forth yeah it's really interesting it's like it's like soup yes with the off unit it's very good for you too like I said that turmeric you know people think of it as curry because it's a great spice for food but it's a it's a potent anti-inflammatory very very good for you know it's good so I'll have to wait and see what your take on today are you I'm almost done interviewing you um are you drawn to that are you drawn to that idea I certainly am which idea that you would get that you'd go and hang out and spend time with yes uncontacted people well you've done it in what what part South America were you out with well yeah they're not on contact not seven not on contact but yes some tribes that like the CH Amane and the Micucci and whopper Shan are all tribes in northern South America who have long long history of contact and engagement with the outside world but individuals who can still very much like hanging out with individuals who aren't that old who in their youth were very much like living a hunter-gatherer lifestyle with it with a mix of native materials and also some Western materials this is Guiana Guyana and Bolivia people that you know people that would still make their bows from native materials people that grew up using canoes that were made like hand you know hand dog dugouts using plant toxins to kill fish but also like you know also other very modern stuff like one of these guys that I really appreciate hanging out with I mean the guys got an email address but I might have told you the story before he's got an email address but he also told us about we interviewed him on our show on our podcast and and he's telling me about how there peccaries their white lip peccaries aren't around right now because there's a shaman in another village who's jealous of their village for being so prosperous and has locked their peccaries up inside of a mountain and that they're training their own shaman to free the peccaries from the mountain and you can shoot this dude an email so right explain a peccary to people Oh people here are familiar with the javelina yeah yeah a javelina is a collared peccary and then there's a no run in little troops of that you might see anywhere from 1 to 13 or 14 white lip Packers are a bit bigger and they'll run in groups of 200 Wow yeah they'll ravage like like these these people have a somewhat agrarian lifestyle they they fish and also have farms scattered throughout the the jungle and that was coming in ravaged farms and groups of you know like I said groups of 100-200 I should be honest here and say I've never laid eyes on a white lip pakery there's a third peccary Chacoan orchha cohen peccary that is much more rare than the collared and white lipped ya picture this Jamie there is the white little buggers yeah those those suppose he tastes a lot better than collared peccaries 500 collared peccaries in in West Texas and in Sonora Mexico are they native to West Texas should someone bring them in no no collared peccary czar native okay like portions in New Mexico Arizona and West Texas so they look similar to has a javelina no it is a javelina in the collared peccary of the same damn they got you you'd appreciate this because just knowing your tastes they have a large breast with a nipple on the top of their back like what would be the neck of your ass has a nipple whoa that's their scent gland so it's an actual nipple that someone nurses from nope but just a scent gland oh I'm sure your your trusty Jamie Jamie yeah you'll find a picture hey somehow related to pigs know people like people like to think they are but they're not Wow oh there it is yep see that yeah how valiant it's when you clean em you need to cut that away because it really like stinks to high heaven is it like a Tarleton gland yeah I'm sort of a scent gland very powerful smell and you usually smell them well ahead of seeing them and they're really um they're they're pugnacious you know you can call at them with a and mimic the sound of a distressed young one and they come in ready to kick your ass I saw that on your show yeah and you and Remy went boho they run it where Emmys got a lot of experience messing around with these things it's funny because they're pretty popular like you know they're good to eat but they're they're much more popular south of the border Mexico it's much more common heavily no they'd make sausage out of them and stuff yeah yeah they grind them up make sausage on cook use various things like you know I don't know anybody maybe some ones out there that like actually takes like a back strap off of a javelina and throws it on the grill but you generally do like preparations with them we were you cooking a fair bit yeah you'd have to break down there got to be tough right not they are you couldn't just grill one you couldn't just grill one they're lean you got to cook them down but you can see how you can see what it'd be popular the hook to me it's a pretty like it's a nice little bundle like of meat right and and I think that in some areas like especially you know in Sonora and elsewhere people aren't likely to like turn their nose up at good protein sources mmm there's one thing that's like it's one thing it's like made for bowhunting because I think that with rifling and people do hunt with rifles not shot with rifles but it's a it's it's a little bit it can be kind of feel like a little bit of a gimme hmm because they're not you got to get very close to them before they're concerned about your presence mmm they're tough they got toss you know they can kill stuff and rip stuff and they have like a they're almost you know you think of the most like I would imagine of all the creatures like a snapping turtle is Least Concern with things that like a snap which world doesn't care about anything until it's within six inches of its face and javelinas cut there's not that exaggerated but kind of have this like their world sort of seems to end at 60 yards but they don't care what's going on outside of that buffer and so so you can kind of creep up to them kind of walk up to them when you see them did they see bad are they like pigs but they seem to have very poor eyesight they seen that poor eyesight and having an amazingly varied diet you know they'll eat like I'm Eve you laid there long enough they would come up and eat you yeah ain't my friends dog oh yeah huh well my friend's friend Doug Stanhope my buddy he lives in he lives in Arizona was he pretty tore up about it yeah well they were you know they hate those fucking things they they just piled this dog ate the neighbor's dog and apparently it's not too uncommon yeah it happens flesh eaters yeah they'll fuck up a dog they're weird you know that's like one of the things that yeah I think it points to a certain amount of sociopathy that I have but when I hear about someone losing a cat or dog to wild creatures I don't like my initial instinct isn't to be sad mmm I see what you're saying you like well that's part of the because you kind of view you sort of I have this view that yeah I have this view of that that sort of like settlement and development v Wildlife mm-hmm is a global problem right and one always wins like the destruction of wildlife habitat always wins and then when you see it when you see it play out like that in some ways you kind of like hope like Bryan Callen who you know yep recently you know that kid got a um kid is like a nine or ten year old girl got throwing up in the air by bison yeah you see that yeah and Yellowstone yeah and by no means this cow hope to see someone you know especially particularly child get hurt but he's like you know they still got it [Laughter] got within 15 yards of that thing yeah ridiculous yeah I think I keep think about making a shirt that says them Yellowstone National Park habituating wildlife since 1877 they do it is weird I've only been once well I went once when I was a kid but I went once recently with my family and it was very weird that you could take selfies with elk yeah these big herds of elk are so confident that people won't shoot them when they're in like the public tourism area that they just go and hang out near the vending machine yes I'm getting a Diet Coke and there's an elk like 30 yards away from me it's so strange that's that's a little bit in line with what that's a little bit light with what I'm talking about talk about like that when I hear someone's dog got killed by a coyote yeah well you know again man I know it like like my brother has this little dog he just loves and they're inseparable if that dog got carried off by a great horned owl in a healthy great horned owl could carry this dog off it's like a little shit and dog I would feel real bad for him so with that sad I do have this thing where you kind of root and I do feel sad when I see like in a place like Yellowstone this is where it gets a little bit weird when I see and wild animals especially animals that people hunt for when I see that they've lost their fear of humans some people would look and be like oh this is like what naturally they should be like okay so this is animals where they have had to give up their human that were they've lost their human fear because we've given them this wild place I see old-timey oh that's a good dude you're fair not I'll call him he is a good guy people see in in like Yellowstone Park atmosphere you see where wildlife becomes habituated to humans and they feel like they're seeing something more natural right because outside of human hunting they often don't have that feeling anymore I look at that and I see that it's like um to me it feels like something's been subverted and something's wrong with that situation yeah because it sort of depends on how fresh your perspective is because I mean people have been hunting you know people have been hunting in that area I mean at least 10,000 years so then we take like a hundred year break and the animals become very accustomed to people it's it's shocking how quickly they can get it back and oftentimes those same elk that live like the same elk that will spend their summer in that Park will migrate out of there and go into national forests and on ranch land well then they'll be where where they can be on it and they know they cross that line so the same elk some do could basically walk up and touch their we'll just something in his head switches and he enters and they enter into a new mind space when they leave and they're still exposed to human predation and if they wind you they'll bolt oh yeah it's it's it's shocking how it's shocking degree to which they the degree to which they can keep this together in their heads and it's also pretty surprising how quickly they adapt like I would imagine if you were to open up this would be a pretty controversial idea about throw it out there let's say you were to open up hunting in Yellowstone National Park I think that it would probably be less than a year I think like a season of fall hunting season would have them right back into the same mindset that all the other animals that live with human predation their sort of attitude toward people I think they very quickly get it back it makes sense but yeah people going up in petting stuff again like referring to cow his idea is that like people have gotten to where they confuse national parks with amusement parks and they feel that the animals are like on Rails you know their entree yeah if it is then it's like they're programmed to do a certain thing but also wow it's one thing that I've discovered over the last seven years thanks to you and thanks to you getting me hunting is that most people have no idea what it's like to be around actual wildlife to sneak up to them must be you have no idea about their sense of smell like to see an animal wind you and then just fucking bounce to see that and to know that like you're dealing with some superhuman ability some like impossible to imagine with the confines of your own biology what these animals can do and when you're when you're out among something there's no cell phone service and there's it's just footprints and trekking your way through mountains it's amazing I mean it's it's not Yellowstone what Yellowstone is and what anything like that and zoos is the worst example right but when we think of animals like people always tell me like like cuz you know I have a his dog I've run with him on time and he's on my Instagram it's like everybody loves him he's the sweetest dog in the world know that dog if you love dogs how could you how could you hunt animals and I'm like well then that's not he's not an animal he's a dog he's a pet he's a science project an animals of wolf and animals deer that's an animal what a dog is they don't survive outside of us if you don't take care of them they won't know what to do they'll hope that the dog catcher comes and gets them then somebody rescues them they're not wild animals it's not and has it almost has less to do with how they're raised and more to do with their ancestors like their their biology has changed they've literally been bred to something different they're fucking science project do you see my dog he's got floppy ears he's a sweetheart everybody who meets him he drops to his back he wants you to rub his belly he's just a sweetest dog in the world that is not a dog I mean it's not an animal there's not an animal like that that would ever exist out in the wild cuz if he sees another dog he's a clue well you're my friend he's not like checking you see if the things gonna steal his food or or robbed him of his mates or your kill his babies yeah he's a it's it's the result of a 20,000 or whatever your experimentation with the domestication of an animal yeah so most people they say they love animals they don't even fucking know any they don't even know what they are they see the caged animals at the zoo they see the animals on a rope that they take to the dog park they think they know what an animal is they don't even have any experience with it we've been so domesticated and so isolated in cities most people especially most people that have opinions on this shit you know people that live in rural areas I mean you know that you live in Bozeman and Bozeman is you know surrounded by these areas that are just fucking completely wild I mean if you're in Bozeman you can drive an hour from your house and then you're around bears and do an Eagles I mean it's a completely wild place but people that are in those areas people around Boise Idaho for example they have a totally different idea people in Wyoming I have a totally different idea of what wildlife is versus somebody who lives in Santa Monica there's a video that just somebody sent me today of a guy in Thousand Oaks is on his Street and he's filming a fucking enormous mountain lion I mean it is huge it's a big boy it's like 150 pounds and they're in the car and they're looking at it through the window and him and his son it seems like her are filming this thing going holy shit look at this thing is right there in the street a big-ass cat and he was saying that like somebody was filmed somebody was feeding it apparently and they're trying to figure out what you want me saying to you I'll send it to you but this you know that's that's super rare I mean that's a real wild animal it's super super Rael that that anybody would have any kind of experience with one of these things and most people that are talking about animals they just really don't know what that even means they're just saying it yeah I think there's developed up like a pretty big cultural division between people who a pretty big cultural division between people who kind of like live around and work around and deal with animals and people who view them or think of them as very other a friend of mine who's a biologist this is all there you go yeah nope no I'm sending you another one I sent it to you it's it's from Thousand Oaks I just had to you know that's a recent one too Oh buddy man who's the biologist with the Forest Service guy named Carl Malcolm he might have heard on our our show he just sent me a paper there was about kids attitudes to wildlife and it was comparing rural people's attitude and knowledge of wildlife kids with urban and suburban attitudes about wildlife and you can see the input of media when you look at this thing because people who live in a urban or suburban environment when they tell you the top-of-mind wildlife they know about its non-native stuff like lions yeah they're likely to know like what's what's an animal right and an animal be like to be like a giraffe right and and people who have a more rural or remote viewpoint will be are much more likely to look when they think of wild like to think of things that they interact with mmm you know and not like the things that are on your mobile above your crib when you're a little baby and it sort of points that and also there's a slight tendency I got to look at this more carefully but it's a slight tendency to have negative feelings or think things are dangerous or bad the more urban you are in terms of native wildlife to more recognize it as like a negative or bad thing and what they're pointing to is again I want to look at this much more carefully and pardon me to the authors authors if I mess up I'll just looking at this morning what they're pointing to is the the the stirrings of there being a greater acceptance of decreased biodiversity hmm meaning that you're kind of like okay with the bad things having gone and we're focused on like what are animals well animals would be like a draft and hippopotamus and the things that that Disney tells me about not like opossums and raccoons which are kind of gross hmm you know get that video look at this fat boy play this thing it's collar didn't it yeah it's got a collar on it uh it's interesting I could see that better there's a lot of them out here that have collars we got a photo that we just had commissioned and she get here soon right yeah it's huge of the the big cat that they photographed near the Hollywood sign yeah it looks like it's staged I mean the cat is walking right by the trail camera in the halls that do the sets of those famous uh yeah there's a National Geographic yes yeah yeah that's a good picture yeah we got one printed on snap that picture right there I mean come on man that's crazy that is a goddamn crazy picture it's a giant cat like who the forearms on that motherfucker well that saggy stomach but it bums me out looking at that collar there was a conversation that you had on your podcast about shooting a deer that's wearing a collar and I'm with you I'm with you 100% I don't want to shoot a deer that's wearing a collar I don't it's wild as fuck they caught it when I was a baby and they just waited and measured it and then let it go and it didn't have a collar and I saw that deer I wouldn't think twice about shooting it but if I saw it and it was wearing a collar I'm like I'm out nope totally but there's a really funny thing and you might have you probably caught wind of this or know about this is that it's a big deal yeah to shoot a duck with a band on it everybody knows is cool as shit like I know that everybody wants to shoot a band most people listen this don't know that it's cool as shit if you get a band duck why is that well it's a little bit social science because long ago like we used to not understand this can little bit tricky to explain we used to not understand how migrations worked because everyone he only knew what they saw okay and there wasn't someone who was sort of like coalescing all of this information people would know very well like you know wherever you live along the Mississippi River okay and you might know very well that like in November shitloads docks that you haven't seen they have been here all year are coming from the north and going to the south and you knew that very well you knew that ducks moved you knew that they move through here but you didn't put all of the you had no way to put all the pieces together over time we wanted to understand like animal migrations better in one of the early this is way pre collars like GPS collars and then pit tags and shit we started this banding system where you could go and catch a duck and it's we're in its nesting area there's like times a year when it's really easy to catch ducks one even catch them when they're young and you can catch them when they molt so people would go out and put a band on a duck and you'd go you could go up and in the Arctic or the Upper Midwest anywhere and throw a band on a baby duck and that band would have a phone number on it and you were encouraged to when you got a banded duck it was like they made it be that it was a good thing and you were encouraged to call that 1-800 number or whatever the hell they were before 100 and given the the band the band number and then we started to really with like great detail map out flyways how ducks migrated like that the ducks in on the Arctic slope and Alaska tend to follow along this path and they tend to end up here at this date there down and you know whatever they're down in Texas all of a sudden are they're down in Southern California and they're hanging out in rice fields around Sacramento or whatever held is we started to put together this whole detailed picture and it was one of the great achievements and wildlife biology was what we learned from the duck banding system so I think that over time it began like I said it was sort of like social engineering where people were taught to think it was cool and you would wear and a band you would if you had a lanyard you keep your duck calls on this still goes on if you got a lanyard every duck calls on any banded bird you get you put that band on your lanyard I even met these knuckleheads from North Dakota who have a lot of bands on their lanyards from banded Birds they've shot and you bet I do that's a lot of bands he goes yeah not one of them's reported mm-hmm they think that it that it remains more pure to do it I don't know that's the dumbest shit ever it's the dumbest shit I wish you guys did like why would anybody want to contribute to oh I don't know you'd have to have like a calling component to your show and we would call one of these dudes and have an explained in greater detail I remember thinking like that's the most that that's the most fucked up thing I've ever heard but yeah I'm think you'd want to talk to that guy it was like he's like yeah they're all unreported anyways I don't know if it's like an anti-science but you love to argue did you talk to that guy about this you know it was long ago I could take where I was standing I was in my brother's kitchen - Miles City Montana beneath this crazy chandelier he bought online and I remember everything about it I don't remember when I if I challenged him on the sense of being proud of having not contributed to our scientific understanding of waterfowl migrations and why maybe it looked like a sort of anti-government sentiment like some black helicopter stuff okay regardless yeah it's a malicious shit it's cool to have bans and I have like in my sort of I have like a box where I put important stuff to me but imagine if you had a box of deer collars dude there's no way if eyes I wouldn't put into your cock that's what I'm getting as like those are cool but collars are not and we had a friend there's a there's a friend of mine who's a she's a does a lot of carnivore research and other research projects named Carmen van Bianchi which is a cool name but she says that you know I'm someone that collars animals and I even think that she's like when you get one with a collar on it she said it was quote I we talk with us here today or she's like someone has already got the best of them that they become tainted when they've been held by someone else and that's a little bit how I view it we're like a wild animal you want to imagine it being like the wildest wild animal and once it has a collar it's like someone it's it's all sloppy seconds man yeah well isn't that why the allure of Alaska is so interesting because it's one of the rare places where like if you run into a caribou in Alaska there's a high probability that never encountered a person never it doesn't even know what you are like you've seen videos of hunters walking towards caribou with like their bow on their head you know and the caribou is like what and the fuck is this you don't even know they think that bow is a rack their assumption in areas where I've been particularly like look up on the Arctic slope know if that troops have seen a lot in the mountain ranges - in south-central Alaska when they see your movement their assumption is that you're a caribou that's like that scene I can't you can't get in their head but their assumption is that like oh I better go check it out and then I'll circle downwind to make sure it's not a make sure it's not a grizzly or a wolf or whatever but they're like you know uh something the weighs a few hundred pounds couple hundred pounds whatever walking around probably a caribou and it's like come on over they come to you until they can rule it out but they're good garius they want to find each other and it that sort of thing like winds up and giving you a little bit of a sense of uh it makes you feel a little bit bad for them right that they're not tuned in like a mule deer is yeah and then you realize this is like living like that I mean these things are these things that could migrate you know they migrate hundreds hundreds of miles have Hulan into access tyria yeah axis deer in Hawaii is the most perverse strange but necessary hunting that I've ever experienced yeah you know what and they don't have net like on Hawaii they're not deal with natural predators zero it's just it's all they're just like they're just very in tuned to like their predator being people yeah I imagine that they probably care the same way that we carry with us and a sort of natural abhorrence of snakes you know a natural abhorrent of spiders I would imagine that they come from a that you probably know a little bit better Meeks you spent more time with axes deer they probably come from a very predator rich environment I'm guessing Oh originally yeah and lately and carry with them a real high strong sense from having dealt with like very efficient predators Tigers you know yeah they evolved to get away from Tigers like they got to be high strong there are the fastest things I've ever seen in my life I have videos of one where I shot at this one from 55 yards 15 yards away he sees the arrow coming 15 yards away from him and he's like dogs ooh it's crazy it's like they kind of understand that things coming towards them kill them yeah because they are hunted 365 days a year because they have to they're so overrun there's some somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to 30 thousand deer on this one island with 3,000 people and you you've never seen herds like this before it's crazy I want to bring you it wasn't that when I hunted them years ago and I remember that the area I had been had been hunted very very heavily did they come they come doles or Heinz Heinz it had been hunted very heavily stags and my god was the from my from my very limited perspective from a small set of experiences that happen over a couple days it seemed like the pressure on the males had been extraordinary where it seemed like you would see a hundred Hinds per stag know if that's common there or not no it's not it's um I remember you like that very surprised by that it's almost 50/50 when you go to these areas that are you know in lanai and apparently the same thing with maui they're everywhere there's so many of them Maui has a real eradication sort of program underway which is controversial right very controversial but they're also selling it there's they're selling venison sticks and venison jerky and there there's companies that are establishing these they're establishing these conservation efforts where they're going out and they're shooting X amount per year like 6,000 per year which is like doesn't he put a dent on yeah is the goal of radication or is the goal just the limit limit them but they eradicating them from the Big Island somebody had put them on the Big Island somebody had taking them from one of the other islands and put him on the big island and they had spent millions of dollars to eradicate them forgive me stop me if we spoke about this before but there's a kind of an interesting perspective that someone gave to me about Hawaii where we have this list you know Hawaii just dominated by non-natives okay I might be wrong about somebody's been I don't think I am breadfruit coconut all these like all the major fruiting trees are non-native and so much of the wildlife is not native I mean they have like like surprising shit they have wild turkeys there's wild cattle pigs axis deer like just like blackbuck antelope running around wild horses chuckers pheasants just they hunt horses yeah yeah I was talking to a guy one time that snares cattle I don't know if he does it illegally or not but he snares cattle my mom's I guess over caught you know technically he'd be my stepfather but feels funny my mom my stepfather my mom's husband who she married after my dad passed away he grew up snare and white dear with garage door cable but they said they were like they were farmers and ate us eight and that was sort of his relationship was dear setting snares setting garage cable snares yeah and just using that as a source of they're just hungry you know poor but anyways in Hawaii right those were count those Islands were colonized by humans like eleven hundred years ago and those in some but now we have like Native Hawaiians or Hawaiians right and I've spoke with some Native Hawaiians who feel that there's this uneasy relationship between what we're regarding and describing is non native wildlife even down to pigs even though that their ancestors you know eleven hundred years ago brought the pig to the island and someone expressed me very simply he's like how can I be Hawaiian like I'm native one I damn sure am Hawaiian why is the thing that I hunt regarded as a non-native and needs to be eradicated he's like if we really want to talk about non natives I feel like that would be you right yeah and he was like and he was kind of pissed about this this attitude towards because these are guys that like to hunt need a lot of wild game about this attitude to access to here and this attitude to pigs and you hear the same thing out of Australia you're the same thing out of New Zealand which is guys who have this this difficult relationship with the things that they've come to hunt and the things have sort of been culturally accepted culturally accepted as as wildlife right where people you know I don't want to use I don't want to use environmentalists here in a way that makes it be that the the hunters aren't necessarily environmentalist but in ways where some people with what they would describe as an environmental agenda wanna see species eradicated the people have been interacting with 400 years in some cases like like in Hawaii in some cases perhaps a thousand years they've been interacting with it on the landscape but then someone wants to come and say we want to get rid of it it's not native and it causes like ton of tension where it creates a potato we're weird situation for people in in some of these places is that hunters have long justified their actions to the public as being that we're controlling right we're like controlling non-natives so we're doing a good thing but then someone says like you know I got in that better idea let's just kill all of them and then the hunter is like whoa we know they did that off I don't mean like that there's an island off the California coast it was filled with elk and deer what was it called I don't forget see if you find it isn't they Braddock ated all of them think they just machine-gun them you know just helicopters and just eradicated all of them are you familiar with the practice in those cases where they have a Judas animal yes that's a great article about or a podcast about that from Radio lab hmm when they kept sending this Judas goat Toit the Galapagos and he'd find the other goes and like they'd got them all down as Judas going where are my friends far can just keep keep wandering off and you know he's sterile so he can't breathe go there and he'd go to find these other goats and they'd follow the caller the GPS on the caller and find the new group of goats and they'd gun them down to that would begin to wear on a human we had a meeting with our kids okay we had a meeting with our kids Oh Santa Rosa Island yeah so Santa Rosa Island dude I was just I was there not long ago it used to be filled with elk and deer and people had sort of set it up Santa Rosa Island elk they had set it up Pro hunters hit Santa Rosa Island I mean in that case I would use professional not pro murderers deer murderers and this is in 2011 so as an earlier fairly recent thing where they eradicated all these animals yeah I was I just not long ago fished off there it's supposed to be amazing fishing the Catalina apparently is like the greatest mako shark fishing in the world which is it here's a weird one shark fishing all of a sudden you're an asshole it used to be with jaws like you caught a shark hey good get that fucking thing out of here they're gonna kill people yeah now it's like you monster shark's fin soup care about that don't you know there's global warming like everything is conflated it's all like piled on together like you what are you doing with a shark you used to be able to buy mako shark in a restaurant oh you still see it but there is it there is I saw thresher shark deer day on a menu I did a story I did a magazine story about this long long ago it was like it was Rome and I got out of school night it was like first like assignment I had to go write an article and I was ready for outside magazine and um this is 19 years ago man and there was a thing called Mako madness and it was this thing in Montauk it was funny about doing this this is in 2000 and I got sent out there and had never ever been in New York I didn't even go into the city I just flew into wherever the hell I flew into and got a car and stupidly took a cab to I didn't understand the I was very young I don't understand I took a cab from like the airport out to Montauk oh my god yeah how much that cost and I remember I remember like when I had to turn my expenses people like home what no but I just like I didn't know but anyway it was funny because I I remember driving along and seeing the is like the summer before and seeing this was like a year before and seeing the Twin Towers you know it was like my first ever view and I never saw that place again I never saw it again till after but is this thing called Mako madness it was like a shark tournament and traditionally had been like a contest to get the biggest shark and they would bet money on it and there was like the general registration fee so all these captains who had charter boats would join Mako madness notebook clients on their boats for Mako madness and when you had to you had to pay some amount of money to this probably still goes on you had to pay some amount of money to register your boat to be in the contest but the real money was in all these side bets called Calcutta's and so you could there was enough side betting going on around all the various captains that the biggest mako could win hundred thousand a couple hundred thousand dollars well catch the biggest mako but the sort of the fatal flaw in this tournament from a public perception standpoint would be that there was a category for just biggest shark and there's a category for like biggest Mako so people going out like at a time this is one at this is when shark populations are still you know and globally they're still on a decline but there was still a lot of shark bycatch from swordfish long lining and other things and there was people were getting very worried about shark stocks and shark numbers and at one time Mako madness there's a lot more Makos that people be register Makos but there had been some years where Mako madness had no Makos people were bringing in a mako so everyone would go out and just they make damn sure that like I don't want to come back empty so they would catch a blue shark cuz if no one caught a mako you still might get biggest shark from catching a blue shark and at the end of this thing man they had dumpsters they were not don't they had they would fill a dumpster with blue sharks and no one with you dude it would know it would go into a dumps but you can eat blue shark yeah well you can they're high in urea and just you know it's like everything else like yes you can so Mako is the most edible mako thresher can you eat a great white you know what's funny about great whites is there's a guy is a writer I love and he does all these fisheries guidebooks named Vic Donnell and like he's dead or live but I got all of his books he's got like Gulf Coast Pacific Ocean Lanta coast he does these books like it's like all the fish that you're likely to catch kind of like how to catch him and he what I like about he's got like a crowd quality section and his food quality sections are really funny and like the highest praise he can give some like excellent or one of the best right so do you look up snook it'll be like one of the best his headline for great I lurked in great white shark it says don't even ask but people feel that they'd be good because salmon shark good these come poor beagles like salmon shark have a very good reputation and Makos have a good reputation and threshers have market value and there's other sharks and other areas they have market value but those ones are like our ones that are popular table fare the assumption is the white that great white sharks would probably be good it must be somebody's eaten one oh I'm sure there's plenty of people who do beating them but at this Mako madness thing I can't remember the point I was getting at what the hell is that driving at but time I make oh madness Oh in this article I got into like the history of where like shark hunting and killing sharks came from is you're familiar with Jaws right well sort of the shark fishermen character and jaws is based on this like very real dude Frank Mundus and Frank Mundus used to fish out of Montauk and at a time Montauk was this premier destination for catching swordfish and big bluefin tuna and as those big pelagic fisheries had collapse from overfishing in the 70s Frank Mundus he'd go out and he'd just go out and find a you know he'd go out famously he would go out and find a beached whale or not a beached whale but a floating dead whale and he'd anchor up on that whale and catch big ass great whites and then come in and hang the bloody carcass up on the docks and he made necklaces with toothed sharks and shit and he became like the monster man or something of the Monster Hunter and started booking all these crazy trips where tourists to come to like holy shit I want to go kill a big monster and he's credited with having created this like culture of like going out and getting yeah I said him that's that's Frank Mundus I see a picture of her left dude so yeah he kind of like built this idea of like shark haunting and Bush in a shark bite in his forearm going back to that interesting forum ah something took a bite out of that motherfucker yes he's got the necklace yeah the dead shark and Frank Mundus kind of like like spawned this sort of thing where you'd want to go out and catch a big shark and hang it up and then throw in a dumpster Wow and people look at like when people look at that history they look at it being is like it's like in some ways Mundus and shark hunting was symptomatic of declining fisheries look at that picture of him and the dude with from the movie they're so similar look at that the black and white in the color next to each other look at that oh yeah was that guy's name the guy in the movie can't remember who's the actor's name that guy was fucking awesome what a great scene you know Moe Fallon yeah that's still his favorite movie I think it's great pretty love job it's not you're saying that the next time you see them have them convince you the jaws of the greatest movie ever great movie it's a great movie Richard Dreyfuss and come on the narrative of shark's fin soup and sharks being you know something that we need to protect that sort of it's a new thing so you only existed over the last decade or so I think so yeah it used to be if you caught a shark like good for you you keeping it from killing someone who's swimming as someone who's surfing the the idea of shark's fin soup and in its lure was driven whole new one-time warrior and Berkeley and we are at a boat launch we come off fishing and we've been out fishing for leopard sharks remember are the life aquatic mmm that's a good movie you like his stuff or no Bill Murray love him no I mean like the director Anderson what Oh what has he done besides that fucking uh world Tenenbaums okay yeah like that yeah yeah I think it's masterpieces life aquatic but uh in there they got you know that the famous shark and there's the Jaguar shark which is a good idea for a shark I don't like it exists but there are leopard sharks and we're fishing for leopard sharks we came back to the boat launch and there's a dumpster there and every cleans our fish and fills the fish guts and the dumpster I remember there was a gentleman digging through the dumpster getting out leopard shark fins and and heads and stuff and I took pity on him I thought that he was acting out of some sort of desperation and I said hey man do you want like a nice fillet I'd be happy to give you a fillet he's like no just why just the fins just to make soup yeah yeah have you ever had it no I've had it shark fin soup yeah did you enjoy it it was weird it was weird it was like it's okay it's definitely not worth eradicating a fucking entire species for no it's a little disgusting it's a little disgusting and I'm always reluctant like I'm always reluctant to yeah I'm a little bit reluctant to sort of oversimplify things around around harvest and animals and stuff because uh I think people can take it too far but if you've seen footage of people cutting fins I'm dumping the sharks in the water and kicking the sharks off the deck into the water dark and I think it but it speaks to something I think that seeing like live finless sharks going into the water speaks to something about just your level of care do you know me like whether you view something as as sacred yeah or not it's hard to see that the individual engaging and that is viewing it as as sacred and there's like ah you know there's a lot of stories about even like swordfish captains you know burning blue sharks and stuff an effigy because they lose so much their swordfish catch the blue sharks but to see people kicking them off it speaks to something about animal suffering it speaks something about like what is that person's view of the resource like - what - how do they respect it but it also speaks like a general thing where you don't see things wasted yeah and my mother saying about like one of the things that slowed in US waters one of the things that slowed thinning was just used to be able to go out and you could fill your hold full of just shark parts if you were a fishing cap then you could just be like ah it's gonna keep the fins and eventually they made it I'm sure something will correct me if I'm wrong here I don't think I am they eventually made it that whatever you have for shark materials in your boat on a commercial operation only a certain percentage can be comprised of fins and since when you're on a commercial vessel you're hold like your area where you keep iced fish is finite it's limited it want to be not worth it because it let's say only like 30 percent of your shark parts could be shark fins and you had to keep the rest it wasn't worth it to fill your hold full like shark meat and so it sort of de incentivized people to go out and fin in US waters mmm that makes sense I had it a long time ago I had it back in probably the 90s at a Chinese restaurant in the US or overseas yes pretty sure pretty sure was yes I don't think I've ever traveled overseas in the 1990s I barely remember it how old we knew first one overseas overseas sounds like yeah like old sailors I'm trying to I think I was in my 30s so Canada doesn't count as overseas no you could walk there nor because of like the darién you know gap in Central America like when you go to Argentina is it overseas it can be video you come from Florida dead nuts over Central America did you go overseas it seems like it's kind of overseas yeah seems like a bad term but you didn't you didn't have occasion to travel a lot no you're young well I traveled a lot from fighting and then all around the country when I was young and then I traveled a lot for comedy inside the country the same thing so there was a lot of traveling but like traveling to another country was like what am i doing good going over there farm oh really yeah it's just more more travel yeah you know that's the it took me a while to get used to the idea of traveling for a vacation but when you know the idea of vacations like going on vacation somewhere in Europe it would get the fuck out of here I'm not traveling for fun I don't like traveling I want to sit sit still yeah I got ever get a vacation I just want to stay put then I realize I you just swallow it just deal with the flight and the next thing you know you're in this really cool place it took a while for me to sort of adjust my my view on that yeah look you have a hard time taking leisure I used to I used to have a hard time taking leisure now I look at it like like sleep like you need sleep and I think you need leisure and I think particularly for a creative person for person who writes and comes up with things you need downtime like I just had a buddy of mine we were having this conversation about that we were saying that he feels like he's just working too much he's doing too much comedy he's not taking in enough just putting too much out not taking it enough yeah man that's a pretty good point yeah you have to it's almost like you have to think of it as a diet like what is your mental diet you know your physical diet is obviously very important if you're an athlete but if your creative person you have to have an awareness of your mental diet if you're just taking in sugar all the time just nonsense junk food and bullshit like your your brain is filled with uninteresting uninspiring thoughts and you know the same sort of typical narrative over and over and over again whereas if you can figure out a way to go to Thailand or something like that you go well these people who live in a totally different life this is a totally different way to live and it's just even if it's ever so slightly it broadens your perspective I can only really relax when there's nothing I could possibly be doing mmm and my kids aren't fighting house land I had to do this insurance policy thing I've told this story a thousand times but I haven't told you I'd do this insurance policy thing and and uh I like lay on my couch does this dude this dude comes over my house to take my heart rate and do a bunch of health tests anyways I'm laying on my couch he's got this monitor hooked up to me he's got to do it for a long time I came over how many minutes but it's like a long it's not like going to the doctor for a check-up or they just like take your pulse for a minute like he's really like checking your shit out and I can hear my kids now and then like a little fight flare up upstairs mmm and I asked the dude I'm like can you see that because all I could see that I mean hearing it me hearing that like now your heart but my brother brother Matt who's who's a very thoughtful somewhat eccentric person he's now says that he needs he's gonna sleep nine hours a night which seems like an extravagance but he's like done the math on it and he says if you're gonna measure me in terms of productivity I'll actually do more on nine then let's say six and you give me all those extra hours but those extra hours aren't as productive anyways I had a podcast with a guy named dr. Matthew Walker who's his sleep expert written books on sleeping and he talks about the vast amount of Americans that are under ested and and what an impact it has on your hormonal production on your body's ability to recover on your happiness and your your body's ability to produce endorphins and all these different variables that are extremely important to happiness and to productivity and he's like the vast majority of people are fucking themselves over vast majority in great ways increases the possibility of dementia and Alzheimer's and all these different factors if you go you look at guys like like Ronald Reagan like famously slept like four hours a night yeah got fucking Alzheimer's like it's it's really common with people that have a very small amount of sleep and they take pride in the fact they're always pushing the needle those people eventually the the fucking the bearings start going yeah yeah do you take caution to sleep I sleep a lot I get good sleep I'm very lucky one of the things about because I exercise so much is that I'm always tired yeah like when when I hit the hay at night and I get home from the comedy store I fucking crash I go down hard I get a good solid eight hours sleep almost every night that's good we're not when I'm in a groove of like like being careful about taking care of myself and and uh yeah doing like a lot of regular exercise how much your appetite for mood and your appetite for sleep the appetite for meat that's the big point increases great well my wife started lifting weights and one of the first things she said it's like god damn I want meat like all the time she's doing squats and shit she's got this crazy Russian lady who's her trainer so the lady the fucking Savage and they're just doing all these crazy squats box jumps and that kind of shit and she's like that Russian in the Rocky movie I do was on what's the call over the people go to like the clubhouse and roll rocks and shit oh like CrossFit yeah that dude was on to cross oh yeah man he's trainer in Russia machines in Rocky that I have out there the fuckin versa climber the first that found out about versa climbers watching that Rocky movie thing he's working hard that fuckin verse two climbers I'm but that's a bitch man you ever do that thing no I'd like to do you do 30-second Sprint's on this legs and arms yeah you're just pedaling and it's like you're climbing and you can increase the resistance for grappling there's nothing like it it's not true everybody hates it though but most people they'll gravitate towards the treadmill the elliptical machine your other thing they look at that thing I know the X is not fun you don't get long yeah you don't get lost in it it's horrible alright but it's amazing when you refer to like how you fill your head up like what you fill your head up if it's just like junk and sugar and how much time you have to process stuff one of the things I've noticed and it's kind of started it's begun to startle me a little bit is I used to find in social situations that I would be very interested in letting people know what I thought about stuff mmm Bieber shit I had no business talking about and I think that you see people like when you see like someone who's older and we have this idea that like old older wiser person and they're just taking in everything and they've learned to be quiet yeah people don't really think about the fact that maybe they're just like sick of hearing themselves talk that - do you know the saddest thing is those an old moron hey I want to say yeah by me I think I you need to explain like it's old racist Oh an old dummy the old person who has like ridiculous archaic views of women or ridiculous archaic views of society and culture and immigration and all these different things like a person without nuance an old person who's not learned from the humbling experiences of life and has not looked at himself in his own folly and and has a humorous take on it description and you paint a flattering portrait yeah man I think about it a lot I don't want to be that guy yeah I encountered a dude like that not long ago where we decided that we're gonna take our kids like we're gonna take our kids out to eat and I don't want to have to deal with any kind of like added noise and I was trying to I wanted to go into there's like this like truck that sells tacos it's called like El Oro day or something let's go to that taco truck and eat cuz I'm not talking about in deal with anybody my wife convinced me to go to this Pub so we go down the group I'm kind of like in the I'm already pissed off because I'm like kind of half mad at my wife for making us be in a potentially social situation and I'm sitting hearing this old man walks past me on his way out of the restaurant and he's got a do not resuscitate bracelet mmm okay he's like he's got a little walk you know those four pegged canes he's got a four pegged cane it's probably nickname for that and do-not-resuscitate bracelet and he walks out what his wife girlfriend whatever and she wanders off and he's just standing outside the restaurant and it's just killing me to know what that's all about so I grab my older boy and we walk out and I'm like you know I couldn't help but notice you have a bracelet says do not resuscitate what's that all about you know and I said do you just feel that if it's your time it's your time and you should and you don't want modern shit - like interfere and sort of what you imagined to be like the way things go and he explains to me is like no I go see things like he's pissed he's already pissed he was probably pissed before I talk to him he's like I don't want an oxygen I don't want CPR I want nothing and he goes because I was having a heart attack and they resuscitated me and broke two of my ribs therefore I don't want to be resuscitated I remember thinking like but but you were having a heart attack like the trade-off seems minor yeah but just like he was he was so kind of just pissed that they broke his ribs that he couldn't even see I'm like another way of looking at it would be that they saved your life but he said he just wanted to suffer his heart attack with ribs intact and at this point would just rather die than have broken ribs that's there or something like I don't know I couldn't even begin and almost that I thought he was interesting also that I didn't think he was interesting anymore such an unfortunate perspective because if he said it's not a great story but you said I'm saying no it is a great story because it's like if he if he said hey I had a good time it's you know there's only enough room for so many people that's what I thought I was gonna get you know that's what I thought I was gonna get in forward to meeting Jesus yeah I thought I was gonna get that so much so that I brought my boy with me oh boy because when I was looking at my dad would go out of his way to have weird people over to the house yeah I he it was important to him to expose his kids the weirdos so I was like come on son we're gonna talk to this crazy old man with the do-not-resuscitate braceland you like learn something about life my cell might not never mind never forget that guy trade-off of broken ribs for life broken ribs takes like a couple of months and you're fine yeah you might be like dude you're at a brewpub with your girlfriend she's going to get the car you don't want to continue this fuck like you just suffer for a little bit one of the things about growing up with martial arts is you're always injured so you don't look at injuries the way some people look at injuries you look at injuries like gotta go get this fish you gotta get it fixed I've had both my knees reconstructed I've had a bunch of she might have his reconstructed I've got a bunch of shit fixed you just get it fixed it's like I fucking tore this thing I'm gonna go get it fixed I don't view it that way Yanis had meniscus surgery Yanis patellas had meniscus surgery on his knee and what's crazy yo y'all had something to say about this this is kind of your in your world a little bit I developed an e a k-- that I had four months left of him no I don't know well now I don't know pregnancy weight gain at the time I would have told you no after this at the time I would have told you that my knee absolutely hurt mm-hmm and my knee hurt and the pain drifted around and it hurt all the time and I was acutely aware of the pain in my knee hmm and I had it built up and then I had made the mistake of having like a passing conversation with an orthopedic surgeon it was like oh you know is probably this or that it's you can fix it but then it then it got worse and worse and worse and I finally go down to a doctor to do all the scans and shit it's like you know you have some arthritis you could probably solve the problem with some physical therapy there's like a band that runs down from your hip and I think that's like flaring up and that's why the pain bounces around and wasn't to later two days later that pain was gone I said to Yanis I'm like man I feel like psychologically frail I feel there's a very I was like I feel it there's a very thin membrane that separates my brain from my body hmm and Jana said there is no membrane that separates your brain from your body and I I can't rule out now that um I can't rule out now that I'm like mentally pretty weak because the minute someone told me there's not actually a problem where I need to get a surgery like III like I I'd now try to feel the pain but I can't find it so it is a little corresponding like hiking or anything that has contributed to it we weren't doing it once it felt better well one day in the spring me my body Pete Munich went out looking for blackberries during black bear season and this is when I was really like thought I had a knee problem and we went out and we didn't hike a long ways we hiked maybe six miles and um and I came back and noticed but it's real mucky you know you're walking and your feet keep sticking in the market way and then your feet build up a layer mark on your boot bottom and then it comes off and then you're walking cockeyed because your other boot hasn't shed its boot mud layer yeah we had one of those walks and after that walk the pain went away for two days but yeah man I don't know fear being old and shit that's real my eyesight's going bad mine too I see you wearing those Lord glass and I saw a minute ago you didn't have me you couldn't bear to look at your phone no I can read that you had you had to like hold it unusually far away I felt was I reading like you that like like that I can read now you read that that's not a problem now you had a thing you tipped your head up and tipped your eyes down and held it far away I felt I do do that I do do that sometimes but mostly with my phone that's not an issue like I could read emails and shit the real the real problem is laptops like a laptop but with small text or reading that like that piece of paper in front of you that's fucked like if I had to read that I mean I could do it but I to do this talking monkey incorporated podcast called the drone yeah Jules really might release yeah it's uh it's just reality you know your body starts to deteriorate there's nothing he can do about it yeah yeah music as like all this like journey of life shit right yeah but he's all into like weird Yanis isn't too strange stuff like he thinks you can kind of like you can kind of like not address thing manifest yeah he just believes that he believes I don't want to put words in his mouth but I feel that uh this is the this is a long debate we have about psychological states I feel that you can have pessimistic thoughts but as long as you behave like an optimist you'll you'll get the same outcome meaning let's say you go hunting and you have feelings that like it's never gonna work out we're never gonna get one but you do everything right it doesn't matter what's in your head because your actions are such the only thing he doesn't like to entertain the negativity he doesn't like to entertain the negativity cuz he feels that but I'm like but what does it matter if we still hunt hard what does it matter if I feel like it won't work as long as we hunt hard it doesn't matter and I think that he feels he would argue that that mental state affects outcomes and so he applies this to all the aspects of his life having a sense of positivity I think there's a benefit to having a sense of positivity in the sense that you're gonna enjoy the experience more if you're always walking around pessimistic and then things happen that are good you know like wow look at that alright well tomorrow's gonna suck that was a fluke where is if you just appreciating the fact that hey Here I am living in America you know I'm healthy I don't have cancer like could be so many things worse that are wrong with me I could have been born with weird birth defects I could have been bored and you know El Salvador with no feet I could have been you know living in some fucking drug ravaged community I'm like this extremely unbelievably lucky like if you had given the opportunity to be Steve Rinella if you were some guy who was living in some terrible third-world country with you know awful drug cartel violence all around you like would you would you give to be like a regular guy living in Bozeman Montana in a beautiful place and have a healthy happy family and a great way to make a living like what I gonna do yeah what do I have you given me you're giving me patriotic stirrings which I'm inclined to I'm inclined to it that's why I got an American flag back there dude yeah be like oh I can have a TV show I can start a business yes just have children I don't think most country to go see they go to like great school yes for free insanely for down the road yes yes yeah I mean there's not a lot of places like that anymore because people have find those places and fuck them up and overpopulated them but there's a few of them left you just got to deal with extreme weather the extreme weather is the barrier for pussies it keeps them out you think so yeah the fucking Montana it's hard that's why we just tried to buy a Greenland yes you see his fucking post where he said I promise not to do this and he showed a picture of Greenland with a giant Trump Tower I looked at this guy's funny he might be an asshole people might hate them they might might be a problem as a president bla bla bla bla bla you can't deny that occasionally he is fucking hilarious no it is funny and I think that people try there's certain people that try hard to not see the humor in it yes I've retweeted it I was like get on with your bad self mr. Trump oh look I don't read my my Twitter posts I'm sure a bunch of people got mad at me for that but I don't read it I just post and forget it I just get out of Dodge I just leave little packages and I get the fuck out of that it was fine about that picture that I found myself zooming in trying to see what those people in those houses had going on oh no these guys look like they probably hunt well green that has so much natural resources and it's also probably a place it's gonna be an awesome spot to live in a hundred years when the fucking rest the world's on fire maybe wind up there man yeah well muskox we were talking about that yesterday muskox Jamie pulled up a thing a statistic on MUC socks muskox that the success rate for bow hunting is 100% in some units yeah in Greenland oh okay 100 percent in Greenland because you know they huddle you know they huddle up to protect themselves against wolves so they just stay in a spot when they see a threat which is great for wolves but not so good for projectiles yeah and I've hunted them before you know apparently they're delicious Brendan Byrne said that they taste like the best Kobe beef yeah so it's really it's tough but good and marbled yeah you know it's funny is the WoW I mean tough like yeah tougher but what's funny about um I I drew it permit like in Alaska the way they so try to find another way to approach this any American speaking of America land of opportunity any American can apply for a permit to hunt for musk ox in Alaska and what units are available to you if you're not an Alaska resident very and and I believe right now the only area that you can apply for a permit as a non-resident might be Nunavik Island and I drew a permit to hunt on to hunt musk ox on Nunivak Island I saw that episode yeah and hunt and then there the to pick Eskimo and a bunch people oh you can't say Eskimo but it was funny because I asked a to pick man who I was staying with I'm like you know I feel like I'm always told not to use Eskimo and he said what the hell else would you call me so I'm gonna say and and in in deference to what this man prefers to be called he's chupa casting explaining I'm Kubek Eskimo I'm not something else I think the Canadian folks you know to be referred to as Inuit indication the High Arctic yeah but then but I think it's created a lot of confusion yeah but there's just interesting that on this on this this stern Alaska coast along the Bering Sea he a to pick man was telling me that that is what he prefers to be referred to as chupa custom oh yeah but the way that we you know like we you know people consume wild game or talk about me cries like went when rating meets we tend to talk about tenderness or not tenderness right it was tough it was tender oh stop it was tender tender being good tough being bad I mean you've been involved in a hundred of these conversations he like this tubing males like we prefer it to be tough you know that tendon that like if you look at the spine of an animal the vertebra above its shoulder will have like a what's called a thoracic belong or thoracic process like that blade that comes up there's a tendon that runs from the top of those thoracic processes out to the neck and it allows like big animals it's really exaggerated on moose vice and muskox where it's like the size of your wrist this giant tendon that's moored to the top of those thoracic processes it allows this thing like to hang its head which I mean the head is 80 pounds or whatever and it hangs off there they like that thing well real chewy meat and they even would hook that they would cook the muskox they would basically like boil them they would take the tough parts of the muskox and almost like purposefully make it more tough but kind of like boiled like flash boiling it and they would talk about like this cuts good it's tough not we're so tender why do they like that did they despite a varied preference as well that's weird but I liked it quite a bit man what was funny is I gave a bunch of muskox to a Guatemalan woman in Seattle that we knew and I gave a bunch of muskox to her and she made me a bunch of tamales so I had Guatemalan style tamales with Moscow with musk ox and we made a deal where I gave her a bunch I said you can keep half of what I give you like make tamales and get me half the tamales so he struck a deal I had a freezer full of freaking tamales like rhabdo nice but uh and I would laugh about that that you know my kids would have Muscat sandwiches or muskox tamales and he'd go down to school with oh that's hilarious that was great my kids like freak out other kids at school you know like like kids at my kids school be like what's your favorite food my daughter like I like bear thinks it's hilarious that she's eating bear you know she she likes to tell people bear sausage it's my favorite and the other kids like what the fuck you know kids that have never experienced any wild game and my kids have eaten you know since 2012 when I started hunting they've basically eaten everything they've eaten elk they've eaten deer they've eaten ducks they've eaten wild turkey they've eaten everything what's there how are they viewed in their community like how are you viewed in that that like school parent community I don't know it's hard to tell because do you go to the event yes I got to go to one today yeah I'm a weirdo for sure but you ostracize friendly no I'm really friendly so like most of its all hugs you know like the parent like I'm a nice guy so when I see those folks it's all like friendly and hugs but some guys will pull me aside and asked me about manly activities because they feel like how'd you you're you actually allowed to be a man and you're everyone's neutered you know like so many guys are their wives are yelling at them and I'm off doing cage fighting events you know and where were you last week I was bow hunting and I was in the mountains with no cell service and so they might be inclined to be like oh I don't like that for like middle America rednecks but it's okay for you well they know me right now they don't that the preconceived notion and they know I'm a good dad you know I'm very active and I'm constantly around my kids and I take it very seriously and it means the world to me so like parents one of the moment the most important things that I find is good parents respect good pair they see that you love your children that's the interesting point yeah I mean if you find someone who's like a dismissive parent and is not interested a disinterested parent it's like one of the most disturbing and disappointing things if you love someone you care about them and then you find out they're a bad person or a bad parent you have to reevaluate your perspective on them because to me being a parent and my wife is huge on this it's like it's everything to her she will not talk to someone or hang out with someone if you feel like they're a bad parent and she forms her relationships with their friends based on whether or not they're good parents it's it's everything yeah if you're you know you're contributing to this community so when I'm around these parents you know I'm a nice guy so it's all friendly but they all have questions all these poor men that are stuck in cubicle jobs you know men men are tortured you know it's like that who was it the RO yeah most men live lives of quiet desperation yeah it's one of my favorite including Thoreau well he knew what he was talking about you know it's uh it's these most people are just living this boring-ass fucking life and I'm living this life where I'm telling jokes in front of thousands of people and then I'm doing podcasts in front of millions of people and then I'm hunting I'm gonna then occasionally I go off and do cage fighting commentary it's like a caricature of masculinity really yeah people get confused well it is when I smoke pot so it's like what's going on here one of the things one of the early things that surprised me about you is man I don't want to use that words don't want to be insulting one of the things that that's more yeah one of these is surprising about you but it's something that sounds like asshole issue is how serious you take being a parent because I think that someone could look like someone could someone could add a glance look like oh you know discussion of drugs and like dirty humor and sort of go like those are not congruous with parenting but you take soup you pay do you take parenting like extremely seriously well but you know I don't think you either you're not like you know you're not so concerned with people understanding a full package you need to spend shit loads of time telling everybody about how good of a parent you are yeah I'm not interested in that I'm interested in love you know and as a kid who grew up with sort of a deficit of it and it's very important for me to spread as much of it as I can whether it's through my friends or through children and to children it's like the most important responsibility because my friends would they're fine I met them they're grown up still figure it out on their own you know I'll help them when I can but but kids you know it's like you get one shot at that you get one shot at raising kids man you know it's not you can't redo it you can't go this one sucks let me rip it up and start from scratch like you have to do it right and you have to and you're gonna make mistakes for sure but you have to spend as much conscious time talking to them and interacting with them and really you know I like it I enjoy it one of the things that you get afraid of about damaging your children is that you would leave a legacy of damage yes like you can have I have all kinds of things that I did in my life in ways I treated people and I could say here name names right like things I did the people that were very unfortunate I wish I hadn't done it someday maybe I'll call them and apologize but if you when you damage your kid man man yeah you're setting you're like creating a string of decades yeah you know and decades of describes that they will do the same to their kids and it's also it sort of reflects how selfless selfish or selfless you are you know whether you do a good job or a shitty job you know I've unfortunately I have some friends that are not that good at it and you know comics in particular there was a I wanna say any names but there's a guy who was friends with the son of a famous comedian let me track that from and uh a guy who I know who grew up with the son oh yeah sometimes I get confused people talk about like my cousins brothers only I know I'm with you and he was telling me that his dad was a piece of shit and he hated him oh my god damn it dad's one of my heroes yeah when you talk to the actual son of the man and he's like yeah my dad it's a piece of shit I don't like fuck like I don't know what to do with that you know like what do I say that I mean his art is amazing is what he did to the world I mean but he what he didn't do was take care of his own backyard what he didn't do is take care of his own children I find that that creates some difficult because there's some writers not some I mean so many of them writers musicians actors who have blessed the world with what they've put out but then you look at the destruction they sold in their immediate vicinity you know and you want to be like well do you condemn it or are you just thankful that or is that like collateral damage unavoidable khalad collateral damage in order to have the things that to have the things that we appreciate yeah well there's also I'd you kind of followed I'm saying 100% well Hendricks you know I mean this pod this podcast was called the Joe Rogan experience because I stole it from Hendrix oh really yeah that's friends just thinking about that earlier when I was sitting in your your uh in the back room there and had that I was just looking at the experience wondering about where that came from yeah Jimi Hendrix Experience yeah it's 100% stole it from Henry's and then I read that he beat his girlfriend's really yeah I was like what is that real well I don't want to think Hendrix even got mad I want to think he's that dude who put the bandana on and just played voodoo child yeah when I worked with Phil Hartman when Phil Hartman was a kid he was like 17 or 18 Hendrix played at whiskey and he was there as like a roadie and his job was to keep the amp the speakers from falling over you know so he stood there on the stage and Hendrix was right there playing guitar in front of him yeah and the way he described is like his eyes were alight he was like describe I was like he was right there it was right there and he's playing you know there's been I grew up but just a giant Hendrix fan like a giant fan Led Zeppelin Hendrix The Doors like it's all classic rock when I was a kid you know no suburban Boston neighborhood type shit you draw up Van Halen on your fucking notebook see DZ logos you know it's like that's that's how I grew up you know so I was trying to figure out a name for this podcast I was like man who the fuck is affected me more in terms of motivation than Hendrix said listen to his music when I worked out I listened to his music oh that's great driving to gigs you know and plus he just seemed like so different you know just such a crazy anomaly and pop culture this african-american dude is like the greatest guitarists of all time you have all these rock guys and one of the things that Eric Clapton in said like he thought he knew how to play guitar that he saw Jimi Hendrix he was like what the fuzzy did wing like what am i doing he was just so out there he was so out there he was so different you know just a freak just an anomaly it's like hunting the Remy Warren I'm glad you guys got him doing a podcast it's great I love it yeah yeah Hendrix I always point out people that how I grew up my dad discovered that I have was left I down I'm a dominant and uh all the hand-me-down shift guns are ours right-handed but I had to relearn how to shoot everything left-handed so now I talked about how I was like Hendrix where I had to shoot left-handed with right-handed guns well I shot my first year with your gun it's a left-handed gun your rifle knock it on the wrong side remember No yeah it's out there man the deers here yeah yeah we're lost this position of prominence to this this is not a table yeah hey did you did you see I don't want to change the subject but do you want did you see the video I sang you which one of the shark tag and the dude the Instagram video yeah yeah crazy yeah which one that's one of the things I get so many of those goddamn things sent to me no I thought you'd appreciate it I'm sure of a guy gonna I don't know what kind of shark it is I'll send it to Jamie what kind of shark is it you know no I think it's a bull shark baby I'm not sure oh yeah here it is I was almost dinner he says yeah air share - oh that was yeah dude it's terrible I'm terrified of sharks did you guys yeah I thought you'd appreciate it yeah because the where the the the the the mental presence of that guy mhm yeah he kept together yeah just to like he's getting attacked by a shark and puts not only things to put its spear gun in its mouth hear this right go pull the trigger boom suck it bitch yeah I mean look that thing was coming in hot that's amazing and got some sharp thinking and he's attached to this fucking shark now right yeah but he stones it yeah oh yeah it's dead that's hilarious yeah fuck sharks I wish there was more of them so you could say fuck sharks and not worry about it yeah now you can't this funny man like you were talking about sharks you hear about guys the fish the Gulf Coast in Florida and shit and you got to be very careful cuz I pull the shark up on the beach people will get pissed oh yeah and they'll get pissed that you're fishing sharks because of lures sharks in oh so it's a double whammy yeah sharks have kind of entered like they've almost gotten like um they've climbed the they've sort of moved in how we view wildlife they made the jump they're out there with elephants yes yes they like almost it's great news for species man if I was a different species and I was trying to like make my plan my three-year plan I'd be like I want to move elevate my species up to I want to look at like what the Sharks done and get there because that shit that's for safety like right like if you were an entertainer and you wanted to get to I want to get to where Kanye is like if you were an animal I want to get to with a shark yeah like if I was a possum yeah if I was a possum I'd get with other possums and I'd be like what does it take to get to what an elephant enjoys I was discussing with my kids right now people are that people don't consider possums now they're like hitting with a car like oh it's just a greener just keep moving yeah I was talking to my kids last night about racism in the insect world and that uh we were hanging out outside and my youngest daughter goes as a roach oh it's a cricket and turns her back on this thing like has no concern at all she goes from beat its cricket I mean and just turns her back same size like you know saying prospect danger was none it's just wandering around she thought it was a roach she was terrified and then it was a cricket I find crickets in my house all the time I capture them I'm gonna let him go yeah I bring them outside of let them go so we do this you know this cricket is hanging out behind my daughter and then my dog comes over and just fucking scoops it up and eats it I'm like why the fuck you eat in a cricketer he's like laugh and smile and he thinks it's hilarious like fuck man he's ate a cricket yeah we are the racism of species or whatever is that you know we still have a rat infestation Jamie right here is a dog gonna eat that bird oh wow that was like halo Fred and Jamie's one of the better internet thing finders he's the best he's got a gold money call that it's like a fine internet finding have you seen that cat yeah I've seen that cat somebody sent me that that's a mouse kill yeah he's rippled that cat looks like he's been running mountains he's been taken down smell yeah he's ripped you know you had was it your podcast but I mean I know you had ELQ 101 what is his name Noah Corey Jacobson no Jason Phelps oh that's right that's right all right different guy Phelps game calls right I love that guy dude yeah great podcast dude well he's a good he's a good guy don't ever had Cory Jacobson on no no sir never met him I'd like to have him Adam I liked you too Phelps yeah like one just as an isolated specimen okay like a like no context nothing if he's like medam because whatever you like wanted trying to park at the airport and you're trying to find a spot and he's pulling out hey you pulling out like you'd like him in that context he was just seem like a good dude but kind of his business it's kind of when I see him in his company because the thing that always pops in my head was uh that's his term like like a like American elbow grease yeah I do let's tell people what he does he makes elk call yeah he makes get a wide variety game calls but he's acting like he's like very much specialized in L calls was like group and a logging family you know in like a logging area in that industry at this particular time is it'll look a little bit in the autumn of its of its life expectancy in there we grew up that's kind of his background I just do like interested in something good at something every time I really like being in America you know the benefits of being an American yeah not that we have a monopoly on but we have a lot of it just like great benefits and this dude just like starts making game Falls and like with his mom and his wife like builds businessman and is a good dude he you know is it's called blowing a game call right so he sends me his t-shirts as I blow Phelps and my wife was like throw it out I was like no you never get aware of like it doesn't matter it stays he's a nice guy like you know when you already sit like someone's a nice is like yeah always a nice guy like I don't know I value that that means like such a good dude I lose a lot of respect for people when they're really good at what they do but they're not nice it's like I get it you had to figure out how to be good at what you did and what was sacrificed his community your sake if you sacrifice friendliness that's not necessary yeah it's not necessary it's it's a weakness I really believe that you know and it's it's common to common weakness like the thinking of yourself before others the problem is it's goal-oriented right you're all what you're worried about achieving success or achieving a certain position or a goal but the problem is when you get to that goal you're gonna be fucking - you're gonna be depressed you're gonna be sad because you know how many friends your way to the top you know it's like you can't you can't you have to see the the trees you got to see everything you got to see the whole forest you can't just keep your eye on the prize because you fuck over people and push them aside on the way and eventually getting it but you have to fuck over some people and I mean fuck them over but tell them to fuck off like there's some people that will get in your way people that are selfish that would trip you up because you'll wind up being completely absorbed in their own problems and you're like hey you're not dealing with your own problems you've made me the curator of your problems sometimes you have to like know when to cut people loose but you also have to like I know I know that you're big on this - you're you're big on tribe like you have like those guys that you travel with you do shows with it's like a tribe of you like yeah a community and it's very important I respect that I think that's very that's huge so that's a but it's the thing I've learned from my interactions with you and a thing I've seen is you don't you don't parade it around and you don't talk about too much but you do talk about that there are some things where you just you put up some firewalls in your life and the people that you're around and I have heard you refer to at times that that something got to someone was maybe like too damaging and referring to people that it wasn't even like you were condemning them or thought they were bad but you just referred to like times you've had like just sort of protect what you had and what what you care about and just make some things not part of your life anymore you yeah you have to do that sometimes yeah you have to you have to realize that there's some people that are not looking out for themselves some people don't make that jump well and they keep that around yeah they keep that that influence around because it because of maybe like misplaced loyalties yes I've noticed you bring that up a handful of times we were like something just got to be where you had to like build you just you had to be like you I love you respect you would ever buy just gotta protect these other things well some people get some completely self-absorbed and they burn everything around them because they're only thinking about themselves and even if you love them and care them or appreciate what they're doing like some people are amazing at certain thing like you know we're talking about Hendrix I mean if Hendrix did beat his wife I don't know if that's true or beat his girlfriend's you know but it's like some people are so good at what they do that like that's all they're thinking about and they didn't develop these interpersonal skills or relationship skills or you know whatever it's you know they didn't develop a sense of nuance in terms of their perspective of the world or a sense of introspective thinking whether they're looking at themselves and being objective about how they interface with the people around them and in life those people that are just like wholly focused on the south especially pure narcissists which you run into a lot of them in show business and some of them it's not their fault you know you talk to me if you believe in determinism you know and you believe that they're a product of all the things that have happened to them and then you run down the list of all the things that have happened to them it's fucking bone-chilling I mean so many people that I know particularly in show business are there because of just a giant hole they developed in their self-esteem and there's who they are as a child they didn't get enough love they got too much abuse and hate and bullying and all these varying factors that made them push so hard to achieve success to let everybody know hey I am special hey I am something you were all wrong and then the but along the way they they burn everything around them yeah and it's I don't I don't you know I mean I don't want to it's it's possible to get there without that that's what I want to say it's like it's possible to get there without being a piece of shit and some people think you have to be a piece of shit to be successful you don't don't have to I think some people get to where remember earlier I mentioned like the collateral damage yeah I some people think have you could develop such an inflated sense of what you're bringing to the world that you it's you personally come to accept the idea that there is a price to pay yeah that price being other people yeah yeah that's a problem but then again if you don't have certain standards than other people to chew up all your time and their problems become your problems and they don't even thinking about their problems they're thinking about you thinking about their problems I mean there's many people that pawn off their problems on other folks and they think that if you're a good friend you're helping me like you're not a good friend you're not taking care of me you're not helping me like you're helping yourself yeah the fuck are you doing for yourself like this is a trap that a lot of people get stuck into it's codependency it happens in a lot of relationships there's a lot of people that get involved in relationships boy and girl that they find that the person who is their their soulmate is also the source of all their fucking problems and they're the curator of this person's life they're they're supposed to be like helping this person along because this person is like deem them the person who's most important to them and it's like you know you got to find you got to find out what you know what is the what's the boundary where you won't cross or you don't realize like someone is becoming an impediment to your own happiness and success it's amazing the degree to which people deep down do care about what someone is quote like you know mm-hmm where I find that because I've been on your show a number of times people are curious about you and people will often ask me you know what's wrong and really like but they know they know that they know what answer they want to hear bad people would love a story okay you think us I'm like Oprah Winfrey I've found that people love a story about how bad like people are gonna eat up a story that she's awful yeah yeah sure like people want a story about some of you bad but what's funny what you've done and how you've done it is that and this happens quite often where people are like they're like he's a good guy right like they wanted to know like they feel like you are and they want to have it confirmed not that they're like oh yeah tell me the story about him being bad like the away with a lot of people if someone has a really bad story about Oprah I'm like oh I'm all yours course why well well I think first of all because Oprah is enormous ly successful like it in some sort of preposterous way yeah what's a billion dollars were just talking she can't saying she can't dance she's not in good shape was she doing just talking she's got a billion dollars fuck her I hope she's I hope she's a meanie I hope she's doing terrible day yeah you know there's a thing about that it's like you want to find oh she got that way because she's fucking people over yeah I heard she beats her assistant Archy I mean she sisters have a it makes sense of the world so Wow in some ways like you want to think that someone who's achieved that ridiculous level of success is mean I got passed by Oprah Oprah has a house in Montecito I passed by the house like that is a ridiculous house for a person it's like a giant lawn 50 million dollar house a fucking huge estate it's a castle she's a queen you know you don't want that like fuck her you know my house is 250 grand why is what the fuck is she doing with that 50 and that's not even how she lives in she just visits that like once a year takes a shit there has someone cooked for takes a nap gets up and stirs an animal stirs and animosity yeah well you know preposterous success breeds animosity and that lady's got a lot of preposterous success you know certain people you meet them you want him to sit like dr. Phil like he's a similar thing I would be receptive to a bad dr. Phil I'm sorry he's great dr. Phil is fuckin great my friend Jay is dr. Phil's son I became friends with dr. Phil through another guy through another guy because my friend Ron White my friend Ron White is a good buddy minds when the best comedians on earth is good friends with Jay McGraw who's dr. Phil son so I became friends with Jay before I became friends with dr. Phil then I had dr. Phil on the podcast dr. Phil's the fucking nicest guy ever he's a regular guy like you hang out and talk to him he's got a ridiculous amount of success but he's hilarious he's like a regular dude yeah before we started we talked about how we're both pro-marriage yes we root for marriages right but with kids yeah but marry oh yeah yeah yeah when there's no kids involved I still root for him yeah do you know I root for marriages I I root for happiness and sometimes happiness means divorce no I root well I'm able to make the switch by even root for mayor I just root for marriages no that's it well because you I know why because you grew up in a fucked up sort of situation where it didn't you know you grew up with broken promises and divorces and separating and that kind of shit a lot of that had happened yeah yeah yeah there was stuff that had happened well for chill not for me but it was there was like it was around right it was in it was in our family history for sure yeah not mine too yeah I moved for happiness sometimes happiness means someone getting the fuck away from somebody you know my favorite story about people being a good guy mo I mentioned mo found earlier he's been on the show so I feel like I can mention him um assuming that your listeners like have this like amazing capacity for attention do but so moles me on the show and mo found talks about dude this is like a third this is like a fifth hand story but mo fans body meets the guy that used to be like who is the dude in the Nerds movie who like nerds oh yeah oh girl yeah okay check this out wow so efference Mo's buddy meets the dude who was older in the Nerds and nerds not Thunder it's nerd so I all man so and the guy that doesn't want to bring it up but he can't help himself bring it up he's like you know I loved you and nerds [Music] so the guy goes into this big thing like he's like do you have any idea what it would be like to have like your whole life defined by some role you did long ago and I'm a thespian and I do theater now and you people that bring this up all the time Oh nerds you know and he does it like he like is cool with right right and rolls into it and the dudes relief the he enabled him to like have that recollection mmm you know he was always like yeah okay people gonna look and when I hear that now if I see that guy I'm like that guy must be a cool guy right because he doesn't take himself too seriously yeah cuz he could roll with it yeah there he is nerds what do Pro Wrestling or something branch of the Nerds policy movie yeah yeah it mean looks like a guy that you would cast in a row or a role where he'd be mean to nerds yeah some people take themselves fucking super seriously like that's one of the best things about my careers like I will for always be forever always be the fear factor guy like that's true ah that's definitely true with some folks really yeah you watch it it's on TV I mean it's not understand if I don't know that I don't know that that's really the case with you I feel like that you might have a wrong impression of your legacy nah it's in there it's definitely in there in there but it's not it maybe it's not there but if anybody wanted like poke fun at me that's always there and I would welcome it like nothing's right I don't think that well prevent me from taking my selves myself and my you know I want to pretend I'm some sort of moody artist that has always followed the path of creativity and artistic expression no.not hoard myself out for like six years I think it's in your head but I'm think it's in people's head maybe yeah I don't know it's in some people's head I can remember the first place I hear you know what you know it helps substantiate what you're telling me I know where I was sitting the first time I ever heard your name know who I was talking to and unfortunately I don't like to admit this this is a long time ago unfortunately the point of contact when I was like oh you're right Fear Factor yeah yeah I mean fucking millions of people saw that goddamn thing I need to tell you too that that was the first conversation when I ever heard the word podcast really I know where I was sitting I was talking to Helen Cho who you know oh yeah I heard the word Joe Rogan in the word podcast and had no idea what either those things were that's before you came on dude yeah I'm talking long time 2012 people did yeah yeah I'm not like I'm not I mean I have I don't want to say I'm a finger on the pulse I'm now like a Luddite well that was when I heard the word the podcast was only three years old back then when you first came on now it's ten years old that crate is longer growing that it was 2012 okay cuz that's when we went hunting maybe 2011 and went hunting in 2012 yeah yeah so it was probably two years old the podcast was two years old and she said for your fact I'm like oh the world the world of podcasting man there was a funny variety article that was just written that Conan O'Brien is blazing a trail in the world of podcasting and you know just got just openly shit on by the entire world who read that like what are you talking about like no one's even like his podcast gets like a hundred thousand downloads or something and in comparison like Marc Maron or Adam Carolla all these people have been doing it for ever and ever but it's uh it's still to this day like this sort of in mainstream views and mainstream eyes it's like just starting to gained recognition when some people like Corolla has been doing podcasts for ten years I think Maron has been doing it longer than me I've been doing it for ten years it's meirin's probably ten eleven years in you know it's a it's a weird world and how many years you guys been doing it now five yeah five years in yeah I listen to your goddamn podcast every week I get it on Monday Monday's weeks are they yes I see man I really enjoy doing it and I've tried to point out I've tried to point out that yeah if it was the view I hadn't I wouldn't have gone into it well you were really good as a guest and I was like man this guy has so much unusual knowledge in his head and you're so good at articulating thoughts and you have a background in journalism you're you're so eloquent like why wouldn't you do it I'm like it's so eat and there's like this market for for people that enjoy hunting and enjoy the outdoors there's you know there's I don't mean any disrespect anybody who's making podcasts do your best but there's a lot of clunky poorly articulated thoughts that are being put out in podcast form and my thought was like this is so but the word spiritual is a very weird word right because it's been sort of co-opted by assholes but there's this has it yeah sometime la for sure there's a lot of beware oh and I'm with you you know but there's a spiritual aspect to hunting it's real you know and one of the things that I really appreciate about you is like this idea like no shooting collared deer speaks to it it's like there's there's something about this that's not just about shooting an animal and eating it it's about the difficult of difficulty of their pursuit what it means and what you're getting out of it as a human being and then also the recognition of what you're eating then when you're eating this animal that this is this is a wild beautiful creature that you respect and that there's a certain amount of like there's a certain amount of a feeling of loss and sadness when that animal dies and this is this is recognizing this is real and it's hard for people to articulate that and I think it's very important that there's people like you out there that are articulating this and then the people can digest this in a podcast form and get it over and over again and they also get because you always do these big groups of people they get a sense of camaraderie too and where people are talking also like an a pride of hard work you know there's a pride that comes through that which i think is very contagious like this the feeling of appreciating and respecting hard work and like you would the way that you were talking about Jason Phelps you know it's like that kind of a that appreciation for ingenuity and hard work and it's very important for people it's very important for people to hear it gives you something that I don't in in terms of like outdoor like the outdoor world like whether it's hunting and fishing and just appreciation for wildlife it's not publicly articulated on a broad scale you know when you referred to the camaraderie which is super important to me when I thought about making a show you know I always had a lot in this when I thought about making a podcast you know it always had a lot of nostalgia for was um Howard Stern in the mid 90s yeah I don't know what it shows like now remember that era when it was on and he made me still be on there like he'd have all these dudes around that were kind of like funny yeah and there's so many people in the room you couldn't tell who was talking it's just like people it felt like people hanging out yeah I liked that and I liked um fresh air but Terry girl sure I was like dude you should do a combo of Howard Stern and Terry Gross yeah the thing I thought about but the camaraderie absolutely one of the one of the things I'd like to see a Molson people write in and they feel like they feel like I said like people sitting around shooting the shit yeah which you know it's a very controlled shooting of the shit sure has to be it's controlled but that's why I personally use important like there has to be one person that sort of like aware that we're all shooting the shit but sort of like gently guiding it you know Opie and Anthony was the same thing for me mm-hmm when I started doing Opie and Anthony in like the early 2000s I I realized like wow this is crazy people don't people that weren't fans of it back then it doesn't exist anymore unfortunately it was an amazing hangout for comedians we would all go there and I would I would show up and ricky gervais to be there and Jim Norton there and all these guys would be there louis c.k be there bill bird me there we just be talking shit and Ari Shaffir we'd all be just laughing and chiming in and even though it's six o'clock in the morning like he went and did it man you had a cup of coffee he showed up but everybody's happy to see you and it was a hang and it was a really loosely structured hang that they put together and that inspired me to kind of do my podcast in a similar way I don't know how comfortable you are pulling back the curtain or showing like how the sausage gets made but um I started something recently about you and sort of how you do your deal I was like if you if you imagine this make you uncomfortable no okay if you imagine it someone I don't want this to seem like at all negative if someone read a transcript of your of what you asked you wouldn't be like oh my god but you bring out things and the people that you interview I like to listen to your show and you get something from people that people don't get did you get it on purpose like I don't know what I'm getting I'm trying my best you are yeah some try my best to relate to my you at you like you know what I'm gonna do you ever say to yourself you don't know how to do different no I don't that's the the beauty of it all there's not that much thinking I mean I do think with some people like there's certain people like Cornel West I read his book before he came on I really wanted to be prepared because he's such a brilliant guy yeah same thing with like Sean Carroll like scientists you know anyone who's like you got your paying respect to the the complexity of their ideas yes and like if someone like like Richard Dawkins we're talking about doing a podcast soon if I if I have him on I will devour his material yeah like a week or two beforehand I will read his book so listen the recordings and conversations and debates that he's had and already I'm a big fan of the guy so I'll get a good understanding of like where I'm at when we lead into the conversation but then I won't have an agenda I just like let the conversation flow and if there's a moment in time where I want to ask him like you said this thing about Islam once like what did you what do you mean do you mean this in terms of like a general understanding of the religion itself what about the individuals that are just trying to be good people that are born into this environment and this sort of you know I will I will have some places to go to if we get stuck and some things that I will but I won't I won't force those things in yeah but I think it's Seconal I mean without with the risk of sounding pretentious I think that podcasting is in a weird way in art form and the art is in like the people listening like I know sometimes I talk over people or interject too much I disagree it happens it happens it just happens there's no way you can have a perfect conversation because I don't know when the person's gonna stop talking and or I don't want to lose a thought and I want to jump in with it but I'm Way better at it now that I was five years ago and certainly way better at now that I was 10 years ago and then I think that there's a an art to the way the things you're saying sound and how they sound to people and there's an art to expression expressing genuine open-mindedness and genuine curiosity and like just a pure 'ti of thought there it is not there's you're not trying to make people feel about you a certain way you're not you're just trying to explore ideas and there's a there's a smoothness to the way that's that's that's devoured by people when people are listening the way they're consuming it it's easy and the easier you can make it on people listening the more they like you so like that like if they know they like hey that's Steve Rinella guy he loves his kids he's a nice guy he's his friends love him I like that guy listen to what he says when he talks to John Norris you know what does john saying about this and about that and like it it it adds to it where is there someone who's clunky and loud and is fucking they're just trying to toot their own horn and all that comes through especially in this long-form podcast genre it's like this is the fucking mirror man like you with long-form podcast you find out who the fuck everybody is yeah that's good that's a good point like like Bernie Sanders like I had Bernie Sanders on yeah so a lot of people that like the fucking comments were insanely positive to like I thought that guy was crazy like I thought he was a nut I would see him in these little interviews and Mike he just wants give away everybody's money like there's a picture with Bernie with my dog and one of the fucking hilarious comments like he just wants to give your dog treats other dogs that's the caricature I mean everyone has a character right the character that guy is he just wants to take money from successful people and give it to lazy people that's the worst the worst view of Bernie Sanders you know and you get to see instead of like this narrative that gets established through these little short sound bites and these panel talk shows there's three people talking over each other or debates or whatever it is all those are ineffective and what's interesting about is all those are fueling podcasts all those things that have so for so long been thought of as mainstream venues for getting your ideas out now they highlight all the problems with those and they highlight all the strengths of podcasts that's encouraging yeah it's very encouraging and remember are you Bernie Sanders man he's a nice guy you know I I I like some of his ideas I do not have a problem with giving up more of my money as a person who's made a lot of money if I know that it's gonna benefit the greater good of mankind you know what squandered I don't want to see it squandered I don't like bureaucracy I don't like red tape I don't like government I don't like people that are so lazy that they just want to take everybody's money and then do what they will with it and take long lunch breaks and this is the problem with like a lot of what we think of in terms of like government government is filled its bloated it's filled with assholes it's filled with people that just got government job and they're they're not good at it you know they just no one else wants that job so they take that job and they do a shitty job with it and they squander resources that's what drives people crazy and especially hard-working people that know how hard it is to make a living you have to give you know if you're a fucking logger you've given away certain percentage of your money and you're tired all these splinters in your hands you're exhausted and some asshole is gonna take away your money and you know and allocate a certain amount of it to nonsense no you know gender research and all sorts of stupid shit that you think is just fruitless and it's just it's infuriating for people for hardworking people that dirt under their fingernails they don't want to think about anybody squandering their money no I'm instinctively yeah fiscally very conservative you know not very fiscally conservative people might look at where I'm at and think that I'm socially liberal but in social issues I'm somewhat libertarian you know but I feel that I need the right to come my direction quite a long ways on conservation issues but that's land that's yeah that's instinctively where I belong yeah but the right but I need them to move back might numb when I say back my direction because historically I don't know the right unless hard to is confusing but yeah I need them to come my way on conservation well I'd like the way you've described yourself in the past that you're politically sort of alone that you're you're you're kind of without a party because the left ones take your guns away and the right ones take your land away yeah this is what we see fiscally that what the most disturbing aspects of right-wing administration's is they want to sell off public land they want to figure out a way just a little bit just a little bit we're just taking a little bit we're gonna use it for mining just take a little bit well I meant lose the salmon river but who the fuck is painted edge of that coming uh yeah I'm watching for yes me too that's Ryan Callahan talked about that with what does it call Pebble Beach that would no pebble and Hubbell mine yeah that mean gigantic salmon fishery is the biggest most yeah it's a yeah deeply on yeah I don't want to get into hard but yeah you can get into the weeds with this stuff but yeah it's like there's no perfect party and there's no perfect politician there's no perfect ideology which pisses people off when you point that out do we've gotten hit hard for that kind of stuff for pointing out to this just not you know we as a company like a meteor we've been like hit hard for pointing out that it's unfortunate that someone's not speaking for our holy for our concerns yes well what's interesting about you guys is people think that your is some sort of a green Trojan horse it's just hilarious like dude we don't really like to hunt I love it but it's so preposterous artists I work with the heart is hit and I work with the hardest-hit and hunters and fishermen that there that there are ever that I've ever lived you don't really like hunting it's hilarious no it's like some like Beltway lobbyists you don't really like hunting oh is that right it just shows you how silly people are let's line them up yeah yeah come on bring your side over here let me see what you're doing yeah it's it shows you how ridiculous people can be in there their desire to like put people into a very small easily dismissed category mmm you know it's like this is what people love to do you know yeah that's what you do that drives people crazy as you defy you're so hard to buck it I love it I don't sit around night thinking about you I love it but I think we need more people like that yeah loves most people would think that I'm conservative that I'm a Republican or an alt right or something like that I vote left on almost everything except gun control I just don't think that people understand what they're talking about when they're talking about gun control I don't think they understand the nuances of the Second Amendment or the nuances of taking away people's ability to defend themselves or to hunt or to you know to own something that may or may not be used against someone else but they never would use it it's you don't have the right to tell people what they can and can't have just because some people abuse things it's like it is a a very complex conversation that people on the Left want to boil down to guns equal bad oh for sure it's like it's like I don't have them and I can understand why someone would yes but therefore I don't know why you would but at the same time they're you know and we're sitting here with a drink but the same time you look at like alcohol and one could make a very cogent argument about the overall destructiveness of abused alcohol for sure but people I don't hear a lot of people talking about prohibition no no I had this one drink Crenshaw I don't drink and drive Dan Crenshaw is a congressman is not for legalized marijuana nobody likes scotch so we had this weird conversation we come on man stop and I'm like when we're standing in front of a ashtray filled with blunts and they said this idea that like if you're a marijuana smoker that's somehow another you lazy like workout with me come get up with me just stop just stop that nonsense I would like to tackle with the this with you because I have questions about yeah but that being lazy being a weed smoker is it weed smoking makes me work harder because it makes me paranoid I don't want to be lazy I want to earn my keep I don't want people to everything that I'm slacking I love it that's great let's say I think about comedy when I think about when I smoke pot I think about comedy I'm like I better get to work that's good you get so paranoid and the paranoia is that you don't work hard enough 100% it's all of it all of it my wife it's just tough my wife gets where she thinks not that she's going to pee her pants but that she has Peter Pan's [Laughter] concern marijuana ever that's a great one I wish I only had that one that would make it so easy to live with but mine aids productivity my my fears aid productivity whether it's exercise whether it's uh you know doing Stan stand up as a big one cuz you don't want to suck you just don't want to sock you don't want anybody to pay money and have a bad time that is the worst feeling in the history of the world well I'm gonna go see it tonight yes if you suck I'm gonna fuckin be like boo I'm working hard dude I might have all you but I've seen people heckle you and it doesn't work well they don't come out on top it's not a smart move because you're interrupting a show for your own idea people already rooting for the guy on stage so when people heckle you it doesn't work out well for them well occasionally people are rooting for the heckler if the heckler is a good point like sorry look people have heckled me and said hilarious shit and I'll laugh along with them it's like as long as we're not filming anything the real problem is people that want to heckle and you're filming you know I can feel me something like don't hackle yeah dude you're funny but you're not funny you'd like to mmm not for like posterity it's alcohol it's all alcohol so like you get a couple of drinks you ever had some funny shit to say to and you know my god funny one this is bald I'm this bald man up here telling me what's funny I know what's funny and I'm not and sometimes people have good points but that's the beauty of live performances you know you live in this world where from ready start who knows what's gonna happen you press start and like this thing goes off in its own little journey and you have this idea of what the way you're gonna steer it and you're you bringing up subjects and you're making people laugh but anything can happen anything could happen do when I saw you last I saw you in Seattle and uh you know I want to say this but the the people destroyed this by saying it we laugh my wife and I laughed so much I wish no one that ever pointed this out because Peter Graham is aw it hurt my stomach I hurt my stomach I laugh so much you're hurt I laugh so much I cried like yeah shut up but like we last much my stomach hurt my stomach muscles hurt that's as good as a person could ever get yeah that's the best my compliment literally I had like stomach afterward we were talking about our stomach muscles like we're doing ab I was like we had been doing a bunch of crunches collies a crazy art form man it's a crazy art form it was a butyl it like because we're like in the mix of it man we have three kids that are under ten it's hard everything is hard and we went to see you it was just like we went to see you we watch your shit and um it was just from you know for this like glorious for that roundel 60 minutes 45 minutes it was we're just like two people like Hey look fucking like having fun that's the best really it's really nice and laughing his stuff that we thought what makes it especially fun and especially cathartic because we're laughing about stuff that we felt like we're not supposed to laugh about yeah but you have this moment you have this epiphany like oh you know what though but it is funny it's okay because you're with 3,000 other people and everyone's drunk you're like oh we're all on the same page but it is funny yeah but also like this that you can be a good person and laugh at things and then and ridiculous and that you probably shouldn't be laughing at these things are possible no we loved it it's the art form of that is the art form of comedy you know that my favorite kind of comedy my favorite comic comedies fucked up I mean I love all kinds of comedy if somebody like is like a Jerry Seinfeld you ever notice like that's great to me he's an artist he figures out a way to craft these things you could take your kids to your grandma but I'm a Joey Diaz fan yeah like that kind of guy like Kennison I like I like Pryor I like that kind of comedy I've told you this before and I've told you listeners this before enough that excuse me um then I don't mean to wrap your own show but I got to go but uh you didn't like this one I sigh I felt like you didn't like it when I said it before but your comedy comes from a position yeah I think you like I think you didn't like this because it sounds um you're you're modest how do you know if I'd liked it but your body language your comedy comes from a position of strength so much comedy comes from a position of self-loathing with self-loathing funny right I can't get it up I can't please my girlfriend right I'm a horrible husband right it comes from self loathing but to have someone come at comedy from a position of strength is unusual because the formula is that it's self-deprecating I'm so pathetic Brian but to have comedy coming from an individual who isn't mired and self-loathing is a really fresh angle and I feel like I brought this out to you before and you seemed um they seem to not dig it I probably just didn't want to talk about myself yeah well you didn't want to talk about comedy cuz you come from a position that's like yeah it's fine it's just jokes if you came from a position of self-loathing you would have luxury ated in the compliment right probably like well thank you Wow no I thought about that way I guess I'm okay I'm okay yeah so there's a compliment for you it's tricky business you you got to go you're filming some shit with Bryan Callen yeah when are we getting together what are we doing come on man well I think I know why turkey hunting or was it Alaska Turkey but I if you remember our proposed you not long ago I was asking you about your availability to hunt elk in September but it kind of petered out too I have two hunts one I see I have that's the thing about having kids and a family and everything like that what I would like most is to bring you and your family up to my fish Shack for a few days let's do it because I think our children let's do that our kids are our kids like kids yeah yeah let's do that let's do that I'm into that my end like I said my youngest
