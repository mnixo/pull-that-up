hello freak bitches and then you've been there back and forth ever since yeah the the first time I would say it wasn't until my flight back that I felt that initial like I gotta do something because whenever I was there the problem just seems so huge and so I mean so insurmountable that what am I going to do or how am I going to help and am I going to get endanger myself or get sick or die or whatever in the process and but on the way back it just felt like you know if if not me then then who you know like they asked me if I would give them a voice if I can help them if I could and I just felt I don't know a yearning longing that I had to do something and so the the second trip back was was great i got to actually meet some people that really had some real plans because the first time i went with people that we didn't have plans to actually help or anything like sustainability was just kind of a learning trip going and seeing what with the problems where second time was the university their their school of community development and they had dreams of giving them water given them land get on them food but they didn't have any way to do it really they had the plan and everything in place but they didn't have funding behind it they didn't have the technology behind it and so the third time was when ever I came back and I I had a study how to build those eco domes and I partnered with an organization it's a great organization called water for and they their big thing is what what i was searching for was how to put the the tools or basically the power in the hands of the people there instead of having to have outside help how could we actually help them to continue to do it continue the process and so water for puts the tools in the people's hands and then they teach them how to do it and then now they can do it for themselves it can be a sustainable business forum they can they can use whatever model they want if it's a non-profit model if it's a business model to to make it sustainable there so that way yet where I'm at congolese can help Congolese in that way I can hopefully you know fan the flame go over there teach them more bring over the right people water for really supported and sent over um you know their director of implementation to come really sit down with us for two weeks teach us he came back out did it again now he's gone over since I've been back already he's been back over teaching her team and more you know strategies of how to dig these water wills and I wished it there was one parent that i could just be like they're the good one and the other ones bad right my mom would like throw hot water at my pops and i'll get what the fuck is going on and and then you know he would do his thing my smack or whatever and then she'd try to punch him and then he'd hit her and I was just like this is WWF in the crib I got a friend who still fights with his wife and his wife threw a fucking screwdriver at him and stuck him in the arm I get stuck out of his arm and he fucked her that night oh because that shit turns me on I go what then he goes one time and one time this is hilarious they were watching a movie together and she fell asleep at the movie so he took his pants down and either watching 300 he took his pants down and put his asshole like an inch away from her head and goes and he yelled something she woke up and he farted right in her face that's a new move that's the cornholio oh man that's and she fucking went crazy she punched him in the mouth she fucking freaky she go Eagles she fucking made me see stars like she cracked me in the job and he goes oh fucking love it that shit turns me on that turns you on not man when I saw this stumble my parents I said I never want to be in a family

yell at my friends I don't want anybody yelling at me that's the one thing I look for people asked what do you look for when you hire people good trustworthy people good values that's it you can't you can't teach that people have it or they don't yeah I know her he he actually the reason he got into it to give him more in-depth thought it was he embezzled uh I think two million dollars from Rico cameras Jesus Christ he was the the CFO of Rico cameras and Amelia's he was making you know in like that mid 80s he was making like seven hundred thousand dollars a year which is like now is way more and what was a million and a half now right yeah he was making a lot of money back then we would take limos to atlantic city every weekend whoa and then as the story goes he was just for two years I think just embezzling money he was just like doing shady transactions and taking money off the top well then he got caught when there was a new CEO and he blackmailed the CEO because he had information on the company that they didn't want coming out and he got out but he could never work in the industry again so he became a gambler I mean a bookie Anna gambler that's crazy so he's he embezzled two million dollars scot-free scot-free yeah wow yeah whatever they were bringing up charges every little move yeah they were starting to get charges together and he was facing like 40 life almost life in prison knows the craziest fucking stress field right yeah and then he you know he became a gambler and this was around the time my mom left him was like 86 he bet $300,000 on the Red Sox to win the world series in 86 oh my god are in the World Series remember those good luck tonight yeah oh no and he lost three hundred thousand which was like most of their savings and my mom left
