the Joe Rogan experience trained by khow podcast by night [Music] she been on the road not really leaving a little bit here and there and start back to Baltimore oh that's out like it was fun later for the UFC so okay oh yeah thanks for the offer on our land of fun dismissed you there we we were out of there about four days before you it was great stuff well you know that guy cow head in Tampa okay break did so he he decided he's indicating so he decided to change his name to his real name's Mike alte so your accountant right right I think I got well so they did a roast for him as it was a benefit but the idea was dead that's answer to everybody was saying like this is your only equity in life did you know and so sue me Jim Norton Bert Kreischer Florentine Bobby Kelly we all flew down for it no  yeah but they said you know come down and bring your family will be tickets to every theme park which they did that's a scratch so so we went to Universal Disney Busch Gardens all look like those Fast Pass where you go in front of my oh I've got a great hotel Lewis oven it was great and then my sister was down in Florida visiting my mom so then we just we made a vacation I spent a week at my mom after that so it's a good trip yeah but I I tweaked my neck on some relics puzzlers did you ruin my knees Busch Gardens is like if you're into roller coasters it's they've got like a dozen of the most hardcore roller coasters like 400 foot straight drops and corkscrews and you know and I was into it but then on the second to last one I felt something and then I spent at my mom's house and literally this this is my rotation entire week at my mom's house man I went to the chiropractor twice if that ever happens forget the chiropractor boat get deep tissue massage yeah loosen up the soft tissue that's almost all but really yeah I mean and I've come through a series of back injuries over the last year and one of the things that I found a lot of chiropractic is the lightening and not really recognized by science or medicine either it's a broad word that's not even one type of chiropractor you get guys that do all different times yet yeah the guy once he wasn't great I just felt like I needed something I was gonna get massaged just too weird to do that with my sting of my mom no therapeutic he read someone do that yeah if she's light it's great but some of these cows they're you know they're 50 years old and they put on a few pounds a weird thing random take a lot of head impacts they start getting depressed and inside so the dirty secret of combats Orchestra that most of those guys when you hear all that positive talk it's not just to pump themselves up for fights it's to to try to push away the demons sure that are in their consciousness because of depression and there's another thing that goes along with that a lot of times they're rather combative and argumented that's a way of getting serotonin levels going I am creating some type of a little argumentum thing and then you get like all the company hormones that go along with the argument of nature yeah like me right now I come on fire it up about this yeah yeah but luckily you didn't take the punches to the head like yeah no yeah there's no punches to the bed when I was just reasoning today about this whole dirty drug thing going on the NFL how they just pumped these guys pull up painkillers for years and I'll here lidocaine oh yeah percocet everything the vicodin and having just on and on and on just tons of this stuff and these guys are suffering renal failure terrific horrific horrific stuff I mean I don't know if you had a son but you want him to play for I would not well I would rather have him fight I'd have my kid cuz I need your kids yeah judo any day over football and you could fight intelligently you could have a good camp let's just we could talk about down the podcast yeah that's actually good um but let's do it Jamie yeah I mean it's brutal yeah and now there's like over 500 players suing the NFL yeah let's talk about that let's talk about that changed this is this is this is so right I see the way it's curved so you can only pull that with one I can pull it with your right yes yeah yeah this is a stabilizer attach this on to it nicely also stabilize this so this is their site floors yeah yeah this is the stabilizer this sort of helps you balance it out while you're shooting and then this why should i here when it's the site yeah this is no joke well my thought is if you're going hunting you what it really helped me yeah you really should use the most powerful thing that you can and the issue really is that a lot of people think you know hey you know you don't need that kind of power and they there's a lot of criticism in the the Bo community the archer community of people who use like really heavy pound bows they think that you know you're being a meathead and it's not necessary in your your over bowed you know you don't need that much bow but I've kind of thought that through it I think what's a regular guy what was strong to a regular guy is not that strong to person who loose a lot of weight yeah for sure strength is relatively yeah for me to use a 90 pound book and a guy who's weak to use a sixty like why does he think that that this is harder for me to use than it is for any use of sixty like if you don't lift a lot of weights yeah so but it's so weird like these it's weird this ego thing that goes on this weird criticism thing like that's old that's great you don't need that why do you use that you don't need a but I really think it's because they can't do it so they have this weird thing they're happy I personally wouldn't want that though that would be as powerful as I could possibly pull that well come on over here I'll show you some got divorced in maiming and in takes it out the cards that I put the site tape on is that what this is for New York yeah this is from here right from this tree is pretty far offered no real authority arms if the cheerleader is any movement at all this is his we're indoor yeah there's a lot of charm here so what's a really long shotgun what's a really long shot I mean what's considered a long shot oh you have to be a real real mark a real Archer yeah [Music] I'll do this for hours once I get home this is kind of summative kind of at the end of it yeah once you get we just hit the swing of it it's kind of it's so interesting that when you're concentrating on the shop once you're locked in the word will goes away [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
