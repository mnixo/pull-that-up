when it comes to defending America it is not enough to merely have an American presence in space we must have American dominance in space so important very importantly I'm hereby directing the Department of Defense and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a space force as the sixth branch of the Armed Forces it's a big statement we are going to have the Air Force and we are going to have the space force separate but equal it is going to be something so important general Dunford if you would carry that assignment out I would be very greatly on look at Mike Pence my pence has this look on his face like I'm gonna be the president this motherfuckers gone completely crazy and I'm gonna be the president next that's is not of approval look at his face he's got the face of a guy who knows he's going to be the president I give you were about to be awarded something like there was some something you were about to get you know like wow I worked my whole life for this and here it is I'm gonna get that thing right now I'm gonna be the fucking president he must be like this guy is never gonna last eight years and for sure he's gonna win again I'm gonna be the president so you think for sure he wins again because is that because whoever the Democrats decide to put in is gonna be an equal turd sandwich again you're a super smart dude but you're also a bruton your big giant savage motherfucker right how many people have underestimated you because you're a big giant savage motherfucker plenty talk stupid to you and acted like you were a moron I'd say equal street fights two fights in the UFC yeah there's a lot of people right that and it just people in general like they'll get snotty I'm take stevia tree I'm going like my men but I think there's a certain part of us that might be doing that with him I don't think he is I think he's really good at winning this is this is not a not like a an endorsement of him no caveats necessary I'm horrified by this immigration policy of separating children from their parents I think that's subhuman his wife came out and and said that was bullshit yeah his wife's an immigrant bro his wife barely speaks English it's chaos right it's crazy I hate I hate all that stuff these are just families they're just people who love each other you got to keep them together if they break the law you keep them together get them out of here if you want I mean if you want to send them back to where they came from if you're you're hell-bent on that but taking them from their kids is subhuman I mean it's beyond it's not us it's not what we're doing in 2018 that aside all that aside he's probably kind of fuckin win again man I think he's probably gonna win again I think he he gets in these confrontations with people and they think he's a dolt I don't think he's a dolt I think he's there's no way he could be as successful he's been I know he's heads ups and downs and shit like that but like what he just just the way he was able to dismantle all those guys in those Republican debates it ain't all feet or no fucking dirt part on the part they had no business they had no business doing that with him they just were too emotionally tied up in his responses there was so much negativity and energy it was like there's all this anxiety like a fight where a guy's in full panic you know you seeing like street fights especially guys just go into full panic or even just talking shit in the schoolyard you know like yeah one guy's getting bullied bullies got the crowd watching him and the other guys like will but but your fuck you man you know nerve is like that it gonna work you know that's kind of that's what the rest of you look like Ted Cruz that's what they all look like he's just been doing this his whole life he's been talking shit his whole life you know and he's got a lot of fucking supporters and if the economy keeps doing good man it's gonna be a hard sell to put some guy in there like Bernie Sanders who you know all the right-wing people think just wants to give away all your money give away all your money to welfare brats even the left was protecting against that yeah right cuz there's still money on the left I should point out I know jack shit about politics this is very important to point out anybody that ever says you shouldn't be talking about politics that's crazy because anybody should be able to talk about whatever they want but what I shouldn't do is give anybody the impression that I know what I'm talking about cuz I definitely don't like if you had to get me to explain to you how Congress and the Senate works and how long the terms are and what's what's the cattle you know what what they have to do that'd be a sloppy ass fucking conversation right I'm no political expert you know like Mike Pence is no MMA expert you know I mean like he probably could tell you Conor McGregor is you know like that's probably like we have equal knowledge and government yeah but still you might win just in terms of like generally good yeah it's a game you definitely good look what it what is it it's a fucking game it's a game it's a very high stakes gigantic game where you're trying to win a popularity contest he won what do you think of the rock potentially becoming president when there that shit was that shit blew up and I was like wait a minute now if you look at the current state and it is a popularity contest and we want somebody who can literally rock the mic has the gift of gab yeah but then you also have somebody who's doing a manatorian shit is as famous as fucking anyone has ever been highest-paid dude in Hollywood he's so nice - yeah look at that guy in your you don't you don't question his character no he's right we dart yeah he's sweetheart you meet him in real life he's like that - oh he's a big motherfucker big giant motherfucker I think you could do it you can win he can win especially if he has Oprah's as VP and I'm not even fucking around not saying it's a good idea folks not what I'm saying I'm saying you don't think that the rock and Oprah could win but who would be the women would get super pissed off if the rock was the President and Oprah was VP Oprah would have to say look I see she's potentially next in line that's not a bad thing she's Mike Pence nodding an approval but she wanted yeah a lot of people would want her to be President Oprah to be the first female president to counter like the first celebrity president being Trump Oprah counters that with the first female celebrity president see that's a big win with the rock vvp in that situation it's tough to get the rock to take a fucking bag see yeah the rock is he's the rock it's tough to get him to take a back seat it would be fascinating to see what happens next that's what's gonna be I mean how we're gonna try to play this out how people are gonna play this out the popularity contest aspect of it because it's just okay if it really devolves into that you know it's like in here's it the other thing how much of his regulations are helping well and what and what do we do now it has really fucked up maybe permanent consequences to the earth that's true too right but what what stuff have they implemented other than I know they did offshore drilling right that concerned a lot of people and it was explained better to me about the the monuments and the private land I've read a bunch of different and publicly and rather I've read a bunch of different takes on that and essentially what they did is bring it back to where it was before the Obama administration changed it so it was it was listed a certain way and then when the Obama administration changed it they felt that was an overstep I don't know why hmm and it doesn't seem to be they haven't started any like mineral drills or oil drills or anything in these areas I don't know what they're doing I don't know I don't know if they're really just trying to deregulate things more they feel like the government overstepped their boundaries or if they really have nefarious ideas they're trying like figure out a way to get some oil out of a Salmon River Hotel yeah man I mean there was that one place we've discussed it before up in Alaska where a lot of people are concerned that there was going to be some drilling that takes place near near where salmon live like close enough that if it fucked up it could destroy this River and it fucks up that's the probably the best way to say it right because if if we're if we don't do anything about it I say if you put a pipeline in the earth and you pump oil through it and we don't do anything we just leave it there just leave it there and we don't you know we don't visit it for 5,000 years this is what that gonna be like so what does that mean it means you got to keep fixing it okay so you put a hole you put a giant tube through the earth and you're pumping toxic ooze out of this tube and sometimes it gets into rivers and it fucking kills everything and there's you want to run this fuck you want to run this tube under the river okay and then what are you gonna do like how many every year every five years would how long how often do you check in and when you replace shit how long those tubes last I don't know they gotta check it out I almost got into that what happens if there's an earthquake and those tubes break fuck city Wyatt how does that work I don't know jack-shit about how they pump the oil out do you what were you gonna say well it's some I mean it's a weird thing if we know for sure they're gonna one day break like we're making that toxic pipeline we know for sure it's gonna the Earth's gonna just absorb it right everything fucking yeah everything have you seen them show like a five-year depiction of what would happen to our bridges if we stopped painting yeah yeah it looks like it happens overnight wasn't there a show about this called life after humans or yes yeah was that unlike NatGeo or discovery something something like that yeah there's a bunch of spots particularly look at the Southern California deadliest quake may have been caused by oil drilling Jesus Christ 1933 doesn't Oklahoma now have a ton of earthquakes from fracking yeah but how could they know this because earthquakes happen out here I wonder how they know this hmm study written by two leading US Geological Survey science scientists in Pasadena shout out to Pasadena and be published in The Bulletin of seismic Society of America on Tuesday also suggest that three other earthquakes including magnitude 5.0 earthquakes in 1920 in Englewood and 1929 and Whittier may have also been linked to oil drilling whoa I don't know maybe maybe we live in California right both maybe both maybe it gave it a little bump but it was happening anyway fuck knows but it is it's weird that's a weird one the weirdest one for sure is nuclear power plants that's the weirdest one because they can't shut him off when you had a Shane Smith on he was talking about that kid that made a nuclear reactor in his garage yeah like 17 years old yeah he's like 22 now or 23 works for the government what did they do they tracked him by the materials that he was perfect in city block when he when he turned but he was doing like fusion he could do was that he could refine uranium oh geez he knew how to fucking mine it get all the materials in d-17 that was at 17 he's 22 now or 23 that since but he can take the used reactors and and basically like a handheld battery like you'd have on an RC car that can power an entire city for ten thousand years each one of those what's that's what Smith was saying I'm saying though that's what Shane Smith was saying this guy has that technology and of course you know they're there to get a little Eddie Bravo ish you know there's there's big companies that don't want to see that happen but he's supported by Elon Musk and another other big-time dudes don't want to see it happen well he would be the thing you I don't know if once those nuclear reactors get up and running like the old-style ones like Fukushima I don't know if they have like a way to shut those down you know I think they need ironically enough I think they need power to shut him down wasn't that like a big part of the problem with Fukushima what they couldn't cool it they couldn't keep it cool mm-hmm dude they can't shut him off like that is the crazy they've only had them for if you stop and think about the amount of time humans have been alive it's only been like 50 years 60 years since like nuclear powers everywhere like what does the bend the year for the bomb was dropped it was at 45 is that in 1945 I don't know before my time bomb was dropped was it 45 Hiroshima and Nagasaki I think that's right I was looking up that they shut down power plants in Florida when the hurricane went through last year nuclear power plants yeah I think new ones they can I don't think they could shut down the Fukushima one or I think that was just damaged by the water so badly that whatever their shutdown thing didn't work but there's no like there's no way to shut it down now now it's the fucking total meltdown disaster I mean they've tried to come up with all sorts of ways to store this shit day I think one of them was dig a giant hole pour all the waste in there and keep it frozen that doesn't sound good that sounds like a really bad you're gonna put it in like this giant vat and they were gonna have this vat like supercooled to some like ridiculous low degree and and do something correct me if I'm wrong this sounds like I'm making this up I bet Paul Stamets could come up with a way to fix that how would you fix that mushrooms eat all the nuclear waste dude that he did that he had the TED talk a six ways mushrooms will save the world and was that one of his one of them was oyster mushrooms eating away all spills so he fucking has like three giant vats of toxic waste I wouldn't say toxic like garbage and they're all coated in oil and he does different things to two of them and then on the third one he puts oyster mushroom spores in there and they cover them and the other two distinct the fucking hell like they get worse over time the oyster mushrooms grow and they grow black as the oil starts to be absorbed by them then breakdown every single carbon in the oil until eventually the oyster mushroom becomes white again and it's fucking edible Wow lately breaks it down and these are giant oyster mushrooms like just fucking massive dude you're gonna get BP cocky we spell it we got some fucking mushrooms we're good give us three months damn could you imagine a giant oil spill out in the ocean and then the scientists drop like billions of spores what is this I don't know as they are might not work in the ocean which kajan if they did do it and it did work and you see these fucking building size mushrooms just sucking oil out of the ocean to be awesome it'll be crazy and then they turn white and they become edible and then just got to figure out how to do that with psilocybin and we're golden oh yeah oh that would be an easy fix to find some way to blend the two of them together don't cry little crossbreed could they do that I know they do that with plants right they got to be able to do that huh how do they do that with plants because it you know someone told me that blew me away that there was they were they were making pistachio trees and they were binding them somehow another two avocado trees and they were making them like grow together to make like a sturdier branch structure and what I've seen do that you have mixed trees I know here they have mixed trees but they're from the same like phylum I don't know if that's right they're close enough genetically related but you'd have like one base of the tree that has the roots and then different branches on that tree grow different fruit why and you can have four different fruit styles on one tree like peaches plums apricots all from one tree Wow dude I had no idea you can buy that shit at Costco I believe you I had no idea though I would have assumed that I would assume that like a tomato has to be in a tomato tree you know you can't splice in tomato juice apple tomato might not work but as far as fruit trees so let me call though to do that and maybe you could do that with Tomatoes maybe could have beefsteak on one side and cherry on the other yeah right possible but you have it all mixed up together yeah it's just what a strange life-form plants are you know the bizarre compared to us it's thing that lives alongside of us cleans our air for us cleans our air like New York without Central Park would be so much grosser probably right yeah hundred percent have to be like all the carbon in the air and carbon dioxide all the fuck just all the people breathing everyone around you there's so many people everyone just breathing you know you're gonna like a soup of people breathing on the subway and in buildings and you know people are so jammed next to each other where they're walking by they just breathing each other's air that is such a weird way that people decided to live yeah it is weird we were just out there for a product development we're gonna get to go out to different conferences and shit so when autistic caucus new jersey' they're like a giant supplement conference where they have it's basically like people that do the science they figure out something really cool but they're not big enough named to take it to the masses so they we come in along with other companies we look for different things that are backed by science piece it all together and create something new so we're doing that by day and then we head over to New York by night and it was cool but it was like it's a fucking madhouse he's an absolutely insane to think that people live on that tiny little island they love it yeah it definitely buzzes it's got its got its own fucking energy for sure for sure for sure and it's a little hostile there's a hostility to that the comedy there is its it sort of exemplifies that New York comedies always been some of the best comedy in the country like always it's always been some of the best comics came out in New York and a lot of them are like super hyper aggressive like a lot of them like real insult comedians like that kind of you know is that style of shedding each other it's like they're they're aggressively like that it's but it's like Patrice O'Neal is probably like the best at it he was so fucking good he was so fucking good he exemplifies that New York style what the fuck are you wearing man what the fuck is that shirt and then who is just me attack and it was beautiful it was beautiful it was but it was fun it was all like in good fun and playful and but that New York style is it's like a harder style like a more aggressive style yeah even families talk to each other differently there yeah yeah yeah oh shit talking well you know I've tried to figure this out myself because my grandparents were immigrants but I figured the way I was thinking is like if you really thought about the kind of people that were taking a chance to come across the ocean and get here in like 1920 like these were wild desperate people like this was a different kind of human they were they're a Wilder type of human being and then to go from that wild type of human being to like a regular person in 2018 it's only been a couple of generations those places is where the people stayed so the people landed there first and then although how the Polish and the Jewish and the Italian and the Puerto Ricans and all these different different fucking ethnic groups just piled in together just buzzin and a lot of people went let's go west let's fuckin go west and they landed over here and this is why California is like quite a bit more mellow you know quite a bit more laid-back and even the comedy the comedians are more friendly there's not like but there is a great roast battle scene up here - they do those roast battle shows those things are pretty goddamn good I love the roasts they get nasty with each other you guys sit in the back of the Comedy Store and talk shit yeah we talk shit to each other but it's fun it's practice it's like you're making other comedians laugh thank you awesome though to be a fly on the wall watching a bunch of comedians just talk shit to each other not even worried about other people not trying to make anybody laugh but themselves we all talk shit and less joeys around then when Joey's around just try to get them riled up when Joey's around my main goal is trying to get him angry about something and just just hear him go off and that's when the magic happens it's got to be something you got to bring up some fucking band he doesn't like or some food that's bullshit next thing you know he's thrown at his arms back in these fucking somebody somebody orders the ranch sauce with their salad yeah fucking chicken wings with chicken wings yeah just that one statement it's blue cheese with wings or go fuck your mother and it's just the way says it too so when when we're in the back and Joey's back there we just let Joey rant we just try to get him riled up I mean we'll have conversations with them it was just once to have a conversation but half the time it's like a game of you know you're hanging around with the funniest guy ever if you get that guy to laugh and get that guy to make everybody laugh just fucking poke and prod yeah just have fun with them but he would always do that like no one could figure that out we do these gigs in the road and right before Joey would go on say she get mad at us he get mad a through whatever reason he goes you guys with this fucking laptop and this bullshit in the fucking dream that's the fucking grain rope like the grump a the green bro so what you gonna do you gonna showing the dick you're gonna do it anyway to click go into this thing like how deep how deep you gonna get into this fucking internet life let these fucking people behind the scenes we just go off and they were like why is Joey so man but he's kin fired up to go on stage so he does comes back is not mad at you who's this he just decides like this is what it's gonna be bastards like I was just trying to do some emails I'm just streaming on on YouTube what's his deal what the fuck is this dreaming what the fuck is that what the fuck are these kids doing with the fucking streamer and the next thing you know boom bang everybody's on the floor dying laughing he would get fired up and then you go on stage already at ten you know there's a really smart thing just get mad just get annoyed right before you go on stage just kidding no I did anything what kind of fucking mustard is this what what got Joe Rogan what kind of fucking mustard is this back in Jersey they had the mustards with the seeds that fucking brown dirty looks like it came out of someone's asshole and he would just whatever it was he would just start ranting about it and get angry and then you'd go onstage like at 10:00 so it could be anything man it could be a fucking TV show that tejani doesn't like it could be the pair of sneakers you wearing baby I don't like the way you're doing your notes he'll just the same yelled at me once for having a notebook I came to the improv had a fucking notebook and he was what are you doing with the fucking notebook and I go it's nuts why I keep my notes he's like what do you want everybody know you're right and carry this fucking notebook around you're doing it to show the world that you take your job seriously but not writing carry that notebook man encouraged notebooks I'm all I'm pro notebook you guys got the notepad right here dude shut down don't look at 90% of it there's a lot of stuff in here though I have no idea what the fuck I wrote but occasionally I feel like one day I'm gonna get E I'm gonna be I'm gonna wise up but I'm gonna go in here and I'm gonna go over these notes and something's gonna make some sense but nope all looks like nonsense chicken scratch some nonsense page after page of it Kyle Kingsbury do you take notes like life notes yeah kind of I mean I have two journals that I use for psychedelic ceremonies shit like that and then my desk is it's kind of a fucking joke I mean it's just covered in post-its and I'll just jot shit down on who I'm gonna have on the podcast or this supplement that I want to try and what dose that I tried it at that kind of shits and some kind of office guinea pig just any any bullshit but they're fucking everywhere have you ever had an adverse reaction as an office guinea pig it out many many times I was at a meeting with Aubrey and I forget the guys that were there but there was some bigwig guys and uh you know I show up and he's like hey you don't alright and I was like ah no no not doing good and I'd taken um I'd taken this form of berberine that lowers blood sugar kind of works like metformin dr. Peter T has talked about that before on your show and suppose dealt with ketone production and just inflammation on that good shit but I took way too much I kind of eyeballed it just I got cocky yeah yeah probably three times the dose I mean it just fucking sunk me and I'm like I'm already in ketosis I should be fine and I went pale as a ghost and he's like why I was got a couch in his offices well just lay on the couch for a minute you know so I laid down there fucking full body sweat it got worse oh and I just listened and I was like ah yeah kind of close to fucking throwing up but and that's like one of probably ten how can you I ball things you're a smart guy yeah that's true well I've shit my pants from my ball and MCT oil multiple occasions so we talked about that last but alas dude's got so mad yeah I'll try your dart and shoot my fucking pants and not take MCT oil you don't have to or you can do it intelligently and fucking measure your dose and not get ballsy you know but if you're if you're in the average human being let's just say you're an intelligent let's be super honest about this if you're an intelligent healthy person that eats a reasonably balanced diet you still have a 1% chance of shitting your pants every day you think it's that high no no I have to revise my numbers maybe 1/10 of 1% one in a thousand one in a thousand days so if it's one in ass out like the one in three years you got a there's a likelihood I think I'm living right if I shit my pants once every three years it for you yeah glad you said that not me yeah yeah if I don't push the envelope you know yeah exactly yeah I'm not playing it safe nope not playing it safe that's odd yeah it's weird that certain foods that are good for you will also make you your pants if you do it wrong so like your body wants this real nice balance you want a real nice balance of nutrients don't get fucking crazy with this stuff come on don't get crazy with that what's all this oil oh you want diarrhea you want diarrhea motherfucker Wow your body says I'm not dealing with this let's just flush it out the problem is that you think it's a fart and you should know better you know it's like oh that feels like air we're good to let this out and then it's not some old underwear yeah well not good then you got to drive home with your hips off the yes eat the whole way it's good exercise dough for your lower pelvic mm-hmm activate loosen up the front side male kegels you're kind of doing a Kegel holding it back yeah you you are definitely yeah just stand puckered for an extended period of time like women to do that competitively do you know that there's like competitions yeah those are some dedicated people like I would imagine most girls like or like vagina is great by itself you don't really have to squeeze it until it becomes muscular you can train it so if you can't you know you can't but it's like training the brain you can but how many people do it I would like to know I was there was an anonymous thing where women can answer I bet one percent how many of them squeeze their pussy all the time and just do exercise I was like look at this girl she's got some stuff up or poon Ana and then she's carrying weights around and she's doing yoga regular setting vaginal weight lifter what's wrong with the pants well there's a hole in the middle of it where that rope goes through that's one thing it's that's a rough-looking rope tube man that's like a rope that you would you'd tie like a dog to a tree with rope that's a fucking rope man he's not bad I don't I really don't like the pants this it's nice that she's moving through different positions you know she's not just standing there hitting chi-gong with it in there she's actually she's working it this is the sexual equivalent to you taking that overdose of those pills or of the that's that shadow too yeah yeah actually quit is exactly the sexual equivalent because you don't want to get jerked off by the Hulk okay I don't know knock it until you've tried it I would just come I would I would enter that and roll the dice and see how strong that is what if she grabs it like your fist any like oh Jesus she's like PI May when he takes the arm do you want your cock back like absolutely it hurts like hey hey well it's still gonna be wet right hopefully sure yeah I mean everything seems to be in working order yeah yeah that's a weird thing to want to be able to do to carry the most weight with your pussy fuck you you'd like to see like how did it go from that being a thought in your mind to one day I'll be the queen one day I will carry the most to like put it a putting it on YouTube and figuring out a way to put it on YouTube we have pants that have a hole in them you started somewhere yeah but I'm willing to bet that seed was planted early on in life probably too early mm-hmm maybe I don't know ma'am different strokes for different folks right if that's what you're into doing some people play tennis some people are world record pussy weight holders what the fuck man okay if dudes could grow their dicks for sure if there was an exercise you've talked about that if they're tribes in Africa where they hang shit from there they like a got a penis head piercing and they hang different weights from their cock yeah there is some of that right who stretch it out and I'm like that's the same they do like dick games where though they'll be semi-hard and they kind of worked those muscles on top of the cock to flex the the weight up and down yeah but if that was like as straightforward so like the the penis has to be erect in order for it to be hard and if it's erect and hard like if it's not a muscle you could work out yeah you know I'm saying it's more about just stretching it yeah like but if you had a weight lifting exercise for the dick like a bicep girl you have big the fucking lime at the gym would be if someone invented that no one would be waiting in line for the Stairmaster right they would be waiting in line to get on that that dick building machine just right these dudes with their pants around their ankles stuffed into a glory hole with a some kind of weight on the other side proportionately like what percentage of girls that lift weight go immediately to booty exercises is it a hundred any kind of squat rack or anything crazy yeah that's where you gonna find the girls that really want to put on that booty mass right that's like a high percentage do you think the dick strengthener would make it shorter and fatter do would be dick strengthening gyms everywhere but would it turn you into a coke can no I think it would it would have to be like you could grow it out like you could he could actually create more tissue what is this what he's showing us I can't find the name of this movie nice try and hang like Asian weeks yeah from his dick in the girls I can't believe this what is the name of this movie Kimba I couldn't find the name it's got to be a parody but she's got to keep him hard there's a black guy look at him like what the fuck damn they keep stacking kettlebells on his dick but if there was something like that like something like a glute/ham machine you know something that just targeted the deck you should talk to rogue I don't think it's gonna work you'd have one in here probably start playing with prototypes a lot of the people are gonna send you one if anybody's gonna figure it out it's gonna be Ben Greenfield it's probably gonna be some fucking well you know I had him on on its podcast after uh after he was on yours the first time and and I was like you know what do you want to talk about and we're in the sauna on it and I'm like I want to talk stem cells and he's like listen no more dick stem-cell talk because no I don't want to be known as the dick stem cell guy and I was like well yeah you went on the wrong show but uh you know I still we still talk stem cells and obviously you know we were chatting before the show it's it's fucking rat cool we get to talk about the intravenous stem cells that he did Oh Jamie show me some more dudes tying weights to the end of their dicks on YouTube Oh God Jamie this is not good that's at the base of his cock and he was holding onto the shaft while he was Oh Micah knit us and then he gets up and he be like his blessings to everybody blessings I carried the large wok with my cock yes that is part of that video you can have that win like fate or after it's over no expression on the face just like yeah I know it is the weirdest way to pick up a rock with your dick and then end it what she gets up well um is that writing is that Indian is that Hindu I think yeah I think Hindi Hindus the religion Hindi's the writing is that what it is um look how they just allowed to show his cock and balls I think because it's like because it's nature it's a feat of strength there was another video I did not pull up that was direct like showing you how to do this kind of stuff with weights and kudos to YouTube for allowing this look at this he just grabbing the honker at the very end he's got the Rope wrapped around the middle and homeboys just gonna pick up this rock he's gotta widen that squat stance yeah look at this blessings and the cock of death blessings he's got he's figured out a way to lift weights with his dick like he's actually doing it and he seemed to be erect there people seem to be there to see him to children he's famous he's the famous dick weight guy do you think he has pupils does he really take on just like what a great reality show that would be he has to he can't take that to the grave with him yeah you have some dude who was born with a small penis and you send him to this guy to the master apprentice in India and he just starts going through all the rituals the stones and the dick and the sticks and there's got to be more to it oh these guys I've seen this price using weights to enlarge your penis they're swinging oh Christ that looks like 10 pounds totosai to five-pound plates is that bolo Chong from bloodsport or that's a woman Wow they're not moving their hips are using the dick there they're using dick muscle that is so crazy so they have something tied to their dick we can't see it because they have some sort of a skirt over it for people that are listening it literally looks like a skirt and then the Rope is making this weight swing like a pendulum in between their legs and there they're not using their hips they're doing it all with their dick muscles now they're practicing kicking in the balls very important to let a guy kick you in the balls what these guys blow testicles all the time right up I know at least two or three guys that were kicked and blew out a testicle in a fight or no training mostly I heard of it in training I mean I'm sure it's probably happened in fights too but definitely in training one of them one of the military's I'm a real promising kid how'd it happen to him I'm trying to place his name did it end his career I do not know god I'm really apologized for now remembers now I want to say Brian Foster said who it was he has a fun you have seen a long time but in training he got it got kicked kicked low and he didn't have a cup on it's like one more round when went that kind of deal okay I will spar one more round fuck it and WHAM I never understood that when guys wouldn't wear cups and sparring so crazy don't roll the dice there it's too risky did you wear Everywhere's tie steel cup cane was big into that but I didn't like that it went up your asshole yeah you know I was like plus they're smaller you know like they don't like the American ones comes away with the bragging the same understand it looked like it looked like it'd be in a tight spot that's all yeah well you know can't make a cup for a hundred and forty pound Thai guy and then make that same cut fit on gorillas like yourself it's just you need a bigger Cup it's just part of it I just your glove I like that there was a little bit of space that's all I'm saying do you have um is it like that leather thick padding around the edges of it no so like like when it goes into you it doesn't go into road rate right yeah I was like the rubber with a hard plastic like a baseball cub guys like those there was this dude amia rena Vardi he was one of bas Rutten 's protegees always to train with him in Eddie's place and he'd mount you and he had that fucking steel Cup and it would be like he was crushing your sternum with his dick it was Luber uncomfortable it was not fun he was very good at that he would get mount on you and just crush you down like you you lean it's like unnatural leverage and armbars as well when you go over that steel cup like you got a metal thing that you're bending someone's arm against it's a big deal it's a really big deal if you think about it I mean you would think like wait a minute even a regular armbar hold on you're pulling is armed into your balls like what the fuck yeah you are you're your dick and balls are resting on someone's arm when you give them an armbar that is just a fact if you don't like that fact your goal in fact is to get your dick and balls to rest on this guy's arm but you're not thinking about that you're thinking of getting your hips down on them getting that arm in between your legs or getting a arm in between your arms in your legs extending your body but if you have a steel cop there you got this crazy fulcrum you get this weird leverage point it's made out of metal it's a fucking metal piece so instead of having vulnerable balls you have this thing you know you have illegal a lever you could snap shit better Mike Swick could pop my rib out eight days before a fight with this Cup this one right here damn it's still fucked up yeah it reset that way Wow it's from those goddamn steel cups right yeah yeah I mean the swiggity n-- and just doug is his cup was right at under a rim and I was dead tired last last round of training of the entire fight camp and popped it out I wonder how controversial I'm so out of the loop when it comes to grappling grappling competitions wonder um how legal they are I wonder if they're allowed to use them at all I wish I was you know I don't think they get to to use cups of any sort interrupted any sort yeah well that would be crazy I would want to wear a cup I've been smashed in the nuts before in training I don't get - I don't think it's allowed wow that's crazy yeah no cups at all because of that fulcrum point probably yeah yeah must be it's crazy that your dick would become an advantage like you know like that area instead of like being like one object changes what that is so it goes from being like a super vulnerable area to oh if I get you there you know even like north-south like canid happening in north-south and just fucking dig it on the side of my face oh geez an insurance also it there too but I mean really that yeah it would fuck me up yeah you got a metal bar driving in your face a real piece of metal and if you kick those fucking things you pay for it like if you kick those things and you slap it with your instep it's like it you might as well be kicking a rock or kick in the bottom of someone's elbow worse than young Jamie running down the mountain in his Vibrams yeah young Jamie tried to go barefoot you running which ones you go would you get the vevo barefoot swords of vivos yeah super thin super super thin yeah yeah I got in checks I have two different pairs of those I got one that has like a lot of tread that's like I got a good thick amount of tread and then another one that has less and then the one that has last like you could feel the difference when you run like these real slippery steep slopes I need something where I can dig in if I'm trying to like sprint up to the top of the hill and I want to be worried about my footing I want to be I'm tired at that point - I'm going all the way up this fucking Evo dude are they toes or they have full coverage full coverage see I like that better for for running yeah you know you stub your toe on shit you can't watch where you have to like when I wear I like the vibram so I wear them all the time I don't have an endorsement with any of these people I don't have any kind of deals but what I like about the vibes is for sure it feels like you you're moving more with your pinkies like your pinky toes and the other toes they're like they were aware that they have a job whereas I feel like when I wear even barefoot shoes that are full coverage I feel like they're like they're lazy they just along for the ride yeah we just take a break yeah we'll take a break but whereas I feel all that shit activated I might it might be just in my head but when I run with five finger shoes on our trail run with those things on I feel like my foot is moving just a wee bit more than even regular barefoot shoes something about having all those little fuckers free like that and they've they're feeling the dirt the way they're supposed to like they're there they're moving together the same way your hands move together when you grab while you're falling gravel or something like that your hand you know it moves together it's it's it's it's thinking of how to cushion blows and how to stop something that's coming your way and how to kind of interact with with space where's your foot is just kind of clubbing the ground all the time I feel like with those shoes the one thing I'm aware of is that the foot is acting like is in it all the little individual muscles are helping to push me around you know it's massive I've noticed that on I mean I walk wearing them right now and I wear them all the time right now no one walks around with them yeah once I started walking them on a long-term basis especially doing longer walks and jogs like there's a clear-cut difference yeah you have to be mindful of every fucking step you take yeah especially if they're thinner sold you know they make some fix old ones for for trail running or whatnot yeah I use those I use those I only time I use the really thin ones or at the gym mm-hm but yeah those are the ones I have Jamie there you just got to watch out for like sharp rocks then I don't have to watch out for sharp rocks and the other ones like if I'm running and something's kind of funky and it's I gotta go I don't to land on that I gotta look yeah you got them here tension yeah but with those other ones I could just kind of hustle and breathe all right but maybe that's not as good maybe it's better to do it that way you know maybe it engages your brain more forces you to think and make decisions while you're exhausted actually it might be better now that I'm thinking about it might be a better thing to do as a workout you're more present too yeah you're not thinking about other bullshit it's kind of like you know when we're talking about archery or the cold baths or any of these things it's Al's Yin but I think part of it for some people with running is like that getting into the zone thing that you do you know when you start getting a pace going and just get into that zone when you don't want to think about any of extraneous shit and if you're doing that watching every step you take is there is it possible I'm just throwing this out there that would like inhibit you from getting into the zone cuz you'd have to be too conscious about every step you're taking maybe I mean I'm sure everyone's different right but for me when I do that I don't feel I feel like it draws me into the zone right because if I can just run on a fucking treadmill I'm not worried about where my feet go that kind of thing and then my mind will wander then right because I don't have to pay attention and I'll start thinking about other shit especially if it's an easy run mm-hmm my mind wander then it's not dialed in because it doesn't have to be yeah what kind of cardio machines do you use if any well one that I really like I mean all I can use right now cuz my knees fucked is the ski urgh and I like that operate and I'll get on those and do some sprint work we're saying you have a was an MCL tear or notice yeah thankfully no surgery required with that placement but and so you got some stem cells on that yeah we did stem cells what did they do last week we did umbilical stem cells intranasal IV and in the knee with glutathione the name the knee didn't hurt like I thought the fucking injection was gonna hurt like they're gonna wiggle it in with some long-ass needle but that wasn't bad the pressure once it goes in that fucking hurt um stem cells fix my left knee I was having problems with my left knee for years I had a ACL reconstruction on that knee and on that knee they took some meniscus out as well it's always been a problem like whenever I would work out real hard like 2 or 3 days in a row it was always sore like I'd walk around was just sore it was being and then I have to warm it up to get going one session with umbilical cord stem cells and then I gave it a long time off and I never had a problem with it again like yeah literally went away it's like one of those things where I had a problem now I have a problem anymore like Hill running kicking the bag whatever I'm doing using that echo bike or the verse of clam or anything I'm doing with my knees no problems yeah I'm just babying it now but we work with this guy dr. Craig Conover who did the stem cells been doing vitamin IVs at on it for us and he's a fucking Savage we'll do like the nav treatments about green phil was telling me really really it is this shit as fuck tell me about it it feels like we get it done in IV what's in what's the name stand for again I think it's nicotinamide adenine adenine adenosine nicotine addendum adenosine dinucleotide there we go damn anyways Marty it's a fuckin it's it's basically food for the mitochondria and you can influence that pathway through fasting hot and cold therapy high intensity intervals different things like that but just to get it mainlined into your fucking body it feels like someone's got their hand on your stomach and they're slowly turning it it doesn't feel good you fucking sweat if people have nasal issues this knee does it feel like it's turning stomach well I think the idea is that because it influences mitochondrial biogenesis it's gonna kill off any old mitochondria that need to go but you hear that in the gut and then you get new ones and over time I mean we front-load this four to eight days in a row and by the end of the front front-loaded every single day you do it for eight days why then you only need it like once a month or once every two weeks after that right little touch-ups after every single day yeah every single day you're getting gutwrench yeah but by the end of it you feel better so because you've gotten rid of most the bad shit and again that's theory it's not I mean this is brand-new stuff here we got to be sue mostly sciences on rats let me let me say that this is the science rats is always like a weird thing to say but I'll tell you that the feeling the feeling is is there's no fucking doubt it works I mean anything that influences mitochondria influences everything that's energy for your brain cognitive function heart lungs the whole nine Greenfield was saying that he had the mitochondria the like when they the telomere lengths when they you know check his telomere length yeah that his biological age is 20 so he went from he went he started yeah and listen to him he had the teller years guy on right and that's so I did the same test and his biological age was 36 and his chronological age was 34 and I'm like this motherfucker who was home-schooled K through 12 and it's an Ironman triathlete it's two years old or biologically than chronologically where the fuck am i I went to ASU did all the bad drugs get hit in the head fucking countless times I gotta it's got to be bad so at 35 when I did mine biological age of 41 well and I'm like fuck so but right after he did the systemic stem cells through the IV that dropped him from 36 to 20 years old biologically and and how many did he do how many sessions did he I don't know I think it was just after the first one I know he's done him more and he did different stem cells so why you why you guys doing it so many days in a row for the NAD yeah well the idea of front-loading you know these to say that with creatine I think that's been debunked but there are certain substances especially with how they influence you can really ramp up and change the body dramatically and then after that you just need little touch-ups here and there but you know I just feel like would you feel like effort with the anyd yeah I was I was like I know I won't really be able to look at this like a quantified self you know I'm not gonna be able to take numbers and shit so what I did was I put myself through the meat grinder I hadn't really been training a lot and since you know working my first real nine-to-five kind of thing and I trained twice a day busted out the old altitude machine was doing altitude every day hot and cold you know I got the dual sauna on it I do the cold baths at home in all during that process because we got the little the little guy I wasn't sleeping well so put myself through all that my fucking cardio went through the roof I never got sick I recovered well so I knew it worked and on top of that you know cognitive function memory retention everything was fucking scaling up a notch and cardio yeah fuck yeah your cardio ramped up anything that influences mitochondria affects fucking all of it that's ATP throughout your entire body and it's brain - you know people think of like oh alright you know that's one of the one of the reasons they're looking at creatine right now is a nootropic because it influences ATP and the brett every fucking thing in your body runs on ATP have they done Studies on this yet I think Greenfield might be a better guy to ask but I'm pretty certain that they've verified that create helps helps the brain now makes sense if it helps muscles I mean if it helps blood flow I mean I mean it's old there's there's got to be a bunch of different things if it's fucking cyber energy it's celery cellular energy yeah that's all ATP is right so everything runs on that one thing and and you're good there whether you're in ketosis or you're eating carbohydrates it's all going back to ATP it's crazy it's crazy you could do that you could have someone inject something into you and all of a sudden you get this like this recharge state and then there's the debate okay is this healthy cuz it what's the long term well yeah I spend then all the shit you know it's funny because of the drawbacks I have a certain amount of followers online then you know you go to a company like on it and you have it's magnified right by a hundred by a thousand whatever and you know anytime I post shit cuz I'll do stuff online for like the bio hack of the week at the life hack of the week and sometimes it's just run-of-the-mill you know go for a fucking farmers walk with some weights in your hand or keep it kettlebell in your trunk and then you can always work out whatever or sometimes it's more technology-based and we get a lot of shit on anything technology-based and of course the argument then is well I believe I can get everything I need from a good diet and good nutrition and movement and I don't need to inject shit to be healthy and it's like yeah but I like green fields model you know like you have one foot and ancestral living and one foot and the benefits of modern science yeah why wouldn't I suck with that I think that's a smart way to approach it I think we have a real problem and we always have as human beings being tribal and I'm on tribe natural I'm all natural bro you know no take I'm not into hormones I'm not you know I don't need my cell phone man I'd rather leave it alone and then we've got tribe science who think that you know that science is gonna figure everything out and nature ain't shit and yes we're better than nature we're smarter that's forward and that's obviously the extremes of each end but people just tend to fuck it do that man there was the most ridiculous video that i retweeted from barstool I think it was barstool just find out who i retweeted it from so he can give him credit on their Instagram but there's a was it barstool it was a video at a baseball game and one side was saying right-field sucks and the other side was singing left field sucks and they would yell it out on Twitter here we go one Joe right field socks yeah everybody got pumped up and the people over here like left field sorry people are so stupid they would sit the team that shot on the left side is the best like they here it is play this is it a barstool our barstool sports shout-out to barstool sports on Instagram but I gotta say if I was there I'd enjoy every second of that especially if I had a couple beers and a hot dog in me I've been yelling at - yeah I mean that's that's what's fun right and they're all rooting for the same team who knows how do they do that no they don't fucking split the sides on a home does anybody regain they do that in soccer it might happen there might be a section but there's still people all over the place but for both teams yeah yeah so they're not rooted on the same team but like conceivably they could just go that it proved my point even further though because now you have both you know say it's Cubs and and Giants got Cubs fans and Giants fans sitting on the right field both yelling to the left field the left field sucks yeah and Cubs and Giants fans on left field both yelling it to right field it's bringing people together Joe Rogan's true hate yeah at least it's fake hate you know they don't really think those people suck I'm sure I'll sat them down as individuals and said what do you really think about these random people on the right like oh they're just folks that are sitting over there watching the baseball game is this a parallel politics for life my friend for all of this life no probably right it's probably something to that that might be also why Trump could win again he can win he'll suck well anybody that believes that he won't win again they're the same people that believed he stood no chance of winning the first time dude I took a photo of Jake Tapper on TV when the results were being read because he was you know doing one of them report things and he had through the entire election he was like really very very obviously in angst at the thought of this guy being president and then when he finally became president Jake Tapper's face it's just like it's so classic it's it's one of those moments where you like Jesus Christ like I'm never gonna forget that guy's face when Trump was elected because it was just like what the fuck is this crazy face I mean if everything works out nobody dies no extra people died because of trumping president this would be a very fascinating time to study be a very fascinating time I think there's ever been a time like this man drug laws are relaxing all over the place they're pushing MDMA through maps is to get it to use use for therapy for soldiers with PTSD and it works remarkably well it works better than fucking anything I've been able to guide a couple of those sessions couples therapy sessions not the PTSD sessions let's have inline fucking incredible I mean I watched a breakup happen with that and I've never seen people break up prior to that so I don't really have the comparison but just seeing it's it's hard opening medicine you know and I know that you haven't had great experiences with it in the past but this pharmaceutical shit is a whole different no I didn't have a bad experience I only had a bad experience with the come that comes yeah there is no come down with the pharmaceutical I mean fucking zero and I I mean how'd it diminishes your I've spoken to Rick Doblin about this twice serotonin yeah and the thing is you know as with any is I know it's not a true psychedelic but with any psychedelic what are the true psychedelic true psychedelic like Michael Pollan say would be like a tryptamine based psychedelic the classical psychedelics you look at hallucinations yeah and you're thinking of things like mushrooms LSD you know watch Huma peyote ayahuasca DMT those kind of things would be more traditional you know what man I would I would honestly say that I think in high doses edible marijuana is a psychedelic yeah yeah there's no doubt no doubt I really I mean I've heard people argue against that I'm like man I don't know I think in high doses when you're when you close your eyes and and lie down like sit down on a couch on a high dose you're really really flying I've had visuals from fucking gorilla glue just smoking gorilla glue my wife and I both what do you mean gorilla glue it's a strain gorilla busting kids it's the name yeah I'm not gonna be a good father it fucking full-blown full-blown you know you can get a man if you get high enough McKenna used to say that the way to do it was to not get high for long periods of time and then smoke as much as you can handle in one setting that's not my jam I've been using uh 1 1 milligram THC spray and I'm microdose cannabis fairly often just in just in the evening and it helps with sleep but this MDMA man it's a whole fucking different ballgame I think yeah I think you should try if I can request at some point you try the pharmaceutical grade MDMA just to know what it's all about because Rick Doblin was saying you give it you give it space like you would with a classical hallucinogen you're not supposed to fucking go back to work the next day or do a bunch of bullshit tedious drawn back in the real world give it space Journal meditate throw on some easy listening music and rest and if you do that you're fine because in there protocol they're not allowed to use anything else but the MDMA so I asked him like why don't you guys have a protocol for 5-htp vitamin C different things we know help build back the neurotransmitter support you may have lost and he said just with the finagling with the FDA and everything they have to go through he says it's fucking impossible but if we give him that day off they're gold and then of course New Moon yeah plug on it again was designed for that experience to be able to curtail any kind of come down I've had zero issues after using the pharmaceutical grade what was the original name of it roll-on roll-off or what was like that yeah it was something like that yeah he was 5htp boosters like I mean 5htp supplementation has been going on from a long time a lot of people being into that part yeah it's a smart way to approach MDMA to like to stock up to have a bunch in your system so your body's gonna have to build this shit up again cuz you're gonna flood it with it for a while so you're gonna have this weird little period where your body's gonna struggle but it's it's a thing that I would hope if this these studies do continue to prove without a doubt that it's beneficial to a lot of these people that they make it available to more people it will be it will be should be quick they estimate 2022 I think are 2023 at the latest a some time back but it got if the FDA made it breakthrough drug I think breakthrough drug which is like on the fast track to go through I think the whole world will be way better if everybody was on just like a micro dose of ecstasy all the time just a little just a little like ha I don't know that that could last but that would be medicines because it's microdose that's the thing you talk about compassion and all these other important lessons that have been talked about in all spiritual texts it's automatic you drop right into that yeah do you think that it's possible to train your brain to produce more of it do you think through meditation and mindfulness and all these different you know practices that people do to stay present to be more open and more loving that you could build that up almost like a muscle I don't know that you could build serotonin up over time I'm sure there's some type of cap where Nate you know nature does not want us to be happy 24/7 is there any tricks though yeah - like there's heat to turn on there's a book the science of mindfulness by dr. Ronald Siegel it's on one of the great courses on audible and he's a Harvard professor and he talks about the brain like a fucking muscle and science is back this the more you trained that the easier it is to drop into and I've had coaches breathwork coaches we know we're working with the art of breath Rob Wilson McKenzie came out and they did like a full fucking blown day of breath working on it and the more often you can shift into parasympathetic state from fight-or-flight sympathetic you know you shift consciously through breath into that simp repair sympathetic state that becomes trainable you can do that over and over again and then all it takes is just a couple deep breaths and you're back right because you train that the fucking body remembers the brain remembers and when you're in those states that shifts everything from the neural chemical response to the brainwave state you can drop from beta into alpha into theta that's fascinating stuff man it's crazy to think what we understand about the various pathways these chemicals have to go through and then what is like still confusing like here's the big one where's the push the consciousness coming from exactly how does it all become the thing that's looking through Kyle Kingsbury's eyes and seeing me and mine looking at you wait what's exactly what's what is that thing what is that thing that seems to be like almost like uh like an energy that runs through this machine it's through fucking everything yeah it's in all things but if we thought about it that way like you'd be so much more concerned with keeping that energy high you know I mean how much of what would people experience when it comes to the word depression how much of it is their life going bad tragedy poor health bad job choices how much of it is some sort of a weird genetic thing how much I mean there's so many variables as to what causes depression but such a giant number yeah of people suffer from depression well I think it's I think it only if I'm being honest I think it's gonna get worse you know like you look at the way we live and the closer and closer you've spoken about that we're just talking about fucking New York we're not meant to be that confined we're not meant to sit out like we're withheld from the fucking Sun right now yeah so many of these things communicate with our bodies I'm working with a genetic specialist ryan frisson juror he was on chris ryan show sunlight influences 500 on/off switches on our epigenetic level for the for the good unless you fucking overdo it right 500 plus on/off switches in our DNA are affected by sunlight positively right I mean there's that's what they look at vitamin d3 takes that for example they're calling that a hormone now not a fucking vitamin real is it's a messenger that's how much it influences in the body incredibly important so when you think about all these things like being barefoot being connected to the earth going in the fucking ocean science will catch up in certain ways but we get fixated on the thing we get fixed innate fixated on our phones on whatever TV is going on we're closed off from other people we think you know communicating through Facebook is the same as being fucking face-to-face it's not you know the more we head that direction and we're putting you know as you put it putting fucking shit food in our body for mouths pleasure that influences the brain right eighty to ninety percent of all of our neurotransmitters are made by the bacteria in our gut so you think the shit meal is just going to put on five pounds it's not it might put on five pounds but it's gonna fuck your brain up for a while you make you a little bit more emotional fuck with your ear your sharpness your memory recall all that's impacted sleeps impacted I wish Michael Walker talked a bit more about that I don't think it's in his wheelhouse I don't think it is he's he's just to go studies sleep and the effects on it but fuck was that in illuminating yeah I opening don't know a lot cast was so important to me it was fucking fantastic I think his book is really good but as far as like dialing in sleep it's more of this is what happens when you don't sleep mm-hmm sleep the book sleep by Nick little Hales is probably my favorite because that gives you all it's a fucking how-to guide on how to maximize sleep and when you were younger lack of sleep didn't affect you the way it affects you now right correct yeah everything he talks about like that shift that you have that happens in adolescence where you become a night owl mm-hmm no doubt and I probably still could stay out a little bit later until having a kid and then that's your your immediate reset yeah bitch you're getting up when the Sun comes out yeah be prepared sir get ready yeah it's um there's so many different factors that lead to a healthy body but how much of a healthy body leads to a happy mind that's work it's like you can't blame some of these people that are suffering from like a disease some of these people that have like something wrong with the way their brain is producing these happy hormones yeah I don't think you can say it's just this one thing like we'll just eat clean or if you just want keto or you just eat paleo then you wouldn't have depression I don't think that's it at all but certainly that's a factor it certainly could be a fact being in nature being in nature as a fact mm-hmm and unpacking trauma gah Bramante says at the heart of all fucking addiction is some form of trauma yeah I'm sure completely makes sense yeah his his theories on that are fascinating it's I never thought about that why that's some form of trauma during your developmental stages led you to like seek out this weird crazy feeling and experience when you uh have you known many people that have had like serious addictions like math or oh yeah yeah without naming names people very close to me family members I've been addicted to meth I lost a cousin to pills I've been going to AAA not for me for a family member since I was three years old so I've seen that you know what if is now now is that trauma based is like everything because pills don't pills just get kind of get everybody yeah pills can't get everybody there's no doubt about that there wasn't your self off there was some trauma there on in all those circumstances and I'm not saying all pills can fucking grab you there's no doubt but certainly with the meth and the alcohol which was other things you know no doubt there was trauma there you have known of quite a few people that got fucked up on pills after operations or injuries or stuff like that but I know quite a few of them that kicked it you know that just realized it was happening when whoa doubt like shoppes talked about it quite a bit when he fought cro cop his nose was destroyed so they had to rebuild his nose and he started taking pain pills and he said after a while he's just taking them every day just because just wanted to take him and then his friends came over and cleaned out his medicine cabinet when I cut the shit it's four months later you're still taking these things all day long you can't do that anymore and he's like whoa he said he almost didn't even realize he was doing it just kind of caught ahold of him yeah shit becomes habit especially when it's that euphoric must be amazing you know when I took the other day I took a large dose of kratom yeah everybody always tells you that kratom is one thing at a small dose you know it's kind of two pills to me seems almost like a stimulant yeah like 100% yeah and even it up to four pills but you get in the land to eight pills I took eight pills the other day it was like whoa this I'm high Mike I'm fully functional I'm not worried about the way my body moves like it's not like I'm gonna fall down when I'm walking everything seems like it's working good but I'm clearly high but I'm not high in a bad way like I could talk fine I can remember things full conversations happy remember people's names but I'm definitely high yeah kratom is a funny one you know it's it's still an opiate it's still hitting those receptors he's actually an opiate yeah I believe it is what are they Hamilton Morris from Hamilton's pharmaco he's coming on soon yeah he's you know that's one of the things he says cuz he's not spiritual he even though he does all these psychedelics so he gets really pissed off and people call it plant medicine or it's like you have to fucking say it you're calling what it is right there's a lot of that fuckery though right yes but but at the same time I mean you can so real and a lot yeah you can take mushrooms recreationally or you can do the rogue dose and be guided and you can do ayahuasca in the Amazon and it's a holy it's a fucking world different yeah totally different experience but yeah I go back to create them thankfully I've always had this thing with opiates where if I had too much I get nauseated really bad so I can take one or two pills and it is a mild stimulant I drove to Greenfields house when I was living in Vegas to podcast with him thousand miles each direction and I just have one pill every three hours Wow and it was awesome I was fucking I felt great so if I could he'll every three hours just kept you focused when you're driving yeah and I felt there's mild euphoria I felt good being in that little ass Prius the whole way no which is important right let me see I don't even know how you climb in that well I'll take three or more I'm fucked up like I'm riding that fence I mean we gonna puke am I gonna puke so exercise so even for you they have the same reaction that like an oxy would have yep and I bet I mean in college I did some weird shit i keister done oxy once and well fucking for those folks not learned in the ways of the dirty dogs he put it up his asshole two Knuckles deep Natsuki stood up as deep people people like what key stirred big a good dudes would just go on your show like lost me when you told me the trees started talking to you when I was describing I an ayahuasca experience that'll be the one this time do you lost me when you tell it when you talk about putting a pull up your ass the podcast but yeah I felt fucking great that one time I tried it I tried a snorted one later you know like a few weeks later and I was fucked up I was fucking puke in the whole time nor did it you could suck off the I don't want to tell by one about drugs I want to tell people how to do good drugs why would you snort it because it goes right into your bloodstream yeah you know you can suck up that time release crush it up let it dry Wow so but that ultimately that was like well yeah they're still thankfully I still have this fucking regulator in my body that says don't put these fucking super addictive man-made chemicals in your body that's fascinating do you think kratom man-made no it's a plant right it is plant base all this shit's plant base the issue is when we take something when we fucking concentrate it and change it in a way to where it just really has an affinity for receptors and we lose out on all these other alkaloids and terpenes and things like look at marinol versus whole plant cannabis alright so your second bulky if they take this stuff and then turn it into an actual drug that they sell they're only gonna sell parts of it right yeah yes on the active ingredient like cocaine versus fucking coca leaf right totally different experience now you ever had coca tea you have that coca tea I've I've thrown coca leaf this car they call it Mamba in Colombia you chew it you yeah how is it amazing really it's like a cup of coffee though like less jittery your rain turns on it's a nootropic you feel like a million bucks we can't have it cuz of Miami mm-hmm they fucked this they all their whole city's made out of coke no no dude you have you ever seen cocaine cowboy yes dude that's all Miami that know that all that that area of Florida there one point at one point time I don't know if it's still the case but Miami had more banks per capita than any place else in the country because everybody's just laundering coke money and coke was just coming in like crazy there's so many great documentaries on it it's a really really fascinating time in like history like during cocaine Cowboys once shoutout to Billy Corbin the the first one they talked about how many of these police officers wound up dead or in jail and it was like an entire class graduating class either was dead or in jail for corruption but but it sounded you know they had made this look this time period however what many you know years it was of this cocaine trafficking who's crazy man like it's a incredible time and like human history been this article says that it's ramped back up to those 1980s drug war heights of production whoa okay so how's it getting in that's the question yeah I don't think that's a problem I don't think it is either but how are they doing it and how do they I mean that's a lot of money that's that money so much money in it that what that's Florida Customs and Border Protection confiscated 4,200 pounds of cocaine last year compared to 1730 pounds the year prior to further cements the guy the guy that was getting paid off the year before got caught maybe how else are they getting it in I don't maybe they just caught more coke at that time maybe they're getting coked up and then they're taking the boats just take it risks I know where these fucking cops hide I know them better than they know themselves we've never seen cocaine production at these numbers oh Jesus Christ stay the fuck out of Miami for a while folks it could get crazy or go there or go there yep I like the way think dude into the fray mm-hmm you know where's the party Miami the DEA estimates Colombia produced 710 tons of pure cocaine last year or enough to fill about 18 semi trucks did you see that so crazy they found the first coca farm in Mexico oh Jesus that could be a problem yeah well it actually might help with the drug wars really if they can grow it and they can bite against each other they would grow it yeah Mexicans and Colombians been fighting for a long and so what they would start fighting with each other and that would help the drug war they would fight less because Mexico would have its own production but I mean they said it was growing in a place that wasn't the same altitude and obviously cocaine is an alkaloid that is really it grows at altitude so you want that that environmental stimulus for that you know you want the hormetic stressor in order for it to produce more cocaine pound-for-pound and I think it would produce far less that that's at least what they were saying in the article how much makes sense to me why what's the justification for what is this Jaime 3 Sean Bissett Roger yes I getting it in us as speedboats treadmills and on poor old lady look at this poor old lady she's holding the kilo she looks like she's about 7 years old maybe older maybe eight years old and she's fully strapped up with cocaine I mean who could who could blame this lady do you think she's out there hustling she got a pistol in people's faces you get the shit out of her - that's fucked up as fucked up so we need more good drugs and less bad drugs we definitely need more good drugs we need to do something to get this this wave of negativity that so many people experiencing on a regular basis do you settle that down and bring that up do you know anybody that's done ketamine treatment yes and pretty good results right Neal Brennan had very good results he liked it quite a bit he he's done a bunch of different things for depression magnetic things and ketamine things he said ketamine was very effective yeah I had one of my first coaches striking coach he had you know you've been put on every kind of fuckin SSRI for years and just felt like shit and he did for ketamine treatments and he's down to like one SSRIs off ninety percent of his medication he says he's never felt better I'm like that that shitty voice that everyone has in their head that was so loud for him is non-existent now whoa yeah we got to do that dr. Craig put us through slightly different most of people that I think that are doing ketamine treatment do it ivy we had an intramuscular injection the ketamine that's the John Lilly it was fucking insane like 40 minutes long and it was kind of tied in with the stem cells really to just be in a state of allowing and whatever subconscious level of accepting this foreign substance into your body let's let's kind of move the needle on that again that's theory what's the experience like what it's a psychedelic right it is but it's different so again we talked about the classical types tryptamine bass gonna fit in serotonin receptors in different parts of the brain this is a dissociative so it pulls you back layers you know like we talked about Eckhart Tolle last time how he talks be the observer be the witness of your thoughts your not your thoughts just pull yourself back a layer and kind of see your mind chatter as this interesting thing like kids arguing right this will force that and it pulls you back layers beyond that like to the point where you know you're not in your body but when you re-enter your body there's a lot of gratitude and you can kind of see things where they are you know you you understand now like oh this is how I was feeling before but I've been removed from long enough to when I come back to it I can recognize it for what it is whoa and I don't have depression now you know so doing it was was just more of a let's see what happens you know kind of kind of intention as opposed to like people that are going in there working on shit might be a bit different for them but it was fucking bananas yeah I've never talked to it I knew a guy who got addicted to it though as a street drug as a party drug you know some peanuts nor they have snorted it yeah what does it do it's it's you know it's it's kind of like LSD you have a micro dohsa LSD completely different experience than a full head or two to five to whatever all different experiences you know if you take like a key bump a key bump for people with the lack of the terminology would just be like the end of a keys worth into a bag just okay snort and it's very relaxing you want to move but you know if you push the envelope a little bit because it's disuse disassociative it's very disorienting like you can like I don't know where the fuck I am or what's going on some if you go really far it's it's similar to injecting it where you go in the K hole you're kind of paralyzed and close your eyes you're in a different spot who you're in a different spot but the psychedelic trip let me say it was a different spot like you're in a different place like psychedelic yeah yeah like you could be I mean for 30 to 45 minutes you could be in a vision you know you could be elsewhere your consciousness is not in your body - that's the K hole yeah that's the K hole yeah the guy who invented the sensory deprivation tank used to do it intramuscularly and then climb into the tank yeah I heard that he had at one point by the end he was so hooked on it that he would run an IV so he could stay on 24 hours in there but you know I was telling you about that book that he wrote the center of the cyclone yeah that was a fucking fascinating book cuz you he would get as a medical doctor 300 he'd get ampules of 300 I you from Sandoz pharmaceuticals of pharmaceutical grade LSD do that intravenous then get in the float tank for ten hours and the trip reports he has when you read these they're very ayahuasca s like talking to other beings and other consciousness DMT like experience but ten hours not fucking 15 minutes and just fastening like he's and as a doctor so with detailed in his explanation of what he's seeing what it means to him pretty fucking cool that's an experience that once you know that you can have I don't know that if I I would have a real hard time fitting into regular life if I knew that I could just have that ten hours like the DMT flash of fifteen minutes of the weirdest interactions with whatever they are whatever those things are when you come back imagine that for ten hours it might you know invite like just change everything about your perceptions of life you might just give up on civilization and move to the forest or something you might and that's exactly what happened to the Unabomber you know the Unabomber is a part of the other Harvard LSD studies they juiced that guy to the tits damn and then afterwards he went to be a professor at Berkeley so he could save up enough money so he could buy a fucking house in the woods and blow up the people that are creating technology because the technology is what's gonna supplant human beings it's gonna gonna take over usurp our position on earth or some crazy shit and he just decided who's gonna kill all these fucking scientists and remember that he was like yeah but that's not and that's a nod take I had a different take on technology in an ayahuasca ceremony where I saw pretty much what's happening now it was like this beautiful merging and wasn't man left behind it wasn't super intelligence with Nick Bostrom where we have to worry about this thing's taking over like we fucking stayed neck-and-neck with it and integrate with it throughout and we do change we're not the fucking same but we're not the same now that's some one of the things they talked about like who is the first cyborg eyeglasses you know fucking eyeglasses you're a fucking cyborg that's man-made technology integrated into your being that changes your perception of reality sure right so we're already doing that with our fucking phones we're already we're already there no because yeah you had this weird idea that it has to be implanted into you in order for that to be the case we're already fucking there yeah we're there both with the connection with this thing it's always in our pocket and then with transportation and the transportation hooks up to the connection so you can listen to things you know like give me how many times you your new car you listen in a book on tape through bluetooth you know or a podcast that you download that's everything he's Aubrey Aubrey ties a chapter in his book on the day on that it's a mindfulness or mindfulness so when you're driving like what's the worst part of fuck in most people's days the commute right yeah so you can choose to be a pissed-off guy you can listen to talk radio you can do all these things or you can practice mindfulness meditation what are you resetting yourself you're giving yourself some quiet time obviously eyes are open while your hands are on the wheel or you do mindfulness where you fucking throw on a dope podcast or a book from audible and you would take information in that's to help you fucking grow as a person right it's just even being too entertaining I enjoy fictional books I like some fiction on on audiobooks we also service function you know what I love Stephen King books but I do not like it when he reads them you need to hire a fucking professional god dammit see your that I like I like the author I'm reading the tipping point from mountain Malcom Gladwell and hearing him do the audio apart is great because he's very passionate about the subject matter and he's the guy that wrote it and so him reading out these results and all these different facts and really fascinating things about the tipping point in you know certain trends is Stephen King is like he's a brilliant brilliant writer like one of my favorite writers for sure my favorite horror writer I loved his shit like I used to read him when I was taking the train to go to Taekwondo practice I would read Stephen King books all day long let's all I'd read so I was always a giant fan as but as but a professional actor perhaps do a more spirited job I've had some fucking bad actors you know unaudible gets a bad one you know but like radio host you know like in the next jet we're gonna tell you like in advanced glycation end-products are the devil and you're like fuck off dude like it's just it ruins it for me well especially when telling a story this is my thing you need someone who has a very good sense of theater like it the way they communicate the words the way they say the words the emphasis they put on with fiction that's really important it's odd to me though that like audible doesn't coach him on that because Aubree was saying when he did the book he was non fucking stop coaching that robbery yeah if he was reading something they'd be like excuse me mr. Marcus we're gonna have you go ahead and reread starting at the top of the page it sounds like you're your minds in a different place like they would catch everything every influx everything you know because he's got to read far ahead you got to know where you're going with it all that shit and he said I mean maybe they've changed over time with their approach to that but well I think you know it's probably completely different for different subject matter Aubrey's book is obviously a self-help book on the day but other books that are stories about like monsters or some shit like that like what's required of the the the guy reading in has to have a sense of theater he's telling us story there's got to be a the pauses have to like a professional like a professional voice actor those were that's what you want for those things yeah they're better at it they just Stephen King's a wizard at writing I mean he's fucking phenomenal but I don't want to hear him doing different voices and shit like it's just too weird you know he's got a great book though and it's great not just for writers but for everybody it's Stephen King on writing it's really interesting because it's sort of uh there's a lot of his sort of life and work philosophy and in the book and I feel like when I read about someone who is in my opinion one of the greatest contributors to like fun books and fun horror movies I mean he's an all-time king to me and so to be able to say like well what what was going on in that guy's head as he was writing Carey like how did he how did he conceive of Christine like what's his what's his process what's his process for writing it's really interesting man first of all he doesn't even know what the fuck he's gonna write like when he starts something like he doesn't know where he's going he just he just does it and as he's doing it he figures out where it's gonna go like that's part of the genius of his method is that it's not like this sort of like you didn't have a fucking outline he's gonna get bit by the snake and then Bob's gonna turn into a horse and then you know all the stuff is gonna happen and then his wife's gonna fall in love with that horse and then he's gonna be mad when he becomes a person again he just goes with it you know he just he just any you know he just shows up every day and just puts in the time and focuses on it and then makes it happen so what a crazy way to make a living to just invent stories and weird things that happen and just put it all together in your head and then give it to people like look what I've done I came up with a story and you know buddy like fuck where's the story going this he's crazy it's a really interesting way to make a living because he's using like he's flexing one very specific part of his brain that most people don't really use it all or hardly ever use most of us don't have any type of creativity left it sucked out through school we're her yeah we're fucking taught to just go sit and be a cog in the machine unless you're super fortunate and have a job where you can create yeah yeah yeah yeah man got a tickle that piece though I met this guy Ted Decker who's one of fucking Aubrey's greatest mentors out in Sedona and he's a fictional writer for the most part but just fucking he's a wizard and I was doing a water fast so I had a wife five-day water fast Ellen just water just water for five days how long do you make it four and a half damn long up a half a day early well the things most a home the thing was a science shows four days right four days is the magic mark so the extra day was just like our I got an extra day to go but we hiked Cathedral Rock and Sedona and it's fucking epic and there's there is an energy there like New York but different but what is what's going on with Sedona why is it doing all this well from from what I understand and why it why it's the hippies travelers guide and everybody wants to be there is are you familiar with pulsed electromagnetic frequency I've heard that those were for everybody everyone that's about to jump on the fucking woowoo bandwagon and shit on me right now punch in the Google bar do me a solid punch in the Google bar NASA study on pee EMF okay this is your fucking study so it's verified with the earth as its own energy field right well whether you want to call where do you think the Earth's alive and it's guy and all that I'll leave that up to you but it has its own fuckin energy field and so there's dip it's not the same it's not equal throughout the earth there are places where that's accentuated and you feel that more you feel it more when you're in the ocean there's negative ions there Wallace G nichols wrote physiological and molecular genetic effects of time varying electromagnetic fields on human neuronal Nero Nero Nero null cells I've never seen that word before I was neural neuronal no no cells Nora no like the way they're saying why is it is it bits just because it's all in caps it looks so weird to me you know occasionally a word just looks weird that looks weird that word neuronal and Ronal there's a good book PMF I forget the author but um I think it has to do with that I think it has to do with that this isn't really do feel that that energy there it's palpable and it's not fuckin make-believe so knowing that we'd be in this special place knowing that I'd be with some really interesting people and that if I was to take some medicine at that point in time after fasting for four days what Hamilton Morrison will call drugs yes but he forgot drugs so I had 200 micrograms of LSD okay and I won't mention anybody else that had it with me just because they maybe don't sign off on that kind of shit publicly but um we hiked to the top of the cathedral rock and it's fucking incredible I mean incredible and another buddy of mine who was it was a teacher at Black Swan yoga he brought up some really good cacao from the chocolate but pure fucking cacao from Guatemala he made it in these drinks and that's what I broke the fast with oh wow there's chemicals in that you know like it's funny what people fucking qualify as drugs because like Terrence and Dennis McKenna say like we are walking bags of chemicals right this caffeine that I'm drinking right now is a fucking drug yeah 100% hundred-percent theobromine in cacao is a drug it's an alkaloid in cacao that will elevate heart rate it's a mild diuretic and it fucking opens the heart it's like my micro dose of MDMA really yeah so how is stacking that why do you think people fucking love chocolate why it's amazing it would have like the tiniest amount of it it depends what chocolate you're eating right awesome dark chocolate or dark chocolate that's gonna have higher amounts you know but we had a fuck ton of this like you're supposed to have 4 ounces is a good dose 4 ounces of liquid or this liquid with with their special special preparation method my special blend my friend by shal blend it what is the like what is is like a shake like was there other stuff in it there's yeah there's some cayenne there's lemon juice there's different things to help activate it instead of the way the mines did it's been passed down generation after generation and it's like micro dosing MDMA yeah and so stack that with the LSD and it's kind of like a candy flip now could people just go buy cacao and micro dose MDMA well you're you got to order it offline and do they do that or online and do the preparation properly but I mean there's no doubt you feel different it's warming you feel more loving you sensitive the touch but this is I mean this is not in any way illegal right no it's not anywhere legal but I was I was yeah I've been talking to a guy who's like look if they fucking just discovered cacao today they would say potentially this is this is drug I've never heard this before the see Oprah mean fucking look it up there's a ton of shit this guy that that's on self hacked comm I forget his name but he's a wizard and he has like amazing articles on different chemicals he talks about 13 scientifically backed studies on theobromine that are all human studies it's dope shit so anyways we stay we take this and we climb the mountain we're in nature we're doing fucking wim HOF breathing and different shit up there we look we look at the part we look we're sticking out like sore thumbs they fucking 230 pound guy with his shirt off doing why snorting cacao could be the next party drug next big party oh my god and that's on Maxim calm so we we take Jesus Christ this is crazy we take our substances we're up there and you know this guy he's got like 12 books that are number one bestsellers he's oh is that he's he's joking around he's joking around his fuck he's not snorting oh those are key bumps key bumps what are you saying he's gonna snort that yep he is gonna snort that here we go let me see what you got son fuckin pound it you pick that you just pounded I don't know a attaboy actually I have snorted theobromine recently as the office guinea pig that's not the way I would recommend administering it what's wrong with going up the nose uncomfortable it's not that bad no I'm not that's not a blanket recommendation for people though mmm but this is not a dangerous substance no no I mean too much of it you know there's a fucking upper limit to anything even water but you know on the mountain going back to this on the mountain sorry Ted Decker Ted Decker hi Ted Ted's the fucking man and he's written all these books and he's like would you like me to tell a story and imagine you're sitting with Stephen King on LSD on the mountaintop and he says would you like me to tell you a story whoa that level of fucking writer and he goes into one of his books and uh I was fucking sold like just drawn right in I could see everything fucking alien worlds all this shit that she's got a battle and you really see like just the mind like how creative the mind can be it blew me the fuck away of course the substances help me draw me into it but man he's a special guy well there's quite a few special people out there which is why we're so lucky we can go to the movies you know what I mean I mean did you think how much fucking creativity how much thought and imagining scenarios and putting them all together that takes to make like I saw The Incredibles too yesterday is it dough fucking incredible well the first one we're gonna mean to say incredible because it's incredible it's it's great we're considering taking bear to that but he's only three so we're not sure if he'll approve he loves those movies at home but you know he talks and shit like that little kids talk at the movie theater when you go to little kid movies it's normal schools all the little kids doing it too we think we might do that for The Incredibles too so they're fucking so good the Pixar movies are so good did you ever see the good dinosaur that doesn't I got to be honest that doesn't know why people though if you go when a bunch of teenagers are there or like young adults and the baby starts talking they should be like a day look this should be certain she's doing a show the day and the kids are allowed to talk first show the day and a lot of theaters do Oh see that smart for the man name that's smart that's smart but damn that's that opens up the door if you tell them they're allowed to talk yeah that's true I'd still try to keep it quiet but do a good dinosaur Pixar movie yeah and they fucking trip balls in the movie oh yeah whatever heat like some rotten fruit and and that fucking green dinosaur grows like four eyes then they switch heads and they're running through everywhere I forgotten with each other schools he sticks his tongue out and he's got the kids face for his tongue it was awesome I forgot all about their trickling it in this is society's changing you think yeah fuck yeah fuck yeah it's the Renaissance Michael Pollan said that and he's not even an advocate he knows his job he's kind of more of an advocate now certainly than he was before he wrote that book his most recent book on psychedelics it changed his life I think it's a smart play if you're a person in his position to say like look I'm just an advocate for the science right but as Rick Doblin says you know if these stuff when this stuff becomes available to people it's never gonna be you go fill your fucking prescription of psilocybin at Walgreens and you can go fuck off anywhere you want right they'll have facility centers where people can go and it'll be guided the right circumstances set and setting will be paid attention to but in that experience like it shouldn't just be for sick people it shouldn't just be for people with depression or PTSD or some type of you know rape victims fill in the blank it should be healthy individuals that also want to have a deeper connection and to figure shit out and have new perspective in life right in Poland I would qualify as that yeah I think he's a healthy guy you know the heart heart shit aside like he's a healthy guy who wanted to have an experience that would draw him in a little deeper so he could understand and now when you listen to him talk about it there's no doubt he's fucking sold on it yeah I think what you're saying is really important because I don't think there should be any restrictions on something that's super beneficial if there's no real indications that it's hurting these people and it's all these indications that it's helping these people especially when it comes to trauma look man there's certain people that for sure of experience way more trauma than others there's certain people that have you know been to war they've lost friends they've been involved in car accidents there's there's certain people that have been through things that are just horrific and almost impossible to forget and that is a fact that they should have access to this medicine but just because like some girl lived her life and didn't have anything traumatic happened to her and she's trying to find her way in this world and she's trying to figure out you know what is insecurity or what is my connection to these people well whatever my real passions and drives in life I'm gonna take a some sort of a MDMA Molly trip and find out how I feel about things find out if it gives me anything she should be able to do it - yeah she'd be able to she'll be able to experiment with her brain and see like hey all these people are reporting super positive experiences what am I supposed to ignore it because some bureaucrat has decided for whatever connection they have some pharmaceutical companies that you fucking keep this gate tight on making anything legal anything you make legal is gonna fuck with my bottom line and that's what a lot of people think and so there's this weird sort of disconnect between the people that want the drugs and the people that won't let you have the drugs like who are you working for the people that won't let us have the drugs and why do these other people that don't want the drugs think the drugs are bad do they do they have any pot experience themselves no well then you can't vote about pot you fuck you know I mean that's crazy right you shouldn't be a doctor unless you go to med school you shouldn't you shouldn't talk about driving a car if you've never driven a fucking car you can't talk about pot if you don't do it you don't know what you're talking about so you smoke pot you got real high you got paranoid so everybody shouldn't smoke pot fuck off pussy that's graham hancock you don't you know he's talking about Richard Dawkins you don't have a seat at the fuckin table to tell me what my ayahuasca experience is unless you've done it yeah at the table you don't get to tell me it's some neuro chemical reaction and this is where it fits in the brain if you haven't had that experience you can't tell me that that's and that's that's what's what's the one thing that's fuckin odd at the very least when people go through these experiences and Pollan talks about this - is how real it feels it's how important it is and how much meaning they have right nobody's gonna fucking tell me that my Oscar ayahuasca experience didn't mean shit I saw you know in one of them my wife and I shared the same vision of holding a child and the next experience we saw it was a boy and fucking all the fear of being a parent came up and less than a month later we were pregnant with bear like that's as real as it fucking gets and it manifested after that coincidence or not I have a real problem with the word real - you know when when people try to say that's not really that's a hallucination it doesn't matter it's the same experience like by saying it's not real so what are you saying you're saying that I can't grab it and throw a fucking net over it and drag it away and then show it to you again yeah well then it's not real you can't be repeated yeah double-blind study how do you say it's not real if it's happening yeah and you can't repeat that it's not a we're I could take ayahuasca rest of my life and I'm still not gonna repeat the same vision and the same fucking experience again yeah anytime he's different DMT figured out your next trip is gonna be a mind bender your next trip you get cocky go in there like I've done this Farms pretty relaxed about my DMT trips I used to really freak you out but I don't anymore bitch you better be scared you better be scared you're white-knuckling it right now you're gonna go deep and gobber city government they said the same thing about aya he's done hundreds of ceremonies and he still gets nervous every fucking time you get nervous before you do anything that's important it's a sign that you're getting ready for something crazy well and there's a healthy level of respect nothing most people run into the issue you know they they want they want to alter their consciousness and they'll take a substance thinking like this is gonna make me feel a certain way yeah and then all of a sudden they got to deal with some shit they got to work through something and that's not what they had on their radar yeah no I agree and and then also this need to control the experience is always the thing that fucking sends everybody off the rails and into the woods if they are having any kind of experience this need to control that experience like know their stuff no fuck this I'm sitting down you know and like no man you got to let go if you don't let go you're gone and you got to surrender to it if you don't you're gonna go through 15 minutes of Satan I was with my old man in Panama at the Travel gathering and we were both doing a Oscar ceremony together and we had the first cup and it's strong like sure people shaman came in fucking amazing experience and they offered the second cup and I'm like get up dude we're doing it and he's like oh no and I'm like come on let's go so we take the second cup we come lay back down and I've had I mean to Ballpark I've had there's been ceremonies where I've had four cups and it was launched you know this to Cup that's where we were fuckin launched so we go back into the tepee and you know noble silence we're not talking to and he just grabs my arm and he's like I'm gonna leave I'm floating out of here I don't want to go I don't want to go and I was like fuck yeah dude let go let go go with it now is your opportunity to let go see where it takes you and he's like no no I'm not letting go I want down I want down right now it's too much I'm too high and I'm like well highs not the right term in this other guy from Switzerland heard us and he goes he'll rub some peppermint aunty's on his wrist it will help him come over in sperm in oil and that grounded him after that you know he's done ayahuasca since then and he was like fuck that was my opportunity to fucking breakthrough and go it's deeper than I've ever been before but I wasn't prepared I wasn't ready to let go and surrender to it Wow and that's that's it man you want to have that mindset going in where if you face some shit it's okay you know and if you have the opportunity especially getting fucking DMT or ayahuasca which is DMT based like to have that ability like all right the answer is yes it makes you wonder what the guys who created yoga we're doing I think I think those people like those people that learn how to do those long holding poses that they were practicing it you know there's a lot of belief that those people were eating a lot of hash like especially the the earliest people that were that created it and they were soma whatever the fuck soma was you ever hear references to soma I don't I don't think they know what that is some sort of a psychedelic but that whole practice of yoga if you really think about a lot of what yoga is like you have to just breathe and just concentrate on maintaining the pose you have to put yourself into this like surrender zone you know you can't like fight a position you just kind of kind of accept it and just concentrate on breathing and hold it as long as you can until your body starts giving out and then you let it go again but I think that prepares you in some way to let go in psychedelic experiences I think that people that don't have any if you don't have any kind of physical altercation with your body there's no like moment where you like come on man come on breathe breathe breathe go go go if you don't have any of those if you never I mean I don't give a fuck what you're doing there's a spin class or just if you never have anything where you're pushing yourself when you don't want to do it but you make yourself do it and then you if you don't have those like those little moments where you overcame something that feels uncomfortable then those those bends in the trip road or scary dark because you don't have any success in coming back from bad states you don't have any success from coming back from like feeling really scared or feeling really nervous like those build up a database if you don't have a lot of success in doing those or especially a success in getting your body to just fucking relax just fucking relax it's just a broken leg if you don't have that in you like it's it's probably real hard to navigate some of the darker roads of a trip where you just have to just hook up just kind of just breathe and just try to stay as calm as you can let it embrace you as calm as you can I think that it works both ways to you know like you have if you put yourself in uncomfortable stressful spots in everyday life like a cold bath or the cryo and you come and you can stay calm and in the fucking eye of the storm and come out of that that extrapolates out in life somebody cuts you off in traffic you're a little bit more chill not that big of a deal and same thing in the psychedelic experience you go through some rough shit you come out of that okay alright I saw my body I was able to work through that now it kind of lowers the noise on all the bullshit in life yeah I agree I think there's something to what you just said about doing cryo to the cryo does make you chill out after I mean for lack of a better term no pun intended but you are you're everything's so elevated after you get out of there you feel so good that it's that's a that's a feeling that like if there was a way to do that in a spray if you could buy that feel-good spray at 7-eleven and give yourself a couple pumps the same way you feel right after cryo it would hit you'd be like whoa you just get this who come out and all sudden your body feels warm again you feel great it's a nice little trick it's a very nice little trick in and it helps so many people in so many different ways with arthritis and people have constant inflammation and back problems and knee problems it's just there's such a good way to just give your body just a little extra reduction and in from give yourself a little jolt Oh Oh feels good man people feel through it I don't understand the pooh-poohing of it they're looking at it now there's their study in wim HOF at Stanford they see five hundred and fifty percent increase in dopamine Wow two hundred to three hundred percent increase in adrenaline which impacts the immune system positively for how long of a wim HOF they have been different they have different levels of cold they're studying at one minute at 60 degrees you know or 10 minutes at 60 degrees one minute at 30 degrees and then they're trying to figure there's gonna be more science that comes out on different because I want to know like how long at 40 how long in the cryo how long you know does it but we know there's some type of neuro chemical response from it right I feel right yeah so it's not just this you know it's not placebo it's not just your mind making this up or man I feel really good I think something's change like no you're you are you are changing it does have an impact well just and also stop and think about all the people that were always scared of the fucking Vikings and the Russians we're scared of people coming out of the snow you know is probably something in our head someone who could survive the snow that we can't like fuck you ain't even scared to be cold you know I mean that it that is whose scariest people in this country or the toughest Alaskans it's motherfucker they have shows they have like 10 shows there's only a hundred people in Alaska they have 10 shows on people too many fucking shows so many of those shows there's I know there's millions of people live in Alaska maybe not even right no it's not even didn't we already go over this like Anchorage is like 400,000 people I think I might I made that up what's the number seven hundred and forty thousand the whole state whoa how many people is Anchorage have 700 Wow not even a million for the whole state but there's like 18 shows on people living in Alaska but there are Hardy people you look at him me like kayln what would I do three to four hundred thousand yeah yeah so um so that's like a Anchorage is like a real spot like a real City sort of I mean real nice bars and restaurants and she'll like that but these shows about those people that live up there those all the people that live in like the Arctic Circle area and they chop their own fucking firewood and fight wolves off and shit like this is one dude we've talked about him several times in the podcast that lives by himself he's the one of the weirdest of all like he's the weirdest of all the weird people because all these other people live in like regular houses and you know they just live in a house that's connected to this river and they take their dogs dog sledding in a dealership but they live in like a normal house they go into a house this motherfucker has like this tiny Shack and he lives right next to a lake and he lives by himself and he walks everywhere and he somehow or another gets like pelts and shit and makes enough money to buy bullets and and he lives out there by himself and he'll come into town like once every couple of years apparently used to be married used to have a family fascinating guy I mean this guy's not faking and he's actually really living up there by himself in this room that's way smaller than the studio and he lives by himself next to a lake and he had a shoot wolves one night because they were coming for his fucking moose or his caribou if all things crazy like it's by himself nobody talked to I think I think that might be a draw for people especially if there is some merging of consciousness and integration with technology down the road like to that that kind of fuck this I'm going off the beaten path and you already see that people want to be off the grid but to truly be like balls deep in nature or you have to deal with wolves and bears and all the shit that's going on like that there might be a bigger draw down the road right now I'm I'm not interested in that shit well I'm not interested in that shit either but I'm interested in him being interested in it because I think that what you were just saying about technology but I thought you were gonna say is about nature I think there's a deeper connection to nature if you just live it in it all the time I met it up I bet you get weird senses of like where things are or where how the wind feels when it's coming at you oh it's definitely coming this way like you know you know where to stand we're not to like you get a sense of the whole thing and you're a part of it you're not talking to anybody so the only the only dialogue you have is internal it's like your buddy who fasts when he hunts Yeah right you get that extrasensory coming in yeah yeah yeah Remy Warren always talked about that that you should hunt hungry that's primal shit dude that makes sense though yeah yeah totally makes sense totally I mean I found out I mean doing the fast thing I've done to five-day fast now the brain it doesn't it's not like I mean I have extra energy sleep kind of goes to shit you know and Michael Walker talked a bit about that but I can't sit and read like I can't just focus in like alright my my brains turned on let me just bang out emails or fucking read a book like it doesn't work that way but I do start to problem-solve in a way that's not possible and not common when I'm eating food all the time it just works differently like all this other shit turns on Wow now when you were talking earlier about this creative experience mm-hmm how many times you done create them well I have a boatload of it I mean I don't know I mean I've lost track of how many times I've done it but usually when I do it it is that that one to two pill dose I don't exceed that often you're a guy who the reason why I ask is your guy who is always on top of all the latest and greatest in terms of like supplementation the benefits of certain things how do you know when to stick them in and like when to lay off other stuff cuz how do you know because you're not necessarily getting your blood tested all the time after you do some of these things right no I do blood work you know fairly often but that's just more for general health and wellness I see how things are impacting me you know these do do you like have a detailed analysis of like what you're taking in the days before blood work and then and compare it to times we're not taking those things most the things the thing that is the biggest impact on my blood work is if I'm in ketosis or not you know there's no there's no fucking doubt and that's also genetic you know it's not the fucking right diet for everyone that's a pinky ass to here what the fuck's the right one for me man that's that's like rhino if you got to figure that out you know wired to eat it's a game-changer it really is very good but you got it you got to do your fucking homework have you seen Rob actually puts it into action on his Instagram page Rob wolf and his wife will eat the exact same thing and then he test ketone levels and blood sugar and blood sugar levels like at the same time stamp and his and hers are radically different like she's just better absorbing stuff yeah exactly and so I'm I'm similar to him genetically in that I don't do well with a lot of carbohydrates I mean like a wide variety I can eat a plate of yams and my blood sugar looks fine but if I have a little bit of white rice I'm fucking through the roof like pre-diabetic did you listen to the podcast that I did with Zach bitter no he's the guy that holds the world record for running a hundred miles in America he ran a hundred miles like literally ran a seven minute pace for 11 hours damn damn yeah that's the only thing you could say 11 hours and 40 minutes I think was the total that is so fucking crazy that you can run seven-minute miles for 11 hours and 40 minutes just keep going was he ptosis or was he most of the time he's in ketosis he eats a very meat rich diet and he is a fat burner he's in ketosis all the time he takes all kinds of you know crazy well he was talking about his diet like one of the things that he eats more than anything was steak right that was like his big thing like fatty pizza meat and when he runs though when he's involved in a race or anything worth is extremely extremely high requirements on his body then he goes way above like ketosis levels of carbohydrates oh yeah nine grades and hundreds of grams during the race that's that's totally what you should do and that's I'd ran that 50k after I was on your show last here it says he says what's even more surprising those bitter trains and compete complete competes on almost no carbs at times carbs account for his littles 5% of his diet and bitter insist that even weaned on endurance record holders to do the same yeah but remember he was talking about when he did the races he takes some glucose supplements an article about this one yeah I think he means most of the time most the time when it's eat in training and exercising he's burning almost no carbs well that's the goal though no that's metabolic flexibility the goal I could leave if we're from out the gate we eat carbohydrates every fucking meal until we're 40 we're not making ketones our body doesn't know how to use fat refuel if we at least spend a period of time and that's what I do now I'll spend about six months a year in ketosis with maybe a couple carb days in in a whole six months span and then after that I'll practice some carb backloading or maybe I'll have you know higher carbohydrate days but I'm still eating higher fat higher protein throughout that and or moderate protein throughout that that creates flexibility that's what we're designed to do you know you can argue all you want about what fucking paleo man ate and all that shit but the truth is before refrigeration and before shipping we did not have access to carbohydrates most the people on this planet didn't have access for at least three months out of the year right yeah so I mean there's there's at least a period of time where we should take off and allow our body to reset and start to burn fat for fuel and then when we go back to eating carbohydrates we utilize it a little bit better well there's also people like the Inuit who didn't eat any vegetables at all yeah but I think even with them two months out of the year when they grow seasonally they'd eat a little bit more carbohydrates and probably not be fully keto what do you think the year what do you think they would eat whatever the fuck grows as they grow I'm sure two months out of the year they can grow some shit man I don't even know aren't there spots where they can never grow anything all year round possibly I don't think it's gonna hurt them I disagree with with people that think you should be one of the other year around and let's like the same dumbass argument you should only eat plants the rest of your life yeah like to be key to the rest of your life I think you're missing the point the point is to have your body finely tuned and adaptable and able to to eat all things intermittent fasting is good way to go about that and when I do that regularly when I get like three or four days in a row there's a noticeable difference in like the need to eat like that feeling that inflammation goes down cognitive function goes up sleeps improves yeah there's a lot of benefits to it for sure some people are going crazy with it doing 20 and 4 wow that's that's but not a terrible idea not a terrible idea I interviewed this guy Todd white was the CEO of dry farm wines he does that every fucking day fast for 20 hours he'll have a bottle or two of the dry farm with his dinner hmm that's it that's his fucking deal and he shredded like I'm a damn MN I'm a paleo FX this year and it was curious to me because everybody that's a part of that is you know their health oriented they're kind of dialed in at least they're on track they you know they work out that you can be a fat guy at a paleo fest yeah they pay attention to what they're putting in their body and how they move right yeah but but at every kiosk or every every little booth not everyone looks the part at this guy's booth everyone's fucking shredded everyone's got a giant smile on their face I was like what's the fucking deal and he's like well 18 out of 20 of us are kedo almost all of us do intermittent fasting they have group meditation every night that would help with fat loss but I mean just to say that they're dialed in group meditation every fucking day at 9:00 a.m. their entire company well the keys he's a fucking legit guy to him with meditation with the whole company with the entire company how many dudes just think about dicks group meditation visualize those guys doing the dick exercises yeah and stop with the weights to build Google my dick look or it wasn't circumcised would it look like a picture made probably it probably added half an inch or you could just shoot stem cells into a like green field to get the half-inch those guys who are doing those good like is that a mandatory thing do you have to do it to work at the company do the group meditation I think it's I think it's a requirement yeah I'd be annoying if I think is he good once you fucking got into it they me even if you didn't learn yeah but maybe I like fucking meditation if somebody carved out like working it on it's fucking amazing cuz we're not only allowed to work out on the clock but we're encouraged to encourage to use a sauna we're in currently there's a fucking meditation room then I'll go hit and meditate for thirty minutes like I'm outside with my shirt off barefoot doing Tai Chi and weird shit dude all the time and that's okay right so that culture that's created there is awesome there's nap pods at Google for a fucking reason right so if you had that scheduled and aware you were going to meditate fucking day on the clock and you knew like this is my time to rest and and just get get silent I think over time you'd buy into that over time you'd learn how or you would say I'm a fucking accountant and I came to this building to work not to have some fucking cult member asshole guru who try was probably just trying to fuck everybody fuck down when I can meditate I meditate on my own time motherfucker I'm here to work he said I need that extra 10 minute he told me most the people in his company still have a meditation practice outside off the clock I would tell him that too if I wanted to raise you know what you know I've had a take for 4 hours when I'm out of here bro I meditate about you and how amazing an amazing leader you are just so yeah man I think it's a great idea I just think there's be some people that would well I guess if you let him know before they took the job hey man the only thing we requires 10 minutes of meditation every day cool with that yeah I'll take it but what if you you know like I think people people gravitate towards that there's like-minded individuals at every fucking company unless you just I need money and usually those people get weeded out of the equation right well on it's a great example of that when you go there everybody's super positive fit very friendly very friendly environment like there's no Dicky if they all fucking enjoy what they're doing to and if they don't they see themselves out yeah you know I mean I think having there's no company you're ever gonna work out where a hundred percent of the people are fuckin dialed in and they're all on the same page and no we're gonna change the world doesn't work that way but if you have a high percentage that are that are doing that that's why how you see big changes happen yeah when you know hundred employees I mean you're gonna have a little chaos a little bit you know you're gonna have that you're gonna have to do it Jen said to Mike in front of everybody you're gonna have that you're gonna have craziness you're gonna have people that don't work together well don't like each other because of pre-existing biases because of who knows whatever the fuck it is they remind them of an ex people are weird getting men and women to work together just to just to pull that off alone who you know you know we got HR now it on it that's interesting what's that like I don't know I don't have comparison because it's my first real job right where I get to play an adult so you have a person who's hired to make sure that no shenanigans take place well just to create a pipeline for people to talk to one another or a pipeline where you can handle things in an appropriate manner so if someone takes offense to some and we all had to go through this fucking ridiculous and hilarious like 1990 video on you know harassment in the workforce shit like that I had to watch those for a couple different TV shows when you when they start with TV show off it's one of the things they do in the beginning they everybody has to go there we all sat in the bleachers like we were there for a show taping and they pull the screen down and they played us this video on harassment Weinstein didn't watch it yes he did he's there's no Weinstein character in that video shockingly there it is yeah if you so I mean I don't know if that works I guess maybe it works in that people know they can't get away with stuff well no it's just it's a safe place for people to come talk and it doesn't mean like I mean I mean those videos know the videos come to shit they're how they work they're comical who's gonna like say mam's brought the sexually harasses chip that fucking videos got me thinking I think people might might bite the lip a little bit though things that can be repercussions like you know what yeah fuck who knows my job don't want to lose my I wouldn't want to lose my job if it wasn't on it because I have a family but I definitely don't wanna lose this job because it's fucking amazing yeah you know it's an amazing thing to be a part of I don't think that it's uh mmm-hmm what am I trying to say here there's no room for fun with people anymore though that's the fuckin niche problem is if you want to cut all sexual harassment which we all do you don't want to cut fun but how do you you know especially like a guy who's saying something that he thinks is funny to a girl and it just really hurts her feelings and he was just trying to be funny like that's in her eye sexual harassment his eyes it's a joke well it's even weird everybody's eyes as a disaster yeah any and it it goes into all things like I fuck with Aubree's assistant a lot Ian he's a good buddy of mine and I you know I treat him like my little brother sometimes so but it's just joke it is always a joke yeah and so we had this team meeting on the jujitsu mats and he's sitting next to me in the second we broke after the meeting I just fucking got on a leg and started cranking like run the fucking mats bitch you're mine and I'm digging my knee into his shin like doing some you know like dirty jujitsu and I forgot the leg I was on he had just fucked up in soccer so he I mean dudes like he's on fucking crutches for a minute you know and I would clown him a little bit about being on crutches and here comes the GIMP and he's my boy and then I realized after watching this video I'm like oh that's just as illegal as sexual harassment and so you know I make a joke about that too like you know Ian nobody's allowed to make fun of you for being disabled that's against the law and you can go to HR for that so if anybody does that you know you can go see something it's okay and that was kind of our you know I mean inside Jones my fucking boy so I can buy that but that's still illegal yeah I should be saying right now well see the thing is if you have good friends you're good like it's what we were talking about earlier with flight comedians good friends say fucked up shit to each other for fun and it's fun for both of them because if you have a real friend do you love each other so much you know that he doesn't really think terrible things about you but he could say funny ridiculous shit like that because it'll make both of you laugh because you know it's not the case but if you thought it anyway was the case that you really were like mocking him in any way then it would never be funny yeah but because you're never capable of that it's very funny and I don't think I think the real issue comes down to people who are looking to be offended right there's that there's also people that are terrible at telling jokes there's people that are terrible at joking around with people and they make people uncomfortable there's some people in the room that won't laugh at anything you know fucking looking for shit right and there's the question right if you have a company like how the fuck do you decide who to hire and not to hire because you don't know these people in the beginning like sometimes people are one and they get a little power and then they become something different they just become a different thing and then they get like ambitious or who knows their life changes in some way and then they get aggressive and then they're different person like hey who are you that we hired five years ago now we have to figure out a fucking exit strategy to get you out of the company fuck you know I've seen many friends go sideways on situations like that where they start doing business together and then the business takes off or doesn't take off or whatever they're stuck together and then they're not the same person who they were ten years ago when they started this fucking thing so there's all this weirdness and resentment and you know well hopefully no one's the same person they were ten years right hopefully you fucking grow and it's a positive thing or it's not always the case it'd be you growing and them not or them and you not I mean it's not uniform either that's the other thing it's like if you find like-minded people the great thing about it is everybody's trying their best to be a good person to be to take care of their body they're trying their best there's gonna be some hills and valleys and ups and downs but for the most part the thought process is about trying to be your best always right if you around those people like everybody's gonna be okay but if you around the people that are fuckin super negative about stuff and always sabotaging their life and always fucking up things for friends around them and always ruining this and fucking up that oh that can be exhausting that can steal your DNA like that steals your fucking that the whatever it is it makes you a person that feeling that you get when you're around someone who's just fucking up all the time or you're like oh yeah that's Austin that's kind of the deal to where you just you know if it is family or somebody you care about just love them at a distance you know better remove yourself from that you can't get wrapped up is there's certain family members that they go crazy and you can't get wrapped up they'll take you down to take you down with them you can't live to live simultaneously you do your best if people want to go crazy and that's always been my my real fear and concern when someone that I know well does the drug thing goes down the drug the drug hole you know like you see like so like what are you doing man are you doing something no no not to nothing and you're like oh no we got we got a Tweaker over here we lost the homeboy he's tweaking he's not even himself anymore now he's gonna lie to us about whether or not he's taking meth yeah I've seen shit like that in college lost a friend of heroin well lost two friends the heroin gained one back and he got fucking clean it's not fun that's the rough one to witness yeah people that are willing to stick a needle in their arm right into the vein there's the romantic thing about it to some people that this is the ultimate fuck you to safety you know the fuck you the standard norms the society's put on you and you stick that needle in you and just untie the strap fucking crazy what a crazy thing to do Ari Shaffir had a good point on that though he was looking at uh I forget when he was talking about it but he said he saw a homeless man and he realized the guy was on some fucked-up drugs and he was like oh I get it you were just introduced to the wrong drugs mmm sorry does a lot of drugs but he has drugs that help elevate him and lift him to a new spot and give him new perspective and hope and joy and this other guy just got fucking suck deep down the rabbit hole in the wrong direction Wow yeah I think in some ways that's true but in some ways they like the heroin better you know who was it that had that statement about heroin there was there was a I'm not gonna remember it but there was a fascinating statement about heroin killing you that what that when it was killing you you I think it was Lenny Bruce talking about it but that it was it was such a sweet death I really forget the quote because a heroin is something I've fixed me out so much I don't even like reading too much about it I like read a few things here there about people that are hooked on it it just it creeps me out so much it's almost like I'm reading about demonic possession and in a way I think it is and the way I think would people lose their entire life to some pills they can't stop they lose their family lose their job and they just can't stop to keep taking it how is that really any different in terms of the overall results and the effect it has on your loved ones and your friends and your family and yourself how is it any different than just a really evil demon that talks you into staying home all day and makes you throw up and it's just fucking with you all day and making you tired just drag you near the ground making you fall asleep right in front of the sink how was that if there was a demon doing that you're like oh my God look at him he's possessed by a demon it would be horrible if we just saw some kid who's just as his body's all fucked up cuz there's a demon inside of him controlling it but instead we're like oh no he's all fucked up cuz he shot up he shot up well though it's the same thing yeah it grabs people that's the fucking problem though is that you look at that that's it I'll die young but it's like kissing God that was his expression of it yeah who died of a morphine overdose on August 3rd 1966 man whoo he's from in my line of work that's the that's the that's that's the Lucy you know that primordial or whatever we would how would you call prehistoric human human owned hominoid what was Lucy that was the hit the kisser yeah yeah yeah that's what Lenny Bruce is and a lot of second you said Lucy I was thinking LSD but oh I know you're talking about LSD they they are Lucy was on the cover of Nat Geo right yeah I was like one of the first like early human skeletons they had I think there's some controversy attached to that thing to which there always is to those ancient humans that they find you know find a fucking human from how long ago was Lucy I mean two million two point nine two point nine million let me see a picture that was us just 2.9 million years ago what the fuck that's crazy would you fuck Lucy if I had to for the good of the human race if we need to make people who was asking if they would fucking neanderthal who wasn't you the answer is yes the answer is fucking yes it happened when humans flush and Yentl what I mean by Lenny Bruce's this is like he's the first he's not like primitive I mean he was like super advanced but he was the very first version of that the very first version of a real stand-up comedian mm-hmm like that everybody all lines come from Lenny Bruce there's a bunch of his contemporaries that were really good too and there's a bunch of people from that era that were just all innovative and interesting thinkers they all I'm sure fed off of each other but Lenny Bruce is almost like Lucy she's he's almost like the first awestruck he's like the first real stand-up comic you know like we say like okay I get Mark Twain was doing it I understand that all these different people had like a kind of you know comical way of talking in front of people but there was something about the way he was analyzing and breaking down Society onstage that was this was the first of those so you watch that you go wow that's um that's like some it's like almost like a scientific discovery it's like well this is now this is gonna shift the culture this way because now people gonna be mocking things for free entertainment so the other side is gonna get way more mocking so you're gonna have your serious side but there's gonna be a business and making fun of it now there's a new thing now this is a new thing and that's what that guy was it's kind of a trip and you really stop and think about how influential one person can be you know that one person with some crazy amount of talent some weird way of looking at things can shift like oh I'm sitting across from one right now that's horseshit this this guy right here man he was he was doing things play some of this man you know that the same dumb suits for ten years you walk in her closet you can't even breathe that's it I got a whole bunch of suits I'll get a chick that likes to hang out man I'll get it I've had enough vodka party that's modified to parties swing it up all I got a chick likes to drink the way my wife she used to look good standing up against this thing she's the lowest though I really put her down no no I really miss her I don't want some sharp chick that can cook Kerouac and walk with boys I just want to hear my old lady say get up and fix this thing it's still making noise like a nearsighted dog where's the bone ah but it's better to be all alone no more taking out the garbage hear her yakking on the phone I gave her everything even my mother's ring but to me she was so petty sometimes I wish that she were dead there probably take her two hours to get ready what the fuck this is probably like I would have to guess like 1960 what year was I to say hmm wonder when that was it's got to be somewhere in that neighborhood but that guy and big heroin problem man big big big heroin problem and he was also fighting against censorship he was like one of the first people that was a public speaker that was challenging the ideas of censorship in court he was getting arrested for doing his nightclub performances and saying certain words you know and he was talking about how ridiculous it is to put all the power in these words including racist words it's nobody was doing anything like this back then it was crazy shit and a lot of what he was doing to mean you know sanity yeah a lot of what he was doing was you know he was a big believer and expanding his consciousness he was getting fucked up a lot he's you know he's doing obviously doing heroin because he died of it talked about it pretty openly but who knows what else he was doing - I think marijuana was involved in there - he's expanding his mind and it's strange time I think it's impossible for us to really put ourselves in the mindset of people who lived in the 1950s and 1919 60s I think I don't even think we're capable of doing it no we have like a vh1 depiction of that did you ever see the decades yeah where they went through for the 60s the 70s the 80s the mess that was pretty fucking rad pretty awesome right that's still a Hollywood version of it a hundred percent you know yeah even when they get to the 80s you know like cocaine's resurgence and it's all fucking Madonna and Prince it's so silly back to the future and yeah that I don't think we can imagine what it would have been like growing up then you know living in his era like people were so buttoned-down to have some guy come along go why why are we doing it like this you know he was that's a crazy thing that stand-up comedy started in America it really did I mean there was definitely jesters and you know King Arthur's days and all that bullshit and from the beginning of time people have had court jesters and there's always been funny people in the village that everybody gathered around like a Joey Diaz type character that lives somewhere but there's the art of stand-up comedy like that was the first and I think I mean maybe I'm wrong maybe it's Mark Twain but if it's not saw Mark Twain it's him you know that was the first one where people started wanting to be that and then they're kind of like there was a lot of that coming off of that you know like these these little branches get taken off the main river and culture occasionally you know and I think a lot of that was what I was reading in the Malcolm Gladwell book that I was talking about earlier that was the point tipping point it's all about different trends like very real specific stuff like what what caused this uptick and syphilis in one part of the country and like what cause like what what are these all these factors that fall in place that all work synergistically and push something over the top how did Hush Puppies go from a business that was like almost bankrupt to being something that like everywhere and then there's in two years they had stores open in every mall and they were closed I mean they were open for decades without this kind of success and something happened and they became this hip thing to have hush puppies on and then boom that business just explodes out of nowhere and these weird moments like that sometimes like an Elon Musk type character comes along and just I want to fucking put people on Mars I'm gonna make an electric car I want to put chute tunnels under the ground like one of these characters comes along and then through them it's like this new river and all this new crazy shit happens that guy was that was that guy's probably the number one for stand-up comedy for that fucking massive yeah pretty crazy shit dude you ever see uh who was the name of it the touring the touring test the touring tutoring test is the whether or not you could tell if artificial intelligence is human yeah it's not the Turing test it's the movie about the guy who invented the computer touring Oh the British dude um talking about ex machina or like the one about the imitation game or something the imitation game yeah it's fucking nuts to think like if you look if you watch that movie and obviously have you seen it no it's the imitation game it's awesome that guy's a great a great fucking actor too I'm writing this right now it's Doctor Strange you Benedict Cumberbatch yeah he's a savage but they go do that in that time period he fucking invents the fucking computer you know and then they go through the time period he's gay in Britain and they put him on medication that lowers his testosterone so he won't be gay so I won't have sex with men it's fucking insane that's hilarious but if you think about like people who move the fucking needle right like people that change it shift like if that's where it comes from computers and then we get to fucking hyper intelligent super intelligent AI it all started there that is crazy like one well there was a bunch of different factions right a bunch of different people are working on computers because a woman created the very first computer code mm-hmm yeah forget what her name was well there's two there's two pivotal inventions by women in in computer design and then ultimately and and in the actual execution of it here it is Ada Lovelace has been called the world's first computer programmer what she did was write the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only on paper of course someone had to be the first but Lovelace was a woman and this was in the 1840s suck it stupid people suck it ada ada was rocking shit in the 1800 she's figuring it out imagine you've you'd be like look one day they're gonna be able to do this right now they don't wanna do it with if one day if they just figure out I do this this is this and this is that we're gonna have computers and the computers will operate on this algorithm and people looking at you like what the fuck are you talking about computers it like imagine out what a hell it would be to be a super super genius living amongst the cave people you're like you fucks we could be flying around a few assholes knew how to melt aluminum can you guys get me some glass you know no glass shit do you have any wires so you have no wire okay way to get your metal you don't have metal what shit you imagine if you like we're looking at metal in the ground like why don't they just pull the metal out and make things out of that and they look like what's the point what's the point in making a house what's the point what's the point in having glass windows that look out at these cave people fucking each other and stab and mastodons in the deck with flint tips tools fuck imagine what the hell that would be that would be like the worst thing you could do to somebody like imagine if one day they'd come up with a time machine and one of the punishments for people that were real pieces of shit is you would throw them in front of Genghis Khan's horde in like 1200 AD you would just like take your underwear you're in your underwear everybody knows it's gonna happen you have a chance to live if you just might get lucky Mike teleport into the right spot and not get slaughtered and eaten by the Mongols as they come over the top of the hill but we're gonna put you right in front of them and you know good luck you piece of shit fucking transport with a time machine I mean if they do come up with what the ability to do that to people one day like an actual time machine that would be the biggest hell ever take a person from 2018 who's used to driving around in his Tesla checking his text every five minutes and no you we're gonna let you live we're gonna let you live but you're gonna live in 1200 ad no doctors no doctors what the fuck is a doctor what are you talking about man you got a run you got a run they're coming over the hill you smell that yeah that's people burning you smell people burning they're like candles run I've just fucking run but you're alive that was the punishment yeah that before you know that would be crazy imagine if somebody raped you and you get to decide what year they come back where they have to go yeah what just send this motherfucker back to the dinosaur era good luck you can't and then they they're there they're gonna be by themselves 65 million years ago how many people would say yes to that like how many people said yes well we could do one thing Bernie Madoff we can either put you in jail for the rest of your life or you get freedom in prehistoric Central Asia what would you do I take the death by prehistoric Central Asia oh yeah you got a fucking live all day got a little mean Siberia there yeah at least I'm not in a fucking cage until my heart stops beating 100% I'd take that all day I'll roll the dice I'll roll the dice it'll suck I'll die for sure but I'll dive running or trying to get away or you know hopefully break a leg you know I mean I'm not gonna die in that box that's the craziest thing about you don't you you just decide when someone has crossed some line that you're we're gonna take you out of circulation we're just gonna cool you in this little cage we're gonna hope you get better when we let you out in 15 years like what a stupid idea it's not working that's how you know it's a stupid idea it's not working for anyone you want to protect people from violent offenders that's primary right violent offenders people who want to rob people or murder people or rape people or assault people that is like the number one thing is we want everybody to be safe I love Jamie I don't want Jamie to have to worry when he walks down the street that there's guys they locked up ten times gonna jump out of the bushes and take his knees out with a baseball bat for no fucking reason other than he's crazy right you don't want that nobody wants that so we all agree you got to lock up rapists and murderers and all that but after that after you get to after you get past that it's like hmm what what good does it do to get that guy that cheated on his taxes why do you put him in a cage for a year why don't you let him work and pay you back like why is he in a cage for a year that seems that seems like you're punishing him like you're just trying to torture him and steal a year of his life but he'll just owes you money he doesn't owe you a year of his life how much is a year of your life worth it's worth fucking billions of dollars a year your life fuck you man you can't take a year or someone's life that's crazy but if you owe taxes they go out like a year of your life sir or if you're fucking selling plants selling plants or worse you're one of those people that didn't send the envelope and you're trying to bring some of that 4,000 pounds of cocaine over what would be a good deterrent to stops I don't think there's I think education is the real determine you have to catch them and there has to be punishment I give you owe people money there should be reparations you should like if you if you were involved in some sort of a banking scheme and you rip people off you should have to pay those people back period you should have you should be responsible for that after that you're assuming that someone's capable of growing and sometimes we don't like to do that it's very convenient to assume that someone is in a static state and they're never gonna grow oh this old banker asshole he's just a ritual cunt and this is how he's gonna die fuck him there's there's that thing but he's a human being and even if he lived his life fucking people over on those you know those weird mortgage situation loans that were going on what were those things called those shorts adjustable arm yeah the adjustable mortgages that people got fucked on because they signed up for him and they were a really low rate and then also in the rate jacked up through the roof and they were just inevitably gonna lose their house and this was like something that people knew about it before even the people that organized that kind of shit even knowing they can grow it's a horrible thing they did but they to say that they're done fuck them lock them up forever my grandma lost her house it's terrible that your grandma lost her house and whoever the fuck benefited from your grandma losing the house they should all have to give that money back too we should figure out the fuck how the fuck they allow these banks to weasel people like that you're not looking out for anybody's best interests when you do something like that and obviously they didn't know they were gonna the rates are gonna get as high as they got where people were well they should know situations but they should have they should have known something was coming you hit the point though that they should have hooked and paid back yeah we shouldn't agree no no those fucking people got paid back it doesn't matter how long you lock him up for like nobody fucking got their house back yeah everyone got fucked over and even people that were involved in the organizations that were probably responsible and part for the recession which fucked everything up there those people I got bonuses when there was bailouts it's the whole thing is the bailout should have been for fucking everybody who lost their home for sure for sure it shouldn't the bailout most certainly shouldn't have gone to I know that they have to pay these people these bonuses because these bonuses are in their contract but that's still crazy it's still crazy even if it's in the contract I mean the government's got to bail you guys out you guys are a failed business this banks a failed business and you're still gonna try to claim that you guys did so well that you need a bonus like this is great and you're gonna take that taxpayer money and apply to your bonus so all those poor people out there working fifty thousand dollars a year you're gonna just take a giant what what's a good one for one of those guys what's a good one what's a good bonus what do you think is like the biggest bonus that one of those banker guys got during the bailout 300 million is it that high I don't think it said I got it 30 miles east that's what the JPMorgan guy got last you 30 yet there's last year yeah but wait a minute no we're not in a recession though like they were getting it at the end of Bush's term right so that was 2009 lady got 16 million someone got 16 million guy during the bailouts well and his worst year you got 20 million baller we thinks house looks like it's probably made out of cocaine it's probably glue so walks by and lays the walls here's a real question you give the average person 25 billion bucks they don't have to work again ever you know this guy's making 20 million bucks every year or more probably with all these bonuses right like what what when do you get out like how much do you have to have in the bank before you go you know what I'm just gonna fucking live frugally and never work again that guy does not need to live frugally he doesn't even any what I mean for most folks like what's the number that you'd have to get to will you like check please yeah I don't know what that whatever that driving forces though to attain that that doesn't just magically go you know it's not like you get to that point and you're like alright now I can retire like what do you fucking do in retirement look at the people who continue to work you have a thousand things you love to do right and you're good at them and you're obsessed with them other people don't have that all they know is their job all they know is to work and they don't they have a hard time integrating when they come out of that mmm you know you have to have something that gives your life meaning and purpose yeah that's true it's hard for people to take up new hobbies too but really fun that's the thing about learning stuff getting good at stuff when you suck there's a little you know a zit period the beginning or it's frustrating but once you if you do do like anything no matter what it is especially physical stuff something about getting good at things it's very rewarding you know not enough people go through that not enough people I think try new shit out and I think there's also new pathways that get opened in your brain the more you try something new that you suck at and when you start off from that beginner phase and try to like put it together and I think the little journey of the beginner face getting get her I think we should try something new once a year I really do I mean maybe more but for me it can't be more than once a year because I get too crazy about stuff for me once a year is like I might be able to squeeze something in once a year and try it out for a little while and not let it overcome all the things I'm already crazy about you know how often do you go hunting well it's usually in the fall for elk and then usually we do something in the early spring we go to Lanai and we hunt for access deer that's like the that gets you ready for Bo honey because they're really difficult to hunt yeah they're really fast they found out that access is 24/7 in Texas 24/7 yeah you can hunt them all day long but they have a real problem in the fact that they especially in the night they have no predators there's nothing at least in Texas they have mountain lions and I mean maybe coyotes are a situation for fawns I think I would think I would imagine coyotes get some fawns but they don't really have many bear to speak of Texas although I think Texas is seeing a resurgence in black bear population is starting to see sightings of black bear check to see if that's true um that would that would kill off some they kill off a shitload a deer a little little bear or little calves and fawns deer fawns and cow elk calves when a cow elk rather gives a calf bears get those fuckers all the time to get like half of them half of the fawns bond born damn yeah they smell it a mile away they have like insane sense of smell they can tune into like when when people shoot guns and kill an animal they think it's like a dinner bell like there's a real issue with that in like certain places where people hunt or there's bears what's once you shoot something they go oh I'm going that way I'm just gonna take whatever the fuck they shot and that'll be mine now I think it's smell the guts as soon as you start cleaning it deer and they smell it like way the fuck away from you might be going home with the bear and a nexus deer yeah I don't know if they hear black bear spotted in another texoma town yeah there it is that's fucking black bear imagine if you didn't know that bears existed there and you're out in the woods at night you saw that thing it's a fucking werewolf you know they have video of it oh yeah I think it's just the picture on the trail camera river that is oh I see yeah so don't now they know yep that's definitely a bear yeah they they travel fascinating animals man I mean if they weren't real you know what a what an interesting thing that would be in fiction especially at Grizzlies Kodiak bears you know I mean if they didn't exist what a what a crazy creation that would be in a movie and just seeing a bear like what the fuck is that thing you know it's a Star Wars animal well just being up close to one totally different ballgame have you ever seen one in the wild no when we were I went to the Kenai River in Alaska salmon fishing on a bachelor party and in one of the tiny airports there before we got in they had a full-size fucking hind legs and I was like good fucking go I had no idea like no idea how big it was same with mousse though like I had no idea what's about Jamie this happened here woman says she stabbed Bear during attack in California Park yeah they have black bear in Los Angeles Los Angeles what watch your shit Joe Rogan what holy shit a popular Park in California is back open Friday after a woman says she was attacked by a bear and had to stab it in order to escape Los Angeles County sheriff's officials say the attack was reported at about noon Thursday on the Pacific Coast Trail in Los Angeles area Vasquez parks Rock Rocks park where's Vasquez rocks holy shit dude look at this she she was hiking on the trails you turned around after seeing what appeared to be bear droppings a short time later she heard something behind her head and turned to see a small black bear approaching her at a fast pace she pulled a knife from her backpack and stabbed the bear in the left shoulder which made it stop and run away authorities say the hiker was scratched on her waist on her wrist but she refused medical treatment holy shit this bitch is gangster she stabbed a bear and she's a first in LA to stab a bear that girl's ready though respect right I mean she pulled that fucking knife out stabbed that bear and the bear scratched her and she's like I'm good I don't need to go to a fucking pussy ask doctor I just stabbed a bear motherfucker where is it is it off to ten what is that near Palmdale Oh interesting that's not Los Angeles north okay near Palmdale Palmdale is way out there man where's Palmdale okay it's halfway between here and Palmdale you go back out again a little bit we're some of the streets of the cities rather Angeles forest it's right in between oh okay perfect so it's near where the two is right just north of Burbank okay is that the two that's just the 14 it's them but this is the five and then this is the okay that Angeles Crest Highway is gorgeous up there that it that's where Jay Leno does all the stuff when he takes cars up there and like does that Jay Leno's Garage it drives them too fucking beautiful up there it's crazy so that's where the bear was that makes sense there's bears up there there's bears and centum sent a barber believe it or not believe it yeah mountainous right yeah people find bears out there you spent time in there Santa Barbara yeah yeah yeah I love it out there it's gorgeous you know it's um it's a real unfortunate what happened in this last mudslide you know about that a lot of people died in a mudslide yes my old man I think it was last year he lives in the Santa Cruz Mountains and he was fucking trapped like not in his home but in his small town for two weeks whoa because the road that leads the 17 now you get from Santa Cruz to San Jose yeah completely shut down tons of mudslides that's right and the PCH was shut down for a long stretch right mm-hmm I think it still is I think it's still down I think the stretch of the stretch of highway that takes that'll take you from like San Luis Obispo all the way up to San Francisco that's that's the PCH right yeah yeah there's a spot like well well on the way to Big Sur there's a spot worried I don't think you can get through it anymore hmm I think it's still fucked up see if that thing is still closed but it was it was a giant stretch that got wiped out like they had these photos of before and after it's like imagine seeing that go down magic bean in your little fucking mg convertible zipping along look at the ocean boy life is grand and you see this fucking mountain coming down just you you know this is it this is it this is how it's gonna go that's back over now oh they opened a beautiful how long did it take to reopen it I don't know it's been open for earlier this year ah nice that's good how do they never did they say how they figured it out because there were some questions is whether or not they were going to dig it out or whether they're gonna put a new road over the top of the dirt that's there now road tripping hipsters road tripping hipster families what a weird thing to say resident survived by creating hiking trails that enabled people to bypass the highway closures by foot and those courageous enough to drive could take on the nasty Nascimento Fersen road with its hairpin turns and steep drops yikes it crosses a Santa Lucia range and connects the Big Sur coast with route 101 further inland given the challenges several tourism businesses simply closed up shop for the summer Wow imagine having a hike for food and shit and you realize like oh my god we live on Big Sur like we're trapped who are we thinking what the fuck we thinking and the earth move you wouldn't have a knife on you or what would you do you wouldn't have shit wouldn't have shit you people were out there with your Birkenstocks on talking about your next ayahuasca session and next thing you know you see that mountain coming down on you look through your fanny pack and like where's all the functional shit in my utility belt right now I don't even have a key like at least you have a old-school key and kind of cut things a little bit with a key most people don't have a fucking key anymore keyless entry current fobs you have a Fabio key for your house and you get a fob for everything else fucking fobs how long before we wear those things I have one in my wallet I have a Lexus and it's a card my cup my key is a card card entry you keep it in the wallet keeping them wallet yeah I like that yeah it's great yeah so you always have your wallet you always have your card that's better because even with all the keyless entry shit now like it still got a spot for it in my fanny pack it's still taking up way more space than it needs to yeah way more right that's close to being one you just didn't have to have that screen right all the time imagine if you could program your phone no to open up your car then someone steals your phone then they'd steal your car I can I mean UK's the BMW app oh you'd have to open you can unlock I could unlock you unlock my car I can make a beep from here I can now turn the air-conditioning on I like ventilate it that's Savage dude I didn't know that was possible where you parked look at you god damn I don't even know they could do that yeah turn that shit Kyle Kingsbury we're living in the goddamn future we are we are there's no doubt you guys are setting up the fucking little AI machine out there right now oh that's not AI that's virtual reality there's a big difference that's a vive yeah but it's sooner if you're gonna interact with shit that's gonna be it's gonna change the world I think someone needs to set up like a Muay Thai game on that vibe like they have a boxing game someone needs to set some up with kicks you know and have someone who kicks at you you know the kicks and all that shit it teaches people to point spar it does but it wouldn't be your if if it wasn't your only training if your was your only training you know like a lot of Thai guys go light anyway when they spar I mean spar Thai style they're playing with each other you can kind of do that with this and just do it fast and then as long as you did like pad work and real sparring on top of it I bet it would add I bet it would add something just makes sense I mean you're constantly you constantly being reacting but there would be no consequences right like you're not even feeling but you you would you would constantly be reacting to movement and you would get it to react to you but there would be no consequences so you could do it all the time not worry about like hurting yourself and you also wouldn't worry about like getting hit so you'd be a little freer with your motions I think if they that would have to be another human playing you though because if it's just fucking some computer I mean they got to write it in an algorithm on how often the feint works how often it doesn't like if it didn't if it wasn't scared I wouldn't give a shit it would just block everything and destroy you well it knows where your body is very perfect distance so it has to have some sort of yeah you would have a haptic fucking jumpsuit on you'd have a haptic like wetsuit I'll go all the way to the top and so you get hit with like an inside leg kick you'd hear the slap you'd feel that slap on the inside of your thigh whoo you know did it's not perfect but I think that it would there would be something real beneficial about that just just constantly moving and constantly reacting to this thing in front of you you just put in a lot of reps that way gauging distance yeah a lot of reps but it'd be interesting to know like would it know when you really hit it with stuff like you're not hitting anything what about like when when you're getting jammed you know when you're hitting it and when he--when you too close yeah I like the power meter right yeah yeah yeah you lent it the kick it shouldn't it's not all kicks for this right yeah the same just because you make contact yeah if someone if you go to throw a front kick and someone's here and you get your knee up high and then you push into it that's a big difference between the guy being here and you just like kind of falling backwards like does it know she's you back vs. pushes him back that's that's huge was sparring having a good sense of distance I wonder how it knows that like exactly your foot lands I think some of the coolest shit that I've seen with that is like this artwork you can do this world or game this is it's not exactly this is crude of what your eyes are talking about it's called drunken fist fight oh the guy's gonna grab a pool stick and crack that guy oh whoa so there's sort of reacted to them but like it right now the VR thinks only tracking the sensors so that's you have to have a haptic suit that has sensors in it and I don't think they're quite there quite that far yet you know what I mean right I have to be a lot of sensors and right now that thing's lit track in the headset and the two things you put on your hands yeah you can't add more of those tube like maybe put on your foot or something like that but it's not it's like just tracking it in space so it's not it's not tracking impact or speed or maybe a little bit of speed I suppose yeah this is super crude give it ten years yeah but you know lots of sensors I don't even even know what you would need to track an impact oh so you're in a bar and you're supposed to be fighting these guys in a bar yeah this is just super simple but like these are just programmed you know like AI bots that are just like watching a swipe of a hand near its face and they just hmm so you I don't know I would say the long time away but maybe not I think the real move one day is AI robots that know jujitsu and go at like 50% speed that would have to be the case you've been watching West world no I watched the first episode of the new season and I haven't I've been I'm in on a kimmy schmitt kick what's that unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt it's Larry show on Netflix about a chick who is stuck in a bomb shelter with a religious cult for 15 years she comes out shows no shit about the world it's a really funny man Tina Fey's show okay it's not a genetic show yeah it's a comedy so I take little breaks I go Vikings unbreak the cancer got into Viking it's good a few episodes shit heats up around Episode four it's a good goddamn show yeah season two of Westworld heats up around episode of four yeah I watched the first episode and I just been busy it's damn good I like yeah just anything that gets me to think about consciousness what that is what it can be and where our futures at I don't want to I wish you had seen it I wanted a fucking death who's the woman who plays the main character what is her name I forget you the actual act or something would Madeline she's a beast so if girls woods she's so good great actress she's so good jack is married to uh what's-his-name right the the goth dude Marilyn Manson yes Rachel Wood Evan Rachel Wood woods with an ass I would what Evan Rachel Wood she does an amazing job of getting you convinced that she's both a person and a robot it's really creepy like she just nails it like there's no there's other people in the show that are great it's a lot of great people in the show but for whatever reason her combination and that the British the lady with the British accent Maeve so then Maeve she's a beast yeah the her phenomenal same thing like there's a scene with her I don't wanna spoiler alert her talking to another one of these robots about her daughter and you like Jesus Christ this is so fascinating because the writing is so goddamn good and then the acting is so goddamn good that it has this weird effect where you know they're kind of fucked up for people but they're not really people but they seem very people like there's just a perfect amount of off just the perfect amount of like what in the fuck are you well you get to see them learn - yeah then figure out dude what it means to be conscious anything Anthony Hopkins and I'm down I'm down - did you have you finished wild wild country no I went episode one and I was like I don't even know if I could do this oh you have going back I'm going back don't worry I'm going back I've seen a little break oh go ahead I got real-life shit to do man I'll get back to our promise I just that that there's something about cults and there's something about like seeing people just hook line and sinker roll out the red carpet here he comes here he comes you know that stuff freaks me out that stuff freaks me out I think because I've seen it seen it with martial arts especially seen it with a lot of a lot of the old-school martial arts schools were very culty very culty you know I don't know if you followed McDo Joe life on Instagram dude I'm just gonna give you a treat here McDo Joe life is a awesome collection of the fakest martial arts you've ever seen in your life and something about these videos is so goddamn compelling because these people who are the students they know the shit does not really work but they pretend that it works because they're just they're in a cult you know and this guy's like teaching people like if someone comes to grab him like to try to take him down like some wrestler check it out he's gonna put his hand here give me some volume on this Jamie small intestine is gonna get it right from the neck bladder point just making shit up dude just making shit up we got homeboys mustache behind him he comes in he touches them hits him here right here that's all you need to do bro Cain Velasquez shoots that power double just put that left hand look at that he's ko UK on him bro get him up this is important and this guy really believes us that's an anti Gracie move he says bitch try that too let try that on hens oh you fucking dummy there's so many of these but this guy has like an awesome collection of them look at this the guy gets out and throws everybody to the ground hi-yah I am a master they goes look at this man they're all they're all grabbing him and he's like but I have superpowers and you don't they might as well be 5 they might as well be 5 year-olds on a playground and one of them pretends he's dr. strange you grab me I'm gonna send you back to Mordor it's so stupid it's so stupid but this is what I'm saying these are cults this is there's something about this shit that freaks me the fuck out and my martial art school that I started out in Taekwondo school was very strict law discipline it wasn't really culty but it was a everyone everyone is there all little culty they're all little culty well there's Master and Mister and all that stuff there's always a little bit of that but we would go to tournaments and then we would see it full-on just full-on cults like one guy would be the kung fu master and have all that students and I'll be at his command and he'd be telling them what to do they like yes I'd say they'd scream it out and shit just like Karate Kid there's a lot of a man there's hundreds of these weird little schools that were run by people that were running their own little cults but at least at least at the tournaments like you guys are getting actually fucking compete right yeah so the kids even though they're they're like dogs they're well trained you know they always listen yes sir yes sir they still get to get on the mat and they experience loss they experienced some form of fucking real-world miss for sure it's not like the shit on McDo Joe yeah no but it's what's stunning about McDo Joe life is how many of them there are I mean there's and they're making video so this is the thing these people put scroll just scroll and show how many videos this guy's got up I mean who I don't even know how many it is probably hundreds but the thing is this is just what's on video man I don't understand how you know the easel that come to these places they don't ask for competition they don't ask to see somebody they don't know any better to think always but is it always like you know oh if I did this to a man he'd die you know like is that is that what everyone believes look at this one this guy when a guy has a knife to his neck he's gonna smush the guy's hand with his chin watch this he's gonna make the guy tap check this out the guy's got a knife right to his neck and he's like but what you need to do try it on me as soon as he gets that knife near me not the same spot bitch that's not the same spot right watch this okay I give up but I will take my hand and then my chin will make your hand hurt like this what's this guy it's the dumbest shit hurry up we get to it he goes look he's making him tap he's grabbing his own hand czi grabs his own head you leave that armbar ferocious ferocious at no point time with that guy I've been able to stab the fuck out of him with that giant knife in his hand that's just what looked a little bit more believable than the other one goes the one right next to it were the guys on the his knees there that one right there watch this one this one's so fucking stupid I mean this reach me with that hand reach me with that you cannot our mustache is like straight Ben Stiller but this is why I think I get freaked out by cults is that when I was a young teenager and I started doing martial arts I saw like certain elements of that I you know I went to Catholic school for just one year when I was young when I was seven first grade actually six right and it was fucking horrible yeah and I remember thinking like that I can't believe all these people are just doing this like all these people were following along there was like so awful okay enough with the I don't want to see anymore these I can't there's some stupid he's got high years of man but I recognize that like when I was young I was like this is not this doesn't make sense this is just everybody's just going along with this this is normal to leave your kids with this mean ass nun and all these fucking people or everybody's like staying order everyone's nasty to you and they're hitting kids like woof was awful and I remember thinking man there's something that happens to people when they get big groups of them together and they agree on irrational shit the sub did some weird thing that happens to people where everybody this can't be right that lady's not acting in the name of God there's no fucking way she's a crazy mean old lady and I gotta listen to her because she works for God this is fucking nuts can I talk to God does he know how she act no you gotta talk to him yeah get to talk through her she's a representative I got the phone line yeah your fucking parents take you there and drop you off and leave you with these monsters all day like what and some of them got fucked right some of them got molested not just some of them quite a few so I think I had a healthy respect for that and fear of that when I was really young and then I saw some of the same elements when I started doing martial arts particularly with like some of the more ridiculous like like really rigid traditional type styles a lot of kung-fu there was a lot of like you know for every hundred martial arts schools you had three or four that were just flat-out cults I just made those numbers up there with no one percent who was the guy he wasn't it was in China that fucked up one of these fake grandmasters and then he had to go into hiding yeah well that guy was two of them one of them happened recently was that that was the guy with yellow sneakers on right he was an MMA guy yeah yeah yeah and he fucked this guy up the it's not all of like two strikes to fucking dismantle it apart yeah I mean it's not it's not fair you're dealing with someone who's delusional but it is fair because we all need to see that because there's some people that really did believe that guy had magic powers because they run a cult like these people that are doing all this death touch that when they see their students like oh huh they fall down they believe that they're getting jolted and some weird might maybe not 100% but there's a small percentage of their brain that's willing to not just go along with it but to believe this guy something special that guy with the yellow sneakers didn't give a fuck about that he just beat the shit out of that dude and for everybody else but that dude that's good you know for that guy to find out that he's not really some possessor of magic powers I mean if he really did believe it here it is Oh red sneakers a different one maybe no this is it what is it he just beats the shit out of this dude I mean real quick he just storms him boom hit some of the right hand boom another right hand and just gets him on the ground and beats the fuck out of them I mean this is like maybe six or seven seconds before they stop at he's out cold have those mats in my house puzzle mats yeah they let me know the exact color I check them like that - you're an animal you keep in the living room uh-huh that's just from yoga we can roll that's hard wrestle with my son there you'd freak people out if they came into your house if you learn new in the neighborhood so uh you fucking hang out with me for a minute in the living room come on over and have some cacao dip into my cart Shekau yeah it's like a mild dose of MDMA Hey look at my living room it's fucking wrestling mats nothing creepy about that giant dude this big jack giant dude drinking cow this fucking five finger toe shoes on yeah welcome to the neighborhood that's the neighbor yeah come on in come on mat yeah he really loves yoga is it funny like that sounds like a great thing if you were single you know like if you're just a bunch of guys living together I've heard a hundred stories yeah we have our living room matted up and we just drill I know a lot of guys who got really good because of that like jiu-jitsu guys that want to be in roommates with other jujitsu guys and so instead of just going to class every day enrolling they would take one or two days a week and they would do like a straight hour of nothing but drills and like dude you'd be amazing how much better you get just from doing that amazing sense those guys won't go fuck that's that's kind of what I do a little bit though you know I just get on the mat like I don't have the time now to go to a full yoga class so I'll just hit it come there I'll drop down my wife she'll be certified now so she'll put me through some shit and we just do it that's very nice that's very nice to have do you ever do it outside in the grass yogurt rolling yoga yeah I've done yoga outside in the grass it's nice to be outdoors I think it is to can do you anywhere you know sure I was doing it on the cathedral rock on the LSD and the cacao that's a double dose son is that candy flippin or what how's it working it's kind of candy it's kind of conflict yeah whoa is that where candy flipping came from chocolate tea I don't think cacao has been around a little longer than LSD right but the original candy flip must have been MDMA with LSD probably but maybe it was candy maybe was cacao fuckin chocolate a little LSD laced chocolate hmm what else should we keep an eye on as far as interesting subsisting substances that you didn't know can make you trip balls look now that we know it's cacao I get a kick out this fucking juice place I go to see shit on cacao I'm saying it has similar properties so you're not gonna say liyan so you're not gonna see a damn thing it's not a triple dose whatever you took I'll take three times as much we'll see what that was that was an issue though that the issue is there's a lot of magnesium in cacao and having fasted for four days so at 3 o'clock I was like we need to go now Wow and I fucking sprinted down the mountain for the shitter whoa straight like there you go another one the other one well I'm you know what I was able to keep that tight I was pinching the butthole like that lady with the vaginal clip going it's real accomplishment when you could do it I was a hard Kegel Duncan I almost shit myself a few months back headed to the improv I was real scared I got over the top of Laurel Canyon and I was going down Fairfax I was like I might not make it like this mine I might not I might not make it as you start sweating yeah I'm sweating hard did not feel good felt very nervous yeah very nervous yep I don't know what else is out there you know I know we're combining some really cool shit I mean getting to work on the podcast is fucking amazing and thank you both for encouraging me to start one I'm glad you did man you're so good at it it's like it's such a natural thing to you it's hard to believe that somebody had a prod you look at what I mean you're able to you're constantly able to recite interesting information about science or medicine or physiology you're you always have the stuff at your fingertips like why wouldn't you do a podcast doesn't even make sense it all makes sense now yeah you know of course it's like being like really good at playing guitar and someone says like you man you should probably be in a band or something like that like I don't know it sounds hard doesn't seem like something into not really into music yeah so yeah we got we got the podcast and that's a big child of minded on it and then sonic development would probably be the other big piece of that I mean let me in on this how the fuck do you make those protein bites this sounds like a commercial but those protein bites are those are crack well some in those things I've sent them to people my friend Erin Snyder you'll do the shit's heroin like what's in this you can't stop I considered making them into one so it's actually a bite and they're like no people eat both or if they do eat one they'll hand the other one off yeah it's not going to waste no no we've got four new flavors coming out and we've been I get to be the guinea pig for that shit - without Brie and a few other people on the team eg Lindsay tastes so good yeah they're and they don't make you feel bad at all no I'm Dita the new flavors are gonna be fuckin top tier - there's something about like there's I'm willing to get like a slightly adverse reaction if I'm hungry if I'm hungry and I want like a certain type of sugar-free protein bar I'm like I'll just fucking eat it I need something I'll eat it but while I'm eat and what what is this what's going on here what is this you know you your body's going yeah you know this is a little weird like whatever the protein in this is a little hard for me to digest here's a fart for you motherfucker but with those protein bites it doesn't feel like you did anything wrong no it's the fucking healthy they taste good but they don't feel like you did anything wrong yeah so yeah that's the idea of them to make something healthy that tastes delicious I eat four of them all the time I gotta I can let I get the thumbs up normally I'm not allowed to talk about shit we're not creating but I'll just give you this we're gonna fucking make really delicious healthy cereal cereal yeah like Coco Pops you fucking name it really yeah how do that well I can't keep away the secrets but I'm just saying son we're gonna have some fucking here's leading is milk healthy because I I don't think so for I think for a lot of people it's not up in California you guys can get raw milk that's healthier but it's necks healthier is is raw milk healthy I think it's healthier than the killed off gently healthy where they ate of all the the good bacteria that's in it 100% no doubt and then raw goat's milk supposed to be even better for you than that yes and the reason that we find out now that do you ever read the plant paradox by dr. Stephen Gundry no he's the fucking Savage did you bring this up on the first podcast we did I don't think I had read that on the first podcast Greenfield turned me on to this guy he says that there's a different type of casein protein that Holstein black and white dairy cows make versus southern European cows goats don't make it cheap don't make it so if you're gonna have dairy go with something from a southern European cow or go with like goat's milk cheese sheep's milk cheese those kind of things but I mean if you're eating the fucking cereal like I'm doing especially when I'm doing keto I'll throw heavy heavy coconut cream in there can coconut cream we're making our own keto ice cream with an ice cream maker do the same shit damn you know phenomenal stuff I'll let my son move that down you don't want dinner you just want ice cream cool whoa whose fucking egg yolks in there if there's no fucking you know it's all natural sweeteners no cart you know uh nothing's gonna fuck with his glycemic index people don't think that that would be you know if you everyone thinks you have to suffer somewhat right but if they could figure out to make a way to make something taste like a real ice cream sundae like with whipped cream hot chocolate cherries everything and have it be super healthy for you there's got to be a way Lili's chocolate bars no affiliation with those guys but they've fucking figured out how to make chocolate delicious and they do it with stevia they do it with stevia and a couple other things what is it called again Lily's Li llyr yeah yeah they're at Whole Foods sprouts all these places they're fucking insane they're they're really they're really insane they've got it dialed in but I mean you if you can melt that down on some homemade ice cream that's something I tell people a lot is if you're gonna cheat or if you're gonna eat for mouth pleasure make it yourself Bryl make your own fucking pizza with a better crust make your own dessert with with shit that's not gonna spike your blood sugar and make you fat and cause inflammation and fuck your brain up like just make it yourself go the extra fuckin mile do it yourself it'll be way healthier give time to make your own keto waffles really no I've watched your you were talking about him and I saw and they did a repost haven't tried their waffles or their syrup but I'm down to try I just haven't found the syrup anywhere they well you get it from their website no I fucked up some of their waffles with some syrup and just a pound of butter on it it was sensational that sounds like a good idea I didn't feel bad yeah after was over I felt good I don't even feel terrible that's the goal of creating shit like that right we've got a ton of keto shakes now at the onic cafe they will fucking change your life damn they're insanely good I'm changing yeah no doubt and they don't make you feel bad that's the key right like if there aren't some like I'll tell you I'm no plug here these fucking kill cliffs these are goddamn delicious I don't have any business affiliation with them but they don't how much sugar does this thing having it zero it's just a Rivero zero sugar shit tastes good but it doesn't have any bullshit in it right I mean this doesn't have any aspartame or anything what are they using it for what are they using this to sweeten it your risperdal what is that it's a natural sweetener that's low glycemic similar to stevia Lexile at all similar to stevia but they all have different flavor components so some of them worked better for an energy drink some of them work better for ice cream shit like that this is recovery and hydration so what it is this shit tastes fantastic and then there's no bad feeling afterwards like if I drank that and that was a coke I'd like oh so good going down a cold coke in the aluminum can you crack the top and it's got the fucking the condensation all over the top of it cuz it's so cold haven't had a chest and hold the cooler in years boy wait especially if you have some barbecue dude you're in the middle of slab of ribs and you go for that cold coke and you did chugged you chugged and you feel the serum you feel the thick syrup making its way to your veins lah but for that mouth pleasure you'll trade it all do you like the sea via this fucking amazing by the multi doesn't it's not the same flavor that oak I fucking love it though there's cherry cola beer yeah ginger Ale's good they got some great there's fucking great yeah that you can legit get things that taste good now that don't have sugar in them I mean we're just so addicted to the things that have the sugar in them you know if we could find healthy alternatives it's possible they're coming out they're coming out well listen man let's go fucking shoot some bows and arrows and shit I'm fucking 73 o'clock let's get this over with Kings boo on Instagram and Twitter yep on accom for everything else and hosted the audit podcast which is
