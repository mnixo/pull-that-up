hello freak bitches and I think maybe that guy wouldn't sexually harass in the big world but in this little world where everything's like jammed in together and you have these clearly defined things like this guy's got a plaque on his desk that says the boss right and you got to come in he's got the desk come on and shut the door shut the door or if you like now Lauer you got a button where you lock the door click come on inside we've got to discuss we've got to review your progress this month click this is the world I mean if he I'm not exonerating Matt Lauer can't believe I have to say this again but if you're in that guy's world and I don't even know what he did I didn't pay attention met him once he was quite a gentleman but he's in this he's got to be working 10 12 hours a day you're doing the Today Show yeah it's insanely competitive that morning TV thing you have to be on the ball you you have meetings you have stuff to review you have guests are you they're gonna review your performance and your conversations and people and well Matt you know whenever you start talking about sex people drop off look we've got the numbers we have the chart in the directory relation to what you were saying earlier is what I read about Matt Lauer was that he couldn't have sex with just normal people because he's famous and he's you know get in trouble he's married so he had to maintain the facade of that he and he couldn't have sex with other famous people because that would come out into the press so he had to have sex with people who weren't famous who weren't just normal people and that left the office and that was it yeah so imagine if we lived in a world where we said who gives a if Matt Lauer's  someone other than his wife between them the sixties again Dustin Hoffman was grabbing titties by the way sorry the last word on this for me anyway the people who are acting shocked and outraged around Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose are full of that's what that's what kills me the hypocrisy of the people have been working with them for years and going I had no idea I heard about Charlie Rose being a creep fifteen years ago and I don't even work in media you know right it's like the Bill Cosby thing everybody if you see if you guys seen this is like one of one of the grossest things you can this in a workplace is when the boss starts giving neck rubs you ever seen that a neck rub and boss though it is it is so creepy to watch married secretary dick just so how are you doing today Carol rubbing her neck just and she we could see the look on her face frozen she's got kids she's if she says to him hey do you mind I don't really want you to touch me right now he's gonna go oh I'm sorry but then she doesn't know down the line down the line when he's doing employer reviews and he's thinking you know what ruin that time I just wanted to rub her back man but I'm not rubbing any of the dudes backs in the office now that man that is up and that is one of the sleaziest slimy as thinks and to imagine when you're the boss to imagine that these bosses they're oblivious they just don't know they just want to give neck rubs they're not aware like come on they can feel it as he's rubbing their back if you can't feel their Adams trying to escape your sweaty goddamn male dominators how many guys become friends with women have air tag friends just so they just creeping closer almost like you're stalking big game and you want to just move that's what they're doing one of the classics that's how I hunt elk I walk real slow give it a neck rub but I try not to make my intentions known but Eddie is one of the greatest jujitsu coaches on planet earth it means an amazing jiu-jitsu coach and jujitsu competitor and one of Eric Dubay his biggest videos is about how jujitsu is  it just shows you it does isn't it about that it's like about wing chun kung fu defeats jujitsu which is by the way not true don't try it unless you're like way bigger and the guy sucks at you Jitsu you should get those guys in a room together then they can just yeah I don't think so they would just talk about conspiracies to the end of time any loves conspiracy I would like to talk to Eddie yeah we should do that I have to get you some earplugs here tonight so to kick in he's interesting because he knows so much about them all oh man is really interested it confuses me I'm like how much time do you have where do you have the time for this yeah he's spouting off this advanced physics references like mikkel Somalia yeah Ares failure and things like that those are the Flat Earth things yeah there's science experiments that especially prove the earth wasn't moving that one's hilarious to me because when I first brought it up to Eddie Jamie pulled this up and sent it to me the other day that I first brought it up to Eddie from like eight years ago on the podcast one of the really early podcast when we still did it in my house on a couch and he's like what's the most ridiculous conspiracy theory heard and I said Flat Earth he's like no people don't believe the earth is flat so he went from that to I don't think he's a hundred percent convinced that it's flat but he's definitely willing to listen he's down the rabbit hole I think got sucked in he loves it and it's probably like a lot of it it's just from him watching endless YouTube it's 100% what it is here it is right here what's the worst that conspiracy day like the worst one flat earth there's people to know in how I was flat to the young earth that's another battle no no no like today people don't believe it yes yeah yeah a percentage of the Christian population I went with young earth there for some  stranger we're all baked Oh probably unfortunately but that was that was when he found out about flatter for me and that was he started him down the Reverend episodes ago what episode was that 54 so that was probably 2010 yeah yeah first year yeah yeah that was even that big on the responsible for this whole thing well he and I used to watch UFO things forever but he got off at UFO see he goes in waves right Eddie goes in waves like we were both like really into UFOs and zecharia sitchin that was the big one but I would have said the same thing about Bill Cosby would you have oh did I ever tell you this story about Bill Cosby no so so I dated a girl in like oh five OH six or seven in New York beautiful girl mixed mixed race and like cool whatever great and she used to talk about she some Bill Cosby came up one time she was like oh mr. Cosby what a sweet man and I was like what what what do you tell me huh she's like oh yeah at one time I was on the street crying and mr. Cosby walked up and introduced himself it was like why are you crying and and and and you know and we struck up the friendship and I was like he was trying to him just so you know I was like just saying I was trying to  she's like no he was not trying to me like and and and like what are you talking about like no it was drinking again like I'm an animal for suggesting it like who you're so Boris why would you possibly think right and it's like cuz I met the guy and he's not a good dude and and so she she defended him he used to take me to place just all this I'm like okay he just had a long game yeah man and so then all this Cosby comes out then I text I go so what do you think what do you think you're a boy and she goes uh she said something like I think it like he absolutely did it and I think his wife was in on it which again I don't know what that what you meant by that but so then I weird text Mac importance she goes you know one time I was supposed to meet him in Philadelphia and he told me what to wear and how to wear my hair oh jeez and she goes and thankfully I got sick she was gonna do it she's gonna what she wanted yeah wow that was the time yeah and that up yeah and he uh he was gonna take her to the ultimate musical and she and thankfully she got sick and didn't go and and I was like and the whole time when it's like yeah that's the thing that one of the things with some of these stories is like why would Bill Cosby want to be friends with some lady do not even like what just because you're great-looking yeah well [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
