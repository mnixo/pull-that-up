the girag and experience yeah that's why I think that activities are really important for people there's a lot of people that unfortunately don't engage in activity they don't engage and they don't have hobbies yeah anything like that learn a language did do something do something that's exciting part of learning you know the problem with our education system Corbett I was saying this is that we don't have an education system that teaches you how to think right we don't that's so true and that's that's that's the there is an art to learning man there's an art to learning there's an art and art to being a human beings right it really is and no one teaches us we don't know what the fuck we're doing we're all idiots raising other people bar with you know the same flaws that we were raised well there's no manual for it exactly and there's in you know when you look at what we consider our our source of education as far as like what is distributed to us nightly what's the news right I mean that's really the education that people have today once you get out of school unless you're reading books on your own where are you getting your information about the world you're getting it from the fucking news well the news doesn't really represent what's a going on in the world and B it doesn't say anything about how you should be dealing with this how you should be thinking how we how we should resolve these issues it's like this tattle tale that just goes running over and tells us about all the fucked-up shit that's happening in the world but they don't there's it's not a dialogue with a person it's like a source of information by the way that complaint goes back at least 3,500 years Socrates when he was in his trial said you take a you wouldn't take a horse to try to ride it and not train it the same applies to a human being you got it you got to start with with the notion if he was trying to teach philosophy in the sense that you better you better know what questions to ask throughout your life and we should start with young people educate young people the right way with the right questions if you don't do that then then you know you've got to start with a base almost you know and we don't we don't do that man it's almost like learning jujitsu just learning moves without learning the principles behind it first yeah well it's also like learning jujitsu without going over the real correct drills learning real live you know applications and and you know the way school is set up I you know it again you want the fucker the way school is set up it's they have X amount of thousand kids and they have to get these kids through with the basic understanding of the building blocks of our world they have to understand math they have to understand how to structure a sentence and they understand they have to understand of form paragraphs and they got to know what happened in the past and then you're off on your own good luck fucker next stop College I saw quite a few euros online they're really really really interesting conversations and one of them that really struck me was you well there was a several of them that struck me but one of them was your story of being mugged and you you told people on an online room like where you got mugged and people were upset that you in telling them that you got then telling the world that you got mugged there it was lowering their property values yeah it was it was a bad one um that's so crazy yeah I mean it was one thing to get mugged it was just kind of freaky in itself you know and whatever you know shame and weirdness goes with that but um I guess what I was trying to do I mean deep down was probably elicit you know love and affection from the people on my list you know so I put up oh you know and there was a social some social responsibility to it so I put up where I got mugged cuz everyone should know this is maybe a dangerous stretch here we got to maybe get a light but yeah so I sent I sent it out and then the first two emails I got back from this like loving list of parents was how dare you say exactly where it happened you know we live right across the street you know you're gonna lower our property values Mike are you selling now is that is that no we're not selling but it was a really weird time when people needed their property values to go up because they were trying to get bigger mortgages and pay down and do all that and it was just like so panicky there about that that some you know someone was afraid of what if a newspaper covers it and it's bad and what if I it's so weird when ones and zeros Trump humanity you know and in that case that's exactly what that is it's ones and zeroes Trump humanity well yeah and two kinds of ones and zeroes you know the the ones and zeroes of money ya know and the ones and zeroes have sort of of digital technology which I think can create a kind of a distance mm-hmm because you're not feeling the impact of saying that to someone's face yeah yeah there's a weird communication it takes place online that's you know it doesn't have any consequence you know you can you can do it anonymously and this is it's like these Barb's that you can just send out and it illogically like see in in in ways that you would never if you had to deal with someone one-on-one because you would feel it you would look at right and you would feel the response you would be like why are you saying this like like why why are you being such an asshole but because you are anonymous right so people are just like in this unnatural communication thing right but then the part that then worries me after that is if you get used to doing it like that in an anonymous way online does that start to make the behavior a bit more normative when you're even with your identity oh I guarantee it has to it has to there's there's no free rides when it comes to that I really feel like your thoughts your connect like there was always a thing I remember when I was in high school this was someone in my school newspaper wrote like a funny critique about the Boy Scouts and one of the things that he didn't like about the Boy Scouts was that they wanted you to keep your thoughts pure and he was like you know my thoughts are my own thoughts you know I'm just as long as I don't do anything I don't think there's anything wrong with my thoughts right enough that was really smartly argued I remember reading it going well this kids pretty clever but then I thought about I'm like but you if you're thinking about creepy shit you probably are kind of creepy you know and it's it's not gonna get any better just you know you're just gonna eventually one day you gonna snap and then you gonna do something happy thing yeah if you really are like the I don't know I mean everyone has their own definition of thoughts being pure you know like a more lenient person might allow a lot of like healthy sexual things in the idea of thoughts being pure as long as it's not creeping but there's other people that would just sit around well let me just think about creepy shit all day and not do it and I'm fine but I'm not there's no free ride there maybe though you think's I mean well I mean we what you're describing what you're describing is you know the benefits of an absolute police state as long as it was always right you know that's no problem you know that's the problem I mean then you can always get your Minority Report you know just maybe there I'm not really subscribing that I'm just saying that you really could be nice you can't have really shitty thoughts and get through and I think that if you're really shitty online you have those thoughts even if it's only online I really believe that negative energy genuinely shitty I mean it's just how do you decide what's what's what chitti and what's not but ya know it's people when their demeanor you are online without your face the meaning you can be online with your face on the meaning you can get in real life you know until you just got mean people it is already what the fuck son
