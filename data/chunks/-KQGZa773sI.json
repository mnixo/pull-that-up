hello bill great to be here in the man cave this is the professional extension of the man cave this part is a this is where real work gets done this is the only part in the building it's worth it just to see it oh really I thought of and I did not expect this but you know as I was just telling you off the air I invited myself on this show yes I will you requested it I think you're doing we're coming back on the air real times coming back in a few days and we always do something to promote it openness let's do that show you know I like that show oh I can't do the shows I listen to got that Mexico should put that in there it looks like it should be a ring for maybe for a slash a roadie what season you guys coming into oh fuck I don't know seasons it's hard to yeah just couple years we started on HBO in 2003 but then we used to do but the first few years they had us do two seasons they took us took them a while to get the idea that this is not like The Sopranos or any other show this kind of show is a habit show it has to be on most of the year we used to do a season from February to like May and then we'd be off for four months and come back for a few months in the fall that's not the way you can do it when you're following events a live show so finally somewhere in there they just okay so then it was one long season as opposed to two so I guess they counted the early years is too we've been on HBO since 2003 but of course it started you were on the old show politically incorrect somebody sent me a clip of that Wow I couldn't even bear to watch it just from the way we looked it was too sad time is cruel it's actually we look better now just because we look douchier younger of course I mean that's the trade-off and yes at your douchier when you're younger yeah do look more pristine shall we say unless beaten down by time yeah but that started in 93 so I've already passed my we did a 25th anniversary show about a year and a half ago yeah in the fall of 18 it aired I couldn't believe that do you know they're trying to bring back politically incorrect who was pay whoever the fuck they are it came to me rip the heads that's so funny cuz I suggested that a while ago with it not with me hosting it of course but it was somebody else hosting it but I don't have to ask my manager about that I thought we I guess we sold it I think mister when we moved to ABC must be ABC when we move to ABC I think we probably sold them the rights to the show which is was probably stupid but at the time it made sense and well good luck with it I'm not doing it it was one of those questions my manager calls me up and says you're not gonna want to do this but I'm obligated to tell you why wouldn't you want it just doesn't seem like something I wanna do no I'm insulted no I'm just I would never want to take over your show I don't exist and then I've got it stripped away though I'm saying something though the whole thing was like you once someone does a show leave it alone you know right leave it yeah like if you left and they started doing real time with Adam Carolla right you know which is exactly what they will be doing a new fucking show you know right do you feel constrained by the time by the the our format sometimes I was on with Howard Stern recently and I was saying that to him and I feel the same sometimes when I watch or listen to you it's it's funny a mirror I don't get America like people's attention span is either seven seconds or three hours yeah no there's no in-between well there's a lot of us that's what it is this decided April yeah exactly people the shortest attention spry see this is all they have Rizal that's their that's not true but it takes a big risk too three hours I mean there are virtues and vices to both of them I mean I do like being forced to condense and for people I always think of the person watching my show is the person who is interested in current events but doesn't have the time to follow it during the week they've got kids and jobs and lives they are gonna watch me to catch them up and it's my job to obviously entertain them but also to point out what's important what what happened this week that you should know about somewhere in that live hour whether it's in the monologue or in new rules or the editorial I do at the end or in the panel somewhere I want to cover everything I think you should doesn't necessarily mean it's the things that the newspaper or other outlets thought was important what I think is really important that's what I'm going to cover so there is something to be said for condensing it's also a lot to be said for letting it breathe you know I mean letting it breathe I do miss that sometimes I wish I could and very often we're in the middle of a discussion and I have to move on I feel like what way things are going now with streaming like I know HBO has their new streaming service maybe they could just give you an option to let some some of those conversations lengthen out it just seems like some of them you're just getting started and you have to cut them off you're right and again sometimes people just want the headlines very often I'm reading something and it's too long I just think just you should have given me the New York Times starts every article not just tell me what happened yeah don't give me the background and on a rocky road in Afghanistan as Fran Lebowitz one said and just get to the part I care about right movies are too long lots of stuff is too long people need editors but these kind of conversations lend themselves more than most art forms to just letting it happen and yeah it's more natural I mean I like the fact that unlike my early days when you sweat backstage and you'd hear The Tonight Show band playing it's wrong you know Johnny's gonna ask you this and then you're gonna say that neither listen don't fucking beer from this you're getting trouble and this is good I didn't prepare anything yeah you know obviously you didn't prepare anything okay I did you really have no list the question oh no I don't you I like you right I'm sure I'm not gonna run out of things to ask you or talk to you about but that's a talent in itself that you could do that off the top of your head I think you think it's not that much of a talent but trust me a lot of people could not do that I don't know if I would trust myself have you said you have two hours with this guy I I would were I would it was be in the back of my mind like shit what if an hour and 10 minutes in I'm like fuck I can't they go one more thing I can't imagine if you and I were at dinner together for two hours we would run out shits talk about that's probably true so that's this okay it's the same shit followed by dead air why completely dead air listen man I've been a fan of yours for a long time I bought true story and I have you Wow yeah I bought that book way back in the day man I was living in New York it was a great book thank you very underrated book on standby yeah it's a novel yeah no it's a novelization of my early life very accurate though like it's you could feel like you lived the life and you know the names were hilarious of the characters each other no I worked probably harder on that than almost anything I've ever done I would never really yeah I would never write another no but well just to make every sentence every paragraph funny or telling no extra words to me that's the kind of what you did you write that I funny I started it in the early eighties when I was still almost living it and I would get busy and put it aside not to look at it for years and then I did a it's my old life in 1985 in December I went down to as he want in a home ex code to do the memorable TV movie TV movie there does appraise the date ship the memorable TV movie club Med I think we all remember it no we don't Linda Hamilton was the star I think I do remember it I hope you don't I remember Linda Hamilton okay in a movie yes right you now I'm picturing it it was a TV movie and we stayed at the Club Med I was in you know you it was kind of a low-budget thing as far as the people in the cast and crew went because we stayed at the Club Med which was not a Club Med it's not a luxury hotel you know what Club Med's are you you give up your money you pay everything in beads but you don't really need money and the rule is for people who just you're gonna enjoy the outside that's why you're in Mexico so the room is monastic right there's no TV cuz you're out all day you know you're just gonna be in the waves and then you're gonna fuck and go to sleep and whatever so I had a lot of free time because I wasn't in the shot every day but I was in Mexico eventually I got fucking cabin fever down there you know I couldn't wait to get home but as they're a long time and had nothing to do and I wrote a lot of the novel there and put it away again and then I was in a real career slump in the early 90s I had finished with acting mostly I didn't want to do that anymore I'd done a few sitcoms and I didn't want to be the office creep forever and so I was just like nowhere and that's when I finished it and also that's like the year I did cocaine which I probably would not have finished it without that it was only one year it was one year I was never meant to do cocaine when everyone was doing it I never wanted it you know me I'm a pothead like you I I it's not my drug but you know if you really insist you can get in you can get into any drug and I and I just happen to be at this point in my life where I was vulnerable to any I had nothing to do all day I wasn't working so and it helps you write it helps on activity it's a Productivity dry was never a drug that I liked because I wasn't social on it but I could I used to like to have sex on it well most men did not I love that and and right but I didn't want to talk some people are get that guy I don't know is never that guy who did coke and talk a blue streak no but but it helped me you know concentrate and organize and that kind of stuff and you know and then I was probably smoking pot - I was smoking cigarettes it was not a healthy year that was not a healthy year I remember you know you because cocaine which is kids that is the worst drug it really is because you get a little honeymoon period and then that quickly goes away and then you're chasing that high and you know it's not healthy and then you know you're you're trying to at the end of the night take the edge off you know you're into that put the edge got to put the edge back on I took it off too much I'm drinking Jack Daniels damned now I gotta take it off again I put it on too much it's that was I never touched it I got lucky you very smart I would probably really enjoyed it I think I would have really enjoyed it yeah that's probably why did again at the beginning yeah it's very much like a relationship okay good at the beginning you know I think trails off I always say because resentment or is it time and relationships are good spoiler alert it's the beginning for a lot of them for sure now when you put that book out is it still in publication another great question I'm finding so much about my own life here I didn't know because the comics incorrect was being redone comics from my era like guys who grew up in general that when we were just starting now there was a it was huge a lot of guys pass it around a lot of guys yeah hey you gotta get this book ya know I mean and I tried to make it into a movie there was many scripts written I mean it's my own fault for not pushing that through I yes but I thought at the time it would really would have made a a good movie but it's Robbie too late now and well you definitely have to change the names now it's very hard yeah I did in the script it's very yeah it's very hard to depict stand-up comedy in a movie in fact one of the original impetus to write the book was that no one was doing that well I remember that movie came out with Tom Hanks remember that punchline punchline okay and Tom Hanks was good I mean Tom Hanks could could have been a stand-up comic he did it as good as you can passable passable but they just never capture the whole essence of it and also when you're trying to have someone I see this on Mazal know I haven't seen that yet some show oh the one I think it's Jim Carrey show on Showtime about oh I'm dying up here thank you yes and I like the show but whenever you're showing a stand-up comic and you're and it's acting you're acting as a stand-up and then the audience has to laugh yeah there's something about it that isn't it just you can tell it's not real it's like a boxing scene in a movie same thing a little bit yeah yeah rocky right yeah but that's sometimes purposely over-the-top this just comes off as fake because one thing we love about comedy is that laughter is involuntary yeah it's in you can't as any giant comedy star knows you can walk out at a comedy club and you'll get the biggest ovation in the world two minutes later you can be dying because it's involuntary has to thrilled to see you but then if you don't say something funny they can't they're not gonna laugh it's also a very uniquely live thing it's like you have to be right I always say that like if you watch a special on TV you're really you getting 60% of funny you're right you have to be there live you if you're there live you'll get 100% of it so not only that not only you watching it not live right because you've got a recording of it but now it's also a fake recording so it's a guy pretending to be on stage and audience pretending to be an audience and the whole thing yeah disaster yeah so maybe it's a blessing in this guy job of capturing the the marvelous mrs. Mazal does of capturing like the early scene in clubs like of her going up drunked and talking shit and then people telling her like you could probably do comedy like it seems chaotic and real but it it gets a little less realistic as time goes on but you watch that show and yeah yeah I like the first two seasons the third season only I hope they're not losing me here I mean it takes place in the 50s yeah yeah yeah I would watch something like that except it's just too much first was just too much so many thanks to watch yeah I mean I put it on my list but you know I'm gonna get to that and does everything have to be like a season you know does everything have to be so drugged back to our subject everything is either very condensed or way too drawn out and you have to follow it and you're not like an episode of friends well you don't have to know what the fuck happened the week before and you just tune in the Seinfeld it's not dependent upon the week before right it's all everything's an arc and people binge I don't binge I never binge ten ething i I have the opposite problem I have watching a DD I when I I love to watch TV it's the last thing I do before I sleep at night but unless something is absolutely compelling I don't watch more than 15 minutes of it I'll watch 15 minutes of this and then 15 minutes or that and fifty meant something else thing and then go to sleep you know people are structuring their Netflix specials that way because of that people are doing their closing bit first I read that somewhere that yeah you have to we have to grab them yeah that's why every fucking drama is something and then six months earlier yeah you know we have to go back because you have to grab them first and then and it's such a tired trope yeah you know it's like now that we've seen it a hundred times think of something else or just go really crazy and do something linear well it's you know this whole thing that you were saying before we do have a second seven-second attention span or we have three hours I would love to see someone try to make a movie like Steve McQueen's LeMans because if you don't remember that movie old Steven yeah old Steve McQueen there's no kids there was a Steve McQueen before the very talented director oh I didn't know there was a director Steven yes you do who is he was it just Peter he'd direct what you know right he directed he's an african-american he directed 12 years of slave okay are you are you using your magic my body to go war and what else to do he's a big director he said he's a major major guy that Steve McCoy oh there he goes I didn't know he has shame widows yes he just did widows widows 12 yeah okay anyway I remember the old state yes who died of cancer 1980 I believe I remember I'm chasing cures in Mexico right yeah yeah lung cancer I think probably like he probably was a heavy smoker and hmm but yeah he was he was what about him the movie Lamont's is a real slow beginning there's no talking for like the first I don't know how many minutes it's just you know people going about their life on the racetrack like all preparing for things no there's no chat oh you ever try to watch a Hitchcock movie oh yeah same thing yeah I mean it just shows how different the audiences are and how we have developed or undeveloped I don't know if it's that or if it's that there's an expectation that people have a short attention span so that everything is made for that expectation no they do they do yeah I think they I do think they really do I mean the more you I do I I must say as someone who grew up when Alfred Hitchcock was still was he still making yeah he made a movie in 1972 I was 16 I saw it in the theater it was one of his last he was on his last legs but psycho had was 1960 I was too young to for that but he was still very in vogue and a big director and I tried to watch I did watch the one he made in 1956 the year I was born called the man who knew too much I think the story he made three times he liked that story about the innocent guy who's being chased by somebody and he doesn't know why they're chasing him and the police are after him but he's got to find the bad guys before the police find him it's Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day it is I mean they talked about the master of suspense I mean Jesus Christ is like the master of keeping me from falling asleep it's really subtle slow I'm sorry but I think they've improved on that I do maybe that's sacrilege to the movie community and Martin Scorsese he'll write me a letter or something but Jesus Christ I'd much rather watch salt mmm you know there's a thriller that robes or the Jason Bourne those movies I feel like they took what Hitchcock was doing and yes they revved it up and I'm glad they did Hitchcock's hard to get through we also have to realize when Hitchcock was making films they've been only making films for 50 years there's a real even left yeah I mean he started in the late 30s right you know I mean talkies had only been around for like 10 years way back yeah yeah so I mean there's something about that like even when you think about stand-up like if you ever tried listening to Lenny Bruce I certainly have good example yeah I can't do it doesn't work anymore it's contextually we're in a different world but any of those old schoolers yeah that's the point at that funny it's it's in true story where I talk about how those guys who are such icons couldn't make it today because they take too long you could take you could take two minutes before you got to the punchline you could take two minutes to set something up the audience was perfectly okay with that you could never do that to the Jack Benny Bob Hope was more rapid-fire but a lot of these old schoolers you know I mean I have a never funny list and it's been a friend of mine created years ago and some of them are on it you know Danny Thomas I don't know when Skelton I mean there's some people I thought were never Bill Cosby I must say so it was on that list really oh yeah you know I thought he was funny never thought he was funny even when he was doing Bill Cosby himself like back at the album days and I may have missed some stuff he did but everything I ever heard even when I was a kid I saw him on TV I'm like no I feel very very ahead of my time I never liked him well it was one of those things where if you had said any of this that you're saying ten years ago people have been furious at you well now these been exposed somebody told me he was a creep back in 1983 okay someone told me in 94 yeah so it was somebody I liked not somebody I was romantically involved with but a girl who he was horrible to and I never liked him after that as a person that makes sense I had heard from people on the set of news radio that he drugged girls it was like one of those weird things you heard as a room like why does he do yeah he drugged girls like Bill Cosby Brett cause be Bill Cosby we're talking about the same guy not like Steve McQueen Steve McQueen we'll get him confused right no I mean dad America and you have to wonder why a guy who could get laid yeah even as a married man that's obviously a sick kink he had but I also know a guy who was a promoter and and told incredibly ridiculous stories about things that Bill Cosby did that were not sexual but just informed me that what his kink is is part of a much larger sickness about control yeah and making people do weird things as he can let me tell you what I heard you tell me what you heard I heard he makes people watch him eat curry he would make the whole staff come into his dressing room and watch him eat I hadn't heard that exactly but it's exactly in line with what I heard that he would do things like make you what was one of them like he would order food and then he would say you know scoop out the the doughy part of the hamburger bun after you wash your hands and put it back on the hamburger or once he asked them to send him the soap that he hadn't finished using in the dressing room like blended to send it yeah just like crazy crazy shit that again speaks to a pathology that's larger than what we know about him sexually that that fear as a subcategory under that because to need to have the woman be unconscious yeah that's that's a weird thing I can't I can't I can't get into there's certain things I think I can't even imagine why someone would find it attractive most could be with a child no I can't understand why that would be appealing to you I can't understand this you know a lot of things I can't understand I worked at a casino and he made the security guard talk him into bed yep and shut the lights off he had like a whole routine that he wanted them to follow and he wanted them to tuck him into bed yeah well I had a friend who had an interesting take on it and he said there is something that happens to some famous people's particularly famous people who were famous a long time ago where they feel like they are better than other people there is a giant gap between them and other people and they feel like they can do things to people and they what yeah yeah I don't think that's on but his pathology but most people try to hide that well I think that feeling they try to I think he did you know it's called acting yes that's why when they're in front of the camera they're so charming but we know that behind the scenes they're they're not but he seemed to wear it on his sleeve well sort of sometimes right but the other thing that he was doing in publicly she was trying to chastise other comics for using bad words and you know he had a lot of weird control issues with that as well but my friends taking on was that he thinks that there are people that they get to this position where they think that they're owed things and he thought about that sexually - he said he probably felt like he was just so above those women that he didn't even want to negotiate with them it just drugged them and fuck them because he's Bill Cosby and they should be happy you know it's crazy it's no it's not you know the human mind is the bottom of the ocean it's mostly unexplored a giant mystery well especially that kind of scenario I mean how many human beings have ever experienced what he's experienced he's been famous since the 1950s right he was an American icon right is rich beyond measure groundbreaker and a legitimate world-class stand-up comic who toured the whole world created yes Cosby show that was a groundbreaking television oh yeah so many factors so many factors and then on top of that a psychotic pervert and a creep and drugging women I mean on top and who knows what else other fucking shit you're probably not just that no you know when someone's that fucked up it's probably not just they might find like 30 dead cats in his backyard I mean who knows the fucking guys in - well I somebody told me it just may not be true that he was drugging people with animal tranquilizers nuts he had a vet's license or something that's how way that's how he was because people were like how did he get the stuff that he was using for the knockout pills would this would it offend you if I put my finger not at all why would it is a man that's a man maybe if I don't ask you you're relaxed you're feel good I put my feet oh great you got some loafers on purpose those are your choice you wore those today I didn't even think about it see that's why I'm saying I love my sweat I did this because I don't have to think about pulling my wardrobe but what I'm gonna wear and yeah is Johnny gonna like me oh boy did you the night show with Johnny thirty times holy shit 1982 to 1992 wow yeah thirty times yes which just shows you that show was went out when I started to do it there was such a proliferation of comics that you could do that show thirty times and that didn't make me famous I mean it elevated me to a degree of legitimizing you in show business but that at one point just doing the Tonight Show once made you a star but part of what true story is about was the comics frustration that they came along at a time when it wasn't that unique a thing anymore hmm there was too many comics you couldn't swing a dead cat without hitting a comic well no I I have like in my Sirius XM radio in the car the comic stations and I love them I would listen and very often seed somebody's name I've never heard of this comic I'll never see it again they're doing you know they play four or five minutes of their routine it's very professional it's funny I'm laughing and who is this person just just and seemed like an innumerable supply of very competent stand-ups who have funny bits about the ketchup bottle and I don't know any of them and I guess they have followings and mmm no you obviously you go to clubs though Club fuck no I'm Nessen table sits like a you go back to high school no I go to the high school every day you do yeah we're so does Leno and lots of belt Chris Rock I don't get it I don't know why you want that first of all cuz my friends are there I like going there and talking to the other comics that are there all the time Wow and I like to do it because it keeps me sharp I do that line up at the store there's 13 other comics and the but I worked alone I yeah but I'm saying but that's my how I keep sharp is a or a sharp as I can be is well also I gave up on memorization years ago first of all with all the pot I've smoked it just wasn't gonna happen I've used what I call the poor man's teleprompter for it's got to be twenty years which is I'm a music stand on stage and then I have my notebook which has my bullet points and I don't think the audience even notices it after yeah it's very every five minutes I'm very discreetly moving the page and but that way I don't have to memorize anything when I get home from the gig I go through it I redo it in the computer print it out and it's it's it's just been the greatest thing because I can say I can get to exactly what I want to say I hate comics who stand up there and go what else what else like fuck that you should know what else you never hear me say what else to it I know what else and I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna try to condense it I'm gonna give you the best show I can for 90 minutes and then leave you certainly can do it that way yeah we all have our own yeah everybody's got their own way doing it yeah we are i I like to be around a lot of other comics like a large number of very good comics all the time I think if you feed off each other like I'm on the road all the time when I'm on the road I'm with my friends I you know I go and tour with other very funny comics yeah but when I'm in town I just like to be around as many as I can you should do my Hawaii gig one year you know I have a study by rantin Natasha and well she did it last year yeah I ran into them and Maui I was like what I was doing yeah you were there yes I was there with my family we were just vacationing next year's the 10th was like it was like New Year's right yes yeah I started this 10 years ago nobody would booked it they all said Hawaii's a dead market and I found this promoter who was okay I'll try it and it worked of course Honolulu's a big city there are a million people there yes and Maui so we do Maui on December 30th and we do Year's Eve in Honolulu and it's always surprises and this year sarah silverman did it and Bobby Slayton and we have some sometimes some very well-known musicians who join us Woody Harrelson is also in Maui and plays with this a little bit it just even says in Maui - yes I saw him there one year but maybe you'd consider slumming and it's a great fun trip and you're with comics and I've never performed in Hawaii every time I go there's just a chill well I'm gonna hit you up on that okay I stopped doing New Year's Eve shows on my own that's the great thing about it I always hated New Year's Eve what a shit day and the shows at 8 o'clock so ok we it's just a show it's a regular show right directly right right now exactly it's a regular show 8 to 10 or maybe a little after 10:00 we always the Hulk group sings smile at the end of it I made that a tradition the old Charlie Chaplin smile though your heart is aching you know that one's sure you'll have to learn it and ease us what a weird gig and well it's New Years Eve you got to do something as you send them off it's only an hour and a half left in the new year in the old year and I feel like that was the propria Tenaya comedian Charlie Chaplin it's a hundred years old it was a hit in the 50s for Nat King Cole Michael Jackson redid it in the 90s when he was on trial for child molestation chose to do a song by Charlie Chaplin the most famous job molester that was Michael's way of the chapel was a child molester well Charlie Chaplin but I think back then they didn't call it that but yes he married no anything yes he married like it was like Jerry Lee Lewis he was like with 14 year olds really Charlie Chaplin yes I'm don't think I'm talking out of school about Charlie Chaplin can you conjure standing up there on your magic lightbox Jamie and see if that what do we didn't know that's child molester yes Charlie Chaplin famous for it for that and you know back then I don't think they got you for it but what they did what was the legal age back then possibly none I don't know if they even had such a concept I mean we're talking about an era before and they weren't letting women vote right teens they didn't women didn't vote till 1920 I don't know if there were child labor laws I just don't know well Priscilla Presley wasn't she like 14 when erect yeah and that was Elvis was a child molester - and that was the 50s right right and that well he went into the Army in 58 so that's when he met her in Germany her father was a colonel and she was 14 and of course he was 25 and a giant rock star and he says to the colonel would you mind if I took your fortune year old daughter back to America she can live with me at Graceland and it'd all be good and the guy says enjoy what the fuck was wrong with people back those are different human beings said years ago no no we're we're we're so different just yeah just are I mean I'm a little older than Oh 16 year old Harris met actor Charlie Chaplin 16 is not that's not even I don't think the worst was the famous one doesn't mean is there like you know Chaplin the MER vert or child monster yes there definitely is but yes died young back then I thinking recently people were just rougher yeah you know I mean you and I I think walk the same path very often talking about we I think are progressives but we have short patience with some of the fragile yes well bullshit yeah okay and some of that is just the way you're brought up I think kids are coddled you know I think they're indulged and that's the reason why they freak out over microaggressions and stuff and some of that is just I was telling some in this story not a mutt apropos of this just talking about something else but it just reminded me that here I'm a kid who had I think a normal middle-class upbringing I consider it an idyllic time I consider it an innocence you couldn't buy today I mean first of all I grew up in New Jersey in the 60s there was no racial issues because there was only one race in town that's just the way it was I'm not saying that's good it wasn't but that's so there weren't racial issues there weren't drug issues and an I didn't try pot in high school may or may be there was a rumor that a few kids were doing it but that wasn't even a thing there wasn't even any like divorce it was really the land that time forgot you know it was Leave It to Beaver land and I was telling someone this time my father who grew up in the depression sheep I you know loved him dearly but I don't think that's the wrong word and sent us to an army friend of his as the dentist and this is 1964 I was eight and did not use novocaine and I remember vividly like he I had like eight cavities that had to be filled he said if it hurts raise your hand you know has to drill what it's okay so they're drilling into me and then I'm riding home up this big hill it was cold on my bike with the tears freezing on my cheek so get to the dentist yourself first of all they wouldn't do that today they don't like kids just be on their own like get your ass to the dentist on your bike get home after they drill into you with no novocaine and I'm saying I wasn't raised by bad people yeah people were just rougher yeah it was just a rougher time and I I wouldn't recommend these things exactly necessarily although getting someplace on your own I don't think it's the worst thing in the world but a little more of that have you ever had Jonathan hate on your show yeah the coddling of the immediate line is exactly about that and he believes that you should let your kids roam around and let them find their way home and there is a movement for that yeah that's how I was raised I was raised to come home from from school fly into the house change into my play clothes fly out the door my mother never said where are you going what are you doing and you know we're gone yeah and again and Leave It to Beaver town there was a six o'clock whistle really yeah at the firehouse the whistle went off time for dinner and then you right and then you got your ass home when you heard the whistle we didn't have watches or followed sir you know I don't want I mean I don't want to compare it's a it's a different world for sure between the way we grew up in the way they're growing up today I don't know what's better I don't know which one's better there's certainly a lot of babies today yeah but there's also a thing today where we're we're giving them access to information way quicker so there's got to be and this is this is not something that's been studied right like what happens to a young mind when it has access to almost anything as soon as you get a phone you're given 12 year olds 13 year olds phones and then they have access to everything in the world everything porn porn instantly which I you know you're talking into a libertine but I do not think porn is benign I do not it is not benign not not the way it is now on the computer I mean it's it's rapey it's [Music] it's sites are you going to any any site I'm not getting the rav4 but I think well it's a nine please it's not it's not it's domineering yes it's a lot of things that I am not interested in even in my fantasies I was doing a bit about that in my last special like even in my fantasies I don't want to choke anybody yeah I I don't want to come on your face I mean come on coming on your face that that's not rapey or domineering or I mean I find that off-putting and gross it doesn't that doesn't move me and the thing I don't get it but that's half of what pornhub is well I think what half of it is now is a lot of stepsister stuff as like stepfathers stepsisters about because people are trying to be naughty and there's nothing naughty left because like the idea horn originally was like I can't believe these people are having sex like go back and watch porn from the 80s so they're just having sex as fucking choking come on you're in a spitting yeah it's gross and it's it and so I'm not surprised that kids have mental problems fuck yes I mean what what's the first date or first real date like when you saw you know a team of Japanese businessmen come on some schoolgirls face when you were dead well you saw that one the bus it was a flight attendant yeah the there was a squid yeah oh there's always squids there in the octopuses shit yes yeah it's it's not necessarily benign but neither's alcohol neither's game but I mean if I was a parent yeah yes away from the kid there's also an issue that you don't tell kids about it so they don't they find out from other kids there's no discussion of what it is there's no like real no one in the right mind would ever sit down and watch porn with their son and say this is what I want you to avoid like this is why I want you to avoid that right but it's probably not the worst idea I mean look there comes a legality issue like I mean I don't even think it's legal to watch porn with a 13 year old kid but if you if you have a son and he's 13 and you know he's gonna be exposed to these things you almost have a responsibility to talk them through it and just give him some to do some understanding of what it what is the landscape here's a big one why these girls doing this okay here's something that people don't like to admit that enjoy porn the vast majority of them have been molested the vast majority of who is porn our porn actors porns that true yeah yeah yeah there was some study they did on girls who get into porn who have been sexually abused mentally abused and physically abused it was overwhelming it was overwhelming I mean obviously it's just anecdotal it's based on one group of people that they I don't know it's not just studies that's not not surprising at all no so that they're searching for acceptance and they're they're willing to do something that's way outside the norm I'm sure there's just some girls are just really promiscuous they're intersex there's nothing wrong with them they just rub it and they love performing right I think there's less of them than there are of the girls who were probably abused and you know maybe they turn a negative into a positive I'm not saying I shouldn't do it I'm not casting any judgment but I am saying that you should understand what this thing is like what this why how come some people like to fuck on camera never everybody else is afraid to you know that you're gonna see their genitals I don't know about the watching rapport with your son Joe but ya suggested either I'm saying I'm kidding but what I would tell a kid especially a boy is son what you're seeing and porn don't think that women really like that because they don't they don't want to have somebody come on their face someone must we saw of course someone likes anything that's one of the bad things about the Internet is that you could in the old days if you were some sort of weirdo pervert you thought and it was the world was better because you thought that you were completely alone in the world now whatever your kink is you could put it on the internet you could write you know I want a hooker to shit on me while I play with electric trains and it'll caddy around the house of people in two minutes or saying me too yeah and that I don't have that value of a community yeah of electric train shit around code chamber yes enjoying shitting on you right chains so that's all unhappy but but I just don't think that I mean that would be my main lesson to it to adolescent boy okay we can't keep the porn away from you just don't think that's real the way real women are or what real women like I don't think they like tinder either in fact I watched some documentary I can remember what it was called I think it was on HBO about dating on social media and that was the main theme of it was women are doing it young women but they don't like it and it's not surprising they don't like it guys are of course wired very differently and they just want to hook up and move on I read also an article about it and the I think it was in Vanity Fair and the the woman says okay she did it once she tried tender she goes to a hotel or meets a guy she had just met over the phone and they fuck and then she said as I was getting dressed I turned around and he was sitting on the bed looking at tender Wow you know so he had just come and here he is looking for the next fix victim and victim this is the feeling participant yes how dare you I'm not open right she's the next he's a writer she was a willing predator how dare you that's so exciting he's out there hunting just try to get the ladies yeah but women it's not designed for women Sensibility no I'm not most women oh they had remember Ashley Madison yes the cheating site mm-hmm and it was like 12,000 women and 126 million men raise e number like that and most the webinar that were sake - there's a lot of them that were fake they'd like fake account it's yeah that was hilarious when yeah but when you have a dating site set up just for people that want to cheat and then they all get busted because someone hacks into it like do you find Ami's use your real name like Jesus Christ I mean just never read that book sapiens yes such a great book and he goes into the fact that monogamy probably nuts what what is wired in us it's the reason why there's so much misery about relationships is it probably wasn't that way in early man and I'm saying early men like human Homo sapiens which haven't been on earth that long there's no primates that are monogamous they've never found right and we are primates right and we probably had a system system it's just how we were that was closer to the chimps and where it was like communal fathered him you know you didn't really know whose kid it was so there wasn't this possessiveness because you know I guess the women fucked different men in the grouping and there wasn't that feeling of I own you right and this pussy's mine and all that bullshit's exit Don no it's basically about that my friend dr. Chris Ryan wrote it okay interesting that's it's basically about that it's about how people behave the polyamorous relationships they had in these right primitive cultures and that before DNA testing and before they understood paternity that's really what it was all about about the community would raise children everybody would rate and they would there was a lot of like shared sex in between different people so much so much of love is I think possessiveness what people think is love it's not love mmm you know and and also you make me feel good is not love either to me and they always say love is the thing that has never been able to be defined I don't think it's that hard it's it's selflessness it's when I care for your happiness more than my own that's love in any kind of relationship man or woman well at least as much as my own yeah right yeah and if if you being without me would actually make you happier then I'm for that that's love that's not that would not characterize most of my early relationships how I felt and what I thought what love was well it's interesting when we look at other animals right because you blown aagree nuts not love and other animals monogamy isn't a choice like the animals that are monogamous the monogamous they don't have any desire like it's naturally built and wired into their system it's only they choose like swans so there's a bunch of um penguins for instance penguins yeah there's a favorite Sergei we know that they all look the same they might as well be gay there aren't they're gay it wasn't there a big thing about gay penguins well there was a story I feel like about gay penguins or really you know there's something because I feel like the usual suspects on the right yeah look up Charlie Chaplin's gay fucking fucking smile is something they were there maybe it was a story something that made the Evangelic o--'s mad about paying me yeah but sanguine so I think it's Tanglin maybe it's they were in my point would be that any of these animals that are doing this they're not doing this because they have a choice they understand what it is aw new york times gotcha gay penguins and their hope for a baby have enchanted berlin two male penguins at the zoo berlin after there that's it that's what it is two male penguins adopted an egg blurps delighting germans but upsetting pat robertson big time i was he bummed out about that yes somebody's like that was or all of them more I'm sure the Family Council those types you think they want to have the example of penguins being gay I wanted it with that leave into a fuck or if it's just a hustle at this point do you think they really give a fuck about these penguins being gay I think they have to say something because it's some new thing to talk about and it gives them fuel for outrage yeah a juicy story in the news they could jump on yeah I mean Pat Robertson is it he's still on TV right he said yeah he's if he needs material like you and I do yes or something yeah yeah yeah you never know with these people gay penguins that's where that's where you draw the line all right Syd that's enough they're dare agenda has moved over to the Penguins such a strange time so this strange time we're like we're I feel like if you read steven pinker stuff he talks about how this life has never really been easier than we have it today right but it's also probably one of the reasons why people are so outraged about things today is this there's it's so there's less real shit that's dangerous in this world there's less there's still is real dangerous seals real murder and real rape and real robberies but there's less of it than ever before but yeah there's more outrage than ever before about nonsense things well when societies get too successful and you could make that claim about America that's when they become a feat and that's when they become soft yes and that's when they fall this is a story that goes back to ancient Rome and other societies you you're you're a victim of your success in a large way we're we're that because yes people don't we were just talking about how people were rougher yeah no novocaine you know that wasn't even the roughest thing we don't know hardship except for that sliver of the country that fights the wars mm-hmm those people know hardship of course we do have poverty in America but there's also a fairly substantial safety net that this country has I mean no Paris in other parts of the world but you know there's parts of the world that are real with crime and gangs yeah those people deal with real hardship Oh real hardship these are the people from central of the Central American countries that they always are freaking out about the Trump administration because yes when gangs ruled the country in El Salvador and Honduras those places life is precarious and easy to lose now but I know Steven Pinker's point you know which is a great point is like let's not forget that in the last 20-30 years the amount of people we've risen out of extreme poverty the people who used to live on a dollar a day it wasn't that long ago when I read this that a billion people defecate in the street you know that's where they poop that's all improved greatly now part of the reason why Trump people are upset about jobs and stuff and going overseas well that's part of the reason why is because we lifted out of extreme poverty people all over the world but they took those manufacturing jobs that's why they're not living in extreme poverty and why they're not pooping in the street because they're making Trump ties as opposed to somebody in Ohio so pick your poison yeah I mean this is like what we're talking about with us growing up that life was rougher the life is easier today and but you have more access to information so maybe it could be better and then things seem to be moving in a better direction in terms of things being safer less violence less crime less rape and then people also get upset at you bring up those statistics that's where it's really interesting that Pinker gets attacked for just stating statistical facts just say and he's not making value judgments he's just saying hey things are if you look at the overall numbers of things this is the safest time to be alive ever it's many people know but what about this what about that like it's a horrible hallmark of our era that we live in that facts almost always come second yes your political agenda comes first yeah and if it doesn't fit in then we don't want to hear those facts and that's the left and the right it is the left and the right it's both and it's it's it should be it should be something that everybody rejects it should be something that angers everyone it shouldn't be tied to one party or another party and it really should be something that if there's a there's a real problem with communication in this society one of them is the denial of actual facts and information if we if we know things we have rock-solid threats it's whether it's about climate change whether it's about war the budget whatever the fuck if you have a real number yes and you want to spin and deny and like that that's a giant problem it's a giant problem right I get madder at the left because I want them to be better and they should be better and they're they they're the science party and they're supposedly the fact people I expect this shit from the right right denying climate change and so forth they've been doing that for a long time the left has it's dirty thing if you disagree with them in any way you become an all right person like right I mean it's obviously a small sliver or race doing this yeah boy I got stucked in this all right category I'm like you guys are out of your fucking right exactly voted right in my life right I know but there's a there's a I feel like I'm sure as you do sometimes a man without a country ass yeah and there's a group of a Sam Harris yeah see people you've had on yeah Jordan Peterson Barry Weiss yeah you know I just we're all progressives yeah but sensible progressive real addresses real progressives were not blindly not be liable to our party right and we don't chase these virtues signalers yeah who are always as a friend of mine said they wake up offended yeah yeah and I I'm always reading a story like daily I read something and what goes through my mind is this country now is completely binary there's only two camps we're totally tribal you read the red or blue liberal or conservative and everything that one side does that anybody does that represents that side has to be owned by that entire side because people go you well you're the party of so whenever there's something on the left that's cuckoo crazy we all own it yeah and that's one reason why Trump won sure because people you go through the polling his fans are not oblivious to his myriad flaws what they love about him what they all say they love is he wasn't politically correct it's it's hard to measure how much people have been choking that political correctness they do not want to walk on eggshells yeah they do want do not want to think that one little misstep and they'll get fired or be castigated and these are not just famous people I mean these are the regular people and I think when someone reads the kind of stories you see every day and it's an eye roll and it's a I roll at the left that's when you lose people a giving example is about two weeks ago the Giants my football team the New York Football Giants cut took his name is Jim Norris Jenkins and our word yes we have to say the r-word no you could say retarded okay well look we're just we're not saying it I don't know what the fucking rules are yes and he okay first of all I don't understand why that generation feels the need to engage with their fans on Twitter but he was and some God needs to teach him social media some guy was criticizing him and he's a good cornerback or safety and whatever he is and the was criticizing him and he answered back yeah again I don't know why but saying here are my stats I'm pretty good I only can do my job right I'm not retard mr. Iran must be nice part of the story I'm gonna explain so then the guy the fan says well why does it matter the team is losing and that's when jinora jenkins said I can only do my job retard and cut like cut from the team cut like the next day and first of all I think he said it's something I thought it was a hood thing you know maybe jinora Jenkins didn't get the memo because he's not you know like on Twitter 24/7 and living with the woke stirs that we don't do this anymore I think they offered him a chance to apologize he said I think he did did he I think he did did after they caught him but yeah I don't think he likes to insist on saying that's were you know there seems like there's no room anymore for someone just to go sorry I didn't realize this was such a thing because you know they do move the goalposts we're often and they like to because it's easier to catch people that way so how about just oh sorry I guess you know we don't do this anymore my bed and move on with our lives instead of no you're canceled your cut you are irredeemable yeah it's hot ridiculous it's ridiculous and what I'm saying is like every day there's some story like that and it just all goes into the bin left-wing yeah and that's when people go you know what Trump's an asshole I don't like him but I don't want to live in that world these people are even fucking crazier yeah and that is the great danger of reelecting him and that very well may do it yeah it very well may yeah the this overcorrection and overreaction and things like that a fury AIT's people and they love it when Trump says crazy shit because it sounds like something that they would say he's trolling like he had that one speech was talking about China this is the way you talk to China say listen motherfuckers yeah yeah that alone like I even laughed and clapped I was like that's fucking hilarious because that is what you would hope some crazy version of a president would say that would never really exist but all the sudden he exists he sometimes he says something that I totally do not want a president to say but if he wasn't president like for example when he was confronted may have been by Bill O'Reilly when he was still extent about Putin killing journalists or something and Trump said something like well we're not so innocent either yeah now I don't think the President of the United States should say that but you know well says that Noam Chomsky yeah that's like something Noam Chomsky says America's guilty of also being doing these horrible things we're not innocent either yeah he would be a little bit more articulate about it but yeah right yeah but the point is that no one judges anymore by the content of what they say it's just by whose team are you on yes so if you liked it when norm Noam Chomsky said it you shouldn't hate it that much when Trump said or vice-versa if you hated it the nun chump you said it then you should hate it the Trump said it but that's not how people react well the team thing is so prevalent that even when he does something militarily like backs out of a country you see people on the Left criticizing him for not not going in or not not engaging like Jesus Christ you guys are supposed to be the people that always don't want to war and when someone who's the president does something that's not a move towards war we should all be saying yes please more of this he's got a good thing here's a good thing it's not like we want to categorize people as being like you said one or zero binary irritable like either chosen or irredeemably careful with how you talk or you get labeled in in one or two of those categories and people are so scared now communicate it's I had a conversation with a friend a while back and he we're crazy conversation it was alcohol involved but he said something really ridiculous he was saying that maybe it's good that women get so much money in divorce because of all the shit they've been through for men over the years and I was home buddy I'm like with that what does it have to do with money and divorce like if that's an individual person that's getting money from another individual person is she getting is she collecting is this like reparations for all the horrible things that have happened for women and he goes well indeed so he starts getting defensive he goes well what about income inequality the women have to deal with I go oh Jesus I go well you know that's not real right and he goes what do you mean I go it's not like there have the same jobs it's not like both women the man and a woman are both male men they both do the same amount of houses but the man makes a dollar when the woman makes 70 cents that's exactly what it is I go the fuck it is not what it is illegal is it is it legal already passed I explained right everybody walked on eggshells everybody's right oh geez what are you saying right you're saying income inequality is not real right no it's not not that it's not real there's so many of those mic drop yeah raises that yes you know kids and cages which of course we don't want kids in cages but there's a whole discussion to be had about immigration yeah as opposed to just kids in cage or Islamophobia of course that is a real thing exists but there's a whole other discussion but just these look the left often uninformed yeah they just are but they have these bullet points that they feel like they definitely can shut a conversation down that's what I mean they don't feel like they have to learn a lot about a subject yeah because you have these mic drop sayings or phrases that just stop people from talking well I'd fortunately known the actual statistics and so when we were talking about I was saying no no take choose different jobs and also they negotiate for themselves differently yes they need to negotiate for themselves better well that's one of the things when people accuse Jordan Peterson to be in sucks it's you know Jordan Peterson literally counseled and coached women how to be more assertive when their jobs to get better raises sure it was really explaining how to do this and and and just even maybe possibly against your better instincts to exert yourself and show that you understand your value and this is what men do and this is why men get raises and oftentimes women just kind of keep it to themselves and they're a little nervous about it but it is amazing I mean you mentioned divorce yeah they don't assert as well going for a raise but oh the divorce thing think I mean as I can go both ways if the woman is the one who has more money yeah but when the fuck does that ever happen that's like women who beat up men women even beat men up to like when I hear that oh my god I'd go to the gym yes you should go to the gym man it's like these fights men's rights assholes are like there's so much to make fun of men's rights guys but well I had one of them on my one of my comedy specials I had a bit about it where they were saying you know that men get raped more often than women I go yeah by other men you fucking idiot exactly chicks are out there rape and dudes what do you think others are and there were stops abuse Tina Hoff Sommers yes okay I love ya yeah I love her so she was on our show recently and you know we were talking about the fact that also they don't bring up a lot of the time that most of the horrible dirty jobs in the world yes are done by men yeah they're the ones who are up the telephone pole most likely dying the job most likely to be murdered and most likely to go to jail yeah most likely to get a much longer jail sentence yeah for the same crime so we're not crying about being men we're just saying as she says life is a complex yes mixture of advantages and disadvantages yeah I think the pendulum swinging the other way though I think really dumb statements like fuck all white men like we used to hear on Twitter and people who still like applaud and retweet it I think people are now like oh fuck well that's a little out there but I have heard when now it's going in the other direction because the race is winnowing but at the point of say six months a year ago when lots of people were getting into the race at some point there were 24 Democrats in there and when a white guy would get in it was very common to hear do we need another white guy yeah and that was completely okay yeah on the left and it's like okay but then we are saying that we are using race yes to judge whether someone is qualified well right yeah exactly we are using race and gender to say whether someone is qualified just so we understand what we're doing here because I don't think that's exactly what Martin Luther King meant when he said judge by the content of their character and not the color of their skin which seems to elude the promised form of identity politics and it's really ridiculously dumb when they don't realize that that same sort of strategy is gonna come right back around at you it's like people to think the other guy's pissing me off I'm gonna go fucking punch him well guess what he's gonna punch you back like this is this is not it's not that simple when you if you go around judging people based on their gender and their their color and their race guess what they're gonna do that to you now like this is it's it's a terrible strategy I want an ID I want to know how the divorce laws came to be I do I want to know somebody must have written a book on it I just want to know how we got to this place where you know first of all this idea that you have to live in the style of which you've become accustomed I can help you here again great a couple couple ways here's the big one lawyers make a lot of money if there's a large settlement so it's lawyer yes lawyers don't make a lot of money if there's no settlement you know Phil Hartman when he was getting divorced one of the things that he said to me I go do just fucking give her half come on man you make a lot of money goes it's not half he was crazed he's like it's two-thirds he was the fucking lawyers get a third it's goddamn family and I've had friends that have gotten divorced and even though they were they had come to an agreement with the axe like let's listen well this this and you'll get this and I'll get this fine then the lawyers jump in he's trying to fuck you and the snow they're trying to fuck you over ya deserve marks exactly the plot of the movie marriage WC marriage it's terrific I was again it at the beginning because it was about an actress and a theater director and I'm like Jesus fuckin Christ can't you at least pretend that there are people in America not outside of your exact circle they've been so many big movies you know that are just about your world of show business have a little creativity make them something else but okay I got over that and then it's just a terrific movie about there's no bells and whistles it's just we're married we seem very happy and then well we're not happy and we're gonna get divorced and then we're gonna let's just do it amicably and not getting lawyers involved and then it all falls apart and once it goes down that path that you're talking about it just becomes as vicious as anything yeah without guns well I had a friend who got divorced and no nope family okay no children didn't have children and it dragged on for more than I think almost three years and even though they had come to some kind of sort of conclusion he was paying for his wife's lawyer I go like you're paying for the general of the army that's trying to kill you you're paying for someone to fuck you in the ass yeah you're getting fucked in the ass bro it's my feeling I have seen so many men broken by I stated every time somebody says you know they people unfortunately get a horrible disease like cancer and say I couldn't have gotten through it without my wife I always think yeah and maybe she gave it to you I don't mean of course literally but I just mean that when you're in a bad relationship the stress yeah we don't know what contributes all the things to cancer but that certainly is I'm sure one of them and then going through a divorce like that I've seen people like like you say just broken they get wrecked and it's a system the reason why the divorce laws are set up the way they're set up people think oh we're protecting women horseshit they're doing it so that they can extract the maximum amount of money out of the male that way the lawyer gets the biggest chunk that they could possibly get most lawyers have a working on the percentage basis right especially if a woman doesn't have as much money or if she's you know the loyal come to our look we've got a deal here we'll we'll figure this out don't pay me now we're gonna make sure we get you the most we'll we'll take care of it all in the end and this is what has happened to several of my friends that have been divorced and you know what it is once you see it what I get and I understand and I accept and I support is child support I mean I've I grew up with a deadbeat dad my dad never paid for shit and I have many friends that have also experienced a lot of financial hardship growing up because their dad was a piece of shit and didn't want to pay for the children the people very close to me including my wife but when there's a big difference between that a man taking responsibility for his children it's a big demonstrating that and alimony alimony is creepy there's something creepy about like my friend like I said didn't even have a child with this woman he is still paying her by the way this is the same guy a very good friend of mine has been divorced for 14 years has been married for 12 - a new woman still paying the old woman and my joke was like you fucked us so hard she can't work right like she literally can't work because he's a wealthy man he made good money and he works really hard he's a he's not in the business he's a you know he has a real job and he works you know long fucking hours every day and he has his own business and he has to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to someone he doesn't even talk to anymore i scooted a fucker guy I knew of a guy was a doctor who what did gel every night because he couldn't make the payments Oh God and they would like let him out on weekends to do rounds and stuff but he was it's I got a better one for you why get in great yeah yeah Dave Foley who's on Newsradio sure when he was getting divorced was when he was on Newsradio so it was a financial peak you know he was the star of the show he's making a lot of money right and so his pain I get to that we're set up for that sure so this is in Canada right he the judge tells him he tells the judge I don't make that kind of money anymore that was an extraordinary time in my life it's very hard to make that kind of money you know I'm an actor I just the doctors the judge rather says your ability to pay has no relation to your obligation to pay Wow think of that just pause here for a moment what a statement you're and where else would we say that it's insane and we're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars hundreds of thousands like as if he's supposed to conjure this up like his career Capote was supposed to magically resurrect itself in some really financial entity is usually the man still who probably has the more money and is paying the woman yes it's very anachronistic to how we have come to think about women as equal and strong and able to do everything we can do but when it comes to this it's like we got to take care of them suddenly it's like they're very dependent I think it's a scam that's setup because the men in general are in control the finance or make more money and they can extract more money from zillow turning it down yeah I mean that's that's why the system I think is set up the way it's set up it's it's dark man I mean the only time it's happened the other way that I know of is Tom Arnold Thomas oh sure yes it does it does happen this one he's gone for the males right we got one on the board there's like if the board was like here if it was it would be a fucking billion scratches on one side and four lines and the one through it and then next to it it's like Tom Arnold Tori I never a couple of the dudes never understood the concept of marriage because when people would say why don't you want to get married I'd say why would I invite the federal and state government into my loveless very important well you have to have it otherwise it's not real if you don't get it a signed piece of paper what the fuck do you have just your feelings for that other not good enough how should I tell her friends she's got to tell her friends and he really can't been brainwashed but he really can't see she's trained you to say the right answer well I think that's how crazy crazy backward way to look at it that without the piece of paper it's not real it's not real whatever you have would this summon emotionally that's what's real the paper is what's fake you shouldn't be worried about divorce because we're never getting divorced I'm not worried about you fuck you're doing like why why you're getting so upset about this bill just sign the paper okay get married we're gonna be together forever I don't know what you're worried about Jesus Christ I'm freaking out but don't you love me you're freaking out about divorce we're not getting divorced we love each other God sign it the darkness clouds roll over haha but also like humans change it's like we said it's so funny when you you could say about anything else well I'm not married to it you know do you want that thing there I'm not married to it but with a human the thing that's most malleable were like yep I'm gonna marry well the but you know but for some people it works fantastic I think it's some kind term limits they actually have a marriage terms like I don't think that's a real thing I think it is really good yeah google it some countries have like a turn we did this before right yeah it's real some countries have like you could get married for like selling oh I see and then you have in here yeah and you could decide the end of it we're good let's get out of here right yeah well that's putting a level of logic into it that's probably not gonna really obtain when the moment comes because that time you're so codependent girls are not gonna tolerate the other gonna let me ask you this how long you been with Phil and he wants a fucking term limit right my god you guys are gonna be together forever what are you doing get the fucking term limit cuz I'm right if you stuck with Dave I bet Dave what now right he's not like that little boring maybe sounds funny but there's a fucking I need to sign a contract you be fine girl it's fine it's like when agents are competing to sign you and they're like you didn't read for that oh I could there's a financial incentive with anything things get squirrelly know what I'm saying yeah but it also you know I remember you it's funny you mentioned Tom Arnold I had him on the very first episode of politically incorrect I think with Roseanne and they were talking about marriage and he said the great thing about marriage is when you have a big fight and somebody says I'm leaving you can go you can't we're married and I got what he was saying some people like that that you have this yeah this self-imposed barrier that makes more difficult it's like a waiting period with guns you know or when they make you look at the sonogram when you want an abortion in some states look at your fucking baby on a computer screen there and tell them come back tomorrow and tell me you want to kill that kid you know you have a waiting period you have to cool off you can't just leave whereas if you're not married you can right unless you live together that's more complicated or kids and more complicated but yeah and the other one we got on the board is Kevin Federline we got him - what do you mean on the right Britney baby daddy yep he's a Ferrari right now absolutely absolutely plus you got the fuck Britney Spears which is a double fist pump is that a good thing oh yeah he hasn't said one thing the whole time we've been here for 16 hours she has not said one word and that was the one thing that made a sound come out of James she's got two things in the majority she's hot and she's crazy she's probably fantastic in bed Britney but still hot there was a photo of her recently on Instagram she still looks hot as fuck I said yeah she was in a bikini I think she fell apart might be I've never seen her in real life you don't know until you see him right right I mean I I didn't yeah I guess I haven't that's right right now I have been that's your right now yep well that's a life no makeup no filter no fur that's a lot of look at that picture right there that's a lot of that one looks crazy well I do not fine oh she's called his fuck with that that one right there that weird thing is so great left no no the right one in the middle I do not listen if two o'clock in the morning and you're both drunk that's what you want I'm never drunk anymore and now I go to bed at midnight which is quite and my dad's here with me because he has to be wherever I go I see that country yes that well she's like 36 years old now into do you think she's telling that well she does that there's a whole free Britney movement from people who can nothing better to do at their time and there's no more issues of all the issues in the country that you couldn't adopt as something to take to care about but people are saying because yes she still is under that order that her father has to run her life because remember when she went and she went crazy yeah yeah I think she always crazy she just expressed it in a way that made people concerned and also I think she's a sweet southern girl who showbusiness will make you crazy would that mean they shed the paparazzi chased her like they chased Lady Diana she couldn't leave her house yeah and yeah that level of Fame yes it is we saw Elvis go through or Michael Jackson go through or any-any like right do they get you get to that super pop star level yep no one can handle it no and and it's it yes there is a point where it's Fame I think we know is terrific mostly unless it gets to that point right I mean when it the people trying to help you when your other people they're just looking at like you know salespeople and people and airline counters and people just look at you like what the fuck do you want oh I don't know and just for you to do your job but if they recognize you then suddenly you get a smile I always say being famous is like living in a small southern town hello how you doing it's so good to see you you know they're just people just friendly in a way that they sure aren't any more in big cities well you know where they're still friendly like that Dallas Texas oh yes the Texas she's crazy please all the south is still a friendlier place I love playing this out yeah I'm always in the south I never considered tensions the south it's kind of a young thing it's sort of how it is the West you're much as it is the south it's everything it's a world where the south what we're the south if you look at the south of the country well with Southern California where the west but we're also the South Texas is a weird thing but we know what we mean when we talk about South Dixie yes and but Texas is so big Austin to me is not Texan enough I might as well be in New York you know it's more like San Francisco like a slice yeah yes I do I want the real barbecue I like well not barbecue but I like that that Texas flavor Houston I love I always had a better it went back when I used to go out after a show always had a better time in the south than the north much rather party in Houston and I don't know Boston which is a beautiful city and I love it and I love performing there but I never found the party but you can't miss it in Houston yeah you know yeah a little more more jovial yeah Joe feel it's interesting how we think of the south to a good and Arizona's not the south but it's fucking for sure the south I mean it's about ordering Mexico yes well Arizona yeah I mean they're there they're bringing up the rear a little bit strange spot a certain civilization wise yeah you know there there's some very concern it's the conservative best Barry Goldwater country and sheriff joe arpaio you know I mean there's some real real cavemen yeah in Arizona but I'll open carry state yeah but when you stick to cities which we do you know we're not playing theaters in the sticks it doesn't matter what state you're in you're always going to be and get a liberal audience look at the election map every year there's a lot of red but anyplace there's a city it's a blue dot especially if they have a college town I played Birmingham Alabama it looks like any place else at least the crowd coming to my show I once was I think it was Birmingham it was somewhere in Alabama must have been either Birmingham or Mobile and there was a bass fishing contest or award show tournament something going on like at the same time as my show or maybe my show was starting and it was letting out but there was this I was driving up to theaters long crowd of people coming to my show who looked like it dressed like anywhere else normal and then on the other side of the street going the other way a bunch of people in flannel shirts and trucker hats and it couldn't have been a more obvious example of two Americas yeah but within the city of Birmingham Alabama but it's still a city and you know we see that electorally the divide Trump does super well among people who never left the town they were born in rural people people out in the sticks and does terrible in the cities and now much more increasingly in the suburbs the suburbs are the swing vote the suburbs last time in 2016 there was a lot of people in the suburbs who don't follow politics that closely and they just said boy things suck in America let's let the dog drive for a while let's see what let's see what let's see what happens and they didn't you know they won he's a businessman he must know how to run the economy and all this stuff we'll try something new those people I think first of all a lot of them have peeled away already those are the gettable voters those are the people if the Democrats want to win I think that they have to target and I already have but that's why it's a risky to run someone far left I think if you run Amy Klobuchar as much as people say oh she's you know dull and she's this and she's that and no-one's excited yeah but again binary at the end of the day when there's only two choices Trump or her I think she were very hard for her to get the nomination I think as far as like winning the election I think she would do it fairly easily do you think that Bernie's to left do these a lot of the laundry yes do you think that's really do ask the wrong question yeah media asks and that there's a debate tonight the media asks the wrong question which is what would you do this is a question that only makes sense if you're running for King the question should not be what would you do the question is what can you get through what can you propose that Mitch McConnell will not either block or you can override with votes because that's a very different discussion mmm what Bernie Sanders wants to do we shouldn't even be talking about because it's not going to happen the free education yes back student loan debt better care for all for all I know all these well as long as the unless the Republicans self-deport even if the Democrat wins the election they're still going to be half the country that's Republican and half the Congress is going to be Republican and this just a lot of Democrats are not for this stuff you know when the Democrats took over the house in 2018 it was moderate Democrats who won their elections it wasn't the the far left so so you get four years of spinning your wheel and the mud you get we're hoping to get some traction you know if he gets in again it's what can get through Congress what can you get a consensus on what what can you make possible Obama when he did health care said yes if we were starting from scratch it would make sense to go for a single-payer system but we're not starting from scratch we're starting from a system where most people already have health insurance through their employer it's a crazy story how that happened it was world war two and they couldn't raise wages because that was the law so they had to find a way to give employers something else so they gave them health insurance but that's what we have now and a lot of people like it or say they like it I don't think a lot of people like arguing with their insurance company but they're afraid of something worse and I don't blame them you know if you're gonna tell me the government and I'm a Democrat but if you're gonna tell me the government is gonna smoothly handle taking over something that large I am gonna be a little skeptical we should be they don't smoothly handle anything there's no evidence they smoothly handle anything rather than maybe delivering the news well I'm delivering the mail look again as an old-school progressive when you go down the list of things that the progressives have accomplished especially in my lifetime I cheered them all Social Security that was in my lifetime but they improved it in my lifetime Medicare Medicaid these are great programs I mean before Social Security the senior poverty rate was like in the twenty eight percent or something and then it went down below ten it was a success but when you look at what the government really what their big successes have amounted to it's passing out money that very often they don't have that's what they're really good at running a giant healthcare system especially when the politicians who are proposing these systems will not a talk enough about we got to cap the gouging you can't pass out all this money with if you're if you're going to allow people hospitals pharmaceutical companies to George chart anything they want when the price of an EpiPen can go up from $12 to 1,200 overnight that just can't happen and also they don't ask the people to lift a finger to take care of their own health nobody's health care system is going to work I'm you involve people have some sink skin in the game you can't like not tell the people look you can't keep eating as much as you want and as shitty of food as you want and expect us to cover the bill you just can't that is not something that anybody wants to hear though oh I know because I did that editorial well people here's this door people did not people loved it until James Corden said something oh that's right he had that hole first of all he did that and in doing that made fat jokes which was which I did not by the way mine mine was nothing city sheep on orbit people look morbidly obese ever first of all he missed a great opportunity to literally save lives if he had taken the opposite approach he took the easy way out of course you can always get applause for saying oh let's let's boo the mean man who's told the truth that's not brave first of all my point was a that you can't solve health care unless you ask the people to participate in that that was one and also that we've gone to this place where we're proud of it we're proud of being unhealthy Weight Watchers had to take the name weight and Watchers out of their title it's WW now it's like wait what it's C being fat isn't bad what's bad is someone pointing out that fat is bad but I mean I read the statistic in that editorial 40,000 people a month a month die from obesity that's a crazy number that is a crazy number we have to somehow reverse this idea that we have in this country not just about obesity but about a lot of things where I'm perfect the way I am mmm I am just perfect the way I am and if you say different you're a very bad person that's not a good place to be it's not healthy for anybody you're you're protecting people's emotions but shielding them from a possible moment that might make them realize that they are eating themselves to death right I mean look I said it also in the piece beauties in the eye of the beholder that's fine whatever you think is beautiful that's your deal but health is science yeah that's science and when we get apoplectic when there's 50 deaths from shootings or something a month yeah it's very bad and we should be serious about that problem but 50 versus 40,000 every month and that's just what they're counting from the big ones cancer diabetes and heart disease there's literally nothing about your health that is improved by being overweight so you know I said we shouldn't taunt people but you know compare it to anything else I also owned up to the fact that I used to drink too much and I smoked but I didn't defend it when someone said you know you went kind of hard last night with the drinking I didn't say how dare you drunk shame me well the width I said you're right I did weird thing about Corden too is he's not that fat like he could fix that a couple of months that's not that hard no he took you know it was a it was opportunity yes and I felt like saying yeah he could have he literally lost an opportunity to save lives because as someone who does struggle with weight he could have taken the opposite approach and said you know he bill makes a really good point and we should we should look at how we are dealing with this I noticed Jillian Michaels the fitness expert took a lot of shit for Liz Oh for Liz oh yeah and you know if you want to be whatever weight you want to be that's fine but it's wrong to shame a fitness expert for saying this isn't healthy well kids even said it's not gonna be that amazing when she gets diabetes yeah of people not diabetes that's nothing to do it weight is for sure everything to do with fucking for sure it also they they they lie they say things like well it's the fat gene it's you know there's nothing it's not that or here's another one and look this is valid it's valid that in this country it is a lot to eat right if you're poor yes and we should totally address that yes doubt if it's on any candidates top ten list but the way the food situation and subsidies are done in this country is horrible but given that let's not just throw up our hands and say we're the can't do country and because it's harder let's not even try yes it is harder to eat right on a budget but I'll tell you something something you never need to have with your food soda which is a large part of it okay and you'll save money you don't have to have soda you don't have to have a Snickers bar a bananas 19 cents so it's not impossible adèle got shit recently because she got yes because she got healthier that's was also a part of my thing was fit shaming you know fat shaming fit people go eat something eat something I'm fine what so you can feel better about your weight problem I should eat and get fat - well when heavy people have a fan or have someone that they're a fan of that's also heavy like James Corden like so he's heavy he's got people in the audience that love him and they love him standing up for other heavy people yeah we're fine we're fine he's one of us we're fine I think they felt like that with Adele Adele was this fantastic singer super talented extremely popular and overweight like yeah it's fine it's fine I'm like Adele everyone's fine it was then she loses weight like you feel like she's betraying you because one of the reasons why I liked you is cuz you're fat yeah you're not fat anymore it wasn't that long ago that we were applauding people when they lost weight yeah I remember when remember when Oprah came out at that time was she was this was like in the 80s I think but she had lost a whole bunch of where there's a picture you it's a very famous picture I think she's she's like in jeans and she's got a like really thin waist and you know she was raising your hands and triumphs and everyone was applauding I guess that's bad now because again you have to be perfect the way you are and if you criticize that then Europe I think on this it's just that there's too many voices that you hear because of social media you hear so many nonsense voices and they stand out just like everybody else's voice there's so many people just screaming into the void because there's so many social media accounts of so many people that are tweeting about things and facebooking about things and and it gets people confused is that this is like a rational perspective and again with echo chambers they're all just hop on board and support James Corden or support you know Adele needs to fatten back up and you'll get thousands of likes everybody will go crazy that's the key word yeah that's is what I didn't understand until about a year ago that so many people are saying things on social media not because they really believe it to get the likes yeah that's really scary that's weird we had a billboard once when we were coming back on the air in January just like now but four or five years ago and the tagline was he's not in it for the likes and it's my favorite piece of promotion that anyone has ever done for me that's great he's not in it for the like yeah advertising that as this is why you watch the show yeah but obviously that's not the way a lot of people feel they are in it for the likes and they will take a position that they don't believe in because they know it'll get likes and I've heard this from people I actually respect and I'm like wow you have an addiction that is an addiction additional likes addiction yeah there is absolutely that and they calculate their posts based on the kind of response they think it's gonna get it's not like a free expression it's not like they're they're making a post saying how I feel about this thing right writing it down going how are people going to react to this how am I going to get people to really think that I'm awesome how am I gonna get people to really think I'll progressive really writing I'm an open-minded person mmm-hmm the male feminist perspective right yeah I was just talking to Jimmy my friend Jimmy Dore about that about male feminists about that pretty that's like a wholly false perspective and you never see it in gay guys there are no male feminist gay guys because there trying to fuck the women so it's like that it's not a position they would take right it's it's they'll support you they'll be your friend right this whole idea I'm a lie I mean I try fuck man it's so clear it's such an obvious respect right you know it's just such a weird sneaky thing yeah but that's it that's a it's a version of the same thing people are doing for likes on social media it's a calculated expression in order to get you know what was the kind of response you're hoping now it's greasy that's grease on the word I would have thought of but perfect whenever I read male feminist posts I get angry I just kick does not i don't want equality for women I just you're a greasy man I know you didn't read your Twitter no me neither never because she likes exactly well and and what I read about people very often who killed themselves oh yeah you know in the responses that yeah this is a big thing how about this guy losing his fucking job for the couldn't you just yeah could you just stop what he got a job with the Saints did you like like he was rich is a better team yeah but I mean everybody I asked some people who I know like Barry Weiss who's like brilliant person and she's like oh my it's like so depressing like it's like don't read it oh yes generation cannot stop reading even when it's going to kill them I don't understand that well it's it's very impulsive right you see your name and you see someone would they say Oh Barry you're brilliant oh thank you and then you go a little further you fucking die and then there's a bunch of them like in that haunts and then a bunch of people piling on and it's you know realizes so first of all they don't even know you're a real human a lot of people have never met anyone famous they have know that they are looking at and a lot of them are 15 like well I always say that if I had a Twitter account when I was 15 how does it horrible shit to famous people right just to get a ride right is he gonna react to see if I can get him to react it's not even things that they necessarily mean they don't know you but unless they meet you they don't even really know you that people take it to heart so much that they killed themselves you know a few of these k-pop stars have killed themselves really look that up from from a social media yes I think so I think that's the main reason and there and these are you know pop stars yeah I can't halogen Bobby Sherman right you know like 68 reading his fan mail and go yes this one hates me too if Elvis had a Twitter account hey man little fucking you give a shit Priscilla's 14 yeah come on what the find a pervert yeah well maybe he could have used social media back then that's it right that's the balance like you don't want Jerry Lee Lewis marrying his cousin and drowning his wives and you also don't want Elvis looking 14 year old maybe be better I yeah maybe a little bit I own as a balanced auction you wonder what my life would have been like as a teenager with this stuff because maybe it would have made me kill myself but I was painfully shy couldn't really talk to a girl if I had been able to text them maybe think I would say some shit I exactly I think I could have done really well with that I would had a lot of dick pictures floating around 100% I would have sent it to everybody you know fuckin dumb and young you have no you have no idea that's gonna last forever I thought that was a humble brag about it no no it's a regular day just Eddie just any old day I've sent people other people's dicks but I would just think that the whole idea because young boys love dick pic they draw out of me that scene in what was the fucking movie super bad that's one of my favorite scenes in a movie ever where he's just drawing dicks and class all yeah it's fucking hilarious because it's so true that's so true yeah like we got real lucky that we are not held up to the standards that kids are today because everything they do today that they put on line they're gonna put a lot of things online it's permanent for ever I couldn't imagine something that I said when I was 14 being permanent and that points me at back to this thing about this football player and things that people write on Twitter it's something Lucy Kay said to me recently we're talking about this you said people look at stuff when it's written down like it's different but it's just talk it's talk but it's written like people say she oh she's a fucking bitch I'm tired of her shit and then you see her like oh I'm sorry like but that's talk right but when you see it written it's like oh my god did you see what he put on Twitter to see what he wrote like you're talking to the whole world now right and you gotta realize this is different thing and then people get a screenshot of it you can never take it back yes senator we're gonna keep it forever we're gonna archive it look he said it he said she's a fucking bitch and you can't there's no just talk anymore but we're wired for just talk people are wired for gossip and and nonsense talk especially when you're drinking but if you're drinking then you get on Twitter oh you could you could say the dumbest shit ever you could take your life and people have yeah with justine sacco that famous yes that was one of the first ones the one who was yeah as soon as you got off the flight it was upside down right yeah she gets on a plane it's almost comical except it's comical you know she gets on a plane and tweets that she said something is funny and then by the time the plane lands her life's over by the way Family Guy did a hysterical version of that where Brian the dog goes into the theater he tweets something going into a theater and it's semi racist but it's and then by the time he comes out of the movie his life is destroyed by the Twitter mob is literally a mob outside his house we're not designed for permanence like that did you be able to just express yourself loosely it's like if you're gonna write something in a book and publish that book and you're gonna carefully consider every word and then you put that book out and you okay we've gone over it we brought it that's a different thing than fuck this guy so what do you think should go on with Louie Louie CK you mention him I know more about it than most people because I've talked to Louie about it but what happened versus what's being portrayed is what happened there were there's a lot of stuff just not true Lackey who's never blocking anybody's door once and what's unfair is that he cannot say it he can't if you if you engage and defend yourself correct the record then you make it worse yeah so you're in this sort of purgatory where if you hear things that are not true you also cannot say anything about it yeah that's a that's a unfair place to be and also like is everything a hanging offense my problem with some of the me to stuff and of course I think like every right-thinking person it was a great thing that happened that men have been put on notice that you're playing with five fouls and you just can't get away with a lot of the shit you use particular men in positions of ours plays right I mean I think that's also extend it to the fracking industry and McDonald's and every other place in America where probably it's very prevalent nobody ever hears about it but there is just no consistency Charlie Sheen who I'm not picking on I like him but he got a Superbowl commercial last year well he did way worse things and Louise ek white where's you couldn't give Louis he can't so people have like let me see guys in a Super Bowl commercial that is ridiculous are lisheen yeah can I Charlie Sheen because know she and I know but yeah held a knife to his did he didn't that time in Aspen wasn't that he was with the third wife or something and I seem to remember but he's done man it's being sued for giving people aids I mean there's just this litany of things that are way worse than whacking off in front of people which is not cool either of course it's self but literally diddly little college eyes and own up to it and I just think the there where is the consistency yeah look and also where is the is it a is it all is everything a life sentence Louis is is a horrible person forever or is there some point where we used to go yes a person pays his debt to society in some way and then you know I you know you're allowed back I feel I just feel bad for him I mean I feel like he did weird shit that he shouldn't have done for sure and I think he knows that I know he knows that but what is the proper punishment and is and who decides it well he's definitely working again so all the people that are complaining and bitching about her sees no one here knows his doing he's touring again right yeah when you selling his tickets to his fans yeah sure but he certainly can't do everything he wants to do right and he can't he can still tour but even if he wants to do a special boy who's gonna take him up on that right you know who's gonna jump jump the law and maybe maybe the proper punishment is another five years before you can have a special but that's a long time well I'm just saying I'm just pulling it out of my ass I'm just saying what we need some sort of it's been more than two years some sort of me to court yeah that a fair and just adjusted by Judge Rose McGowan presiding yeah yeah how would you how do you decide when you know a person has been punished enough and and what is the governor yeah but he's got some hilarious bits about it because so the problem was I like jerking off and I don't like being alone right and I wanted to the rest of the material he does about it but you know he asked he asked can I jerk off in front of you when they said yes he did it it's not a good thing nothing's good about any you know but and he knows it and I'm not defending him but right people are portraying it is far worse than like he went up at skank fest in New York and people went crazy and cheered and I reposted the video of it and someone posted on Twitter one of the rare times I look fuck you Joe Rogan he assaulted women yeah no like no he didn't no but he didn't you're gonna can't change where salt means right he asked if he could jerk off in front of people and then he did there's some question as to whether or not a jerked off on the phone with somebody I don't think that's assault either it's kind of creepy not even kinda it's time she would say it's creepy but we're not talking about someone assaulted people like you you can't just change the definition of the word because it makes you feel better about hating someone now I also read but I don't know if it's true if his management I think threatened women who were gonna talk about this or prevented someone's career from moving because of this if that happened that to me is almost worse yes that's a guerrilla beds yes agree I don't know if that's true and he's not allowed to talk to straighten that out well it's not that he's not allowed to talk well it would be it was been considered talking about it a few times and I think he just he decides at the end of the day it's just better just keep pushing ahead and right and his new hour apparently I'm not advertising for it but from everybody that I heard it's fucking amazing cuz all the pain all the craziness he apparently has a book about new material rock and knew I talked about something to talk about I do cuz it's like a work night for me boy up tell people when is it when's the new season air Friday this Friday yeah the 17th to January same bat-time same bat-channel HBO at 10:00 Eastern and I guess you can figure out the other time zones from that and we're gonna go back at it again plenty to talk about plenty to talk about always see congratulations by the way on making this such a big stop and such an iconic place you did good thank you thank you I don't know what the fuck happened stumbled into it will you do my show sure okay I asked you before and you were very squirrely about the people they're all talking over each other over stand by you know I heard you say that one yeah when you're some guy doing a terrible impression of me and and it's a very tile kolinsky it is a great impression of you I didn't know who he was have you ever seen the face off faith of Face Swap version that he does of you on Instagram no oh I don't know find that before we leave what's that cutlet kolinsky sorry sorry Kyle no we don't have to look at this I'm Emily it's amazing to you it was amazing it wasn't yeah I don't man I people done me and I can laugh at it something it was your face he's got your face I was doing an impression of you you've never seen it it's not I saw what anyway the point yeah that doesn't matter the point was what was the point a point was there's not too many people talking over each other on your show correct I feels like it is to me it's very difficult to have a conversation when there's so many different people talking it's such a fundamental criticism of my show it's not his show is just that format that's the size but that's of that which I think you're thinking you're politically incorrect was that way I'm thinking of your show right now well I'm there every week okay and I try I monitor it pretty closely of course when you have a panel which we do there can be those moments but we don't book that kind of person and that kind of show it's not the old let's get them fighting thing we don't want that and honestly the number of times when people have been shouting over each other and you can't hear them is very little it's not even that they're shouting over each others if you have a point you want to talk about something you got to let it was a little hesitation but you would be the mid show guest to my left and it would be a one-on-one you know I do a one-on-one twice on the show have you seen the show okay in the middle of the show yeah I bring out more of a celebrity usually to my left I would be tossed in one wears one harris start going at it with ben affleck because of that Sam was your one-on-one that's right okay well that's you know you picked the one example where somebody that's what you were talking about I think you've seen one show Jordan Peterson glad we only don't demand that anyone be effete I just like honesty one of my favorite how we're getting woozy honest Hitchens went after most deaf well he's been dead for like ten years so what we're establishing your knowledge of this show is very limited so I watched a bunch episode I hope you to watch Yeti I don't need you to have I have lots of fans I'm not don't need one more what I'm saying is I'd like you to do it because I think you'd be good and I like listening to you and you'd be to my left one on one there would be nobody shouting over you because they wouldn't be involved okay so you wouldn't have that problem so will you do it yes great all right and then we'll work on it shin will work on Hawaii all right all right Bill Marley's thank you thank you pleasure to be here man yeah [Music]
