and would go 4 3 2 1 and we're live you fucking handsome bastard look at you oh yeah what's going on man what's going on um well I've done this once before and I've watched you throughout the years and when I come in here I get a little nervous why you're a guy who knows a lot about everything and I don't know a lot of I don't know a lot about everything I know enough to make it seem like I know a lot about everything whatever you're doing it's you know more than I do right like like we were on your treadmill out there right and you go it's 13% what did you say I heard 10% more difficult than regular running okay I forgot the fact what you just said from the time we walked in III lost it so I don't I don't have the repenting know that I wish I had you some alpha brain I need something do we have any here is that what I'm missing in my diet alpha male I mean it's uh what's interesting though is that people will come up to me with shit that happened just a few years ago and I'm like I don't remember that at all like I think you have a certain amount of room in your brain and my brain is always deleting stuff that it doesn't think it needs anymore and then shoving in new things like sometimes someone will tell me about something like what are you talking about and they're like you don't remember there was the guy with no arms who drove us around I went what and then I have to go oh yeah it's like I find the folder in my head and like oh there yeah yeah yeah yeah and then we went to that pool hall and then I'll remember okay but if yeah it's just for whatever reason this uh I can only only keep things that I'm interested in gotcha yeah I just wish I could retain a lot of the things either see or hear - then recall it in a conversation you can but you got to write things down you gotta like want to recall things yeah that's a problem I don't do a lot of writing as far as like a notepad or anything to just take notes do when you write your act you write it in your head you write it on paper or it's audio just audio go to the comedy store I record it and I listen to it on the way home and then I'll go home maybe I'll do this next time maybe I'll do that I'll take that out in this out and then so there's no writing my act is more recalling stories than sitting in a room going oh I think this is funny right so that's kind of how I work but yeah the reason I say that to start off is just like I see you go down a lot of different paths on the podcast and I often go man if I was sitting in that chair could I add to the conversation and a lot of times it's no okay just because for whatever the reason I I just feel like I need to be a little bit more well-read mmm how often you read like I read the Goggins book yeah and that fucking book yeah and that life that dude had huh a sad life but then on the flip side inspiring to you know a guy like myself where you know I'm running I'm running say I'm working out and I I thought of this guy I go you know what let's let's put another mile in today yeah so yeah I mean I'm just now starting to get into a little bit more books than I have in the past because in the past to be honest with you I haven't really I haven't really read much I try to read one new thing a week and the way I try to do it is I have I use a lot of audiobooks they're also read books so I go back and forth in between them between reading and audiobooks but I find for whatever reason I retain more with audio books than I do with reading maybe it's my ad D or something like that because when I'm reading I kind of have to back up sometimes like I'll go through a whole paragraph or I'm thinking about some other shit while I'm reading yeah and then I gotta go okay asshole back up reread that over it again you know that's what I find and my mind wanders like yeah if you're saying the audiobook definitely is better option yeah I think all stand-up comedians have scatterbrains at least in some in some way yeah all of us are a little fucked up I think we have to be I think I think that the mind works in a weird way in a comedian's head I think it has to be a little bit fragmented and thinking a lot of different things at once and you have to operate I mean you're doing it on stage I think you know you're doing you're doing your comedy and I'm self-evaluating going is this working right now should I go off into another bitch shit I talk about my family I see their liking family stuff so I think yeah that's what we're doing when we're performing and then sometimes I think that bleeds to everyday life yeah for sure yeah when you're doing a bit are you thinking about what you're you like you have a bit on deck like while you're in the middle of the bit do you like go from there I'm gonna talk about you know the gym or though you know this or that it's funny and I don't know if you go through this do you ever go through well first of all when you're doing comedy do you have a beginning middle and end and you know where you're going throughout that whole set or do you in the moment go you know what I'm gonna do the bit about that that or is it set it's not it's both it depends when like right now I don't have a lot of material because my Netflix special came out in October so November December January I've basically three months worth a new shit which is about 40 minutes of all told material and then I have 20 other minutes that are in the there in like the baking stage like I'm not ready to take them out of the oven there I fuck around with them I'll shove them in the middle a bit some sometimes but they're not they're not a hundred percent legit they need to be fleshed out but one of those became like one of my best bits now it's weird how that works like sometimes you'll just find this one part of it that makes it work and boom all of a sudden the bits turbocharged so because of that I usually I decide that day usually what I'm gonna open with and then I leave the middle part up to my imagination and then I decide what I'm gonna close with but when I ready to do a Netflix special I basically have it all mapped out I basically have a starting point and I have an end point yeah not even like when I'm filming I still fuck around and ad-lib because I don't think because every show I do I don't I don't have like I'm gonna say it verbatim this way every time I always fuck around because I always feel like I could find a new way that's better if I just stay loose and so even when I'm filming I do it that way because I feel I want this to be like a real show it's a real show and I always film four shows so I'm like if it's a real show I'll fuck around and inside I've been filming before I fuck around I go down a dark road and there's no one there I'm like alright turn around I thank God for editing yeah I think I think that's the way to do it though to be kind of in the moment and go with how you're feeling when you're filming something just because that's the way you would be anyway yeah ain't but sometimes I've learned in the past when I'm filming something I feel like man I'd like to get everything that I want out on this special and I don't want to forget anything you know cuz it'll be nights where I'm I'm performing and I I forgot a bit I'm like I'll be searching in my head for the bit and I'm like I know there's another something then goes along this but then I just jump off it and go into a another routine so for me I don't know I like to keep it different every night just trying way around and it's weird now that a Netflix special the I just have one came out and I don't really subscribe to if if I have a Netflix special out and you come to a live show you're going to see some of those bits that I did in the Netflix special I don't like retire the the act I know some guys go okay it's out there I'm not doing this on my live show myself I still like to do some of that material because I enjoy doing it and I also have some new stuff so I kind of and I don't know how long that lasts I don't know like I know some some people were like oh I saw that on the Netflix why am I gonna pay to see it live if I could see it at home but there's something about going out I believe to a live show and seeing a live performance there's different nuances that you might see in a bit or an add-on like this sometimes I add on to the joke then my jokes are sometimes never finished so we keep adding on so that's the way I've kind of worked at my entire career yeah Gaffigan does it that way a lot of Brian Regan does it that way where guys will call out bits like they would like if you go to see Gaffigan he doesn't do hot pockets you're gonna get fucking mad mm-hmm that's this a lot of people like that I retire my material but I have brought stuff out before if people asked like someone asked me to bring up explaining Kim Kardashian's to the aliens the other night and I was amazed that I could remember it but I remembered it but for the most part I retire ship because I feel like in my mind if I don't retire things I'm not going to work on new things as much I'm going to limit myself and then I always feel like my newest bits are better than my older bits because even though I've been doing stand-up for 30 years I still think I get better at it I think it's a constant state of self evaluation and self analysis and going over the material and then realize you know you have enough good sets and bad sets and great sets you have enough to kind of recognize the characteristics of each one where they go wrong and then you get better at having less bad sets and even less good sets and more great sets yeah and you know and I think that for me one big part of that is constantly writing I write write I sit down and write right and I write at one hour every night after shows that's one big one I write during the day but the big one for me seems to be at night when I come home from the store and I'm jazzed up and also it's great too because everyone's it's just me and the dog and I just fucking sit at that desk and I'll just work until my eyes start blinking and I start getting really tired and some of my best shit I've ever come up with is that way well after shows because I'm all juiced up and then I also have a process of listening to the show in the car because you know it's one of the coolest things about Bluetooth audio that you get your phone you record it on your phone and then in the car home you can listen and you can go I fucked that up or I should have done it this way or maybe if I do that or you have an idea I'll pause it got another idea yeah and then I make a new voice note and then I'll go home and I'll listen to it again I'll listen to my set again and I'll pause it and then start working on stuff and that's how I've been able to expand all these bits pretty quickly mmm that's interesting I I find my best bits come out of just living my life and you know I have a daughter we went to the zoo and the nuances at the zoo that I picked up on and I just go out either tell i-i'll call my mother and I'll tell her a story and that's kind of my barometer of whether or not this thing's gonna work on stage and then I'll go to the comedy store and kind of flush it out there but yeah I mean I just never been the guy who writes I just I don't know well you don't have to know i yeah it's working for you there's a lot of guys who don't do it that way bill burr doesn't do it that way he's one of the best ever yeah a lot of guys who just don't write for me I feel like it's all about how much time and energy I put on things and if I put more time and energy you're just working on my act because I'm writing then it's gonna be better that's just how I look at it yeah yeah everybody's got their own process and I'm fascinated to hear guys like yourself Seinfeld's another guy that every word is planned out yeah and you could hear it with him you know you really hear his act is like a scalpel you know it's just he's slicing the perfect slice and he's just he knows exactly how does that it yeah he's got perfect timing he's got you know his use of words is you know whether or not you you know meaning anyway any comment can appreciate that any comment can appreciate the way he does that you know there's a lot of guys who like that who just have that did you ever watch Jenny at all I have in you know his timing I think was I think timing in comedy is something a bit of a lost art I don't think a lot of comedians are really taking to timing like they have in the past and I don't know if they're are scared of the silence cuz because a lot of timing is silent and a lot of guys and and women tend to not relish in those moments of silence where sometimes it's it's comedy gold a lot of people run through the material and for me as an audience member I like someone who kind of gives you as an audience member a little little beat or yeah maybe some time to kind of marinate in the joke a little bit opposed to kind of blowing through the material don't you feel that like when you're in a large audience that's even more critical because you have like there's thousands of people and it seems like a big pause like in between punchlines or you give a person a chance give this whole group of people a chance to think about how ridiculous what you just said was yeah it enhances it oh absolutely I mean especially like you said in a large audience which is even more fearful for a comedian to let the joke breathe yeah as God knows you know if you've got a thousand people and then you got 20,000 people I mean you know 19 more thousand people could yell or scream or say something so anything but man to stop and just let that joke breathe a little bit and just and then maybe have it percolate there's times where I'm on stage and and I'll go a little bit longer than I thought I was gonna go without talking but maybe give it like a facial expression or whatnot just to see if I could eke out another crescendo of laughter yeah and those are the moments are really relishing because sometimes the silence is even better than saying anything yeah and you also realize that you're not like rushing anything yeah you got a hold of it yeah at least for myself my act is more like a it needs to needs to kind of sit I don't really do well on like five minute talk shows doing like you know doing a four and a half minutes set on Fallon I need to like go out there it takes me two minutes to to get warm you know I'm saying like to get into a joke right away and to me I just anytime I need I need to let it breathe ya know I feel the same way I've always felt those late-night talk show sets are so strange not only that but you're basically opening for yourself I mean cuz there's no one has done stand-up yet accepted monologue you just kind of stand up but kind of nob because it's all like what's happening today and everybody knows that it's been written it's it's weird yeah and then you go out and do a stand-up set and oftentimes you see guys go out and they'll do a stand-up setting they don't even have a microphone you know they're doing a stand-up setting they don't know what to do with their hands you know the first time I did a stand-up set on MTV I said I need the microphone yeah I can't go out there I've been doing comedy for what 12 years it had been and then I got like a Leno I need a physical like yeah I'm used to this I'm not gonna go out there all of a sudden now and like you said what am I gonna with my hands yeah so every time I do a late-night said I need a microphone how do you still do those um no not anymore I like to do it's like comedy on the couch you know you know it's like you go on Fallon or what-have-you and it's all premeditated birds the master at that all right so he's the master he's the best that's sitting down there and saying something fucked up and they just like you know you know I'm saying he's good he just got a great way of handling the couch yeah he makes it sound like just two guys talking and then there's cameras filming it yeah sometimes it could look like okay you asked the question I give the answer but for whatever the reason it's so natural for him it's like this guy looks like he's talking in a at a diner yeah exactly ya know he's uh he's mastered the art of not giving a fuck yeah he's very comfortable and if you you know like but that's who he is all day you know he just wraps it up a couple extra clicks when he goes onstage yeah that's when you're hanging out with him that's burr yeah it's not a far departure from now from what we're seeing he's got one thing down - that guy does not fuck with social media he's not doing nothing oh he's not even on it I mean he like kind of I guess he posts stuff well you know I follow him on Instagram and every once in a while I'll see something yeah um which you know from me I've kind of weaned off the social media a little bit I know a lot of guys live on it and they take you into their lives and here's you know like here I follow Bert Kreischer so everything I'm wondering if the people around Bert Kreischer are going to him all right Bert you want to lose the phone you know like we're all we're having dinner here oh yeah because man he really gives you a bird's eye view into not only his family life but he's on a ski lift and he's got the you know skis and this and that so which I appreciate it's just for me I don't know is there something a little sense of privacy every once in a while well in Bert's defense what Bert did was he had a legit TV gig and he was doing Bert the Conqueror and was the the other one the other one where he was traveling around trip flip trip flip and you know he's doing really well but he was gone for long stretches of time away from his family and he wasn't getting to do much stand-up and he and I had a conversation about it and I said stood a girl you're too funny to be just working for a television show anybody can do a television show but not everybody could do stand-up the way you did stand up and he somewhere along the line decided all right fuck this TV shit and I'm just gonna just gonna concentrate on stand-up and a big part of that was social media so big part of it for him was you know every year we have this sober October crew it sorry Tom Segura me and Bert and we do one month challenge yeah like it was last year was a fitness challenge and before that it was a hot yoga challenge and before that they had to lose weight so that when we've only done it twice but it's a big thing social media why it's a bunch of people hop on board with it a bunch of people join in and they take a month off boozing - and and for Bert that's fucking hard that guy goes hard in the paint with the booze yeah so for him that that the sober October stuff and the weight loss stuff propelled his career I mean everything started taking off the Netflix special started taking off his stand-up shows are sold out everywhere that he people know him they know he takes off his short when he goes onstage now it's a totally different thing so I get it with him cuz that's what brought him to the dance social media absolutely and that guy's figured it out I'm just using Bert as an example of a guy who's on social media a ton and has figured out a way to weave that into his kind of aura and what he does professionally but for me I feel I get a little I feel like everything I do on social media has to be funny I mean if I do a post I feel like it has to be funny I feel a little bit intimidated to put something out that's just me doing X Y & Z and that's where I feel I fail at social media and I feel like I've kind of weaned off it and sometimes I look at my Instagram or my Twitter it looks like hey I'm gonna be here I'm gonna be here here's my shows there's no real kind of substance to it at all yeah that bothers some people but the good thing is I mean I get what people who all you do is promote your shows yeah but I'm promoting my shows you know this is where I am if you like my shows that's where I'm gonna be I get it but I see what you're saying as a comic because Ari Shaffir said that to it he doesn't want to put anything on Instagram or Twitter unless it's funny no that's what he concentrates on and he tries he was off even saying that he was gonna mock people that are comedians that say things that aren't funny I'm like well then you're gonna be mocking me I say a lot of shit that's not funny he's like yeah but you do other things which is weird because I do do other things whether it's part I sing all the time or doing the UFC commentary like you know if I'm if I watch some fights and I start posting about MMA I'm not trying to be funny it's just yeah just what it is yeah you know well yeah you're living in a lot of different worlds but and and I look at your Instagram you're cooking meat right yeah but for me I'm thinking how the hell does he get the meat it's like from from top to bottom like medium-rare throughout you know that's for me that's more of a l'heure oh I can teach you Sebastian I could teach you you know that he is cooking it slowly okay the key so you got like this grill or whatever Praeger yeah he'll it grill palate grill is the one you want one if it gets my meat the way Wow I'll have them send you 100% perfect but yeah one of those are do you know how they work no it's fucking fantastic it's it's uh they like say if someone wants to make a desk like this at a hardwood like this oak this sawdust they take the sawdust from from sawmills and they compress it and they make these little tiny pellets and so there's no chemicals no nothing it's just wood and then the the way a pellet grill works a bunch of really good companies that make them I use a trigger but I've used a yoder that's a great one too and Green Mountain grills it's a great one this they have they all work the same way they have a heating element and a worm drive so you have this big bucket of these pellets and then the worm drive feeds the pellets into this heating element and the heating element makes the pellets catch fire so once they catch fire it's a matter of how much pellets and how much fan to keep the tip that's what it looks like up there so then see look at this Joe yeah no I'm looking at this and I'm like it that looks like that looks like a lot of work it's not first of all you got to get a a side pellet catch all but it's there comes with the whole thing yeah but then you gotta go buy the pellets it's easy I have it delivered to you I'll have it delivered I'm trying to get more people to cook like this because it's just wood and fire it's the best there's no chemicals there's no bullshit no lighter fluid no gas no nothing so you're in gravy fire your entire meat process is on this grill except the end at the end this is a different grill than I have because this one has a thing on the side if you see that thing on the right hand side is like a like that looks like a like a direct flame thing looks like it's got gas as well right the one that I have doesn't have that but at the end I see her it at the very end on a cast-iron frying pan so I cook it from between 225 to 275 degrees which is pretty low and I'll kick it until it hits an internal temperature depending upon what I'm cooking somewhere around 120 to the maximum like 130 ish then I take it out and I have a cast-iron frying pan that's hot as a motherfucker and I use either a beef tallow or grass-fed butter and then I sear that shit out of that with some garlic and I throw some thyme in there and fucking flip it over and get that good sear and then I let it sit for a minimum of 10 minutes okay so your meat is unbelievable I've seen it on the ink so I do something similar but I do it in the oven I don't do it I don't work I do a slow cook in the oven and then I take it out I let it rest for I think 15 minutes and then I do a seared job oh but I'm always looking for better ways to to cook meat and if if you're saying that this palate thing does it add any flavor yeah that's with that because it's smoky hardwood gotcha so you it's all smoked you lift the thing up smokes coming out of it and everything it's a nice aromatic smart that's what I know it's like cherry smoke or oak or you know Hickory or maple all these different hardwoods you could choose a bunch of different perfect okay so you're not getting that in the oven no and you know it's different and there's also a setting on a trigger called super smoke where you hit it it it goes - it can't be over 225 but that's what I like anyway and you put it on 225 and it's just constantly fans hard and pushes all this smoke so it just gets this deep rich smoky flavor in the meat melesa nice but I like if you're not into that - I like a regular burr grille like one of those little fucking Weber that you know the little bocce yeah what are those things called that you get what would you call them they're like a drum looks like a half a drum yeah a barrel fucking thing yeah but what are those this way it looks like looks like it's like a black yeah the black ones yeah like steel those but I like those with just lump charcoal that puts a nice flavor on it too the key is don't fuck around with chemicals when you start using lighter fluid and shit that adds weird taste to your food and does yeah and even if you buy that lump charcoal though those charcoal briquettes rather the charcoal briquettes there's there's something in them that makes them that shape they have to and then they they you know they they light fast yeah because there's fucking gasoline in them yeah like butt lump charcoal meaning they just take hard wood and then they burn that shit down to two you know that clunky looking lump charcoal just get that stuff and then take some newspaper and roll the newspaper up in one of those you ever use one of those little those chimneys do you know what those things are no it's a barbecue chimney it's like you pour the charcoal in this tube and at the bottom of the tube you take like pieces of paper and you crumple them up balls and then you light the balls on fire and the fire rises up from the paper to the charcoal and it lights the charcoal on fire then you dump the charcoal out into the grill and that puts a nice flavor on it too that's just a but it's again the same kind of feeling it's like wood just this wood flavor on the meat that's nice I'm salt yeah yeah yeah I'm a big fan of cooking I love it I went to this restaurant the other night to a pl I saw it on your Instagram good meat I ate a 380 day dry aged steak this guy I'm gonna get him on here he's a chef his name's Adam Perry Lang and he's the guy who runs the place and I've never even heard of someone doing something like that like you hear like dry aged steak is like 30 days yes right he's he's taken it to some weird crazy place where he's got these these stakes in his gigantic like walk-in freezer error where everything is dry aging they have certain microbes they put in the air and then they have fans so it's like it's a certain type of bacteria that they want that covers over the meat certain type of mold oh wow so it delivers this very strange taste it's not like any steak that I've ever had in my life it's very weird it's delicious that's what it looks like oh wow yeah that's 380 day dry aged steak it's you see it's he says it smells like foie gras it does it's it smells very strange it's very different yeah and I've heard about this place phenomenal and I haven't been there is this in Hollywood thank you we'll go together good man I'm ready to go man it's uh it's on vine yeah it's phenomenal but it's it's not for everybody like that float like my wife is not into it she likes regular steak she's not it's like she's like ah yeah she's it's it's a strong flavor all right it's a different fly kit doesn't taste like anything you've ever had before look it doesn't taste like venison doesn't taste like bison it doesn't taste like a ribeye that you get from Fleming's or something like that it tastes very very different I love photograph it taste like that then I'm then it's what it does but not really it smells like foie gras it's it tastes like itself it doesn't taste like anything I've ever had but it's uh you know that's when you're you're fucking geeking out hard there's a show that I binge watch on YouTube it's called the meat show I think that YouTube channels called eater and then the show is called the meat show this guy just travels around going all these different super high-end restaurants that serve steak and trying to see what their preparation is and what they do differently and you could fuck and lose your mind with that stuff yeah you could go down a deep dark hole with me yeah hey man I'm willing to try anything I'm more like experimental as far as when it comes to food my wife not so much she's very picky do you use recipes use cookbooks um I have used cookbooks in the past I do a majority of the cooking in my house I come from you know my mom used to cook a lot and and my father used to do a lot of fish so I don't do a lot of recipes it's more like dad how do you make the the muscle for the muscle sauce and then he'll you know take me through it so nothing's written down it's yeah what do you do like what do you in do you like like linguini with clams like what kind of stuff you could you know what I like I like a lot of pasta I like a nice bolognaise sauce however I'm trying to stay away from those types of meals because in the past I ballooned up to you know 205 207 not given in with a crap about my health or or anything and recently I've lost some weight due to the fact that I've been watching my diet because you know I mean I don't know I mean you're in shape so you you seem a lot more discipline than a lot of comedians when it comes to to health but for myself I have you know taking on a regimen of not drinking wine I just having like a little wine after the meal or during the meal so I've eliminated that and I've been doing some Pilates Pilates which has helped my my balance and my core underrated exercise very on I gotta tell you Joe this Pilates is really changed the way I look at physical fitness you know who's really into Pilates Sergey Kovalev really yeah he just regained the U of the WBC or WV I forget which which light heavyweight championship on Saturday night he's the crusher this is badass Russian motherfucker and he just just I mean at 35 I think he has regained his title and his routine is very unusual and one of the things that he does for his exercise is Pilates and you know people make fun of it but the guy has got strength in all these weird places yeah full range of motion and fly ability and well that's what I have I'm forty five so my range of motion my shoulders screwed up my legs my knee and this has given me an exercise where I could not only improve my flexibility but man I mean you walk I'm drenched yeah and so yeah I'm getting back on the physical fitness thing because I've been on the road so so much that I kind of let that slip a little but I want to get the I want to get it back yeah you know some guys are real good about working out on the road like Bryan Callen goes everywhere he goes he'll go to a gym he's real good at that like he'll go and go work out with kick boxers work out with jujitsu guys Bryan does a lot of boxing so he'll final like a local boxing gym and have a guy hold the pass for him maybe do even little light sparring he gets really into it on the road but I think that's the key is like to force yourself to not stay in your hotel and wait till the show goes you just gotta force yourself to get out and go do something yeah I I wish I was a self-motivated guy but I need help so I've taken my buddy John Petrelli is a personal trainer so he comes on the road with me and you know motor motivates me to well that's great to get up and go we do swimming we do a lot of different things this guy's I liken him to you because he's into mixed martial arts he's into hunting he's one of these guys that is a great motivator and really helped me get my life back together when it comes to it's a physical fitness because again I was lifting weights my everything was falling apart and now with the swimming in Pilates I feel like I have something look forward to when it comes to to working out because I to go to the gym for me wasn't fun anymore it's like what am I gonna do I SEPs and chest it's over I I do it 225 ever again yeah that's that was my workout since I was like 18 I'd go in nothing nothing changed it was 225 yes and then let's do some curls and you know neglect the ABS go home yep the legs no legs although I did have I played soccer growing up so I did have those you know those soccer legs I got like Earl Campbell thighs yeah soccer is one of the best exercises ever I mean it's also a great way to blow your ACL out totally yeah everybody's you know it's shifting left and right and all that there's a fucking picture you know big boy the the the DJ his fucking son there's a video he retweeted it his son is a football player and there's there's a video of his son where you know someone's trying to tackle him and he moves like a fucking ghost it's incredible you watch them do it like it was one one of those rare things where you see something and you're like legitimately impressed like holy shit I watched it like five times in a row this kid's footwork is incredible really yeah but footwork like that kind of likes like who's in better shape than soccer players they're constantly sprinting yeah the home game it's like you and you have to maintain that stamina you're constantly sprinting yeah there's a lot of mileage you're putting on in us in a soccer game although you know what gives me and you are probably gonna laugh as well as your listeners believe me pickleball you ever played on pickle bold pickle pickle ball it's like tennis and ping pong and you played in a gymnasium so it's like it's a net okay and it's you got paddles and talked about moving side-to-side it's it's fun and you burn a ton of calories when you do it in a gym you didn't in gym and look at like a basketball court so it's like racquetball but there's a net there's a net so not bouncing it off the wall you're you playing it like tennis yeah it's a court small net and you have what's on that like in Venice there's a little small corset listen you're gonna laugh alright there's a lot of old people that play this but I'm telling you this is embarrassing so you each have your is for people yeah you could do doubles but me and my buddy play just one on one and I'm telling you it's not that looks like it's not only fun but you you burn a lot of calories and you don't even know you're doing it because I'm diving and right it's uh it's one of the exercises that we when he's got you doing he's got you doing Pilates and pickleball what's next I have no LA he's working you know he's working towards I don't have to tell you I'll tell you I know a lot of 68 year old people play this but if you're looking for a low kind of impact fun activity no tennis is fucking hard tennis tennis another thing this is like this is like panis reduced to a smaller coin basically probably healthier for you yeah it's not as hard on the ankles and the needs to it's not as hard yeah I will have to go after we have our steak where would one go to have it of course in Venice Beach that's what I thought it was I've always seen these small tennis courts there and I know really what people were playing also they're calling it paddle tennis yeah maybe maybe this but this is what this is what it is these guys look ridiculous they should just go home this is outrageous what are you doing sir a pair you put a little English listen I grew up on ping-pong I'm really good at ping-pong really yeah so this is like a larger version of Ming pong yeah it looks like it's fun I'll bullshit aside that looks like a good time it's it's fun believe me I know your listeners are dying left and right now but I'm telling you it's it's it's it's good so that's what I'm doing show so you take your trainer with you on your lunge row that's the move where's this gourd you meet this guy I've known for 20 years and I don't mind a set of days of our lives only extra work yeah days of our lives when I first came out to LA in 1998 I was the type of guy I would do these weird like mailings to get work right so four days of our lives no it was General Hospital General Hospital take a headshot and then take a post-it note and I would write on the post no ready to operate stuck it could a headshot and I set it off so I would do these like weird little mailings where oh you know maybe the person opening the mail would get a little chuckle and whatnot so I met him doing extra work this is what I used to do for for some extra cash and we became fast friends he's an Italian kid and we similar operating middle-class he's from New York I'm from Chicago and just a great great guy he set me up with my wife I mean that's how I know my wife through him and he's been a huge huge help for me that's awesome man if you could find a guy who actually knows what he's doing and that that is so huge because they also know what you need you know they're like hey you know we need to concentrate more on your rear delts and you the issues you have with your shoulders or your mobility so we're gonna work on some band work first and warm you up and you could fuck yourself up just doing it by yourself I really could I did and you're right he knows what to work on what to loosen up mm-hmm let's not jump right into the exercise let's warm it up a little bit so yeah I credit him to kind of get me back on the health and fitness and plus we've taken our own meals that's another thing we were we pack our own meals we get like a service and we bring breakfast lunch and dinner on the road and that's our meals Wow yeah well listen I was going out having a dry-aged at midnight you know I was eating a full-blown steak asparagus and baked potato and then a show then I would go to bed yeah and was good it's delicious like it but you won't go to in that you're right that is you know sometimes I will come home from the store and I'm hungry and I'll eat late night and then I wake up almost hungover I don't like I didn't even try I ate I ate like a thousand calories at 2:30 in the morning yeah well last night my wife and I had sushi I woke up and I don't the sodium was unbelievable I was like geez from one thing as sushi I look like I need to go sweating your son is it sodium and sushi like what's it's the it's the soy sauce and that that's where at least I'm picking it up from who are all these guys showing up at our door okay just but sodium is not what would it be in the soy sauce the soy sauce green soy sauce that's like the low you know those have the low one and the high one of the two different yeah low sodium and high sodium I think last night I had the high sodium and I woke up and it wasn't good how much soy sauce are you using you know what I like when you like the soy sauce and then I like the wasabi yeah I put a clump of that in soy sauce and you mix it I mix it I make like a slurry yeah it gets it gets thick yeah so when I eat the sushi it just it burns my nose that's that's how I like it I like it that way too sometimes sushi chefs don't like it when you do that they get offended of what disrespect in the fish yeah yeah should stand alone did you ever see that movie jiro Dreams of Sushi oh is that the guy that's got that sushi joint at the in the train station yeah in Japan yeah yeah have you seen that I've seen half of it it's really weird because it changed my idea of what sushi is I used to think it's other cut and fish up they slap it on a piece of rice it's great it's good tastes good clean easy for you now I realize like this guy it's like his life's dedication to putting together the perfect tastes yeah like there was one guy that's been working on this egg plate for a year trying to perfect it trying to get it right it's in literally like a joke you know trying to make the joke so perfect I was trying to get the dish so perfect yeah I would never thought that with sushi I thought like if you said a sushi chef I'd be like uh yeah right okay like he's not really a chef it's just cutting up fish yeah but there's something about the way they're preparing these I mean yeah it's one thing if you're getting like a sashimi it's just salmon but if they're putting it together with rice and you know it's like a science yeah no it's definitely a science it's also science because they age the fish which I didn't know I didn't know that yeah I was watching this YouTube thing where these guys were going to the sushi place and they were saying that tuna they will have their tuna in the refrigerator for as long as two weeks in preparation for sushi and just like dry aged steak the aging of the tuna breaks down the the bacteria break down some of the tissue and make it softer and more delicate and change the flavor profile yeah no I had no idea I thought they caught it yeah don't you freeze fish for it to be sashimi grade is that the deal I don't know was that the case I don't let's find out what makes something sashimi grade I saw there was a guy who caught a big-ass fucking tuna and they sold it for three million dollars so I had yeah go back to that what in the fuck is that five thousand dollars a pound Japan's king of tuna is that racist racist the way I said it it seemed racist the first tuna auction of the year a Tokyo's new fish market set a record price more than three million for a giant bluefin tuna a critically endangered species yeah see that's where you gotta go man is it critically endangered and if it's if it is so should you really be cutting that fucker up yeah I don't know when I was in Hawaii we caught some yellowtail my youngest daughter loves fishing so I went out with her and we went on this boat and we were actually jigging there's like this shelf and this big drop-off and these yellow tails hang out there we caught a gang of them and one of the things they were saying was that the Big Island had a farm where they were farming yellowtail like they had this gigantic likes sort of netted in area where the fish couldn't leave and they were they were trapped in this area but then this storm came and broke down all the nets and the fish escaped and now they're everywhere and you're catching them we caught like six or seven of them and they're fucking big like ten pounds and you fighting them on like a light spinning rods like like really awesome awesome time but they were unbelievably delicious but these are non-native they brought them over there and released him like they better start doing that with other fish right like they really should set up these fish farms and just release these motherfuckers out into the ocean because they're just taking nets and pulling them across the bottom of the floor not even it's like such a there's something to be said about going out and catching the fish like you're saying rather than taking a net and just scooping everything up in its path everything turtles dolphins whatever the fuck is there everything gets jacked and the problem is you know there's who knows how many countries have boats that are doing that and they're all operating in international water and I don't know what the fucking laws are but they're just pulling what and they you know the other thing they do that's fucked up when they're done a lot of times they cut the net loose and they just leave it in the ocean they just drop the net to the bottom of the ocean it's funny they have the regulations for like hunting yeah they don't have it like in the ocean you know it's cuz nobody owns it you only own like a certain amount of your Shore like off like say from Malibu out I don't know how much they the United States owns but we only own a certain amount and then it becomes international waters international waters it's like kind of anybody could be out there mmm it's weird I mean it makes sense but there's no I don't think there's any I think if you have a boat you could just kind of go anywhere that's international water and just no regulations here what is what parts of the ocean are considered international water territorial waters or territorial seas defined by a 1982 United Nations Convention on the law of the sea it's a belt of coastal waters extending at most 12 nautical miles from the baseline usually the mean low-water mark of the coastal state so 12 miles so 12 miles out or thirteen point eight miles yeah nautical my own Oracle miles is different huh interesting why is it different how weird is that wait nautical miles are different in regular miles the fuck get it together yeah don't call it a mile then you fucks is this it imagine hey buddy I'll meet you at 12 miles all right 12 nautical miles and the guy's a mile on a point eight away from you all those stores use the label sushi-grade fish there is no official standards for using this label the only regulation is that parasitic fish such as salmon should be frozen to kill any parasites before being consumed raw the best ones are assigned grade one which is usually what we sold as sushi grade but what about sashimi grade is what he said it's the same thing you're not supposed to eat salmon raw apparently salmon is a freshwater fish and salmon know it can fuck you up but you could pull a tuna out of the right out of the ocean yeah I have a buddy of mine who win tuna fishing off of San Diego they caught a tuna and they sliced it up and ate it right there on the boat like right is they right after they pulled it out of the water that I haven't done but that that to me it would be the bus eating yes water I mean I just hope they don't wait until there's nothing left before they start doing something to save them it just doesn't doesn't seem like I mean if you're taking us fish and you you're buying it for three million dollars that's almost like a scene in a movie right that's like the end this was one of the last tuna look they bought it for 3 million everybody's smiling and they're cutting it up it's like yeah hunting regulations are critical but you could you know what the population is it's very they they did the fish and wildlife departments have all these different methods they use whether it's using reports from hunters whether it's the they fly over with airplanes and helicopters and things along those lines whatever they use they have a bunch of different ways that they can determine what the population is then they determine the population of predators how many animals are lost how many animals are shot during any hunting season and then they determine how many tags can be divvied out so like say if you live in an area there might be 500 tags available but there might be like 2,000 hunters that are applying for those tags so most people are not going to get it it's a it's a very smart way they've they've really got it down to a science and because of that there's more white-tailed deer in this country than then even when Columbus landed yeah it's they've got a really good system yeah if they could figure something out for the ocean prominent enough to get everybody to cooperate this some like they can't even get Japan to stop killing whales like there's there's certain Japanese folks who they have this really sneaky thing they do and there's this business conservation group called the Sea Shepherd's and they catch these fucking people all the time but what they basically do is they say we're a research boat and they use a research boat and go slaughter whales and then sell the whales but they pretend it's that it's research but if they kill a whale certain countries still value parts of Wales they make things with it yeah what the fuck do they make with whales I think they make some perfumes like what but people are still killing whales it's it gets weird when things are smart that's when it gets weird yeah you know some as smart as a fucking whale yeah I mean the end these in these countries they're using like you said parts of the fish for you know that they put it on their mantle they got like a I don't know a tooth yeah or what-have-you from a whale or a shark or whatever that's the big thing with rhinos sorry guys but the rhino horns off and they drink it like in a tea and supposed to make your dick hard oh it's see this is what I'm talking about you know these things mmm I mean I don't know how to hell you remember all this stuff I'm gonna I've just forgot the mileage off the coast we just 13.8 model miles 12 nautical miles difference 1.8 difference at 12 miles which is who knows how long we get to 500 miles out you got to do the math that's crazy it's stupid yeah yeah I don't know how I remember these things it's a fucking screwy brain no I wish had your memory Joe that's what I'm saying it's not the best I'm telling you it's like there's a lot of shit that I don't remember I just remember things that are interesting you know I have a it's it's an odd it's an odd sense of memory but the the rhino horn thing is kind of sad because it doesn't even work you know especially in this day and age where people can get viagra it works yeah but there's something about it I think in some Asian cultures where it's considered like a sign of wealth you drive a Rolls Royce you drink rhino tea this guy's a baller you know he doesn't give a fuck he drinks wine OD you know like oh man drinking rhino tea what a guy yeah this but there's something about that like you know yeah I want to eat an extinct animal I want to bring a woolly mammoth back to life and shoot it in the head like there's some people that are like that like they they want to be the ultimate Conqueror and you know I want to eat a whale dick you know what I mean like this there's people that are like that I'm just good looking for a nice steak generally steak are good linguine with clam sauce that place that I saw you out when I was with my kids yeah that's a sensational Italian restaurant that place is legit well that place moved yes if you've been to the knife lesson yeah so that place is excellent what's in the old spot they're redoing the whole building so I mean that think that's one of the last times I have eaten there when I saw you and your kids having a meal there yeah that place is good the pastas are fantastic as good as it gets they make the perfect linguine with clams they dislike perfect it is it just is not too soupy you know some people get crazy with the the liquid and you get it it's like it's it's almost like bathing you know in a soup and but they have it's nice it's al dente it's got some chew to it the places I've been to and they got like guys walking around they're from like Sicily yes the owners a little old man that kind of walks around and make sure everything's okay and he's speaking Italian yeah you feel like you're in you're in Italy witness I'll Pacino there see no II touch it yes I did well yes I did that's crazy you know I also that saw their shannen doherty remember her oh no no the original bad girl yeah there's a lot of celebrities up up and then saw jay-z and Beyonce come into the back door yeah there's like a strap there's a tunnel under the ground put the celebrities in pop him up through so um what was it like doing Madison Square Garden you did four shows in the Austin Square Garden he did it in the round yeah so how many shows he done the round before leading up to then I'd say probably 15 16 also you've done quite a few in the round yeah if you like it um it's a different animal and my act is very physical and expressive so it kind of works for that type of environment although you have to listen there's a screen above you so people are watching screens yeah when they go to shows anyway but the challenge to do it in the round is to hit those people within the first five rows that maybe can't see the screen because once you go to the other side of the stage you got your back to them and it's it's kind of difficult yeah yeah that's so crazy that's 18,000 people yeah that's fucking bananas dude so yeah it's been for New York New York for me has been really really good to me over the years obviously I'm Italian and there's a lot of Italians in the New York City area but what I think has happened is I'm talking about like family and I'm talking about like the immigrant experience my father being an immigrant from Sicily and what I'm seeing at my shows is not only an 88 year old grandmother but a 12 year old kid and kind of everybody in between Wow so it's very broad its comedy and I'm not Tooting my own horn here I'm just saying it's comedy that you could come and not cringe because the material might be a little blue or what have you and Joey Diaz Joey Diaz open for you and mascara what shocked so yeah I mean that's why I think I was able to do four shows at Madison Square Garden just because my audience is a large swath of multi-generational it's more of a generational just a lot of different people at the shows and to do Madison Square Garden for me as we were talking prior to getting on here I was saying that I think I took a little too much on my plate and what I mean by that is coming up in comedy I used to say yes to everything the phone used to ring and it was my agent you want to do yeah put me down I'm in what you're trying to work yeah trying to work and what has happened once you get too busy I think you need to learn to you know press the brakes a little bit so I did a ton of press when I was in New York and I had family there I had friends there and I think I read myself a little too thin so when the shows came I don't feel like I was operating at an optimal level to to perform yeah it was fun I I still had a good time but you know the more and more I just stand up the more and more I feel like you really gotta be clear-headed in the moment and you can't you can't overwork yourself it's just who I am I've always been a worker I mean when I wasn't going to college and I had time off in the summer I was working when I used to work summers as a janitor during high school so all the time was always occupied with work and I feel if I'm not working I feel like or I'm not doing press or I'm not doing anything I feel like you're slacking yeah I feel like because my father has always put in my head you know what do you what do you you know we doing like he'd come home and go would you do today yeah it was like all right you know you're gonna paint the fence this this weekend I'm gonna paint the fence so there was always something to do right and that work ethic has bled into my career and now that I've had some success in my career I think I'm have to kind of pull it back a little bit and not say yes to an interview that maybe it's not gonna help but he's gonna take up a lot of your time yes yeah exactly yeah no I'm in the same boat and I mean I think sometimes even I do too many podcasts I think but there's a lot of fucking people I want to talk to so it's hard but I think I've definitely stopped doing interviews and all those different things for that reason it's just there's only certain amount of time you have and you know like you I have a family like you I exercise and I have a lot of hobbies man between archery and martial arts and and reading and just watching documentaries and you know it's is it gonna help like I don't want to be any more famous you know we were talking about this earlier I don't it's good I'm working it's all I want to do what I want to do now is do my best work yeah that's my number one objective whether it's standup whether it's UFC commentary whether it's doing a podcast I want to do my best work and I don't think that I can do my best work if I'm scattered and I often am I think you put hit a nail and I had doing your best work whatever you're doing so yeah if you're gonna come in here today and do a podcast whatever you did prior to this cannot really take away from the energy that you need to do this same thing with the MMA and then that announcing and the same thing with the stand-up comedy I feel that sometimes I jeopardize myself and I take on too much and I've realized that and I'm going to kind of because then I got a FAQ another baby coming so resolution thank you families growing and you know I come home and I'm looking at my daughter she's 20 months and I mean those moments for me are like do do I want to like take my daughter out for lunch or do I want to do an interview in Idaho right you know I know you gotta sell tickets that's part of the game but I think I need to kind of just choose my my my roads a little careful well that's one of the good things about social media is that it allows you these paths to distribute you know like fliers and you put little poster zuv where your gonna be and stuff like that and it can reach your actual fans as opposed to just you know random person who's listening to the radio or random person who picks up the newspaper so that's that's what I think that but but I like to reach the person that doesn't know who I am it's fun to go to your fan base but you know I'm sure a lot of the people that listen to your podcast maybe not know who I am and it's a joy for me to to get someone who is this guy maybe check them out and to get a new fan opposed to maybe feeding the fan base I currently have I'm always looking for new people to come on board with what I'm doing so you know when I do a radio show in Peoria at 7 o'clock in the morning I'm hoping someone's in their car going check him out yeah yeah and even if it was two people that bought the ticket for me I would think that it was worth it getting up to get to more fans right sometimes though it's it's it hurts the end product and the reason why I'm I'm here is the stand-up comedy right if that starts to slack then everything else falls apart yeah I feel the same way and I've learned over the years what the what the mistakes are like where I can screw it up like podcast for instance I don't do like I used to do like a hot yoga class at 10:30 it gets out at noon I do a podcast at 1:00 I can't I don't do that anymore because I found I was just too fucking worn out yeah because I do a 90 minute yoga class and I'm I come in here and I'm still like oh yeah what what do you are we talking about like I'm still Spacey I need two hours I need two hours and I need to drink a shitload of water and then I'm good to go but I need that extra hour so now I'll do like an 8:30 class or something like that or maybe even a six in the morning class and so when I have a 1:00 p.m. podcast I'm fucking completely acclimated yeah but I had to do that by trial and error absolutely and that's where I'm at I think I'm trying to figure out what what the balance is of creating a life outside of stand-up and then giving all I can to stand up and and even I I do a podcast with Pete Korey Ali that we did a live podcast for the first time and I don't know if you're seeing this the podcast listener is a different audience than what's arriving at my shows to different audiences there's a there's a there's a definite podcast listener out there I mean people that listen and consume podcasts and it crosses over don't get me wrong but I I I want to do the podcast in Orlando and totally different totally different vibe it's nice to see who the hell is listening to this stuff yeah we did it and I don't know if you've ever done a live cast but I'm sure you're yeah McCann anomaly I you got like fans from all different walks of life I mean you're in the stand-up world you're in the mixed martial arts world you're in the podcast world so it must be a lot of different people coming to your shows no there's a lot of weirdos yeah if you see a dude with shaved head and tattoos and he's kind of jacked he probably knows who I am but it's like a lot of people that are into the science podcasts or the you know podcast with interesting intellectuals there's like a lot of yeah but this is people that don't like the mixed martial arts stuff and they they like me for other things you know it's it's hard you know you can't please everybody you know you can't it's not really possible and then along the way you find that out and you piss a bunch of people off you know they're like you know I don't like that part of you like okay I don't know tell you yeah you can't make everybody know but especially if you do a lot of shit you know but I'm lucky with the job with the UFC that they don't really care about the other things that I do because if I was working for more sensitive organization you know obviously it's a fucking Cagefighting promotion it's like how sensitive can you get yeah but with some social issues you know this like if I was working for the NBA I probably been fired a decade ago the MMA is definitely a where the UFC is definitely an animal in itself how did how did you get into that position did you know the Dana White and you started for you I always wanted to ask you this and at the Comedy Store how did you become kind of the voice of of the UFC well I started in 1997 I was the post-fight interviewer that was it was just a position that was available and the UFC was very small back then very few people knew what it was it was off a cable you couldn't get it on cable you could only get it on satellite and they needed someone to do post-fight interviews so you were in that world to begin with I was in the martial arts world you know I used to teach martial arts for a living before I became a comedian I used to fight fought a lot of Taekwondo tournaments and had some kick boxing fights and I'd always been a martial artist since I was a kid and so I just was interested in watching the UFC and then I started training in jiu-jitsu and when I was training in jiu-jitsu I was just a white belt it was just starting out that's when I got hired by the UFC to be a post-fight interviewer but I only did that for two years and then I quit it was just too much and it was actually like it was I was losing money I would make more money doing a weekend at a comedy club than I would doing it doing the UFC and it just got to a point was just it was too much of a pain in the ass and so I still remained a fan but I backed away and then the UFC was purchased by this company called Zuffa in 2001 and when that happened they started putting on shows in Vegas and I would go there with my friends they got me free tickets they reached out and they would try to get celebrities to go sit there so that it would they would because they were very small-time they were trying to were hemorrhaging money they were trying to build it up and in talking to Dana White one day you know I was talking to him about fights going on in Japan I'm like have you ever seen Sato fight do you know what what do you do you know soccer odd you know this guy I was bringing all these names and he was like do you want to do commentary I'm like I don't want to do commentary man I'm here to get drunk and watch people kick the shit out of each other I'm not here to work and he talked me into it for one show UFC thirty seven and a half it was a show that was on one of those Fox Sports network's smaller networks and I think was the best damn sports show period was a part of it I did that and the rest is history well and then I did like twelve of them for free like the UFC didn't have any money well they were hemorrhaging money then they had there were rich people that owned it but it was not a profitable venture yeah and I said look just get me there get me my friends tickets and I'll do it and so that's how I operated for like like over a year and then I just became the commentator it's just weird that's crazy it's just Dana White he's a crazy man and he's uh he's got a you know a weird way of looking at things that that's very effective and in in his crazy mind he's like let's take this guy who's never even thought about being a commentator and make him our commentator I mean I didn't know what the fuck I was doing I mean I really didn't I didn't have any training at all in sports commentary I just would see what was happening and start talking about it you know which is really like the wrong I was more even play-by-play and color it was like doing both of them at the same time was really weird and as far as you doing that do you get any notes from anybody going hey Joe try this try dad or you just develop that whole that voice all on your own 100% of my own so the only thing that I had was there's like Mark delicata who's a good friend of mine he is he's a one of the top trainers in the world he's in the truck and I can communicate with him there's a button where I can communicate with him and we talk about stuff like I can say does he look like he's limping to you and he's like yeah there's something wrong with his leg I go the left leg right he's like yeah yeah and then I'll start talking about it like I'll be able to bounce it down or sometimes I just it's obvious and I'll say it myself and I'll I'll ask him like am i wrong is he dropping his hand or is is this is it like is it nice it's a nice thing to have someone to bounce things off it used to be Eddie Brown Eddie Bravo used to do it as well where I would be able to talk to him about certain positions because he would be in the truck and I'd be able to ask him like his left legs in jeopardy right now right or he needs to step over with his right leg we'd be able to go over because like there's some aspects of martial arts that are extremely technical especially jujitsu when things go to the ground and you're trying to commentary do commentary and I have to decipher which is his left leg which is his right leg where is he tied up where is he tangled and I'm doing in real time while I'm trying to be entertaining and talking very complicated mm-hmm you know but nobody taught me how to do it I just figured out how to do it and you're not looking at like a Jim Lampley or anybody in the broadcasting world when it comes to fights of or this is something that you developed on your own like sometimes you look as a comedian you look at other comedians say the Friars or yeah Ireland's or whatnot do you didn't have kind of like a mentor no not necessarily because there wasn't one there wasn't a lot of guys that did it in in for martial arts commentary there was John Peretti who was excellent he was one of the very best who was actually the UFC matchmaker and a commentator when I first started he was very good there's a guy named Jeff Armstrong he was very good - he was there when I first started - he actually ran a promotion called hook and shoot he's excellent he really knows what he's doing and then there's a few other guys you know that also did it but there's like what I do as far as like stand doing commentary for MMA this might may be ten guys in the world that do it yeah you know don't really do it on there's a high level maybe ten guys well I mean between one Fc between you know brave and then the UFC Bellator pfl there's maybe maybe ten guys on the planet that are doing it which is not a lot of people know and there's a lot in the UFC now where fighters are now transitioning to become commentators and oftentimes they're the best at it like Michael Bisping just did this past weekend he was the UFC middleweight champion and he's awesome at it already did one one show they know more obviously because they've been in there you know they have that added element of actually having fought the UFC which is gigantic yeah I could see I think Paulie Malignaggi yeah yeah yeah he seems to be very very fantastic he's very good he's very good very technical but also very aware and fighters can see things that maybe the average person can't see like they see when someone's slowing down they see when someone's laying back they see when someone got hurt to the body they see like little things that maybe a person who's never fought before it doesn't see yeah the knowledge is key and plus the the excitement level to I mean when when someone gets hit for the announcer to like react to that in a real way for for an audience member it's like you know you it's it's exciting ya know that's what's up yeah like when so if someone's boring and bland and they don't really care what's going on the audience feels it and they feel it when you're faking it too yeah if you try to pump it up and fake it do you have any other hobbies outside of comedy and um I'm not a big hobby guy growing up my parents always used to say what are you interested in do anything so they gotta be happy now look II worked out my how he is stand-up comedy really I mean I like to cook don't get me wrong I like to travel my wife and I really really enjoy going to different places and I love hotels it's I mean and these aren't really hobbies it's just I like hospitality so that's my that's my passion I like having people over at the house and making them feel good that's that's what I like to do I like to entertain if I find out you like a specific drink or you like something that's you know I take I take notice of what people like so when you come to my house I got what you like there that's very tallien it's very very Italian and I've always had I know I work for the Four Seasons Hotel and that chain taught me to anticipate people's needs so anytime I have anything at my house whether it be a birthday party get-together if it's gonna be a fight I make sure when that you come over you are taking care of not only with your alcohol needs here's one I mean a pot guy right I don't know smoke pot you want start listen but I got pot at the house just in case you want some really so I thought you know you have alcohol you have beer right you have scotch you have wine right so what if what if someone doesn't have a taste for alcohol and they want to joint Wow I got a couple of joints will you get it from PDC from the Comedy Store I think I got it from you know from though I think it's the what's the med med men yeah yeah I went in there you went in there specifically just for hospitality hospitality if you came over and I go Joe you want to join and you're like yeah you want smoke it no I don't smoke but you know there have at it just to have even a cigar I got two cigar smoke cigars you want one I don't know I get a I get joy in making others happy so when you looked at your house did you look at your house and go this is a good house to entertain in mm-hmm uh yeah so we see that like when you see like a YouTube video on a home and they're showing also a wonderful entertainers home or entertainers home that's what I think what does that mean a singer guys playing piano what does that mean I like I like a living room that bleeds into the kitchen alright that's that's I like that right right there's not really a wall and be - yeah - it's got to be and then I like indoor outdoor you live in California I liked it yeah outside maybe you want to have a drink outside and bring it back in yes it's like the different that's what they let's what they're talking about when it's an inert I like a fire out saying oh that pit fire pit do you try to bring people like if you have a party to try to bring people over that you think would have interesting conversations yes although we have a problem at this particular point we're in a transition period we have a child so I don't know if you went through this but a lot of sometimes when you're coming from a single couple but a couple with no kids and now you have kids now you're you're finding other people who have kids Yeah right so that's what we're in we're we're not yet into the preschool so we're kind of in limbo we're looking for new friends right that our old friends are are bad it's just now we have other obligations we have a child we can we maybe can't go out at the dinner at eight o'clock at night only like we used to know now we're looking to bring it to the house yeah no I know exactly what you're saying we went through that exact same transition and a lot of times you pick up some dead weight along the way the only thing they have in common is the kids of the same age and then you have to talk to some fucking guy oh they give you ear beatings about their job just like you just some people just not interesting it's unfortunate yeah I mean you do run into that where you meet a guy like I went to a toddler group last week no some sometimes I do this obviously because I want to hang out with my daughter but sometimes the material that comes out of going to something like that is gold yeah now it's me 15 women and a gay guy at this toddler group right so I mean it's just like it's almost rioting it's like writes itself yeah although I'm in a circle sitting indian-style the hell I mean it it's strange but man it's that that's the things I want to do because I feel if I live more of my life I could draw so much more humor from it or it it's a it's it's it's two-pronged it's I want to hang out with my family and I want to I don't want to talk to people who are living these life experiences because what I've noticed is I want to keep the same kind of lifestyle I've had when I wasn't successful because I feel alone you start detaching yourself from the daily routine let's say even going to target if you have somebody go to target for you you know you miss out on like what happens on a day to day and I want to still keep that rich in and and available to me that's very wise of you that's very true that is something that happens when people become more and more famous especially they become more reluctant to go places like they just they don't want to just go to the mall you know like sometimes just got to go to the mall yeah it's good it's good it's around weirdos it's good well I think it was you yeah it was you saying that like if you were out at a restaurant and somebody comes up to you and asked for a picture because everybody wants a picture nowadays to prove they met Joe Rogan and then what what have you and sometimes it's a little intrusive when you're having dinner with your daughters or your family and then it's like you know I've had people ask me for pictures while my daughters on my lap and I'm feeding her yeah I had man you can't see the promise you take that picture with that guy and then someone says I want a picture too and then you get 10 people to get up and it sounds braggy but it's not it's just it's a weird thing that happens with people's phones half those people don't even give a fuck about you they really just want to take a picture with someone that they saw you know on fear factor or whatever and they just oh there he is let me take a picture with them and they've come over to your table and they seem to think that it's part of the job that you have to be every time you're in public you have to be available to them it's very weird like rule that people have decide some fairly ignorant people have decided so that's why they would think that even with my daughter on my lap and I'm literally this is I was literally putting food into her mouth and a guy was like hey man can I get a picture like this is this is not a good time yeah it's not a good this is not a smart thing to ask and it's why people certain people are reluctant to go out in the first place what they're reluctant to go on public but do you feel an obligation to at all to your fan base to make yourself available to them if if I'm not with my kids yeah yeah so do you generally turn down any photos or autographs it has to be an extenuating circumstance for me to say no if there has to be something wrong like if someone you know if someone is somewhere where they're not supposed to be you know like like I had a guy come backstage at the Comedy Store with me made it backstage all the way to the back and he's talking and and and I'm like yeah I was last the other comments you know this guy do you know whose guy I go who are you man and he's like oh I'm friends with this guy I go see just walk back here I'm like you gotta get the fuck out of here let's get out of here man and then the security comes and kicks the guy I'm like what is happening here like there's no security here like doc I didn't ask for a photo but if he did I probably I probably take a picture with that motherfucker I got a picture with them out there yeah this you know it's if you're in a rush if you're trying to go somewhere and you're literally running and someone wants to pull their phone out like sometimes you can't become most of time if I'm by myself I'm very approachable yeah it's just family stuff it's just like my kids don't like it like especially my youngest art she does not like it she gets angry she squeezes my hand cuz people ignore her and they just start talking to me and she's just standing there and eight-year-olds have zero patience mm-hm she's sitting there going boring she doesn't give a fuck if they know me like to her I'm just dad yeah you know it doesn't matter if I'm famous it doesn't mean anything to her what means to her is like when she's with me she likes attention she wants me to talk to her we have a nice little relationship yeah I love having little people it's fun it's like it's it's uh it's for people that are single and I think it all depends on where you are in life and you know how reflective you are about it for people that are single they look at it and I know I did they look at that as a potential burden because when I was a kid I thought of myself as a burden so I think of other children as a burden but then you have them yourself in this the love that you for them is indescribable crazy feeling that you didn't didn't even know was in the menu before and then all sudden you have this crazy feeling to this little person it's your favorite thing to do yeah it is amazing and then to echo those thoughts I wasn't a big kid guy I was like I don't really need kids know this but then you have them and you're like man what I'm missing this would be if you go through life and you don't have a child and and I'm just I'm not saying you need to have a child to be complete but for me man it's been it's been fantastic and you know having a baby boy now coming on the way is you know it's great I mean it's not a burden it's it's just adds to your life yeah it's it's its responsibility it's so overwhelming response yeah I mean it's not about you it's about them and you know you have to have a sense of I don't know he you got to give them the time they need in order for them to succeed in in life and you know my parents gave me gave me a lot of attention I mean my dad was the type of guy that was not really around because he was working and my mom was kind of managing the house but over the course of time my father and I become best friends I mean you know he's he's a huge critic of what I do for a living I don't know if you have parents that are heavily involved in your career but man my father he's it comes to the comes to the it's taken notes at the show so he's one of these guys he'll tell me if I suck I mean it's good it keeps me level-headed you know I have a family that is very very honest and they know it's lunches and you know people confuse that with being cruel what honesty yeah yeah I listen my father and our my relationship with my father has been and I had a towel and I said dad you know just could he come to just be a fan and not like a father just enjoy the show you know after you know critique it which you know he has backed off but I know deep down he's dying to tell me dying I mean I know when I do something on TV and if you don't like say nothing about it he don't like it you know let's say if let's say if you listen to this interview and then we talk and he doesn't bring it up I know he's gonna say you sucked it's no good boring boring well shut it off why people want to listen to you you know like yeah give it to me but that's also why you're so funny because you grew up with that that's part of the whole program totally totally I mean I think that's a huge reason why I am the way I am because I'm kind of honest when I'm talking about comedy on stage the honesty is to me that the the funny the funniest stuff I got is just the truth and if you don't speak the truth then I don't think it's particularly funny at least in my life but yeah to come from that yeah my sister my my wife you know they'll tell me yeah yeah my wife will tell me too my wife is fucking funny she's hilarious she says ridiculous shit all the time and she's getting good at it like she likes to make me laugh so like she'll point at some to look at this motherfucker and like then we'll both start cracking up that's huge to and she'll tell me like if he seemed a little off tonight like yeah yes new shits especially when I have new material Matt's slippery you know new materials like know something's there but and the only thing that makes it better is trial and error that's the only thing that makes it better it's the only thing just fucking constantly doing sex you know I know you're at the store all the time are you working other clubs as well around no I just like to some motherland just that stage in the original original room for whatever reason I feel the most comfortable and the most creative yeah I'm not saying I won't do the ice house so stuff like that but it's it's it's easy it's it's kind of near where I live I bounced in I bounced out and I like I like doing it there and I used to bring my wife there when we didn't have a baby and my wife I think and I don't know if your wife has do you think your humor has like bled into your your wife's because my wife yeah looking at the world completely different like a comic yeah my wife started comedy yeah she thinks like a comic yeah so definitely if you around comics all the time you think like comics like when comics come over the house she's always fucking with them it's hilarious she'll start poking farting them and she gets a kick out of it and when she's with her friends she's absolutely the one who's always talking shit and making making people laugh that's funny yeah it's uh it's the most fun group of people to be around when we're all at the store when we all see each other I mean that's one of the things that makes me feel so fortunate is that I have so many friends that are hilarious like when I go there I see these guys and I know that we're gonna we're gonna have some fun we're gonna we're gonna do sets but we're also gonna hang out in that back bar and talk shit and laugh a lot it just it's a great friendly environment you know to it and I like to laugh I love to laugh so when I go to the comedy store I don't really if I'm around comedians I don't say much cuz I I'd rather sit back and enjoy what's happening in front of me that he actually be a part of it because for me you know I make people laugh all the time and to be around five or six comedians in the parking lot of the Comedy Store and watched whatever you go off on a tangent or cat Kalen start you know doing his thing I just sit back and enjoy it I don't like to speak around I like to go when I'm in the main room I like to go into the to the bar and sit in the back and watch the show sometimes too when I know I'm not going up at all that night in that room I like I like to do I like to be an audience member I still really enjoy that I still really enjoy just sit in the back with a drink and just laugh and it's great it's a great thing to be a part of it was fucking murdering it these days Neal Brennan Neal Brennan is on fire right now he's on fire he's doing really really well I think that's special on Netflix the three mics has really opened himself up to performing in front of large audiences and he's always been a real funny cat you know yes always been real funny but he's in a new zone right now we were I was watching him the other night in the o.r I was sitting in the back my god damn this new stuff is good really here that's just such a fucking it's such a great hot spot there's so much good comedy going on in that place with Santino Santino has been murdering lately Hinch cliffs been killing it there's just so many good comics there it's like just you feel like you it's it's fuel its inspiration oh yeah you walk in and see some guy going up and you're like man that's that's some funny stuff and you feel inspired to go and go yeah well I'm gonna I'm gonna write something new or what have you it's nice this is a nice community to be a part of that Comedy Store it's really helped me over the last 20 years yeah it's it's very unique you know and I showed you that painting that a tailor made mm-hmm I posted up on Instagram that's the painting of Mitzi I think I'm gonna put that motherfucker right there that's nice I've met you watch over us yeah this this whole thing you got going on here and I don't know if you talked about it much I don't know if you're private about it but even even being here in this studio is inspiring when I when you were showing me what you have and whatnot I'm like man see I don't I don't I've always looked at people who have things or it whether it be if you have a nice home or a nice car or whatever it is a nice family I always inspire to do that I don't begrudge anybody that has a lot I've always looked at it as I wanna be where that person is approach to you know it's being a bitter bitter yeah that's very healthy yeah III mean man just just having having a treadmill whatever whatever it is the treadmill you showed man that's that's not I want to get something like that I mean I just just always looked I want to be around people who you know are inspiring yeah me too yeah I mean that's one of the best things about this podcast I get a chance to talk to really interesting people an aqua all walks of life and you know it's weird all the worlds mixed together but all those interesting inspirational people it's definitely made me more aware and smarter 100% made me more aware of things made me reconsider my positions on things made me like like we talked about David Goggins I mean I just think about that guy and I want to work out harder dude there's a part in a book I think he went to support his mother or sister in a race and then in Las Vegas and then I think he just took off and left like he wasn't he was there for them isn't it there's an inner part where he just like he was in dress shoes and he he's just started running that's that's him man I was like he's a man and savage he said legit and what's great about him one of my favorite parts about David Goggins is that he's real honest about who used to be that he was like 300 pounds and fat lazy and drinking milkshakes and he just was depressed and couldn't get his shit together and then he hardened himself up through some strange force of will yeah and became that guy decided he wanted to become that guy who was as he puts it uncommon amongst uncommon men you know that he just decided I'm going to be the motherfucker from other fuckers and then he's so much like that when people around him like oh Jesus because he's so fucking intense like you got to ramp it up to like I'm not ready for Coggins right now I was gonna do 20 sit-ups and 20 chin-ups and 20 push-ups and I was gonna go home this motherfucker wants a run till we die yeah you know but that's those people I don't know how many people Goggins has inspired that listen to this podcast and all sudden they're out there hustling and they're out there doing things on a level that they never did before and they're putting in that work and exerting themselves in that way you know and he rubs some people the wrong way because of that because he's so aggressive and intense some people are just reluctant to be inspired by a guy like that yeah they're almost like it's too much I'm always been there he's been he's been there you know he's been in the in the basement of life you know I mean 300 pounds and really come from you know the father was and he willed himself out of it so I mean if he could do it you know why can't I run another mile and a half yeah there's a video that I listened to from my friend Jocko Jocko willing who was a Navy SEAL commander and he's got this video and it just says it's just it's it's I think it's called good because it's how he looks at everything oh you hurt your ankle good more time to work on other things you know you didn't get to promotion good good everything's good everything good that's like how he looks at things Wow and I've been like running hills halfway fucking dead exhausted camp breeds like Oh your lungs are on fire good you got an opportunity to get better shape like good keep pushing this is what it's all about good this is an opportunity to to face the intensity of this moment you got played that play that video play that video just a just a freak Sebastian now cuz this is something I listen to this like one of my guys that work for me every three or four months call me up or pull me aside which are major problems some issue that was going on and he tape off so we got this and that and the other thing and I look at him I'd say good and finally one day he was telling me about some issue that he was having some problem and he said I already know what you're gonna say I said well what am I gonna say he said you're gonna say good he said that's what you always say when something is wrong and going bad you always just look at me and say good and I said well yeah when things are going bad there's gonna be some good that's gonna come from it didn't get the new high speed gear we wanted good didn't get promoted [Music] Oh mission got cancelled good we can focus on the other one didn't get funded didn't get the job you wanted got injured sprained my ankle got tapped out good got be unexpected problems we have the output to figure out a solution that's it when things are going bad don't get all bummed out don't get startled don't get frustrated if you can say the word good guess what the meet you're still alive they means you're still breathing and if you're still breathing or now you still got some fight left so get up Dustoff reload recalibrate re-engage go out on the attack come on don't you mind just go run through a fucking wall right now hey Joe good good I think of that all the time that's a legit thing that bounces around in my head when I'm tired when something's wrong in my life I think good good don't be a bitch look at this the right way look at this right way you're gonna have the things are gonna go wrong yeah you always do if they don't you're not trying anything unusual you're not doing anything difficult you're not stretching yourself out yeah I like looking at videos like that and being introduced to guys like that I mean that's how I got introduced to Goggins someone played a video of him dr. Eric Thomas was a motivational speaker who loved listening to I love listening to people who get me motive I need that yeah jock who's got a great podcast - that guy's a Navy SEAL yeah he's a motherfucker he's uh he's a very interesting cat extremely intelligent but just as manly as they come you know and just fucking owns it and you you you know you see that guy talk one of the reason why that's so inspirational is because that's really him you go to his Instagram every day there's a photograph of his watch at 4:30 in the morning because that's when he gets up to train the trains by himself and it'll take a photo of the puddle that's on the ground after he's done and then he earns the sunrise so he gets up and he goes to the fucking beach and he sees his son come up after he's done training he's a savage that's a real savage these guys that get up at 4:00 or 4:30 in the morning and I'm like what happened taking a nap he'll take a nap later but the point is he makes himself it's nothing wrong with taking a nap and all but this is that occasion I get his whole fucking instagrams pictures of his watch he's a fuck and mall but he's really doing it till he's a Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt like a very high level black belt he's tapped some world-class competitors and fucking great guy - cool yeah he was a guest on Tim Ferriss podcast that's how I heard about him then I had him on mine and me and Tim both convinced him to do his own podcast I was hugely popular got a great book out what is it extreme ownership yeah he's fantastic I'll definitely look at him yeah people like that are so important because they give you this stuff just that little push that changed the frequency of your brain and make you gets you fired up but you can accomplish a lot of things because of people like that and there's there's extra gears to be had extra horsepower to be put to things totally good good so now that you've done you know for sold-out shows in Madison Square Garden I mean this is the fucking pinnacle of any stand-up conference career there's only a handful of comics that have ever been able to do that there's like dice louis c.k there's a few others i mean it's a you're in a rare place do you have other goals or are you just just working on maintaining and and continue to put on good shows for your fans that's been the goal I I'm not a gold guy I don't I don't say hey this is my goals this year I never planned on doing Madison Square Garden my only goal when I got into this business was to do it for a living I want to do stand-up comedy for a living and now wherever it takes me it takes me it took me to the garden I'm not looking at my vision board and going doing the Vatican next it's believing the secret wherever this takes me it takes me you know to do the Madison Square Garden was was fabulous it was a great experience nothing nothing quite like the rush of going out in front of 18,000 people in the round and you know having your family witness it my mother when she walked into the arena started crying you know she was there when I was imagining her you gave birth to this little tiny baby yeah and this little tiny baby is got four sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden it hit her it hit her heart and you know must've hit you too to see it hit her oh man I was listen I'm an emotional guy so to see my I brought my little baby and Lana on stage for a photo at the end of it I brought my father on stage I brought my mother and my sister on stage to kind of like share in that moment so yeah when my mother walked in an empty arena and saw it you know she had flashbacks to in 1998 when I did say knees and we had to get you know friends and family there to fill the audience and then now she walks in and her son's doing four of these you know it was it was a great I'm so glad my parents were alive to see that it would be a shame if if they weren't there because they've been on this journey from the beginning these are parents who when I told them in 1996 that I was going to go out to Los Angeles to pursue a stand-up career didn't look at me and go do you not still looked at me and go hey you know what if you think you got what it takes get the hell out there don't put yourself a time limit no some people say if I don't do it in five years I'm gonna quit or whatever so when I came out here was all in you know if I said five years I wouldn't have been here I would have been back in Chicago working at Motorola who knows yeah so I family has always been really really key to my success having people were very supportive and my wife who's a huge huge reason I am doing what I'm doing I mean you you know to have a wife to deal with the life of a comedian on the road away from home a lot and you got to add like a strong strong woman to be in your corner and to put up with that also just to deal with the weirdo a fucking comics a weird person yeah I mean just just the mentality of a comedian is is tough to be around not tough it's just you know we're always we're always you know in our own head sometime so yeah so to answer your question where do I go from here I don't know I'm enjoying doing some movies I just got started dip in my tone to some of these movies the Green Book which is out now and nominated for some awards for the Oscars happy to be a part of that and then I like it exercising a different muscle when it comes to acting but not comedic acting I like the dramas mmm how come I'm a serious guy generally speaking I'm not a goofball I'm not the guy always the center of attention it's just not who I am so I like kind of being serious and and and and acting in a Drama kind of place to kind of Who I am it's kind of a serious guy and I like it I get my fix from doing a stand-up on stage I don't need to do it in a movie so I like the challenge number one and number two I just like to do different different things a little bit outside the box so I like I'd like to I mean did this gangster movie coming out with Scorsese and no shit yes what is that it's called to work with Scorsese yes so called the Irish Irishman what is it about it's about basically Jimmy Hoffa and how how they killed them this is this guy I ride the narrow plays the Irishman Jimmy Hoffa's played by Pacino Pesci's in the movie so and I played crazy Joe Gallo and my first and the scent was with De Niro and Pesci so what the fuck was that lie yeah so um I was shitting I mean there's nothing who is that on the left but you know get the fuck out of here Wow that's incredible I mean maybe it's just that photograph but it that barely looks like I know I know that this is coming out on Netflix that's crazy yeah how different he looks wow that's a Netflix movie huh yeah fucking Netflix huh yeah it's like a hundred forty five million dollar project and now he is us they it's coming out on October 2 what is it like to just be around Scorsese on a movie set and realize you're a fucking actor in a Scorsese movie that's gotta be I mean that is about as high level as his but it's like either Francis Ford Coppola Scorsese there's like a few people that if you're on a set with them you know Kubrick when he was alive like holy shit that was a holy shit moment for me I was out listen I am by no stretch of the imagination a seasoned actor and then to get thrown into this group of people and working with them I mean I gotta tell you there was a sense of doubt like you know sometimes I should I be here you know is this is this happening and then you know to do the scene with the narrow and Pesci it was almost like after the first scene I'm like oh yeah I should be here it's all the anticipation leading up to the moment that is unfamiliar to you then once you do it you feel like man I that was all in my head and I made it sound like it was going to be you know because I was thinking the negative too I always think oh I'm gonna screw this up and that's that's what motivates me I never look in the positive always come from a negative place but once once I did that first scene with them and they were it these guys were more than helpful working with them Scorsese when he came out it was friendly nice you know it was it was encouraging to be around that kind of positive energy did you have a hard time sleeping the night before oh yeah I didn't sleep I don't think for the first week leading up to the scene because I knew it was gonna be with De Niro and Pesci was like they took Gotham comedy club in New York City and they made it the Copacabana which I thought was fitting because Gotham comedy club is kind of where I did all my stand-up in New York I didn't really do any other club but Gotham and then here great Club great club Mazzilli brothers who run it all of those tasks that guys and they stay transform the the Gotham comedy club into the Copacabana and Don Rickles is played by Jim Norton oh sure oh I'm watching I'm watching him on stage with mushy and it's like I'm no it's a perfect Rickles I'm just thinking about that he's perfect for that you really did a fantastic job really really I mean even a smile is almost like Rickles esque yeah they gave him oh that's fantastic casting Wow I mean come on who the fuck else would be better yeah get him fat did they fatten him up fatten him up did he give a make up to fatten up but they make him eat they made him I think they made him bald and they gave him a fat suit no shit Wow so that's amazing I mean the Jim Norns a guy known for what over 20 years and now I'm sitting there watching him as Don Rickles in a movie it was just blowing my mind just blowing my mind but this thing is going to be I can't wait to see it I didn't see any of the movie even when I was doing it I'm even look at what I was doing so uh I'm really excited to see what this thing looks like god damn that's phenomenal what a milestone a movie with De Niro Al Pacino Joe George has she a fucking Scorsese film Harvey Keitel's oh holy shit Bobby kind of always in it there's at Harvey Keitel a lot of people never saw the bad lieutenant you ever seen the matter lieutenant I've never seen oh my god look Harvey Keitel has been amazing and virtually everything he's ever done but the Bad Lieutenant is one of those movies that's so fucked up and so crazy it was a about bad cop like I'll fucking really bad okay and like completely totally out of control but it is one of those movies where after it's over you know the credits roll and you just sitting there trying to catch your breath just calling Jesus Christ with a fuck that I just watch there's a 80s ah I don't know Jackie was it says 93 but they remade it with Nicolas Cage a couple years ago get the fuck no it's not the same no no I love Nicolas Cage but no you stick to driving that Eleanor Mustang and gone in 60 seconds you can't be bad lieutenant you son of a bitch nothing you're not a great actor but look it's just there's certain guys that take over a role and to do that again like here's one like say if they offered you taxi driver they say hey we're gonna do taxi driver again you'd have to be like yeah good luck casting somebody else get that fuck away from me right okay you can't be you can't be De Niro in taxi driver unless you're De Niro like possible that movie Cape Fear another one he nailed it's but by the way Cape Fear was I think someone else was that character before I think Robert Mitchum I think played the same role that De Niro played but I didn't know that when I saw it when I saw it I just thought it's fucking DeNiro 1962 there it is yeah but if they tried to do it today like get the fuck out of here no no no no no no no you can't especially taxi drive now you can't recreate that role no Barry Tennant nobody's seen that necklace Cage Babbitt and even Nicolas Cage probably didn't watch it it might have been like a sequel I don't know if it was a remake cuz it's called port of call like it's got an extension on the end of the port O'Call New Orleans it's called Bad Lieutenant port of call no oh yeah I heard about that yeah yeah that's the Nicolas Cage one yeah okay hein so they tried to piggyback on or some shit like that yeah but whatever that Harvey Keitel version is holy shit but he's creating everything he was great in Pulp Fiction he's great in everything yeah a nice fantastic actor and they really I mean the people in this movie are what's it like hanging out with those guys I listen Joe when I went in there I told myself ain't talking to nobody I'm gonna speak when spoken to yeah there was a part one they were kind of lighting the Niro and I and we're standing face to face and he's looking at me and I'm looking right at him and I'm I wasn't gonna say nothing and then he comes in on my my tiny a tiny zit be tighten a little bit and he cinched my thigh straightened out my so yeah I had a wig they put me in a wig what kind of wig like actually there's their third that if you if you type up Sebastian Maniscalco Irishman that it should pop up yeah what is the difference you know it's I'm so confused why they give you a wig it's got sideburns I mean if you if you see it in person you'll understand maybe why yeah it's not that much of a departure from from my my real hair but did they give you the option to grow in sideburns and you like get the fuck out of you know they just said again I dad I didn't say nothing they said you're gonna wear a wig no no problem whatever you want me to do Scorsese was like um okay um there's a part where I'm gonna go through a window and he's like okay when you go through the window and I'm like oh I'm going through a window cuz I knew there was a stunt guy involved right but he's telling me that I'm gonna go through the window and I wasn't gonna say I don't do windows right to a window yeah I'm not gonna tell Martin Scorsese I'm sorry I need a stunt guy right um but then they said hey Marty there is a stunt guy here he goes oh okay so I was working to go through the window I went through a window on Newsradio Nick DiPaolo threw me through a window is that right uh it's it's easy they're made out of sugar glass you just go right through it alright it's weird it feels like nothing like a good tissue paper or something it's very strange I was like whatever whatever whatever it takes Scorsese wants me to go through I mean the guy went through the stunt double one through when he cut his hand oh did he really so I don't know what what it was oh if I went through the window Joe I would have been dead Cersei is he's such a psycho he might have made the guy go through real glass you know like this is just not realistic enough this yeah five hundred extra dollars the sugar glass whatever it is it's not gonna work but I guess you could probably cut yourself on that sugar glass yet if you landed wrong I mean if it was sticking up wrong you placed your hand funny makes sense yeah that's how I could cut yourself a little but but yeah that was exciting it's been really exciting for me to last three or four years to have these opportunities to do these things and yeah it's that's great listen man it's been awesome to see because I remember you first starting out at the Comedy Store I really do I remember you from the late 90s just trying to get your shit together we did a lot of shows together man you know and then you really came into your own and then during the time that I was away and I was hearing from some you know comics always talk I was hearing from so many people how hard you were killing you know so many people were saying you were doing great and you've always been like a real easy guy really easy guy to hang out with real easy guys to talk to so to see you blow up like this it's been just fucking awesome a lot of things I appreciate that Joe and we've known each other for a while and you're right at the time that you were away from the comedy store I think I kind of you know found my voice in the beginning there was really tough for me to you know to you know find work I mean Alan I think I thought talked about this the last time I was on the cast I was trying like different shirts and come through I've come with it's my nipples hanging out and like a leopard shirt I thought it was cool yeah this is one of those things is a young medium you're trying all these different things out what you were trying it out in the Lions Den - no I mean you are in the fucking the belly of the beast trying out stand-up it's very hard to do yeah but no but I appreciate you the support you've given me over the years and having men I don't take this lightly you know I mean when you had this podcast and it became so huge and it still is huge to have me on here you know I I appreciate it because you know I don't take anything for granted well I don't take you for gonna need the brother I really appreciate man God thank you very much
