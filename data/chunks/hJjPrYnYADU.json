hello freak bitches now when you started lifting weights on your tois in 12th grade and you got more like at night - ten nine - ten yeah early - when you stop taking the pills did you feel like the exercise did for you what the pills were kind of supposed to do for you the the weight lifting I had a this coach where he's mentioned in that article that you were talking about the iron I talked about peppermint yeah any of he I was in his carpool he was a Vietnam vet and he once said to me I have to quote he said you're a skinny little faggot he thank you sir and he said I'm going to teach you how to lift weights I said okay more attention than my dad gave me so I said I'll take it and so he taught me compound lifts at the school gym so I bought a Sears and roebucks Anfield weight set which I couldn't drag to my mom stage DW fastback and eventually I did buy three months of that weight so I'm fairly throwing it across the room because you know you're growing so fast like your muscles are recovering overnight you just do this thing work out everyday you don't even feel it and he said you're not allowed to look at yourself until Christmas break after Christmas exams and this was like in September so I didn't I did everything he told me to and then he dropped me off before the Christmas break he said now today you can look at yourself in the mirror and I ran home I ran home and I tore my stupid school uniform off and I stood in the mirror and my body had definition I'm like wow those are pecs those I mean like I look like I was a guy who lifted some weights and I it was self validating like wow I'm here I did that I'm looking at myself going I did that no one can lift those weights for you and the feeling of achievement it gave me that I accomplished that was a shot in the arm that I still feel to this day wow I mean because it was so like wow you can do this that's possible right because every other time trying to meet girls at the school dance I had no guts to talk to the girls so they were alien creatures I didn't do well in school so you could make fun of me I couldn't throw the ball straight so they would throw it at my head to watch me from and so I it didn't have any traction anywhere and then when I had the way from like wow I'm filling out my t-shirt man noticeable improvement hell yeah more lost effort equals yes and I couldn't didn't make my grades better so I still use all of Swahili to me in school I was up Tuesday probably too late I just yeah I'm not good at sitting still but when I had the summer jobs that's when I kicked ass I never had an allowance I never my mom said you never said here's 20 bucks for like where's Henry go he's got three jobs over the weekend I'd wake up in the morning go to the pet shop work all day there run home shower change my clothes do the night shift at the movie theater take the bus out to the surf shop in the suburbs and repair skateboards and whatever on Sundays so I always had pocket money because I always I liked having working a cash register on my keychain in school I had the keys to stores bosses trusted me because I'd never steal and I so I would work like 20 hours a week and go to school in high school and part of that was informed by the weightlifting and I like getting out of the house and being responsible but in school it didn't mean much to me but showing up on time at the pet shop and cleaning out 20 cat pans man that was like I had to be there at eight o'clock not eight oh one man because we got things to do I felt a real fealty and to this day like if I'm ever on a film shoot like who's the guy who's there early man that's me I'm there i memorize the whole damn script I'm so happy to have a job I'm like amazed anyone cares and so all of that it keeps me on the straight and narrow I call myself a human frozen yogurt machine just output you know I don't want the applause I don't I like to build ships I don't want to sail in them and the best part about finishing the ship is it sails off to sea and you can build another so I love finishing a book you know I'll get this thing off my desktop now I can start a new one like where can I go now and so that's how I live to achieve and to output but it's not I don't ever look at I can have a thing on my computer it's called the list and I keep a list of like every show every book I've written every movie I've been in every album I've ever made and when you look at it it's intense it's like you keep a list of every show you've ever done oh hell yeah of course Wow other words I don't know anybody who does that yeah and sometimes I write down the set length I take a lot of notes Wow oh yeah I write them all down but um I have this one thing called the list and it's just like you know every film every TV show every voiceover every book every record on and on and sometimes I look at it just collect the input like a new book comes out I have to go to the thing and input and I look at this list and my bones start aching like man this is a lot of a lot of my shit a lot of crap Escrima yeah I don't wave it around go see what I've done I just kind of go I'm only interested in what I'm doing what I'm doing next so why do you record it then why do you write all that stuff down I love leaving a good trail of evidence and I like to be able to when someone will say I'm I saw you in 1985 in Champaign Illinois I'm like no that would be 1983 or 1986 we didn't play there 1985 how do you know that here it's right there see like whoa yeah you got a fucking list from 1983 or I have every show since I was in Washington DC with my with my first band so you you've written down every single show you've done in your life yeah you should publish that well it's in you know my journal books of the years I was in Black Flag that came out as a book I did it but I mean you should just publish that list you should put it up online or yeah just so people could look at it yeah I have a lot of there's a lot of those kind of things are you really sure if so people could feel lazy just just to look at the angle what in the fuck is sometimes you know something like that will change the way a person look to the world to know that someone like Henry Rollins is out there recording every single show and here's where all here's always like you get this feeling like I'm getting this feeling when I'm talking to you like I want to go do something for real I like to get out of this no no no I love this interview I want to fucking accomplish something like this is this is something that I like when I talk to people that are really motivated and really passionate it gets me fired up and out so I'm listening to you talk about this stuff and I want to go do something yeah that that's all you get do in life you get to do stuff and then you die you know it's over and it's over fast enough anyway so for me I don't I don't tell people well this is a very compelling and attractive attitude you have though it's very very interesting yeah it keeps me going and it never gets I never get to that point where I've been to enough places we've written enough books or I've done enough radio shows or I bought enough records there's never enough records there's never enough time to do everything and I like living with that kind of aspect of desperation we are always kind of like oh come on man let's go and I like that because it keeps them as I say it keeps the blood thin and it keeps complacency at the door I have my bad days I'm like anyone else I'm just you know yeah but you're burning your bad days are probably ridiculous you're burning so hot I mean your bad days are probably like an average ambitious person's you know quality times I don't know I mean yeah I don't know man pretty intense but it's one of the reasons why I picked the people I work with like today you met Heidi who manages not only me but all my companies and she's basically she and I've been working together for damn near 20 years she's amazing and she's air traffic control because if I'm not I'm never careful I say yes to every damn thing and she said you can't say yes to that cos you're to be over here on this day she goes like to stop answering the phone I got this so she like she's the one who coordinated all this with you right because I you know I'm not going do it and I'm not good at setting it up right and so she locks in the coordinates and so I work with people who are used to kind of my velocity like the road manager in a way I'm very easy on road manager award same I wake up I go to the front of the bus and he's already written out the map for me to walk to a gym so I wake up I go right to the gym and I always want the same thing I want a gym I want this I want a gig and then I want some sushi and I want to go to sleep and so but it's intense and there's hardly any days off so he knows how to keep all of that going and the phone is ringing because I work in different me all the time and so Heidi is always juggling eight chainsaws and so I'm around people who can allow me just to really run at it and go as fast and as hard as I want to I call it living at the speed of life you just kind of go you let your imagination and your resolve dictate everything and to be able to do that and still keep the lights on I'm just a lucky bastard [Music]
