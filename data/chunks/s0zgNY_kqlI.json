all right here we go first of all welcome James I really have now my pleasure and welcome again Chris so this is essentially giving you an opportunity to refute some of the things that Chris has said about your film we should tell everybody that you the producer of game-changers yeah I was one of those users I know you also from of course from The Ultimate Fighter yeah UFC and Chris this is your what fourth appearance your fourth or fifth did you get a chance to see what Chris had said yeah I've watched you watched it okay I've made a bunch of notes excellent let's start from the beginning the beginning of the show the beginning of your film you talked about the gladiators and all that stuff and the the fact that you were shocked to find out the day they had eaten the vegetarian diet yeah I mean well you know that's been misrepresented right so even before the film came out people like oh there's this vegan film coming out it's freaking propaganda people were judging the film before they'd seen it right and the vegan sort of community really pushed it like a look at this documentary so there's been things saying they claimed that the gladiators were vegan right and if we can just prove they think the whole film is based on this premise that was just like an inciting incident for me start digging into it first of all Fabian Kent said they were predominantly vegetarian and I said they ate mostly plants and that is what I couldn't believe right so they wouldn't claim they were vegan didn't even claim that they were vegetarian or just fueled mostly by plants you know and people say oh you cherry picked one location it was the only known gladiator burial site in the world based on archaeological and anthropological data at the time at the time where you read the study there have been other studies there's been there's some have been questioned so like there's one in York there's one in New York at the time had a few gladiator skeletons and it was questioned whether that was the thing but I'm happy to address every critique but if you wouldn't mind I just want to make sure that Chris round the same page about how evidence is evaluated sure so would you consider yourself a nutrition expert no I would consider myself someone who is adept at reading the literature and learning from experts in nutrition medicine anthropology etc although I do have master's level training in nutrition okay so it is it fair to say that any one study cannot show what you know the human race should be doing is that fair any ones that absolutely so basically anytime you show us study if you say something you have to give a citation for it right you have fair to say and then someone can claim it as cherry-picked is that you've got to show a study or some studies and then someone can claim as cherry-picked right so what we have to do in order to understand nutrition is look at the totality of the evidence and I'd want to make sure we're on the same page and then we can address each critique that's okay so there's that core of my argument right exactly so you would say is it fair to say like this three main area so there would be like preclinical data which would either be in animals or in test tubes petri dishes right there'd be observational data where you look at people and see how they're doing and obviously there's the health user but healthy use a bias potential and there's interventional trials right so let's just take trans-fats for example right you you look in a petri dish at endothelial cells and trans-fats and it's you can see that it creates vascular information in those cells right and then you look at people to eat more trans fats and they have higher levels of information and then you can actually do interventional randomized control trials and you can tell that trans fats cause inflammation so we basically all agree that trans fats are bad based on all of those data points is that fair all right so therefore again if you start any one study people can just someone can just claim that you're cherry-picking right you can just say everyone can say that I could say that you're joking you i'm cherry-picking not necessarily because there are many analyses and reviews that are sure for this purpose look at the totality of evidence here in the film for example pointing to many meta analyses that summarize all the research that's been done on the topic that i wouldn't have said that that's cherry-picking fair enough i agree with that okay so basically in philosophy there's this is a logical fallacy called appeal to Authority right but in the real world you know you have to look at experts that are specialists in the field so if I you know I just got so deserved you know long ago right so I went to shoulder surgeon I didn't go to a dentist if I want to learn about comedy or you know fighting ounces I might come and talk to you right if I want to learn about acupuncture or understand chemo I might come to Chris because you've got a master's degree in traditional oriental medicine you're a licensed acupuncturist right so if I want to learn about that Chris is someone that I might want to go to so what I'm saying is the World Health Organization the FAO the American Heart Association the 2015 2020 Dietary Guidelines are all suggesting to eat predominantly plant-based diets right and they're saying that vegetarian vegan diets are healthier for all life stages including for pregnancy childbirth so through trial birth breastfeeding adolescents athletes and so on okay that's the general consensus can I just just finish a little okay and so and I've got a bunch of slides if anything the position papers for all of these I would also say that I'm on a predominantly plant-based diet exactly if you look at and what we argue if you look at two-thirds of my plate is plants this is my point you're being unfair that's really really unfair because last time you pointed out that the totality of coverage of the plate is not reflective of the calories you set that on calories he's talking about what is predominantly his diet plants you gotta based on calories it's always on that the the if you're saying that your diet is predominantly plant-based then either one we're on the same page right well we're not because the the main question here in my mind is whether there's evidence that supports being on a 100% plant-based diet with no animal products versus a diet that includes a lot of plant foods and some animal foods I thought you were backing the film which was talking about plant-based diets so plant-based diets means getting the vast majority of your calories from plants well everything or excluding that offers you but the the film essentially was all about only eating plants no okay kill you dairy products will kill you know that claim was never made see but there was a connection there was not there was a third connection no there was not just what was the connection the connection cigarettes was the the the way the playbook that is being used by the sieve as people are conflating like what the hell PlayBook is the same the same way using athletes and they're using advertising we never made the claim which I that was lean that then but be clear so the PlayBook that was used by the the smoking industry so they pay for studies right right and and we know even with food right this has been done with cigarettes it's been done with drugs it's been done with food research shows that industry-funded studies of four to four to eight times more likely to have a conclusion in their favor for their product so this is what the smoking industry did then they got doctors to say that smoking wasn't bad and then they got athletes the show like hey smoking is good that was the power that we drew we never do that the parallel that was drawn in what the hell so I want to make that really clear there was no and I've seen this in in articles saying you know they they connected me we didn't do that and if you watch the film we never said I did you why did you have that in there though if you're not saying because they're using the same playbook if you're not saying that meat causes cancer you're saying claims that chicken eating chicken and fish causes cancer eating dairy causes cancer doctors vegan vegan that's the oath misrepresentation so can I just go back can we just finish the evaluating evidence Naida at each point every critique so basically the consensus and you're saying they're changing over time they are changing because as we get better at signs that becoming more the recommendations becoming more plant-based despite industry influence from studies and marketing and people being paid off industry influence goes both ways the sugar industry in the 60s I agree expose pointing the finger at fad I's the culprit so that's a straw man argument he's not he's not saying you are saying the sugar industry is terrible and I would agree that but can I just agree just finish the F value but the thing about this section of the film was you were making some sort of a correlation between cigarettes and the way that it was marketed away their marketing rather than the way meat is marketed correct so it's the same company's exponent but why would you do you would never do that about like carrots or kale or predominantly healthy but I didn't because I didn't do it but if you're saying that you you you you're connecting the two things you're connecting something that clearly causes cancer cigarettes now and these studies that were made to show people that it didn't they were paid off the studies were fake there was there were essentially cherry-picked fake studies that were financed by the tobacco industry direct in order to get people to buy more cigarettes you're making this same sort of claim about me correct which means you think that meat is bad I do okay that's but that's where we're that's where I we're not we can disagree I'm almost finished with the evaluating evidence so so basically what we did when we expert interview the experts is we chose leading experts in their individual fields we collectively with thousands of articles in the peer-reviewed literature right so and this was only the bummers about the making of documentaries like you put the lower third on people don't get to read it so we had the chair of nutrition at Harvard the president of American College of Cardiology the lead delegate of urology for the American Medical Association the chair of anthropology at Harvard the director of energy environment resources at Chatham House really respected so talking about vegan doctors I saw some of them some one were involved in hunting some we were involved in animal testing I saw one of them eating a chicken sandwich at lunch said let's not say that like this was a vegan bias coming into it because that's just not true they're stretching out and this is we were talking just about this one section were you connecting cigarettes and meat so you're saying that the same Sordo deserves the same playbook but there's no evidence that meat is bad for you no but this is something that's actually recently been established by mainstream medicine you understand that right that they've released new studies releasing these new studies saying that there's no longer this concern that red meat causes cancer or this is appeal to Authority because I can find many illustrious doctors and experts for a highly qualified that will disagree with my point of view that that a diet must be a hundred percent plant-based and I wouldn't say okay okay okay you did but this was the connection that you made with cigarettes in the film no yes I think they're both promoting something bad because there's a profit so you think that meat is bad for you they're promoting it knowing that it's bad yes for profit okay so so all Chris has today to debunk the film right is convinced the people watching and listening but he knows more about the consensus and the experts in their field like I would understand this is what actually not that interested in consensus of experts I'm looking at that research that is published the peer-reviewed research that is published yeah the meta analyses and even reviews of meta analyses that have been done a perfect example is the whole dairy in cancer section totally that we talked about where you had argued or Walter Willett argued that there's you know dairy products caused cancer and I pointed to a meta analyses that looked at over a hundred and fifty different reviews that 84% of those found no associations so how is that not part of this discussion where we're talking about hundreds of scientists across different continents different countries they're using peer-reviewed science some show this but in the movie just one expert is pointing to you know one group of studies without mentioning that that sense that one right so this is the 2018 meta not have you got a slide for that if not I've got your slide hundred and seven slide hundred and seven no this is a 2019 1953 studies right yeah and I can get I'm really a lot further into it not the only one I'd love to because at nine o'clock last night until nine o'clock last night I thought Chris just made a bunch of mistakes interpreting the data and I'm gonna show you how he has misleading people on this study okay so if you can bring up the slide 117 is that can we see this like yeah okay this is it okay so you see what he's putting quotes okay 84% of meta-analyses on dairy consumption showed either no association or an inverse association between dairy and cancer and then you go on to point out what an inverse means is that people ate more dairy get lower rates of cancer that's what he's implying when you put something in quotes what does that mean to you it means us what he said yeah but it's that quotation is quoting the study right fair enough is that what they said in the study no that's not what they said in the study that's right my summary of the evidence of the study thank you but when you put something quite that's misleaders his quote okay fine but he's not putting things in one else totally I mean that's how when you when you when you anything you do in literature when you put some in quotation marks you're quoting the study but let's let's just bypass that I'll agree okay so can you bring up side 109 see what they actually said okay this is the actual quote 10 out of 153 reported meta analyses comparing highest versus lower dairy consumption 109 71% showed no evidence of a systole significant association between dairy consumption and instance of cancers 20 showed a decreased risk of cancers with dairy consumption and 24 showed an increased risk of cancers with daring sumption now this is actually until last night like 9 o'clock I realized what he was doing okay if you want to go to I mean just to sum it up if you go to slide 110 wait but can we see what's your interpretation what do you do you agree that that was the quote from the study okay good but I'm asking you what your interpretation it does that in your mind show a strong connection between dairy and cancer okay Joe you're gonna really realize here what Chris is doing okay this is really and I'm glad that you bought it please answer what okay so can I just say the reason you brought this up is because Walter Willett said there was a strong connection in prostate cancer and dairy correct yeah so you brought about something about all cancers okay yeah so and in this study about half of the study showed a connection between prostate cancer and dairy and half didn't what so not a compelling argument that dairy is associated with cancer okay so can we got you got a coin flip basically slide 110 well let's let's stay with this explain this first not we'll move to that's known as sliding excellent is explaining okay it's just breaking that down okay so there was statistically significant associations between dairy consumption instead of cancers 71 percent showed no evidence thirteen showed a decreased risk in a sixteenth century an increased risk so you see what Chris did to represent this he added 71 and thirteen to make eighty-four right voila this is how you got it right so you added seventy three percent seventy one percent and 13 percent to Gaetti four right so his statement from this study was 84% showed no evidence or decreased risk that's what he made you believe well 71 percent shows no evidence the 13 percent shows decrease right circle you add the two of them together that's 84 percent shows no evidence a great increase risk directly but he could have said his 71 percent plus six teams and that's eighty-seven percent he could have said eighty-seven percent showed no evidence or an increased risk its 84 one plus 16 oh so I could make the claim no evidence or a decreased you were claiming in the film was claiming dairy causes cancer my claim was there's no the burp the bulk of the evidence suggests there is no association or inverse association that's true no I agree 13 percent shows decreased risk okay so the hold on a second yeah the decreased risk and the increased risk are almost the same talked about which is higher 3% shows interest and this one's not the point of this study is that this is his study that he brought up showing this is very strong evidence okay his statement was very misleading he added up those two and then he finished it up by saying so basically there's an inverse correlation but he did not show he could have said 87% showed no risk or an increased risk in church instead he chose to summarize it saying 84% but there's no risk in increased risk it's not going Joe because you're talking about something causing cancer no I exactly and so he couldn't there wasn't showing of things to find the total cancer was increased right but we just we know that as research shows this included did it not industry funded research um two-thirds of researches in right and we know that we research shows like are you are you proposing that we throw out every study because the one of the main studies in your film was sponsored by the Hass avocado board the one that claims that animal products contribute to inflammation I'm not sure I'm not sure that's right now I'm saying industry-funded studies and by the way industry-funded studies they typically only put them out when it shows in their favor there's no obligation for industry when they do a study to release it yeah I'm primarily a retired okay what do you think that the industry and the meeting guarantee is far more money than the plant-based industry right you'd agree with that actually we can look at some statistics on that would you would you disagree that industry funded research has a four to eight times increased risk compared to non industry funded research in fine inclusions in their favor I think and I think industry research is definitely a problem but I see it as a problem across the board and I have some statistics and so do you not do you not admit that you here led the audience to believe that there was a potentially decreased risk overall you made it sound very high because you didn't split between them no difference that was not my intention it was just it was a data's not to spend ten minutes as we're doing now talking about one studying claim no it's not accurate if there said showed no evidence or showed an increased risk 84% daddy so 87 said that seems like it's miss Lee I think that would be misleading also do you run he could so we're talking about something causing cancer James exactly so he's making increased risk is what we're looking for well rocking for residents of it causing cancer 71% the bulk of the evidence shows no evidence that's exactly what I've my point it doesn't show that you honestly don't think that that statement instead of just putting the sub norm centered no evidence 13% show that would be the fairest the most you know honest explanation like summary of that statement I would say that if you wanted to say it the most accurately yes that's the best way to say one percent showed no evidence 13 percent showed decreased risk but I don't have a problem with saying 84 percent showed no evidence or a decreased risk true cuz we're out something causing cancer that's the that's the relevant point the relevant point is does the study show that dairy causes cancer the the primary evidence that most of the evidence says it shows no evidence or it shows a decreased risk that's the bottom of the bulk of the 84 percent versus 87 percent it does no no 87 percent shows increased risk is only 16 percent no evidence to increased risk to get 87 percent okay let's throw out the no evidence let's throw out no the proof is to show evidence that indicates the dairy causes cancer if you do a study and it shows that it doesn't then that's not in support of the claim agreeing that the meta-analysis did not could not find an association but I'm also pointing out that industry-funded studies were included in it and they are more likely to find no connection so there's a hundred fifty three studies you're claiming we should just that all of them are industry funded and we should throw out this huge review of 153 meta-analysis because of industry funding what is the basis for that claim no I'm not I'm saying that it sways the results can you you can't see that I don't I don't like but you know I don't accept it I have a hundred you just III studies you accept they were that they were in this meta analyses that they're gonna sway the results to the point where these findings aren't valid and we could do the same thing with this all of the studies that you have linked to in the film well we can we can also look at other studies on dairy and cardio metabolic outcomes that we have got lots of large reviews that we can look at and again and you know this is a pointless discussion to have if you're just gonna sit there and say industry funding my point solid that's not my only point I think you're saying it makes them suspect correct yes Greenview about the cigarette thing how many of the hundred and fifty three studies meta analyses which each also had individual studies in them are are so so biased by industry funding that we can't count on the phone well I would hope that you would know more than I I mean basically you've I would you know this is a this this we can't get very far in this discussion if you're gonna claim that we can't even talk about studies in the peer-reviewed literature because industry funding completely biases the finding no I'm not saying that's the case I'm saying just because they couldn't even though there were more showing an increase than showed a decrease risk right I am saying that it's possible that the the industry fund that's a misleading statement more showed increase than decreases Corral but there's 71 percent showed no me with that oh I agree I agree so that's a wash it's not even those two a wash no it's not a wash if you have a hypothesis this thing causes cancer and then you do a ton of studies and there's no association that's an that hypothesis is no longer correct it's not a wow that's actually that's actually not true based on epidemiology if you have ten studies that show no association and ten that show an association then you don't have that at all I'm not again not like what he said you have eighty four percent that shows the opposite you could say eighty four percent showed no evidence and then you can forget about decreased risk just say eighty four percent showed no evidence forget about decreased risk right you sit still have only 16 percent showed an increase risk right do an epidemiology study or you have to take into account all the other factors in these persons lives totally about whether they whether they drink whether they smoke totally they exercise well you know sedentary lifestyle there's a lot of factors so that would if you had something that was causing cancer you would expect the results to be flipped you would expect the results to be 16% showed no showed no evidence 71% or 84% showed an increase that would be something you'd say hey this is causing cancer this is more like that's not however demonology work so if you if you had what buddy me ology is slippery and I agree that not happy me ology works if you've got if you have even if you had ten studies showing no evidence just cuz you don't find something doesn't mean that it exists okay the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence okay let's say this if you if you had a hundred studies and seventy of those studies showed an increased risk of cancer would you say that thing causes cancer most likely most Wow if it is all epidemiology then it's okay so now let's do 100 studies and 70% now show no evidence yeah would you say it's most likely that there's no evidence no that's not how it works oh so if you've got seventy studies that can couldn't show a correlation and 30% that did that is still in favor of showing that there is a correlation but no no no we're not now we're doing 70 study if 70% look it was 70% of the people in these studies if you have all these studies you have 100 studies and 70% of the people in all these studies are showing an increased risk of cancer we would agree right this is why you can't prove causation based on observational but right now if it's reversed now if 70% of these studies show there's no increased risk of cancer or 84% four eighty four percent which is because you add in the decreased risk when we're not even adding the decreased risk which shows that you're less likely to get cancer which is almost the same as an increased risk of cancer which in my eyes is a wash you would assume that we're talking about something that doesn't give you cancer well I mean that that's I agree that this study found that there were they couldn't prove a causation right they couldn't prove a link between cancer but you made it out like he was being deceptive is being deceptive I don't agree that I don't agree with that because you try you're trying to show that these studies are proving or at least making this correlation between consumption of dairy products and cancer but the evidence doesn't show that if you want to look at it in its entirety the evidence shows that most of the 71% showed no evidence of it causing cancer 13% showed it's actually better for you you have less risk of cancer than not eating dairy 13% showed increased risk of cancer and again when you talk about epidemiology studies when you're talking about you know 16 out of a hundred you you have to throw in all the other facts right and that's why they didn't find it but can I just the reason you brought this up is prostate cancer right and and so if you look at slide one thirteen prostate cancer was that's disturbing so it's 5050 with dairy consumption versus that's not one try one thirteen but a lot of people get prostate cancer too isn't that an also an issue that's a high as well isn't that a high risk for males prostate cancer yes it's a high one whether it's our 112 whether they consume milk or not so just so in this metric Lance that you point to the highest connection that they could find between dairy and any type of cancer was processing cancer so if you look at the black line that shows no association if you look at the green line that's decreased Association and the red line was increased Association that was the meta-analysis that you provided yeah so you brought you brought this study up because dr. Walter Willett who is the chair of nutrition Harvard he's one of the most published nutrition scientists of all time if not the most published a disagreement right and so he is coming to the determination that prostate cancer is linked then it's likely that it's causal and there's very slow up back up half and a half that's not evidence of a causal relationship dance there's no evidence not a causal relationship okay dr. Walter Willett is in just about any type of study then appeal to Authority you just said yourself that's a rhetorical fallacy no it's it's a it's a fallacy and message that appeal to valid Authority because literally if I want to know are you saying like so if I want let me look at mixed martial arts and Chris goes well I've never done mixed martial arts but I think I know more about anthropology nutrition like I know more about boxing kickboxing jiu-jitsu and wrestling so we're telling people out the Consensus we're talking about leading experts in their field with thousands out there reviewed census there are experts who would disagree and would look at this study and reach the same exact conclusion right I did some researches there's no reliable no there's no reliable proven connection between dairy and prostate you have half studies showing an association half studies showing no association not to mention the fact that that's as you just said that even if there was a strong correlation that doesn't prove causation you said you like this because it included also randomized controlled trials yeah and I think should be should be trust Walter Willett who at the time was the chairman Justice studies but we're way off here the question was still you know the there are a lot of inferences made in the film whether you they were intentional or not on your part that you know dairy people are hearing o'deary is gonna cause prostate cancer they're gonna extend that to cancer there are other claims in the film made about dairy and metabolic prop and saturated fat and metabolic issues so the operative question that I'm trying to answer is do the data support that not just Walter Willett think that or any other expert in the film do the data support that conclusion right and even in that study it the data don't strongly support that if you have half studies saying yes half studies saying no that's not a clear signal and it's definitely not evidence of a causal relationship so so having Walter Willett or anyone say there's a strong relationship and we know the mechanism and there's you know it's causal that capacitor by the study can I posit didn't you tell me that two-thirds of people have an intolerance towards towards milk and dairy and I have a study here is that what the number is it why not two out of three people in the world okay because this is actually to your point so two out of three people have an intolerance towards dairy in the world and if you're talking about a study that shows 50% of the people in these studies that are consuming dairy there's a correlation between prostate cancer and and Derek mm-hmm wouldn't you assume that maybe the same thing that we're talking about with two-thirds of people are intolerant to something they consume this thing that's in tolerate causes inflammation in the body and that inflammation the body could possibly be leading to cancer correct no not correct very dairy is inversely associated with inflammation so inverse associated with inflammation but if people are irritated by dairy if they have an intolerance to dairy and you said two-thirds of people here's here's what I would suspect there that if you we segmented those people out and said let's do a study find out who's intolerant of dairy and find out who isn't you would see even better results for dairy because despite the fact that some people are lactose intolerant we're still seeing in that meta-analyses that you know most people there's no association in most cases and a inverse association in other cases hold on a second but this prostate cancer thing is not moles why this is 50/50 right no and what you're saying you're saying if half of okay but if there he gives half people cancer right and doesn't give their dog answer and I can just think dairy second of all do you see what Christmas did that's not what that's Ted but you see ology James it's not dairy gives anyone cancer it's Association oh that's your meta analysis included randomized nice time this is actually to you can I stop this though wouldn't if someone's intolerant of something that means your body is irritated by it means it causes some sort of disturbance right whether it's inflammation or gastrointestinal disorder you start farting and that's what happens when people are lactose intolerant right that irritates the body wouldn't there be wouldn't you assume that something your body is intolerant to would possibly be the cause of distress sugar disease certain thing could be right so now if every but if you're looking at two-thirds of the population are intolerant why your that cause prostate cancer and no other cancers I don't that doesn't make that's why it when you see that kind of thing in the data it's a red flag because there's no logical explanation for why it would cause prostate cancer but no other cancers is there more of an association there with with that Jamie pull up but just Google dairy products and inflammation review of the clinical evidence and this is a review systematic review of 52 clinical trials and they found that dairy products were inversely associated with inflammatory markers which means that people who consume dairy actually had lower levels of inflammatory markers so the hypothesis that dairies inflammatory and that's why it's causing cancer doesn't seem to hold up in the literature so so can I just say so first of all you know there's this that might be studies he can bring up I'm not even a nutrition scientist I'm gonna come like a combatives trainer right and so you also said that you're not an expert in nutrition and so what we have to believe today is that Chris really is it is about the meta-analysis but it's about the meta-analysis it's about the totality of taking into account all the evidence not just one meta-analysis or a meta-analysis of a meta-analysis but all of the data and so what you're asking people to believe is that you are better at interpreting the data than people that are experts in their field many experts who would agree with me didn't choose to interview them in the film no actually we did interview some that I can tell you about in a second on the other side not to be why we didn't include them but you are asking people I would understand it if suddenly Chris has figured out this new travaux diet that he figures out something about nutrition that he's better than the consent he knows more about the consensus and more about the majority of leading experts but to believe that Chris knows more about anthropology urology heart disease knew why is environment apology because that what you try to do anthropology and because a majority of anthropologists agree with what I said you chose the probably one of the few that would agree with the idea that he primarily ate a plant you know exclusively plant-based diet for promote of human evolution we can go into that again I'm actually representing the consensus viewpoint in anthropology James and you'll be hard-pressed to find a consensus group of experts that agree with that idea so you're saying that the check you're saying that Richard rang and the chair of anthropology that we interviewed does not represent the scientific consensus of anthropology if you're arguing that he is is saying that humans primarily ate plant-based diet for and didn't and animal products were not a significant part of our diet through evolution then yes that's what I'm saying it depends so we came from the equator right but I want to go back as I guess because are you arguing that there's a dominant consensus among nutrition experts in the US that everyone should be on a vegan diet No so what's the what's the argument here that we should people should eat plants and my argument is yes they should and and internal products can also be part of that neutral or healthy omnivorous diet and I think you would find a dominant consensus of nutrition experts that agree with that so it should be let that that's not the way this film is being interpreted there was a bias going into it so for example when you go to the US military right the game changes the first documentary that has ever been accredited by the defense health agency for the Department of Defense it's the first documentary that has ever been supported by the Special Operations Medical Association they didn't come into it looking at the science this has been evaluated by hundreds of PhD researchers to come to that conclusion okay they did not leave it how so they've been evaluated how so you can't get an accreditation here in the video is yes valuated by the department of defense health agency of the Department of Defense which decides what the military's eating they don't give a crap about oh let's let's base our diets on ever on evolution they care on what is the science and the doctor game-changers is the first documentary that's ever been accredited by the defense health agency there you can look at this and go ok this is a vegan propaganda film why are you saying that hundreds of PhDs have reviewed this and reviewed all the data in it to come to this conclusion and is this proven is this printed this is some published paper where it shows hundreds of people have reviewed this film and found all the claims to be credible and that all the debunking zuv it or not the defense health agency has reviewed this film in detail digging into each of the studies right but you're saying you again called to Authority you're saying hundreds of PhDs have have studied this who are the people well there's there's a lot from the defense health agency there's a lot of people this special operation Bagration that came to the decision and these are master's degrees and nutrition PhD in nutrition to get that accreditation that just hasn't happened before because they didn't come into it thinking this is a vegan propaganda film that was the bias going into it we're again talking a lot about experts and their experts in their opinions and not Chris Crestor in his opinion it's not no this is not about my opinion and Ike we can fill the room with experts who agree with me you had an expert a debate with a doctor in the UK on a TV show who disagreed with you we can always always find people who agree and disagree with all kinds of different credentials it's disingenuous to claim like I said that I I'm not here to argue that plants are unhealthy and that we shouldn't be eating a lot of plants this is the fallacy that gets creative with these kinds of films it's not a choice between a standard American diet and crappy processed food diet that contains meat or a vegan diet right it's there is a possibility of a plant-based diet a diet that has a lot of plants that also contains animal products and that compares comparing that with a 100% plant-based diet that is the operative question the book the film the film is I believe that meat and dairy are bad for you the film talked about promises you believe that I think there's sufficient evidence about that if you look at our website and telling you know people are wanting a resources on what to eat they said if we say it's all or something it doesn't have to be all or nothing so we were talking about okay but that's nice but what you just said you think that meat is bad for you yeah please dairy and you know I could see the argument if we're talking about two thirds of people being lactose intolerant I would see the argument that for two thirds of people dairy is probably not good for you doesn't support that but but I mean we can say I can what is lactose intolerant if you're intolerant of something that means your body's not enjoying it and by the way that's not the only issue with no that's a giant number two thirds of people are lactose intolerant if you would if you set your body's intolerant of something but you keep consuming that thing that your body's intolerant of I would naturally assume as a absolute admitted non expert that that's not good so two things here number one I've always for years have written that dairy is very individual and depends on your tolerance number two there are a lot of dairy products with virtually no lactose in them so cheese for example hard cheeses no lactose you know cream no lac very little lactose butter very no lactose g no lactose yogurt fermented dairy products like kefir no lactose so while I agree with what you're saying if someone is lactose intolerant they should avoid dairy products that contain lactose when you look at the studies on dairy and connections with conditions like cancer inflammation which I just pointed out with this study and you look at cardio metabolic outcomes which I'd like to cover because that includes heart disease and diabetes and overweight obesity etc there is not any strong evidence that dairy contributes to those conditions so let's let's look at those actual studies Chris what you you talk really badly against epidemiologist I can't prove causation and then when you like it you cite it so you'll give epidemiological that's the same way with you James both ways that's right okay so you can if the burden of proof if you're claiming that something is bad for you yeah the burden of proof is on you Shawn meaning so you can't say it's bad for you and then I show epidemiological studies and RCTs by the way that were included in that meta analyses that don't support that and then you say oh we can't trust the research no I'm sorry your hypocrisy is saying that you say that you said the epidemiology that's observational studies just looking at people you have said that we can't rely on those and then you then cite them yourself I didn't say we can't rely on epidemiology I say you have to consider the caveats it with epidemiology but again the burden of proof if you're claiming that a food is bad for you the burden of proof is on you research that it is so for example first of all there's an inflammatory mediators for example like heme iron second of all we look at population data and we show increased causes of morbidity and mortality for people that eat less meat or they eat no meat so there's there's increase causes of morbidity you just said it's yeah sorry decreases decreased risk of morbidity and mortality let's just be real clear on that because you said it wrong let's look at two randomized controlled trials see these are not observational studies the the first found that increasing red meat consumption by replacing carbohydrates in the diet of individuals without anemia actually reduced markers of inflammation sorry replacing what sorry carbohydrates yes what you said sorry so Jamie if you want to pull this I mean these are all on the website crecer dot Co slash game-changers but that's that study is called increased lean red meat intake does not elevate markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in humans I believe a study exists I mean that doesn't so these are RCTs randomized so so they're actually controlling it instead of just looking at observational data which is subject to healthy user bias these are the RCT so that's yeah that's one study and then there's another one another are CTE in women with anemia inflammation markers on a diet high in red meat were not significantly different from the on a diet high in oily fish and then there are also numerous studies of paleo diets but which contain meat and other types of animal protein and show that they decrease markers of inflammation including CRP there's randomized controlled trials showing reductions in interleukin 6 and also in tumor necrosis factor-alpha in these diets so all of this suggests it's not the meat it's what you eat with the meat that makes the difference sorry we have studies of chlorophyll eating chlorophyll rich green vegetables yep decreases the formation of n nitroso compounds with me we'll have lots of studies showing that when you eat plants along with the meat then you don't see the effects that you might see if you're just eating right standard American diet I agree so I off sex like some so if an animal foods crates oxidative stress you have it with the plant foods and that would have the antioxidant and that would offset it is that basically it's a little more complicated yeah I think it is more complicated than that as I said last time and as I've always argued I'm not a proponent of corn the carnivore diet I'm not a low-carb guy I'm not a keto guy I'm my fundamental argument is just that the optimal human diet contains both plant and animal foods and this focus on individual food components or macro nutrients like protein or fat or carbohydrate we've gotten too much it's called nutritionism it's just focusing on these individual elements and ignoring the overall pattern of diet quality which is the most important thing and that's what a lot of the more recent studies are showing when you look at the diet pattern and the diet quality on its on you know overall that's what actually makes a difference in terms of health and lifespan not how much of this fat how much of that fat whether there's you know red meat or white meat or fish or whatever it's the pattern let me because this is this is one of the primary misconceptions that people have about consuming meat when they hear studies that say that meat is associated with mortality or high cholesterol or disease are all these different factors we are talking about these kinds of studies where people fill out a form tell us what you eat yeah how many days a week do you eat meat how many days a week do you eat this what they don't take into account is whether or not these people are going to Wendy's whether or not they're eating a grass-fed steak and and and you know and broccoli something healthy there's a giant difference between those two things but they're lumped in together because this is meat consumption yeah there's the studies aren't perfect for sure but you were saying that basically look at saying we should look at outcomes and not just look at individual markers right is that basically no I'm saying we should look at the diet quality the overall diet pattern so if I example Christopher Gardner did a study at Stanford a couple years ago and he took - instead of saying you know low fat low carb he took two groups and he advised them all to basically eat a healthy diet and then one group ate a low-fat healthy diet and the other group ate a low-carb healthy diet they all lost weight it wasn't that big of a difference between the two I agree I agree so first of all in terms of health I would be pretty my opinion would be I'm pretty much micronutrient agnostic so I wouldn't like I'm not advocating high carb or low carb I think that people can do healthy and well I think for athletes they need a lot more carbs and a sauce getting those from plants I think there's certain athletes that can if it's slow in steady state where you're getting more fat oxidation I think that you know stone steady state athletes can do but like an MMA fighter or a soccer player but you just said that you were you were not low-carb right you said you're not low cop I'm not I'm not a low carb I advocate I've written articles called seven things seven reasons you should be cautious I'm not saying I'm not local Oh carb advocate I don't believe everyone should be on a low-carb diet Chris has his own he doesn't have the consensus definitions of carbohydrate levels you've made up your own definitions right when did I make up my own slide eighty Jeremy if you do that please I just point out that Zach bitter the man who I had on the podcast yesterday who holds the world record in running a hundred miles in 11 hours and I think it's 18 minutes he's on a low carbohydrate diet yeah and again you know those slow and steady state you can do well so you so Chris your recommendation your your definition of low carb is 10 to 15% if you know the next slide really want so if you look at the peer-reviewed literature it's either less than 30% or the next slide really less than 40% like if you look across all the literature's less than 30 or 40 moderate carb according to Chris next slide Jamie would be 15 to 30 peer-reviewed literature next car and next slide 40 to 65 and then high carb Chris calls more than 30% in the peer-reviewed literature high carb more than 65 and the next slide more than 70 depending on the peer-reviewed literature so you've come up with your own definitions of what is low moderate and high carb yeah just for the purpose of my work with people that that's not relate I wasn't trying to represent research there sure that's what I consider to be low carb moderate carb and high carb in my work with patients my recommendation did you know him says he did I mean that is what you said I mean you when you wrote this out you did have a different definition than the P that you do slider to that by his definition have your own idea and he said no you heard him say yes yeah so slide slide idea whose dream so I just want to sum this up but what's the point here I said that everyone should be on a low-carb diet no I agree and I I've always argued that it depends on everything from your genes to your exercise patterns where are you getting your numbers from like when you write low carb moderate carbon high carb you make them up this is just a wreck this this is a clinical recommendation from my experience working with patients I'm not representing the scientific literature here I'm not trying to make arguments about madness but that's absolute madness to come up with your own definition and this is why I feel that Chris does gay and when you have people like Chris on at multiple times it throws people's perception office of what is a healthy diet because Christmas represents the data he comes up with his own definitions of things he misrepresents things that we said in the film okay let's just talk about this real quick what so when we're talking about low carb moderate carb or high carb when you're recommending to your patients low carb moderate carb or high carb these definitions how are you coming to these conclusions it's made them up no based on so there are a lot of people James that disagree with the the car the range is signed and yeah there's a scientific consensus how many different scientists were were polled on this how many different studies were shown I don't know is this something that you just found that disputes his position it's like a large group of no this is okay so slide 89 consider Verta health who uses you know vert the folks at Verta who are all scientists and these they used a ketogenic very low carb diet to you will not be in ketosis at 30% carbohydrate or 25 percent or 20 percent or even 15 percent so you know that and and then you know 40 to 65 percent you're not you're not-- you're not even in the ballpark you know so if we're thinking about using low carbohydrate diets for example for weight loss or for diabetes or you know metabolic issues like Verta health is doing then you low-carb is not going to be 30 to 40 percent look like that's not gonna work so that's where my recommendation rhombic based meiosis based on you know based on the optimal range if you have if you look at the rest of the article it's going to be like if you've got diabetes you've got you're overweight you're obese you're trying to lose weight this is the range that I've found and other experts like the people at Verta health have found will be most effective and these are its branches there's no representation that this is the range that is defined as low carb in the scientific literature so you're do you're tall you calling it low carb because if someone's on a ketogenic low-carb diet in order to get into ketosis you have to have a low number of carbohydrates actually probably even below 10 it's not even just to be in ketosis like just to get the the maximal weight loss you know someone could be at 15% and still right way to us without being in Quito I got her in dropped because you just like in the last five minutes you showed a study from trying to prove your own point but low carb and low fat people had equiv equivalent fat loss you just said that so why not you now all of a sudden advocating only low carb diets for only low carb that they can both work for different people James you're misrepresenting what he was saying what he was saying is getting people to go on a healthy diet versus the standard American diet yeah so he's not just talking about low carb versus high carb what he's talking about is getting off bullshit like processed foods and sugar and eating I totally agree really and when you do that people no matter what low carb or high carb lose weight but I think you will agree as well as almost anybody would that getting on a low carbohydrate diet and forcing your body into ketosis makes your body burn fat that's one way that's true but it's it's proven right not the other piece of this is most of the studies aren't comparing healthy omnivorous diet with a you know plant-based vegan diet they're comparing a vegan diet with a standard American diet that contains animal preserve or diet yes by the way yeah has any of your work or your ideas been published in the scientific literature I've never claimed it I just I just wondered so you didn't wonder no I did one that we were saying that you were saying that to try to make it seem that he's less of an expert yes I'm not an expert either so what what's the point why I'm here because why am I here well I actually I did ask if I could bring my chief science advisor who has a double master's degree in exercise physiology and nutrition he's a registered dietician he built with his papers and we can talk about him totally but I think we should so first of all we just we still haven't come to this understanding of why you think meat is bad for you you were basing it well okay so there's the individual components like heme iron for example we talked about that last time the heme iron is only associated with poor outcomes in the US it's not not true it's not it's not true in other countries it's not true bang meta-analysis which looks at most of the studies that have been done on that and then if you also consider that when you add green vegetables and other plant foods spices and all of that it reduces the oxidative capacity of heme iron and reduces the absorption of heme iron and you know again we're talking about diet pattern not just is red are you eating red meat oh you know in McDonald's and fast food restaurants but if are you eating it in the context of an overall healthy diet and does that have the same effect right do you know how do you read a forest block yes or no I don't what does that mean that's basically looking at the statistically competent individual the forest Bligh's to plot plot okay that kind of looks like a bunch of trees right okay so you don't know how to read a forest plot so have you actually looked at the study the study okay so I'll just read on how to read it so it's kind of so get a microphone on you James just pull that sucker over so you see the first of all he said that what he put up on the screen and if he still got the slide but you said that the he- OCA ssin was only in Americans right but the conclusion of that study said that heme iron was associated with cardiovascular disease that was a conclusion study which he didn't put up on the screen okay I'd like the quote I put up was with respect to heme iron intake we found a significant association only in the studies that were based on American cohorts right so there's two things about that was from the study okay first thing I can't link to my slide I don't know where it is but basically can you just read the conclusion of that study because I can't fly my slide the conclusion this is down here a higher dietary intake of heme iron is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease whereas no association was found between seat cardiovascular disease and non-heme iron intake or total iron intake okay so and then also then I just read the quote just now which was incorrect by the way the authors made a mistake so how did they make mistake so if you look at this forest plot for example this Kipps team grow bush and you can go and look at the I've looked at the individual studies that they were referencing in the meta-analysis as my scientific thing so basically you see this this is a 1.86 with a constant interval being one point one four to three point zero nine okay that is statistically significant connection between heme iron and you can look at the the conclusions and what you're saying that what he said about eating it with green leafy vegetables I don't think this is real no first of all unlike the dairy one where I think that he was being a bit misleading in this case I don't think he was been repeating I think yeah I think that you read there was no misleading it was summarizing we already went over this okay create that impression but in this case I do not think he was being misleading at all it did say what you said in the study even though you didn't point out the conclusion you left out the conclusion of the study but what wasn't your fault is I think you I think you read the study but you you admitted that you can't you don't know how to read forest plots and the forest plots if you did look at them you knew how to read them you'd show that there are three in the Netherlands and in Sweden that did show a significant correlation because what you were trying to make out with this point which I understand when you're trying to when you have a point of view and you're trying to work it backwards what you end up doing is you try and find studies that suit your position and so you went and found this study and you found a quote even though you didn't like to put the conclusion of the study no I did say that they were did acknowledge that there was an association but American cohorts but it's not in there but it's not it's not your fault because the study the people in that whoever wrote the the write-up for the study made a mistake there were statistically significant because one point one four to three means that there was like a 14% to 300% increase in that one study of from the Netherlands the Kerstin klippstein crow Bush and for people watching they can go and look at the study look at the conclusions yeah there were three because his point was what you tried to infer from that was that the American diet that includes a bunch of junk food is different than the ones in Sweden the Netherlands where they aren't eating so much junk food but that actually was incorrect so he mine has been associated and is recognized yes it has been associated and we still have the studies that eating fruits and vegetables attenuate the oxidative capacity from he mine reduce absorption of iron in the gut and now we're focusing on a single mechanism rather than looking at the outcomes right which again I'm happy to look at the outcomes do you agree with what he just said I do same iron I think that plant foods offset the oxidation offset and something some regard the oxidation that you get from animal foods however if you work out you have oxidative stress okay so if you want to have a meal do you want the plant foods in the meal to be dealing with the oxidative stress from the animal foods or do you want the plants to deal with the oxidative stress allow you to recover faster and your next workout will be better I don't think we know that's true no we do know because we're not focusing on the nutrients in red meat and the things that and the highly bioavailable protein it's not like red meat is only there to cause I is is causing oxidative stress I agree it's not the only thing there are some nutrients in me so again the question is is there a place for animal foods in a diet that overall not not whether you know you should eat plant foods right we both agree that you should probably a lot of plant foods right which is my position I think it would be difficult for me to argue a hundred percent plants versus 50 percent plants I don't think it's argued to a delight argue like 90 95 percent plants versus I think the argument would take hours and hours and hours to convince you why I think 100 percent plants is but I think there's definitely bio variability and I think different people have a second I want to make sure I understood what can you repeat that so my position is that the literature I think it's an easier argument because we're talking about plant-based diets and plant-based diets we do either limiting or or limiting or eliminating animal products right so for plant-based general diets in general right so a vegan may be some vegetarian like if you eat turkey on Thanksgiving and then you eat fish once a month I would say that's a plant-based diet you're getting the vast majority of calories from plants right and I think there's a lot most people even if you're eating pasta you're getting the vast majority of your calories from plants well yeah but if we're talking about what's a healthier the healthiest diet that's the problem right I think whole plant food a lot of shitty American diet its plant-based you're talking about buns and bread and yeah bullshit butter and jelly sorry a lot of vegans and vegetarians just cuz you're vegan or vegetarian doesn't mean your health exactly right it's like the my argument leaders you're getting vast majority of your calories from whole plant foods right okay agreed okay you agree well I don't think the vast majority is my position but I think that's his position right I agree what he's saying I think that look I I eat animal products I have for a long time and I eat a lot of vegetables as well I think that an omnivorous diet is is the key to health that's what I believe yeah I I believe that meat helps you recover faster I think it's more nutrient rich I think there's things in me that it's very difficult to get in plants and I think the quality of the amino acids and the quality of the protein can be superior to that in plants my definite again what's to talk about that because that's one of the things you brought up and I kind of just say this agree with the type of meat that you eat we know that like there's not studies done on the inflammation in ELQ but there is Studies on inflammation in kangaroos for example in Australia so totally wild ports that's like their equivalent of elk right and there is about half the inflammation coming from that as there is from beef why would imagine I mean you're talking about a much healthier much higher protein because the difference between the protein content in elk per ounce versus the protein content and beef is almost double its a giant controlled trials I showed that showed less inflammation with eating red meat no the thing is that's it's tricky because when is something healthy or something inflammatory it's always compared to what so in some of these studies what the industry does is they'll compare red meat to bacon or that or you know that which it up there's always to watch it works the other way around they compare a plant-based diet with a standard crap Western diet no I agree that's what you saying meat is bad for you well so he I mean we just heard with the heme iron but the heme iron in conjunction with plant-based foods like you are showing who said it's because of the is that one of the primary reasons is because of oxidation and the oxidants deal with oxidation you get oxidant you get pro oxidation from animal foods right you also get pro oxidation from exercise alright we're talking about Makina you know isolated mechanisms right about but Chris you talked about mechanisms when you want to and you talk about preclinical data when you want to I was talking about them in response to the claims made in the film because on our European isms were mentioned neu5gc TMAO heme iron and so I brought those up in you know to respond to that's not when you use them because if you go on your website maybe I'm not saying we shouldn't ever talk about mechanisms genes I'm saying if if you're talking about mechanisms but the outcomes don't support the mechanism then what's the point well I think we can get into epidemiology can look at that but I think we should definitely hit protein because I think of everyone watching that's the biggest myth and it would be just sort of gripe and I think we should definitely be 12 so I wanna make sure would be 12 because one of the things that you said that he disputed was did bring up that b12 quote that you said was complete horseshit I can read it out if you want good please b12 is this in if you disagree with what you were reading b12 isn't made I'll read the whole thing and then so b12 isn't made by animals it's made by bacteria these animals consume in the soil and water just like with protein animals are only the middle men before industrial farming farming farm animals and humans could get b12 by eating traces of dirt on plant foods or by drinking water from rivers or streams but now because pesticides antibiotics and chlorine kill the bacteria that produces vitamin even finer moles have to be given b12 supplements and you said that's just all false that's all just factually wrong so first of all b12 is made by bacteria but it's animals don't get it from consuming the soil and water first of all you misrepresented what I said so I said it's made by bacteria that these animals consume you went on to say that animals didn't get bacteria from the soil that's not what I said I said they'd get it from the bacteria that they got from the soil so you misrepresented what I said you you know that the key claims you made James is that as pot it was pot used to be possible to get b12 by eating dirt or on plant foods or out from drinking water from rivers or streams I've still have not seen convincing evidence that okay so I was like 14 Jack Norris a vegan diet ition has admitted as much in his article and then even more relevant than all of that is looking at b12 deficiency rates between vegans vegetarians and omnivores in the clinical literature like the the other stuff is not really relevant until you get the clinical address each of your critiques then is that okay yeah so first of all you said there's zero evidence the b12 is fed to cattle right you said that and so can I just first you return it because I said even farm animals can you put up slide 44 please Damon I said even farm animals have to be given b12 supplements that's what I said okay so did you mean all farm animals okay so so do you see that is a screencap from the film that's a chicken and down at the bottom there's the quote for the poultry right so would you a disagreement and chickens and no I don't disagree that they sometimes get b12 but do what about shellfish shellfish are extremely high in b12 they're the highest even total non sequitur and it's because the implication in the film was the only reason you get b12 from eating animal products is because they're given b12 supplements so yeah are you you in certainly said you're really suggesting that the like the population gets most of its b12 from shellfish no okay I'm saying that the claim that animals need to take b12 supplements in order to have b12 in their flesh so he's not waking chickens got it from it James why do you think about the shellfish was I never claimed chicken was a great circle I said you I said in the film even farm animals have to be complete resins you said that it was absolutely false everything that I said about me girl you said was absolutely false as well this is also you talking about the people used to be able to get it from consuming vegetables right okay that can be read on it and that the water is now because of pesticides and I mean the water no longer has you claimed that the same percentage of you you picked one study that showed equal the rates of deficiency and I heard the huge amount of literature that shows big differences between vegans vegetarians and efficient I know all of your critiques because I've noted them and I've got a point for each one so can I just go children and then you can if you disagree you can so could you just general could you blood slide 45 and I know rather than throwing off track going to about humans we'll get to that in a second but that I mean b12 is just commonly fed to chickens and you would agree with that right yeah and and pigs and lambs would feel that can't room and like ruminants can create b12 in their gut from the bacteria yeah okay yeah so but you brought entitled bivalves and there ya know surely this ah yeah that's not yeah totally okay so super since you brought up cattle you said that cattle there's no evidence of cattle being fed b12 so if you bring up flight at forty six vitamin b12 for sheep and cattle it's what it says you said there's no evidence so you said there's no evidence so the left just so because people might not go to read the small print well listen there's people just listening as well twelve injection for sheep and cattle there's three different processors added to feed on the left so it says a liquid complemental complementary feeding stuff containing a central trace elements cobalt selenium twelve of b12 deficient arrests let's do two some soils and being low in cobalt which is a lot of character so now if you just go to slide 47 please Jamie next slide okay this is the largest supplier of animal feed or supplements in the world okay on their website young ruminants requires supplemental vitamin b12 prior to full room and development they also say vitamin T was sometimes administer enter early to incoming feedlot cattle and also b12 by the way has been shown to increase milk production you said there was no evidence that cattle are given b12 and you said that all my statements were absolutely false do you at least admit that you were wrong there if I said that at all this specifically that one portion of the statement there's no evidence to get ever get b12 supplements okay is it first of all when I made the full statement this is what you first said that's just all false that's all just factually wrong and then later on you said there's also zero evidence that b12 is fed to cattle that is flat-out wrong and I have just shown that is that fair I was wrong okay so we'll get to other points because you were wrong about many other things as well ok so let's see so you agree that um you know it is fed to cattle so you want to look at humans don't say there's none of the points that you brought up they've been giving minerals and feet and different things to the point if cattle are deficient because they're in a feedlot where they're not eating grass not only that and that is a primary reason it is a known war because young cows every piece of young cows that are most likely don't have been getting I know meat b12 from animals do you just do you dispute that the primary source of b12 for human beings has been eating animals and also fish and shellfish in history and I'm from but where's the evidence that the rivers and streams and dirt has been a primary source gonna be I'm gonna give it to you okay I think I came into debt you think I made claims in the film that I couldn't back up perhaps we did we went over those in the last show yes I stick with the b12 sure okay so can we just go to slide 48 so each health concentration fluctuated between 100 so this is in the levels of water in the English Lake District if you want to go to slide 49 the vegetables were vegetables were eaten without being carefully washed the strict vegetarians who did not practice hand-washing or vegetable cleaning may be untroubled by vitamin b12 of division C and by the way the there are retained vitamin D 12a soil was adequate to prevent b12 so what you're essentially saying is that we're dealing with b12 that was in soil and in water and that by the chlorination and filtration systems that we use today that's what's ruining the water and the water does not eat water now which is a good thing yes but that also takes out the b12 sure so he takes your statement correct sir he was wrong again that's not the consensus view that you can get enough b12 from eating unwashed but didn't necessarily say that was the consensus view what he said in the statement was that the reason why we no longer have b-12 in the water and in the soil is because the fact that they had chlorines and pesticides and that seems like there's evidence to back that so again now people question did I spend a thousand hours they now that I'm giving you the facts do you question that I spent a thousand hours I've spent sent another two thousand hours looking at peer-reviewed research since then if you say you have I don't have no reason to disbelieve it's a lot of time it's a lot of ten thousand hours is a lot of time like what was it Lane Lane Norton said that you should probably have gotten a PhD I think well I don't think that's the case I think there's people a lot smarter than me that are making these scientific Matt that amount of hours of research I've estimated that I've done conserved estimate I've done since then about three thousand hours cuz once I started making the film and during that then I didn't anyway I believe you so anywhere else so can i twelve analogues in the soil that aren't absorbed and utilized like true b12 right can we admit the two things the things that we've you touched on so far you you got wrong absolutely that it's proven that cattle do receive b12 under whatever circumstances I don't know whether it's because they're grass-fed or grain fed I'm assuming they're feedlot animals that don't get proper nutrients from soil right don't get proper new if you're getting these grain Feld fed soybean fed cattle and they're just pouring this dried-out shit into a bucket these animals are not grazing and they're likely deficient and a lot of different things okay that's like this also they've always been supplementing their diet with mineral supplement with vitamin E and that's the funny people like oh well let's just take the extreme end of a plant-based raw vegans right so people say oh well vegans have to take a supplement or guess what you're supplementing anyway you're just doing it in the regular eating that kind of 99% of the yeah whatever so so the vast majority so well you know people are getting it you're supplementing you're not just somebody b12 you don't amending D in I'm getting it from someone who supplements it in the feed of the animals and then you get it that exactly generally not if you're eating grass fed beef not if you're eating shellfish you loved her ass fed beef can you just admit that you made instead about those things b12 in the cattle and I mean either a third point so we had the b12 in cattle you had that the use of no average you said there was zero evidence about that you said there was no evidence about being able to get it from watering and from dirt which again I proved to be for you to be wrong and the third thing you said I said that there's no evidence that humans primarily got their b12 from eating from soil and water with no no no I didn't you miss fret you can he's misrepresenting and he's wrong Joe you've gotta admit but in this case well it's clearly wrong about b12 being given to cattle I mean we showed it says before industrial farming farm animals and humans could get b12 by eating clay because of dirt on plant foods or drinking water from rivers or streams you don't think that people will get the idea from hearing that that we never needed to consume animal products to get b12 and we don't also could we could get plenty from eating corral so where is the evidence for that other than the one study that you showed there that that's because most evidence raviga ng's even vegans or solder many these are modern vegans right that's talking about some he's going to things wrong in this because his statement is essentially saying that the reason why we don't get it today is because of so the third point you I said this you took issue with my plan okay and up to 39 percent of people tested including meat-eaters are low in b12 as a result the best way for humans to get enough b12 whether the animal foods or not is simply take a supplement then you said he didn't provide a reference for that so it's hard to check but again a contradict you know mounds of evidence on b12 efficiency so can you bring up slide 50 please Jamie you said that I didn't provide a reference okay but in the bottom left where we put all of the reference whenever I made a claim about the scientific research oh well it's covered by the it'll go away in a second okay okay allegedly yeah okay so first of all there's the reference you claimed we didn't have reference would you admit that you were wrong I missed that okay three times wrong about b12 okay so can we just go into your study sorry your e-book on b12 you basically said I don't know where you got that study from your b12 eBook opened with the exact same study so can you put up slide 51 please Jamie okay is that your ebook on the left yes okay you round it up to 40 but I kept you at 39 okay your lives being specific b12 deficiency is far more common than most healthcare practitioners and the general public realized data from the Tufts University Framingham Offspring study suggests that 40% of people between the age of 26 and 83 have plasma b12 levels in the low normal range range at which many experience neurological symptoms that was the opening statement of your b12 ebook and you claimed that where you couldn't find the evidence of that study I know disagreement that b12 deficiency is an issue I talked about that on my website that's not that's not what you said on the last time you want rose podcast you said I don't know you didn't provide a reference for that so it's hard to jack but it contradicts the evidence if that's not reflective of the preponderance of evidence why did you open your ebook with it it's not right okay so there's two different issues here one is do omnivores get b12 deficiency right do yes they do okay and 40 people tested in this study which is where you reference right Chan there are many I'm not saying this study is bad but you say look at all of you said I didn't provide a reference for you did you do you write you're on ebooks by the way I do and you don't remember that study no I write a lot do you know how you have any idea how many articles I've written over the years all right you know do you remember every study from every article I don't know right trainer and that's the thing do you not feel like I'm a combative trainer you yourself recognize that you're not a nutrition expert right you said that at the beginning I'm not a nutritionist I have master's level training in nutrition so I mean so be 12 is 2 is that specifically me like master's level training and nutrition right thank you Joe well in California acupuncturist have a four year master's program which includes a lot of medical sciences and nutrition research methodology etc because we're considered primary care providers in the state of California so the training is a lot different than it is in other places so there's the question of can omnivores develop b12 deficiency yes they can if you go and look at the rest of the ebook it's because of things like SIBO arranges you'll actually set higher ranges of what would be considered potentially deficient right you'll say like three four hundred might be deficient so that would mean that even more people were deficient right now I'm not arguing that vegans can be more deficient in omnivores but can I just go to slide 52 can I go to slide 52 so what is that what is the question here if you're not arguing no I'm just well physically does not be more it's more common I'm pointing out that you as that is what it clinically makes the difference if someone is b12 deficient I'll get then then I think I'm not prepared to get to that I will get to that you said that like the four or five claims that I made about b12 or patently false I've already pointed out three of the things that you got wrong out of the five and you are the one that like is recommending and telling people what to eat I am a combatives trainer and my facts in this case are this doesn't change anything about the factors I'm recommending nation is still that people get enough b12 and that they are less likely to do that on a vegetarian and vegan diet and there's lots of studies showing that for Canon omnivore developed b12 deficiency absolutely I see it nearly all of the people that not the vast majority no no no no I didn't say that the vast majority of that 40% or meat-eaters you referenced you didn't reference the story because there are more meat-eaters in the general population that has nothing to do with the fact that I'm not arguing but we've got all of these studies about homocysteine 9 out of 10 reviews that have shown higher homocysteine levels and vegans to the point that he made last time I'll never get the rebut okay so when you reference the Framingham study you didn't link to the study you link to an article from the us theory about the study and that study said oddly the research has found nois again this is the opening statement of your e8 book references this study but you felt you didn't mention this part oddly the research has found no association between plasma b12 levels and meat poultry and fish intake even though those foods supply the bulk of b12 in the diet it's not because people aren't eating enough meat to get that b12 Tucker said it's the vitamin isn't getting absorbed so is that so this backs up my claim that the safest way to get b12 is to take a supplement now Chris will just say so 60 can I just finish on this point nobody can rebut everyone so your claim was what people can just go and get so you agree that so um you know I would say that vegans that don't supplement and omnivores there's a lot more deficiency in vegans right like it sickens it's a nutrient of concern that vegans should be cautious all right yeah so but that you even if you don't accept the 40% number even though that you said that I didn't say I didn't accept that it doesn't matter whether you accept it or not it like you've even said that like we should consider higher levels b12 division so it really made even more but doesn't that doesn't really matter the point is that you are saying that rails are going in this they're saying the vitamins not getting absorbed in the b12 also my point was it's safer to just take a b12 supplement and for the general population in the world that is the best recommendation you'll say you can go to your doctors and get a $60 blood test and test would be 12 and then you can decide whether you need a supplement or not they may stop you guys both here why isn't it getting absorbed there is a higher level of vitamin b12 and fish and there's other factors that inhibit the absorption so what are zero is one yeah when likely vegetables conditions but also in our growth in the small intestine so Sojo so basically um but we still have the data about cuz i said the best safest way for everyone to get b12 is to take a supplement well right you say well you can just spend sixty dollars and get a blood test but you've got to recognize in the world not everybody can afford a facility okay so the safest way to get b12 if whether you eat me or not is to get take a b12 supplement we know the surest way let's just all agree on that the surest way is the surest way for sure but then when you've got studies that show you know 11% of omnivores have b12 depletion versus 77% of vegetarians and 92% of vegans you know that's with using whole of Transco Ballymun which is a much more sensitive marker b12 deficiency than serum b12 which is really problematic and then you have nine out of ten comparisons of homocysteine that found higher levels of homocysteine and vegetarians and omnivores and higher levels and vegans compared to vegetarians and homocysteine is also more sensitive marker than serum b12 so there's four stages of b12 deficiency and serum b12 will only go down out of range in the fourth and final stage of b12 deficiency so these other studies that I shared on the last show we are looking at holo Transco Ballymun which was the most sensitive marker b12 depletion it's not technically the deficiency at that point and then you have homocysteine and methylmalonic acid that are more sent less sensitive than holo Transco bellmen but more sensitive than serum b12 okay okay can you bring up slide 54 please okay and I need to show you so not only if you got all the facts wrong so far about b12 or my claims you said that they were all false and they weren't false right every claim that I made so far was backed up by science and you have admitted that you made mistakes okay so this is your slide this is your slide right this is because this is how I can show these handpicking these studies to make his claim you said that 92% of vegans were deficient in let's read what it says his b12 depletion among alamo omnivores vegetarians and vegans vegans now we got to remember that most people are probably listening versus Wow sorry yeah okay so vegans 92 percent it says 77 vegetarians 77% and omnivores 11 percent for b12 depletion but that study showed it was more like 40 percent of depletion even across the board I'm not trying to compare the two okay I'm just trying to say your case by using the study is that 90 percent of vegans are deficient in b12 and omnivores an efficient okay didn't deplete it whatever I'm not trying to pick apart this study I agree with this study okay okay can you just go to the next slide please Chris I think it's slide 55 okay this is from the study okay this is from 16 years ago by the way and a very small study from 16 years ago and this is why I show you that he's hand picking the data that he uses and this is where I go back to the fact that it's about the interpretation of the totality of evidence and you can't really rely on something that's not a nutrition expert hand picking studies to suit their bias so in sub this is what it said in subjects who did not consume vitamins the levels were what Chris said right 11 percent in omnivores 70 percent and so I would agree like if you couldn't get b12 anywhere you should incorporate some animal foods into your diet fat okay but let's look at some other studies so slide 56 and I'm only choosing a few I'm sure certainly they're in my favor and I'm not saying that vegans don't have lower b12 levels because some people don't supplement right but it's like you I'm showing it you hadn't picked a study from 16 years ago slide 56 from and this is for a new study from 2018 with twice the sample size of one's an eighth you know people now know usually two b12 supplement the studied markers indicate a generally sufficient cobalamin status independently of the diet preferences lacto-ovo vegetarian or vegan slide 57 now this is a study that looked at runners in May of 2019 really current and it feels like you might not have the most current data because you said to me in your email that you this nutrition is only one part of what you do and you have lots of other things that you're doing right so slide 57 this is comparing vegans vegetarians and omnivores and these are runners yeah and recreational educational yeah all three groups showed an adequate biomarker status of b12 related parameters and then flied 58 it would be and this one not only backs up my point about vegans but also and plant-based leaders but also the supplement is better so the vitamin b12 status of supplement users of vegans and omnivores who is higher compared to the non supplement users and a higher proportion of nonstop news's had b12 parameters outside the reference range you know they were low so again that's more evidence that people it's a good idea to supplement in general because you just have higher levels and after another consensus recommendations after you get over 50 you have lower engines it's a water soluble vitamin anyway yeah but after 50 you lose intrinsic factor so you can't absorb as much so it's not dangerous to have higher level so yeah it's a good thing to supplement period right every single thing that I said in the b12 payment is true and backed up by so Jamie bring on slide 59 for me if we're looking at totality of evidence let's look at more evidence totally but again I'm not playing those free studies out say there's not more I'm saying that you hand-picked a study where vegan time picker study James there's many studies here in vitamins and I agree so we agree that people on plant-based diets take vitamin b12 actually said and we agree that most people are getting their b12 supplement in any way just indirectly through animals fair enough fair enough if you follow the diet that these animals were on which is the most and again I would say look if you want to eat 95 percent plants and you know how common it is for them to supplement animal diet would be 12 is it a rare thing with cattle it's lower because there's a lot of a lot but much it's not rare but it's lower but it's not super rare because a lot of soil is deficient in cobalt and cows need to consume the cobalt to manufacture the b12 in their in their room so it's more of a side effect of mineral and neutral deflation also but not for pigs and chickens and that's what's up so vegans have higher homocysteine levels than omnivores Donna attempt comparisons found higher are homocysteine levels in vegetarians and omnivores and higher levels in vegans and vegetarians right a blintz of hyper homocysteine units home assistant emia among vegetarians may actually be higher than that among non vegetarians already diagnosed with heart disease so that's 9 of 10 comparisons that's not handpicking one study that's 9 out of 10 comparisons that have been done on this topic right and the out like you said before we shouldn't just look at the markers we should look at the outcomes right vegans and vegetarians with higher homocysteine levels do not have increased risk of cardiovascular disease or diabetes or death from those or from cancer I didn't make the claim that they do we're talking about b12 and homocysteine being a marker right and I'm Chris I am showing that you picked a study from 2016 which have a test very small sample size that was ten comparisons right there I am saying that when you came to b12 all of the statements that I made in the film were true and you said that they were patently false and you were wrong I didn't Joe come on now listen I've come in here correct right because I've come in here and people saying oh what are you gonna say to that debunk Chris did not debunk the film he made misrepresentations about claims and he got things factually wrong well he certainly seems to have gotten it factually wrong that animals particularly cows are not given b12 supplements he certainly seems to have gotten it factually wrong that at least some of the b12 that people would be able to get in the past but I got from water and soil and the $0.40 of people are division really well and for the best way to get b12 is this element so yes and every but you're wrong so so the thing is I have proven that he got three or four things factually wrong I'm every twelve right and I am a combatives instructor okay that right I'm just saying I'm putting myself down I understand I'm not like a super intelligent guy but you are so you are very intelligent I've said that before what you did is you did research on these very important subjects when you acquired a lot of data so this is what people do when they go to school I mean it's like the difference when is educated and not educated is not whether or not they go to a specific turtle it's whether or not they absorb the information and when they study and yeah you said you studied a thousand hours before the film and 3,000 cents that you're you're obviously educated you understand what you're talking about so so anyway you've got things factually wrong about 312 so to the people listening or watching do you really want to put the interpretation of the data in the hands of someone that just got so many things wrong about b12 well he got things wrong about humor assertions about me still stand that vegetarians and vegans have much higher rates of b12 depletion or deficiency than omnivores the bulk of this there's no disagreement these are vegetarians and anyone over 50 and moat like the safest way and you're now disputing the safest way to get b12 is to take a supplement it's the best way to surest way to get b12 but it's not necessary for many people right for people that can afford blood tests which is know most of the works like you will live with sitting in in America in a nice light air-conditioned room and we know we've got cars and we drove here we can afford to go to the doctor like the best way to get b12 is to take a supplement period and you're wrong if you think otherwise if you can afford you're sure if you can afford a around the world that's expensive right here's the thing if you such a diet that gives you the ample amount of b12 and you don't need you don't need a supplement sure you're saying is that blood tests are expensive so you should take an expensive supplement no they're not expensive v12 no it's like if you bite and bollocks like two dollars a year but no I'm not yeah if you're buying boo dollars a year yeah you've got it but the trick is you gotta like you'd have to split it with a bunch of people because it's like year's worth of supply but anyways right so so no the argument is that like I said and I've also shown it to the world I put two bucks here if I gotta hook a lot of people up I've also shown that in the study that you presented in your eBook stated that like they weren't absorbing it as well from an employer's I'm not saying does not be 12 in animal parts and also we have to remember one last thing that the b12 that our people are getting in animal products it was supplemented in the first place in some indicators in the vast majority in grass-fed Science in the vast majority of animal products the people are reading b12 a supplement and so I'm just saying the safest way to get b12 is the supplement in the vast majority sad true yeah you think the vast majority of people are eating wild caught fish and I don't know how many animals are actual chicken all of the chickens that's chickens chickens are omnivores they're not fed omnivorous diets run most part unless they're free-range chickens if you give it ever seen a chicken fuck up a mouse it's pretty stunning yeah yeah they're carnivorous little monsters then chickens and when you get them and you get those eggs and the eggs are like a really dull yellow those are animals reading grain only those are vegetarian chickens that's not what they want to eat what they want to eat his worms they're not living in the nose though right in their natural state little hopping time they don't need to have supplementation this is sort of an argument against vegetarian diets for chickens really because no chickens aren't really supposed to eat that way yeah and feedlot for beef for feedlot either can we get the protein because I think sure miss protein then we've like we have plenty of time cool okay twelve you made some excellent points and you definitely cleared up what was what was misrepresented right and it's really why I really appreciate you having me on because that you guys did like a three-hour debunk right and there was just a lot of things were factually wrong and there's more that I can point out okay let's go I really appreciate have me on I appreciate you being and I really appreciate Chris and as long as much as we disagree I really appreciate you coming on and giving me the opportunity and let's talk about I know I'm getting like emotional cool so you don't talk about protein and yes what issues are still Sartre also just the red meat and dairy thing outstanding - oh whether or not red means bad for you yeah we never really cleared that up with protein but let's finish that okay because we really should finish that we can always yeah sure protein cuz I'm sure protein is gonna be a long discussion well I know I think it's gonna happen here so we can talk about red meat showing that like some of the individual things like heme iron for example are shown to be pro-inflammatory and by the way just to back you up pro-inflammatory necessarily correlated with poor health because sometimes things that provide information on has a positive reaction it's an automatic HoMedics stress and so the things like exercise your exercise your career yeah yeah hold me sis right right sure saw no yeah and it's the same thing right he'll sort of try and show that fish you know held the TMAO for example you'll say well how continue meal would be bad we'll get to that we'll get that but let's let's stick meat why things where it meets bad for TM arrow is one of the things okay then read me just like he mine that I showed his inflammatory mine is associated with cardiovascular risks and that he mine is found in me an eating plants in a healthy diet pattern that offsets it absolutely that is their evidence that eating meat by itself is associated with cardiovascular disease nobody ever has eaten meat by itself what about the stories in the coal mine there's no research on that so that's one of my people just eating all meat diet yeah there's not yeah I mean I mean we both agree like let's just create a false dichotomy first if you're if there was a cut like all animal products fire not just carnivore but eggs and all this stuff and then there was a fully plant-based diet supplement would be twelve which one would you advocate if false dichotomy I'd probably check pick the plant diet probably well although I would be concerned about nutrient deficiencies yeah I I've never advocated for a carton the carnivore diet I said as much okay class show that says something about plants right plants are awesome right so we agree on that yeah he's never had anything wrong what all he's ever said was that eliminating all animal products from your diet is probably not healthy unless you follow a very strict routine when you make sure that you have all your bases covered nutritionally that's what Chris has said from the job so now I I would extend that and just say that I don't think there's strong evidence suggesting that including some animal products in your Whole Foods plant-based diet is harmful that's where we vary tremendously could be five percent for some someone who's just eating mostly plant-based diet and they're eating some shellfish and organ meats for the nutrient density or you could have someone who eats more animal products and depends on the person that their needs are I go with that first tough and the second off but just to back up what Joe does slide 62 because I mention this earlier but we didn't put a slide on but I think the graphic again I know mystery listening so if maybe Joe you could describe it to people differences in postprandial inflammatory responses to a modern versus traditional meat meal kangaroo this is kangaroo meat versus beef Waggett Wagyu beef as I pronounce it so so you'd recognize that marks in CRP tnf-alpha and il-6 are inflammatory markers yeah okay good so I just want to point out that yeah if you're gonna eat 90% plants and you're gonna eat the rest of it from animal products I think that wild-caught elk and kangaroo meat stuff like that would be the way to go by far well it just makes it just to show you like there's look at the the that there's about half the information roughly coming from the wild core well that makes sense because well most the time we're dealing with when you're dealing with beef you're dealing with this grain fed unhealthy animal when you're talking about Wagyu beef that is that's a dying animal I mean if you saw a person who's muscle tissue looked like a Wagyu steak you'd be like bro you gotta get on a fucking diet you know I mean really but if you saw like you know an athlete if you looked at an athlete's muscle tissue would look like a piece of elk most likely right look very lean and healthy right dense so anyway I just want to point out that one that shows a couple of things that shows that meat does create information I would like to see this on grass-fed meat yeah so close to this a feedlot not even if it matched the you know the the kangaroo meat we're still seeing information there mm-hmm and yeah and certainly like you said I agree if you're gonna eat animal foods I think it's wise timing wise to eat a lot of plant foods with that those animal foods right definitely animal foods you should eat a lot of plants where there's also a lot of benefits to it in terms of fiber in terms of your mo the bio micro bad yeah there's there's a lot of benefits to having these fermented vegetables as well you know things like kimchi and and having things that provide you with good probiotics either all these things there's great benefit to a lot of plant foods yeah and people on plant-based diets I just end up getting naturally getting more fiber most people are deficient in fiber right if you look at like the Paleolithic period you'd be looking at like maybe a hundred grams of fiber hungry and very high fiber intake and be and plant people on plant-based diets get more fiber than people in on other diets as long as you're eating healthy as we both agree hosta and peace but just to be fair though even in vegans and vegetarians in all of the studies they're still getting more fiber despite the fact that I you and I would agree they're not eating the healthiest diet overall overall vegan overall completely plant-based people are the only people that have four within the recommended BMI range at the most vibrant BMI range body mass index so are you talking about yeah yeah but body mass that's not great it's not a great measure a shitty one right that's not beasts right yeah there's a lot of nonsense I agree generally that if if you look at people who are on a vegetarian or vegan diet and compared with people on the standard American diet and they're gonna have right and people American you take someone who's eating healthy plates of broccoli and kale and also has a piece of grass-fed meat that's what I want to talk conscious diet no I totally agree I course you're gonna see markers like for example the longest study on a paleo diet right there had a two-year follow-up and they had improved they'd lost body fat there and improved blood markers what was really interesting is they were told to eliminate dairy right so you cut out dairy they were told to reduce their amount of or cut out completely processed plant foods like white flour and sugar and all this type of stuff they were told to increase their fruits and vegetables and they were told to increase their meat consumption and they got you know improved health markers all across the board but now now what was interesting is at the end of the two years what they found was that people had not stuck with the meat recommendations so they kept their meat recommendations the same they got out a processed junk food right the trans fats and stuff that you'd all agree we should get out of our diet mmm right they took out milk out of their diet and they increase the amount of plant foods so it's very clear that the benefit did not come from increasing meat consumption it came from increased plant food consumption it is decreasing bullshit right no no is a two-fold thing right you cut out things that are inflammatory and you put in things that are anti-inflammatory you cut out things that are low in antioxidants you incorporate things that are high in antioxidants so that was the the major benefit it wasn't from this from increased meat consumption who's saying it is from increased meat consumption no me no I'm just saying that was the benefit of a Paleo diet going in a more whole food plan and I think that's what everyone says the idea is that you eliminate processed foods you eliminate sugar you really limited these things that are just filled but we know that it's not just it's a two-fold difference when you incorporate whole plant foods there's the opportunity cost so you replace your you're getting rid of crap in my personal opinion and based on the consensus you're replacing both highly processed foods and animal foods and you're incorporating more whole plant foods and that is the scientific consensus is see a predominately plant-based diet you could say the same thing about the benefits you see with vegetarian and vegan studies comparing with standard I agree I agree you're removing a lot of the crap I bought studies have you got comparing a new travois diet to you know a whole food plant-based diet we don't have them so we have to infer and when we infer we have to rely on experts that are experts in their field right we don't we don't turn to Chris and go okay can you tell us more about nutrition anthropology and neurology than all of these experts I think I agree you shouldn't just listen to me but I don't think it's genuine just to suggest that there's a consensus that a whole food plant-based diet is a better choice than a plant-based diet that also contains some animal products we have no Studies on that and we probably won't unfortunately in the near future because right especially those outcomes right forty years yeah they're not good so we I agree that that's hot like again I've said before that we should be getting the vast majority of I calories from whole plant foods I think there's enough in the literature to show and and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recognizes that completely vegan diets are helpful for all the life stages including for athletes I think that there's sufficient evidence to go hundred-percent but I'm not telling people that they should be doing that I'm saying if you can eat whatever they want but I think we both agree that people should be getting out junk food right there's soda and trans fats I don't by the way on trans fats so that's you in the beginning of the show what your position was because that's the fundamental question for me is that is this question that were talking about right now right which is is there sufficient evidence to suggest that you know everybody most people whatever you want to say should be on a hundred percent or even 95 percent plant-based diet versus a plant-based diet that contains some animal products and my argument all along has been no there's not sufficient evidence either you also think that you also think that completely plant-based diet is likely to be nutrient deficient and all these other things do you know his history you know and that's why I think that there's I think there's emotional ties I think you've my history is not relevant yourself you said that I had like burst mood and also said there people acknowledge that there are many successful brigands and vegan athletes even vote the end of one and also you didn't follow the scientific consensus about Plan B starts when you did it so you chose a macrobiotic diet and you chose a raw vegan is just the rigidus two iterations right now why did you choose those when they weren't based on scientific consensus cuz I wasn't this was 20 years ago and I wasn't paying attention to it you traveled around the world and you got sick and you attributed it to the diet which I may or may not I didn't attribute it to the diet that's what I don't even know why we're talking my experience because it is relevant because it shows that like I don't know why you were vegan or vegetarian maybe it was for like animal rights reasons maybe you felt bad for going back to eating meat so now you need to feel proved like the reason that you need to know the reason you need the film is because you've got a massive business selling supplements and protein powders and giving diet advice so after almost does I make very very little money selling supplements genes it's it's basically convenience from my patients that's understand you're saying overweight my business is basically training people right but then being a clinician there's no I have I don't profit from you know selling and like animal product you directly because you advise this diet so the film was very bad for you personally because if people believe to the film which you know like the defense health agency they review the film they don't care about like this myth that we should eat in exactly the same way as our ancestors not the Riva you really ate that way but they don't care about that myth they care that what is gonna be better for warfighter effectiveness and to cut the health care costs of our military so they looked at the science independently you think they're like the defense health agency is full of vegans I mean so you have a film as is neither here nor there for me but that's what we're here for that's what the reason that I'm here is because and the reason that I came when Joe invited me and not I probably tell you that I it took a few invitations to get me here it is just to provide the other side of the the view here it's not because it materially affects me in any way believe me I've got lots of other things as I told you in the email situation so even like my nutrition team they spent full time either consulting elite athletes or military personnel or they're digging into the research I got chief science advisor eight hours a day all he does is dig into the latest research and so what you come you come on to Joe's podcast and you're supposed to like people are supposed to believe that you are the best person to because you say it's about the meta-analysis and you say is about the totality of evidence we agree but you're suggesting is that people should listen to your interpretation of the evidence when you get things factually wrong people should make up their own mind that we have provided and you don't know a basic forest plot is my point because you're not certified and you're not yeah okay I'm again I'm not a specialist in nutrition like I would have liked to have bring my I like to have brought David our chief science advisor who knows a hundred times more about nutrition than either and you're coming on here telling people what to eat you said yourself you're not an expert in nutrition and you don't know how to read the nutritional data let's talk about some of the claims okay protein let's talk about protein oh we talked about the film let's throw out the protein so is that fair we should get it right okay so can I just just so I understand your position and I'm sorry for getting worked up like that no whatever like I'm like an attorney trying to interrogate you but I feel like I spent a lot of time digging into research I had the research checked in checked and checked again I had the research check to make sure that it was not cherry picking that it was reflective of the preponderance of evidence but who was checking it were they people who were not advocates of a whole food plant-based diet exclusively or were they not bull like because all of the experts in the film are people who are clearly aligned with this that person and abused them because they're aligned with the consensus and no on an over half of them I thought you just agreed that there is not a consensus that a hundred percent plant-based diet is better than a diet that includes a lot of plans for what some animal products so so where were the experts that would represent that point of view plant-based yeah I agree it doesn't have to be a hundred percent the film said plant-based diet I tell you why we only interviewed vegans over the athletes right the ones that actually spoke on screen in Arnold is not vegan he doesn't drink dairy thinks it's for babies and he's cut down meat by 80 percent but all the people I mean you know nate is not a hundred percent vegan he's on a largely plant-based diet eats a bit of seafood and stuff like that but all these yeah eggs as well so all the reason that we only put and by the way we did interview Loren Cordain and Rob wolf and I can get to that as well if you want because the anthropologist laughed in their faces claims that you know I'm talking about scientists who published sand these you know who are on the team otherwise the papers that I've shared yeah it's like new tracks who are funded by the industry we can get no not new true disingenuous to claim that all of the research that that I've shared is industry do you want to ignore your claim that like you know the recent study that just came out and we were getting off track but the recent survey that just came out that said that red meat and processed meat is totally fine right like you really want to go with that like it to me it feels like you don't have your finger on the pulse honestly I'm not trying to be rude I think you probably know a lot about you feel about that study well in the Nutri rex study the study that said that ready there's a new trek study okay so in the annals of internal medicine the day before the film came out six studies exonerating red meat and processed meat all from the same company but apparently giving recommendations well guess what exponent and nutria Rex and companies like that are not the ones that give public recommendations on what people should be eating number one okay and we talked about this in the film with exponent nutria Rex is like another exponent so if you look at their recommendations first of all a Frank who Frank who is now the chair of nutrition Harvard he took what will its place said the panels bring around conditions that adults should continue to their red meat consumption habits is highly irresponsible Walter Willett said it's the most egregious abuse of data he's ever seen and if you want to follow their recommendations if you could put up slide 92 so they did the same thing in 2017 for the sugar industry so there was a meta-analysis in the annals of each state they you mean the new terracing so it was so Bradley Johnston is the director and co-founder of new Tourette's and the first author of the paper that we're talking about for red meat okay that just exonerated red meat apparently and processed me so this is the same company says that the said President there seems to be no reliable evidence indicating that any of the recommended daily caloric thresholds for sugar intake are strongly associated with negative health effects so there you get a meta-analysis so English don't worry about your intake of sugar at all that was what their meta-analysis the collusion it came to and then two years later the day before the cameras kept film him out and do you really think that's a coincidence do you think that the so let me tell you something okay the of our email subscribers do you know the email address of the person that opens and views our emails the most from the beef checkoff program and they've been doing that since we started so they sign up for a mailing list they look at when the film is coming out and you don't you think it's a coincidence that the day before as that film comes out they release a paper exonerating red meat and cancer and the same say so if you're going to buy into the neutral rate study about red meat and cancer then to be fair you've also got to buy into their conclusions about sugar because they were paying out tell you who they were paid by okay so so the financial support for that paper was funded by the technical it's caught this now listen to this sounds great the Technical Committee on dietary carbohydrates of I LSI North America and I as high as the International Life Sciences Institute sounds pretty legit right so it's members include coca-cola Hershey Company Pepsi company and Red Bull and a bunch of others folks looking out for your best interests that should go okay sorry okay with problem if that was the only you just you claimed all this recent study and I honestly again no disrespect you're busy with lots of other things you run a successful business consulting people selling stuff I get you don't have the time you you weren't able to read a basic forest plot to look at statistical significance and confidence intervals okay I just don't think that the you're the one to interpret the data so the reason you don't have a you you haven't seen the hundreds of really respected scientists that have come out saying that this new Trek study and by the way there's an investigation into the annals of internal medicine because of this for accepting this stuff from neuter X but if you're going to accept the meta-analysis on red meat and on processed meat for cancer then you've also got to accept the 2017 studies meta-analysis you accept the source if you accept the source the only meta-analysis that showed no association between red meat and heart disease or a cancer that would be first i'm talking about the one that you cited you made out this is like okay say second of all I pointed out the funding industry funded research is four to eight times more likely right yeah to do and going back to that dairy one by the way do you know that when they did their meta-analysis they they doubled and tripled and quadrupled up because when they looked at when the the meta-analysis that analyzed the meta analyses the multimers has included the studies multiple times you see one saying yeah because they took it into account each time and so when the industry floods the scientific research with their funded studies again if they find a study it doesn't their studying other studies and and those the same conclusion adding those on as if it's an additional studies that we're saying no it's so look if your industry fund studies and an only did you decide if you're an indie Fitness tree or dairy industry are you going to put up studies that aren't in your favor no right and you also you don't have to you spin it and so what you do is you if you want to make beef look better if you want to exaggerate the fat look okay or if you wanna make cholesterol okay you can you know you can switch things around the study to make it look good if you want to look at eggs and for example and I don't want to get like it continued with free a debate about cholesterol and saturated fat but if you if you give if you go from 10 eggs a week to 12 eggs a week it doesn't raise your serum cholesterol so that's how they did the studies but if you go from no eggs a week to one egg a week it does increase your because there's something called the cholesterol plateau so what the industry does is it tricks you it does I'm but then when you look at eggs and outcomes like cardiovascular disease you don't see what you do I was just making a point that industry-funded studies sway the results of the meta-analysis right I think that's I think that's fair and it's done with the sugar industry and it's done with it was done with tobacco and again I'm not comparing the the amount of increased risk of cancer from diet that was never claimed that was made it was the PlayBook that is used by the drug industry by the meat industry by the sugar you know by the sugar industry by the dairy industry so even though your film came out of these studies came out right before you film it's kind of proving your point that this same company that tried to exonerate the sugar industry is also if you're gonna accept that if you're gonna cite that as evidence and they're gonna cite that the fact the reason I think because like you said you're so busy on many other things is I just don't think that your fingers on the devil's not the only study no I know it's not I know there's other meta analyses 2010 15 we can look at them you know if let's do that okay let's look at those studies so but I don't they're funny you know they're including studies that are funded by industry and so unless you can pass those out and say is that really saying we can't rely on any study no I didn't say that Romeo I said that I said that that you would really need to look at the way in which a study is designed to see if it was viable and you also have to replicate the studies you know it make studies have to be replicated and so what I'm saying is so they said can I just finish the last point now like as sure as many studies as you want because again you can show as many times as you want you can't prove that you're not hand picking them to suit your bias you are the one that quoted this study it shows that your fingers not on the pulse because hundreds of like top scientists have written letters or joined in the same letter to the Al's Internal Medicine asking for those things to be retracted and there's now an investigation into the annals of internal medicine yet you are silent radiation it doesn't prove nothing as I was aware of that controversy and I'm you can read forest plus the controversy is not surprising if red meat has been demonized for as long as it has been and then a study comes out which exonerates it it would be entirely expected that there would be controversy so and do you know who that study was funded by but can you just pick up slide 93 just there's just to show that any rate so just it's not just me saying this I mean the site you know scientists do to try to meet guidelines didn't report past food as you died so there because remember most people are listening scientists who discredited meet guidelines didn't report pass food industry ties the lead researcher Bradley C Johnston said he was not required to report his past relationship with a powerful industry trade group under what that trade group is but if he scrolled down I didn't tell you in the first one the sugar one it was that Pepsi and always that although they made it they make a non-profit with a fancy sounding name right and then they back it all with industry funding same with the the meat study that that's why I don't know Stan why he'd use it if you were being objective are you saying all these are the other studies but why name this one as though it's got validity because so do you feel like they cut they concocted this study and released it right before your films I think it's likely that it was tied into the background but it doesn't matter whether it is I'm showing that to to to present that study as evidence when the consensus of the scientific researchers is against that study that is calling for an investigation as a spirit to been retracted the co-author of the paper who's part of the leadership team at nutria Rex he's the Vance Chancellor of Dean and agriculture and life sciences at Texas A&M right Texas A&M is partnered with the beef checkoff program right and as part of neighbors and this is also discussed in the New York Times slide 94 and there's actually there goes a lot deeper than that it actually goes back to Brazilian government but let you slide 94 by defining foragers closing about research group that discounted risks of red meat has ties to program partly backed by beef industry so I know right so this doesn't necessarily mean what they're saying is incorrect and this is where it gets slippery right because if they found things that happen to be correct and they release it but they release it from a shitty company that has said things chose it and picked which studies and analyses to because you've had plenty of time just explain this yeah to get to your point Chris you agree with the founding with the the conclusion of that study and you think that the evidence points that there's many studies that point to the idea that red meat is not in fact the culprit and the culprit is when you're looking at these epidemiology studies that you're looking at the overall diet of these people and asking them do they eat meat you're not asked him what is the quality of the food they eat yeah so I agree that conflicts of interests are a problem and I and you know that the editorial that was published in Annals alongside of this study said this is sure to be controversial but it's based on the most comprehensive review of the evidence to date because that review is inclusive those who seek to dispute it will be hard-pressed to find appropriate evidence so analyses had studies covering millions of participants over 34 years there are several other medicine analyses that have been done over the past few years so I don't know the best way to show these because I've got them in a Google Doc so 2017 let's see if I can give you the title Danny maybe you can google it or something contemporary review of the relationship between red meat consumption and cardiovascular risk quote from that study the review concluded quote recent findings demonstrated that despite the presence of heme iron and carnitine red meat does not significantly increase cardiovascular risk when it is assumed and recommended doses you have 2014 meta-analysis of thirteen studies again these are this one Jamie is called association between total processed red and white meat consumption all cause cardiovascular disease heart disease mortality and this is a good example of what you were just saying Joe there was a slight increased association between red meat consumption and cardiovascular mortality and then at the end no no significant associations observed between any type of meat and and heart disease mortality results of the present meta-analysis indicate that processed meat consumption could increase mortality these results should be interpreted with caution due the high heterogeneity observed in most of the analyses as well as the possibility of residual confounding meaning healthy user bias lippi in a meta-analysis of eleven studies of red meat consumption and heart disease concluded the quote the current literature data does not support the existence of a clear relationship between a large intake of red meat an increased risk of myocardial ischemia and then this is one of the largest that was done let me give you the title of this Jamie red and processed meat consumption and risk of incident coronary heart disease that should bring it up that's by Misha at all conclusion consumption of processed meat but not read mean is associated with higher incidence of heart disease the and diabetes these you know so there's a bunch of meta analyses that have been done over the years that reached the same conclusion and we could you know look at the same same this is for heart disease but there are also some for cancer so it's not just that study there are many others right as well on the other side so you can present studies here so the people that's true there are analyses on the other side right you can present the data for the people listening and it appears like the proponents is that but your guidelines for diet they're not in alignment for saturated fat they're not in diet for cholesterol they're not in diet for the amount of carbohydrates for normal people then in line with the consensus for college athletes I've said a range of carbohydrates could be a present all I'm saying is you are not in alignment with the scientific consensus and you claim that we cherry-pick in the film right but you handpick studies to back up your bias not to mention that we've pointed out that the studies in those meta analyses some of them are heavily funded by industry not saying you should throw all those out but you don't have the wherewithal to assess the studies in the meta-analysis because you point out yourself that you can't even read a forest plot so he reads conclusions right he reads conclusions in writing but has not looked at the actual data so you haven't been able to establish when I was like spent the first thousand hours I would look at the whole paper and then I would look at each author and I would dig into each author to see where their funding was from and I'm telling you that the industry is funding studies to sway things in their favor and you point the shows that you don't have your fingers no doubt about that why didn't you point to those last time you why did you point to an industry funded study that everyone else before why why point out in the new direct study you know when it was clearly invalid the scientists way way way not clearly invalid it wasn't representative of a scientific evidence they they hand-picked the studies that were including they used the polemic they used a grade methodology you know what the great method idea okay and it was and you think that's appropriate for assessing food rather than for some nutrition organizations biases in quoting well very few it's not the scientific consensus so what is a tional Academy of Johnny just basically they use the methodology that wasn't appropriate for looking at what they were looking at it's just the same with the Siri Torino and the Chowdhury studies they the the the the what they were looking for could never have been found the association between saturated fat and cholesterol levels it could never been found based on the methodology that they used but again we still have with that we still haven't got to protein and I so so the it's absolutely true I've never claimed the daren't studies showing correlating red meat with so you show the ones that you never have claimed that and I've said those those studies are highly problematic for all of the reasons that we I've talked about on the last show and on previous shows healthy user bias problems with data collection food frequency questionnaire z' relative versus absolute risk confounding like you know not looking at physical activity and the biggest confounder of all not looking at diet quality so even the other diet quality because I know you like to use Matt Leland's work which has never been published which obviously was built in what you might use Madeline's reaction with Jack well I'm talking about food patterns like healthy food pattern eating density which is a part of diet quality you have referred to Madeline's work we're going we can unhappy talk about that I'm tired I'm still talking about the the research on read me being problematic because it doesn't consider the overall diet path right but again your views first of all you don't have the wherewithal to interpret the scientific evidence which is very clear that you don't understand far plots there how can you be we you recognize that you have to look at the totality of evidence and you have to be able to dig in and look at where the things are pointing you yourself said I am NOT an expert in nutrition and you said again I'm not either and which is I don't even know why we're sitting there having this discussion honestly like we should get some real experts in well we could do that too and I can you know we can you can you can point on your side who do you think the experts are and I'll point on our side who we think the experts are I mean I don't even like to say sighs really because to me it's not really my position like I think your position is a lot better than the standard American diet the opposition is really like the carnivores right well your position yeah that's the opposite your position though is in defense of your film ants to his critique and how do you think I'm doing so far well with b12 was a homerun for sure well I think there's lots of other things but well the thing about we still haven't really shown whether or not there's evidence that is see that's the problem with all this data and you're dealing with these epidemiology studies you it's it's so hard to figure out what's what I agree what what it what are these people eating when people are they drinking are they doing drugs like what what is the overall health quality base diagram that's why you're looking so much of it is based on the diet so that's why we look at scientific consensus could you just bring up slide one come on do you agree with him where you dispute what he's saying about scientific consensus would you agree that you're not and lying to scientific consensus my my general dietary recommendations yeah probably some aspects of it but not all aspects but but generally I mean come on I don't think that what do you think the scientific consensus Chris what do you think the scientific consensus is when it comes to dietary recommendations well it's changed a little bit in the past few years definitely was low-fat although that is changing a little bit iris recognition of different fats different you know may have different effects etcetera would be limiting red meat would be limiting saturated fat limiting cholesterol eating a lot of plants and Whole Foods limiting you know limiting sugar and the science this is scientific insight but all that please what is that based on what do you think that's based on that's based on you know mostly observational research and then some mechanistic studies and RCTs but even RCTs if you're comparing again like some of the studies that are cited for example in David Goldman's papers they're comparing a standard American diet with a plant-based diet so in in a random in a crossover trial randomized trial that's not comparing apples to apples but anyways to get back to your question I would say about half of what I of what I recommend is consistent if we use the factors that I just said eating Whole Foods and not eating processed and refined foods limiting sugar all of that the areas where I differ are red meat saturated fat but not always I think they're that's individual and depends on how people actually respond to saturated fats and eggs and total fat legumes and grains I think they're they can be part of a healthy diet if they're well tolerated and you do think that like the research to trying a whole food plant-based diet versus ten American diet people are getting improvements on that yeah some people I found don't do well with grains legumes especially people with digestive issues so you know for them maybe not but I don't I've never argued well that grains and legumes are you know like I'm not a paleo rhetoric paleo kind of advocate and you pointed out last time I think it was wrong to Patrick that talked about it too hopefully I watched your podcast and you know you pointed out about these 4matic stresses that we talked about earlier and so you know these people that are talking about anti nutrients and food they're red herring right because I don't know what they're talking about and yeah it's it's a really common thing and they're basically look the landscape of food is enormous the landscape of dietary requirements and of health its enormous and you know just you talking about spending thousands and thousands of hours combing over this research can attest to that yeah and Chris I think you can as well I mean we're this is a very complicated issue and there's a certain amount of bio of bio variability different people have different physical requirements different nutritional requirements but I think we're trying to zoom in on what is actually bad for you and what is actually good for you I think we agree on I think we all agree everyone here agrees that the you you basically need a certain amount of vegetables in your diet you need vitamins whether you can get those vitamins from supplements like b12 supplements or whether you can get it from the actual food that you eat there's certain dietary requirements and I think we're all in agreement on sure I think where we disagree on is whether or not red meat is bad for you and what kind of red meat were talking about and why you know why is it bad and what what is it bad when it sits alone or is it bad when you're eating it with vegetables which is what we're recommending in the first place so if we're recommending that you eat it with vegetables and these vegetables do have the sort of balancing effect of the negative aspects or the perceived negative aspects even though there's no evidence that those negative aspects when eaten by itself because we don't really have long-term but studies on carnivore diet people so we I think mostly we're in agreement here you're you're defending your film rights a bunch of claims untrue well the most proven with the b12 issue that he said some things that made you look like you were saying things were inaccurate and in my uninformed and he's done that with a bunch of other things too though okay and sorry you did it with protein can I just show what the consensus actually is on diet yes okay so can you just bring a slide one and I mentioned this earlier but I didn't show it so so the World Health Organization recommends that people eat a nutritious diet based on a variety foods or agenting mainly from plants rather than animals which you said you could agree with right because it's like not vegan as a Saudi like maybe from plant yeah I mean like the proportions are a question mark there and then the actually slide 3 would be the FAO the Food and Agricultural organization thing i appropriately planned this is academy of nutrition Dietetics okay appropriately appropriately planned vegetarian including vegan diets are healthful nutritionally adequate and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases that's a weird the appropriately planned is a weird way of phrasing what it is and it's also a little bit in fact because it sort of it sort of it sort of says like with you if you eat an omnivorous diet it doesn't need to be probably plan to do whatever the hell we want yeah that's a good point these diets are appropriate for all stages of the lifecycle including pregnancy lactation infancy childhood adolescence older adulthood and for athletes so these women that you hear that are getting arrested because their babies are malnourished because they're following a vegan diet appropriately planned is the key said that at the beginning of the last of the show yeah there I acknowledge that they're very healthy high-performing vegans you know people and plant-based diets right if they do it right and there's someone to take your advice what they have to do that right and plan that if you probably you got to have a plan right got a plan to go to the grocery store yeah it's time to get the right for there are some nutrients that are of you know potentially bigger concern I think that we just show two more slides on the proposal of evidence so a slide very completely agree with appropriately planned okay recognize that if you as long as you plan it while you have b12 you get a wide variety of foods okay it's the same one no no the slide off I meant for omnivores too like here we go we want people to be thinking about what they're totally and most people are eating a bunch of crap so here we go the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics the American Heart Association and the 2015 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend appropriately planned vegetarian diets for improved health that that's a statement by Frank who is the current chair of nutrition Harvard looking at plant-based diets and cardiovascular health and then slide to is the FAO sorry I got the slides in the wrong order there's the FAO I don't know what messed up with the doesn't look like that on my page anyway household should select predominantly plant-based diets rich in a variety of vegetables and fruits pulses and legumes which again a lot of people on the Paleo diet would and minimally processed are key staple foods the evidence that such diets will prevent or delay a significant proportion of non-communicable diseases is consistent so all I'm pointing out here is that you're not in line with the consensus of science and that you don't have the ability to read the papers that's why I'm sorry I'm in line with pretty much everything that has been shown just just then there's only one of only one of the paragraphs that you mentioned even mentioned animal products and one and it didn't recommend excluding them entirely so so you would point out that one you agree that predominantly plant-based is the way to go and that as long as you plan it appropriately vegan diets can be helpful because say yes I agree I said as much that vegan diets can be helpful okay on the first show on the first thing show if they're appropriately planned and I don't know you know predominantly plant-based again if you look at the plate and we see mostly plants there and then animal products then yeah it's not something about sometimes calories I don't you know so do you agree by calories then no okay so you're not in the line with the science certificates a consensus okay I'm not in alignment with that this is not known they're predominately getting your calories from plants which is the scientific consensus you're not with saturated fat and cholesterol and a bunch of other things heme iron but anyway so can we get a protein because we really here she felt like to defend his critiques of the fence because you know honestly I've got people that watch the film change their diet started feeling better watch this podcast where he debunked the film then called me a lot you know like write me a message on instagrams and you are full of shit you shouldn't read comments anyway I'm just saying like it's a shame that you have someone that doesn't really have the capability to really understand the literature coming on here and people buying into it talking smack on the film where you met he made a bunch of factually wrong comments so I just talked about let's get in the flow thing for sure and again I like I'm not even the one that's qualified like if I'm beating him on some arguments like what do you think you would get if you had a real nutrition expert in here I'm not qualified like dizzy I would like to see it okay so can I just your concerns with the protein and just make sure I'm understanding your argument protein quantity and protein quality and within protein quality it would be the amino acid profile and the digestibility is that fair though those are your issues with the consideration of protein so important we're on the same page for what we're discussing right so I I just don't know where and again not saying that it's not possible to get enough protein quantity right and quality of and mix of amino acids in if you're really on it right but here's well planned just like your any other diet was well planned I think it's less it's less likely that you'll get protein right on a completely vegan diet without a diet that contains animal protein it's more complicated it's not it's not more complicated what it is is if you just you don't know yeah if you don't know what you're doing and you've been eating in a certain way for 30 years and you slowly take your meat off the plate and you only eat what was left from the plate you're gonna have a balance of knowledge and understanding about that is pretty low in my experience right no I agree that's why I think people people need more resources to make better informed decisions about their health about their exercise and so on I agree what's your position on what he said okay so you could this is I'm just quoting you from last time now you you really put me through a lot of hours of extra work now it's gone from like three thousand to like 3100 you know anyway so there's just so much wrong with what you said that I just had to go in to eat every single topic but anyway so three ounces of you said three ounces of 90% lean ground beef do you think the animal fat is not good for you because all of a sudden now Chris is a so he says no no a protein car what was the statement in the film the film ground beef not retaining that for protein content no no the statement he felt was the most common no it's not that's not actually not a tease yeah anywhere from and grass-fed beef which is what I advocate okay that rights generally leaner okay great was specifically talking about protein cars no I know that's what we're gonna go into right okay so doesn't I mean the ground beef okay so basically what I had said and I might become of the exact words that I said but I pretty much do as I'd record it a number of times so one cup of cooked lentils or a peanut butter sandwich has about as much protein as three ounces of beef or three large eggs that was what I said okay I might be off in a word but that was what I said okay I said about as much protein okay so you go on to say three ounces of 90% lean ground beef well already what you did is you picked Lina beef but you know even though you don't advocate for that you you you don't think the animal fat is bad so what you did is you picked the leanest beef anyway you say has 24 grams of protein I'm not sure what your sources but he does advocate for fed beef grass-fed beef is leaner so he's talking about what he does advocate for the Dylan make senses right three ounces of ground lean meat okay but the thing is the point in the film most people aren't saying that most people yeah you were saying what we said in the film right I think you're saying regular asian-american ground beef was much less about what we're trying to point this thing was not to say this is the best foods theory or just so much in comparison the regular stuff that you eat like a peanut butters how much people think no protein at all right I think you know people think that plants have no protein the first question you get asked or where do you get your protein so I said it's got about as much protein so you so then on by the way I'd listen to your 30-minute podcast trying to take down the film which came out before you on Joe's podcast and you said that you and you sort of backed this up I don't know this happened like from one article and it got spread and spread and spread that someone said you need five tablespoons of peanut butter to get the same amount of protein in what world for someone and you changed your tune a little bit when you came on the podcast but in when I make a bean up a sandwich I use bread two pieces of bread how many like you would use to lose a bread a beautiful sandwich I think that sort of size by definition right it's pretty much a sure so what you did on your podcast you admit that a tablespoon of peanut butter is four grams right mm-hmm okay and what is 4 times 5 20 right and and then by per USDA how much is one piece of whole wheat bread 4 or 5 depending on the source you look at I agree how many pieces of bread - yeah okay so 5 grams of protein in bread the one that I actually have a home is 6 grams but let's take USDA ok her five five plus five is person 10 plus 20 from the peanut butter is 30 well even on the leanest beef you chose it was 24 grams why did you say you needed five tablespoons of peanut butter and I know how it came about because I think what you do is you take other people's work like Denise Miller and all these other people you read their articles and you take their arguments because some of the stuff that are on your site is very reflective of people's other arguments on other sites so there was something that started where people started saying you need five tablespoons of peanut butter and in the first article it said without the bread now I don't know why you don't include bread and when you make a sandwich because I mean most people do it's not just peanut butter and I almost bought a peanut butter sandwich in here today to show you what two tablespoons of peanut butter looks like or two and a half because the one I had I looked at it and it was surprising like when you actually measure a real tablespoon it's actually not that much peanut butter and like some I never figured out has about like two and a half tablespoons and two pieces of bread my bread has like six grams butter so my playwright's I saw about 22 grams of protein anyway red would be more like 2 or 3 grams but no but again like we showed a piece of whole wheat bread on that we're kidding eating mostly Whole Foods that's a whole grain no one is saying we even said in the film if we want to cherry-pick we just try and push plants we said white sugar and flat white flour bad for you you're associated with weight gain that carbohydrates from whole food sources are insulated with better lean body mass lower body fat percentage and everything else but anyway so I don't understand your math what I think it is you took that article because articles that spread from that article forgot to put the bit in parentheses about without the two pieces of bread so you take five tablespoons of peanut butter at 4 grams apiece that's 20 grams right which is around what pieces of bread 10 gratis so why did 24 grams of your hand-picked lean beef which you don't even necessarily like there's no reason that you should be picking that when that's not what we showed in the film why are you comparing 24 grams to 30 grams why didn't you say 4 tablespoons of peanut butter fair enough Mary now got it wrong again okay so this is what it's frustrating when I watch the show because like every five minutes I'm hearing something that's just factually incorrect or that's why I hear that's why I'm here now again press you to both of you so can we just look at actual the breakdown of all these different things so again the peanut assembly is as 20 to 22 grams but that's maybe a little bit more than there's something the other argument was the quality of the approach we'll get to that but quantity for us so if you go to bread on slide far oh I don't need to do this you've agreed you've agreed right okay so in length all's if you underside eight oh no I'm sorry what you haven't agreed on is I'm gonna say two tablespoons of peanut butter and two pieces of bread okay fair enough say for a what I'm just gonna say like the comparison roughly I mean you know three three tablespoons sir can you just three and a half tablespoons of peanut butter and two pieces of bread no no no I'm gonna I'm gonna back up what I said in the film so I let's just go through the slides quickly if I forget it so slide five and apologies to all the listeners who don't get the snip my slide so tell them to go to youtube yeah here we go so what this is USDA so I don't know what you numbers from but I went to the USDA site unfortunately it changed in October so it's not quite the same as we were making the film but anyway one slice of bread five grams of protein and you accepted that right mm-hmm okay good peanut butter two tablespoons eight grams you accepted that you expect that two tablespoons of peanut butter has 8 grams yeah okay we could have more I have like more but whatever okay there we go so you agree that 18 grams of protein for the peanut butter that's the sandwich we showed in the film whole wheat bread peanut butter okay so the next slide and again I'm being very conservative on this like in the mounts so now I look at lentils one cup seventeen point nine grams of protein that is USDA again would you accept that on the left side one I accept yes here is absolutely okay but you accept USDA when it comes to this but not in terms of recommendations we're talking about yeah if we're talking about quantity of your accepting' micro this is something that's been clearly measured this is not something like recommendations okay sure so but we're on the same page we're taking this as a soap okay so now if we go to slide it's nine sorry the one that you just had the one with here we go so three eggs 18 grams of protein would you say so far we've got about as much protein in the peanut butter sandwich with two tablespoons not the five that you can it's less I mean 18 is not 24 no no no I don't say I'm getting to the beef I'm saying so far what I have presented just the two tablespoons of peanut butter and it's came to 18 I was really conservative right I could have put more peanut I could have had bread that had more like the one I don't want in the brand okay but you do admit that you can get bread that's got 6 grams of protein sure ok so I'm being really conservative just that sort of prove a point but you so far we've had a peanut butter sandwich with only two tablespoons of peanut butter and when it seriously you try that at home Joe like actually measure it with a measuring yeah well I talked about in the park yeah so I'll probably have about five okay so anyway I probably would too three large egg three large eggs okay so the 18 grams and I'll go to organic this is organic ground beef standard organic Brown v the answers so three ounces is seventeen point five grams if you want to if you want to get into it you can get into like because let's put 100 grams so I can if you what's the fat percentage nine point two grams so it's half no it's no no sorry it's nine point two grams per hundred grams so you we had to do the calculation oh but that mmm okay but this is the regular organic ground beef in the neighborhood of and then what to be sex I knew you'd bring up a grass-fed beef so that I found the lowest and the highest okay okay so go to grass-fed beef slide eleven three ounces this is on the very low end so this is probably the fattiest meat but you wouldn't be against animal fat right not typically depends on the person and there's I just talked about person there anyway well Louis fourteen point four on the highest end I actually think my number eighteen grams okay so Pia butter sandwich 18 grams lentils seventeen point nine can we round it up yeah three eggs 18 grams okay three ounces of beef 18 grams at best 90% lean you can have more protein no doubt so you can find protein that's got higher I said about I was trying to show that dispel the myth that you you know plants have no protein and animal foods have all this protein so I've just shown you there now your second point was that the problem with his second point was a problem with a peanut butter sandwich to get 18 grams of protein and I think this is a fair point you would have to eat for 410 calories right so if you go to slide it's actually the more important point because I'm not necessarily you know that may not be a problem for somebody who's training no no yes or no no quantity can we finish can we finish coffee first so so can you like bring up slide 15 so you admit that you can get like a decent amount of protein your argument was you can get like percentage so slide 15 there are lentils for 18 grams of protein again if you want to check this calculation and stop at anything I'm fine I have had this triple checked okay 18 grams of protein 231 calories okay because you like points no I love that people like to point out the beef and then the peanut butter sandwich and try and compare those even though we were right on the protein now you're trying to pick on the calories so you didn't pick the lentils which have 231 calories the next one slide 16 has which is about the same for beef which is about 210 calories grass-fed beef in the first instance grass-fed beef in the first in slide 17 275 calories and that was on the lot the one that wasn't so lean and 70% lean beef and I'm just pointing out there's different ranges 417 cows for 18 grams of protein right so fatty meat which you don't think that like the animal fat is bad right he's talking about the protein percentage there was less in my opinion there was more protein percentage-wise in my peanut butter sandwich than there was in the in the green peep and then the last no not the last one yeah we could have picked something with less calories so if we pick tempeh for example slide 19 170 calories so again would you say but I think his argument was no the the the argument was the quality of the program there was too much apart yeah the part of it was you would have to consume more calories okay but just before can I just one point yeah so the first part was you can't like you can't there's no a near as much protein and then there was like always based on the calories so the percentage of protein is you would have to have more calories to get the same amount of protein which is not program we don't have to laughter okay so he made a mistake again it was not a central part of my art and the quantity was broken down to two things you just can't get as much for like you know song as much in that serving they're totally wrong you that have five tablespoons of peanut butter totally wrong I agree right thank you okay and then you also said that you have to have so many calories that you couldn't get it and you were wrong again agree for the peanut butter sandwich or just in general just in general from plant foods lentils coming at slide twenty sweet potato and leek omelet from Chris's site where the protein is going so this is from your site 18 grams of protein 410 calories the funny thing is I typed in recipes and I think it was either first or second came up the all I do is pick the first two high protein recipes from your site because I didn't pick the soup or the salad so that'd be unfair so I picked the first couple so sweet potato and leek omelet cut the protein coming from eggs 18 grams of protein for intent guys do you have an issue with your own meal no so do you have an issue with the peanut butter sandwich having 410 calories yeah okay that wasn't central to my point there was not the same quantity which is not what you just admitted it's not quality which is yes score we're get the deer score in a minute and I will show that you were wrong again so Terrell and bacon hash slide 21 18 grams of protein 570 calories if you want to go to your breakfast of champions which I thought you know for athletes slide 22 and by the way I took your date I didn't at USDA I assumed that you were not lying so I took the the totals from the bottom and but I standardized it for 18 grams of protein because we're just comparing everything percentage-wise 688 calories do you think that people should not eat that meal yeah it depends on who you're talking about but but slow down slow it's a low protein right I don't think that people shouldn't so first of all it's low protein by like most people standards but your standards of protein are much higher so that would be far off so that would mean to make for the rest of the day you would have to have meals that were like almost just protein or maybe they'd have to buy the protein powder from your website in order to make that up anyway so let's move on to now the by the way slide 23 largest study ever done comparing completely plant-based leaders with extent study showing plant eaters versus me 75 grams a day that was the average aren't you supposed to have one gram per body weight per pound of body weight no that's the upper end for athletes okay so this is this is how much they're actually getting the largest study ever done comparing plumpie theaters so you can see it's about the same and actually per pound of lean body mass fat free mass the vegans were getting slightly more because they had better body mass index they were slightly leaner but anyway I just want to say it's roughly similar so your next argument was that athletes need more protein it's like right I know it wasn't an argument because you admitted that I pointed it out in the show yeah so if you go to slide 20 you know 24 I just want to point to talking about the amount that we're actually reporting we're going into the amount now we're still we're in um yeah we're in amount for athletes because this point there's like maybe you can get enough to survive but not to be an athlete so I'm gonna look I just think that was this point I think his point was there's a different requirement oh no no no no for athletes yeah survive we won't argue on this point your point is you need more his recommendations though what he does is he pushes them to a really high end that isn't consensus showing that then trying to make it out that it'd be harder to get which we've already shown you can get enough protein for you know of course and athletes more calories therefore they get more protein as a percentage so I just want to check sure two positions on this and then we can see if you again you don't agree with the consensus of science so this is the joint position paper of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics the dieticians for Canada and the American College of Sports Medicine so this is for athletes okay this is just one I'm going to show you another in a second do you want to read it out Joker's sure we might get bored of my voice Teradata see suggest the dietary protein intake necessary to support metabolic adaptation repair remodeling and for protein turnover generally ranges from one point two to two point zero grams or kilograms per day okay and then the next slide Jamie if you could bring up like I have I agree with that and have it in my okay so on the same page okay supplementation beyond a total daily protein intake of 1.2 grams kilograms day wait is it wrong one why we where are you reading that from the big square - no I said 1.6 okay no you said 1.2 82 grams you read from the last thing did I really do that that's pretty Genie that doesn't make any sense okay so this is what wasn't on amiright read again yeah okay I thought I've read it's 1.6 I didn't that's what you read your won't wait six oh maybe I thought you said one more to the tail no no protein supplementation beyond a total daily protein intake of 1.6 that the squiggle means about oh okay about 1.6 grams kilograms a day during our et sistent exercise training provided no further benefit on gains in muscle mass or strength and these like really highly and and if you look at the and I'll I'm so complex that kilogram a kilograms to pounds of body weight you're going to 2.2 so we're 1.6 grams so it's it's point seven two seven two seven two grams per pound people so you're looking at about three-quarters of a gram per pound recommended anything over that provided no games I want to clarify so you can see the the two-phase breakpoint analysis on the top right this chart yes okay so you can see that you can see as the chart goes up and then it flattens out there was no further gains in fat free mass which is the y-axis and after one point set however there's a constant called a confidence interval like how confident are they that these findings are correct and it was a very wide confidence vote so it actually took it there was six grams either side so it was actually up to 2.2 and down as low as 1 mmm so it's one to two point to the other one the Academy nutrition nutrition and dietetics and the Academy of sports medicine one point two to two so the widest range is 1 to 2 point 2 so some so you think that this like recommendation that's a standard thing that you hear in a gym one gram compound of but it's probably just that's a gerund so 2.2 grams on the upper end the 2.2 grams per per kilogram of body weight per day is one gram per pound of body so no doubt and this is what you're talking about certain athletes like bodybuilders trend athletes but a confidence interval means to apply to everybody some people could actually build optimum and this is about optimally building muscle as fast as possible right and some people could do a 1 gram some people might do point to but like readily it would like 1.6 1.8 like the scientific consensus that and you said you agree with these ranges of the science and there's some evidence suggesting that higher amounts may be beneficial so if you go to or Jamie if you search for examined calm how much protein do you need there's an article there and examine calm is a do you know about about them so I know you're on a panel of scientists or a group of scientists a group of scientists right not the American Sports Medicine the indicator an indicator amino acid oxidation method which was newer if you scroll down Jamie to the optimal daily protein intake for athletes and similarly active adults or if you just click on that you see in that paragraph I a steady xand athletes found different numbers because for of the 49 studies in the meta-analysis meta-analysis that had that range lower range were conducted in people with resistance training experience the other 45 were newbies I a different numbers female athletes required 1.4 to 1.7 meal endurance 2.1 and 2.7 a mature male bodybuilders this seems the same point this is the average amount of protease probably get some higher one maximize lean mass is about 1.6 grams per kilogram it's the same exact your it's like totally accepted in sports world like whatever it's also says some people need upwards of 2.2 grams per kilogram for those interested in comprehensive breakdown it provides another link range we're not a far off it says regular training some male endurance athletes require 2.1 to 2.7 grams per kilogram so that's the high range yeah and so and you could you do say something about 2.8 is 3.3 and 1 remember in one study you pointed out that was just doesn't actually help you build more muscle mass but if you're trying to lean out yeah and also I think some of the studies that you've looked at that look at like there's one at 2.3 I've actually got it on my computer I don't have in my slides but there's one at 2.1 23.3 you've got a Moute there's two things about that one it's when you're in a caloric deficit because if gluconeogenesis you pull some of the protein and you crit you know you use some of the energy so there's less protein less for building so if you're a bodybuilder cutting for competition trying to get down to like four or five percent then your protein requirements go up above that still more range because you're basically using deficits you're using some point for fuel and that's also the case with those carnivore people and a lot of keto people as well right yeah and they probably adapt some because like normal people you can actually only during exercise you can only get 10% of your energy from the oxidation of protein into glucose but so the where are we going so the two point three to three point one by the way it's one in caloric deficit and it's - based on fat free mass qualifications it's not based on total body weight which is what all the recommendations are on so the the two point three to three point one in some of these studies if you did like okay if someone's 50% body fat right I would bring it down right there wouldn't be two point three to three point one based on math so if you're 200 pounds and you've got 20% body fat you only weigh 160 pounds for this calculation got it anyway where we have so you'd like to talk about the IAR in terms of these recommendations and if you were to slide 102 Jeremy how am i doing by the way defending in the film excellent you're really doing really well good not bad for a dumb old UFC fighter right you're not that old 41 how much proteins can the body use in a single meal for muscle building implications for daily protein distribution showed up were of see one of two point two grams for kilograms a day and cohort of young body builders all of the method of assessment indicator amino acid oxidation technique used in this study has not received universal acceptance for determining optimal proteins for arm and so it's in that same range so I'm not yeah but I mean the couple things I'm not trying to point out that your ILO is off I'm saying if you want to take your iro the indicator amino acid oxidation index if you want to use that then the upper confidence still is still 2.2 so the scientific consensus I just want to make it very clear that you throw out a bunch of these numbers on high protein making out the vegans couldn't hit that level first of all I've shown that foods can get that I've shown that vegans can get sufficient protein and I've shown that I've shown the levels that the scientific consensus on the protein ranges for athletes and not inside the consensus with these three point three but even if they were there's no reason you couldn't get it on a plant-based I didn't argue that everyone should be eating three point three grams enough protein and you were wrong I didn't say they couldn't get enough I said that it's less likely that they will get it but it's not like some of those recipes on your website the beginning less so you're being disingenuous Chris like the first recipe was there was sweet potatoes right was it no it was a it was a second one oh it was a leek omelet it was a different bacon hash and then it was breakfast of champions with milk yogurt and eggs so all I'm saying is people that watch the last episode where he was bashing the film people walked away thinking you can't get enough protein and then they thought the quality is not good enough and now we can get into that let's get into that let's get into that because this is the crux of it right yes it's like you can get all the acid content if I throw to first of all b12 as an argument smash that protein is the next argument I've just smashed the protein caught quantity argument and now we'll get into the program we certainly smash the protein quantity versus caloric intake right and so it's fair to say is it fair to say that based on what I've presented you can get about as much protein from the things that I said well based on what you presented you haven't lost an argument yet there's not one thing that you've said that that thank you that's incorrect and I even agree if you're gonna eat some meat should be some help you wanted yourself so let's get into the love of us I was like really like doing like researching for this I really enjoyed it because there were so many flaws that I was just like I I love I was a true seeker right so ice went for the search of the truth in combat you know Bruce Lee would say research your own experience absorb what is useful reject what is useless add what is specifically your own I don't care about all the the George Dillman you know BS about you can knock people out I don't care about that I don't care about all these traditional styles of martial arts I care about what is the truth before I did this you know I thought oh yeah paleo it makes sense I actually switch to grass-fed beef with because the omega-6 made of three ratios I started eating our chilled chicken but then I read the research and I wasn't biased by like anything other than finding out the truth between the optimal diet for health and athletic performance and recovery my injuries and that is the truth and that is what I have done and now we're going to expose how you were incorrect about the protein quality so you said what's a little disingenuous about the film they said every plant has every amino acid well yeah nobody disagrees with that but it does have does it have enough of each of them well first of all people do disagree with that but if you want to search there's you know plants of missing amino acids people think that it's missing some of the nine essential amino acids so that's why we put that in the film okay and we did and I said you left off part of my coil I said every plant has every amino acid that's what you said but you left off the end of my quote which said every plant has every amino acid in varying proportions that is what I said and you left out the in varying proportions which again I think is disingenuous he did not complete my quote you hand-picked part of my quote to represent your view so people number one do think that plants a complete limit so a lot of people think just like you know that people are this article saying when no one thinks that protein gives them energy I've got five studies here the only five sites that I could find on the knowledge of collegiate athletes and around 50% in each of the studies think that protein is what gives you energy so people were saying like why did you put that in the film that's a straw man people don't think the protein gives the energy about 50% of collegiate athletes think that protein gives you energy that's why I dressed in the film anyway back to you like the DIA is right the digestible indispensable amino acid school or the pdcaas which preceded it yeah either of those right so can you just mention why you like it and you know what the benefits are and how it's the term how is it determined so the benef the Daas takes into consideration amino acid profile and bioavailability okay and how is how das did not take into consideration I looked at crude protein to the total amount of protein absorption not the individual amino acids because different comido in different amine different individual amino acids absorb differently so that was a one of the benefits of the DES scoring record the S&P dks or whatever so but how is it determined press you know how it's determined the DF yeah I don't know the details so I'm sorry I'm sorry it's like it's just it's like it's almost like comedy that someone is talking about these systems that does not know how a so slide 27 and I'll tell you one of the benefits of the di is so and I think you might have mentioned this I think you might know more than you're letting on so one of the benefits is the auro ileal digestibility so the pdcaas right that took the whole digestive tract to what came out will end are we looking at here so look at this so this is how the dia s is brought about so basically passed the ileum you can't a digest your body doesn't absorb the protein really it's digested by the bacteria right so this is one of the benefits of the dia s versus the pdcaas right the old system is that they saw how much protein went through the whole digestive tract but that wasn't reasonable right because you passed the ileum you're not digesting the protein the bacteria dress thing and you're not getting it and that makes sense yes so basically they put a pore in the pig now pdcaas was mostly in rats and this is that in rats and there's some in humans but it's mostly done in pigs because it's a more similar digestibility to humans and they basically assessing how much of that protein was absorbed right and how much of the amino acids were absorbed now somebody will make the argument even the FAO point out the flaws something make the argument well pigs have a different digestibility rate which is true and they have a different amino acid profile requirement different so some people would say that for dears bunch of crap right I'm not going to make the argument even though it's telling you know it's taken animals primarily not in humans they've got a different amino acid requirement and different digestibility capability okay so I mean would you think of that score is the best one to use with humans it doesn't make sense right but I'm not gonna even make that argument I'm gonna go with you and say okay des is the best thing out there okay okay so even though you can question it so you've said this is a quote from the last time when you were trying to bash the film it's all about protein quality and this as you said is an established science a firmly established science he was talking to you obviously and you must have said it was established they look at this especially in like third world countries where protein deficiency is common so they try to figure out how to address this okay now the FAO the Food and Agricultural organization of the United Nations what is their purpose correct to prevent nutrient deficiency thank you very much yeah so honey I've got a slide if you want to prove but it's basically defeating hunger providing food security not for America or for England but for like the nation you know the the like 130 more 130 countries right where people are starving malnutrition that is their purpose so you've got to look at it through the lens of that so if you just work slide 29 because I just want to bring back these claims up I know the slides are getting kind of boring I again apologize to people just listening focusing on protein malnutrition was largely conducted after the identification of course your core core core core and the realization that many children globally are suffering from the subclinical protein malnutrition to address protein malnutrition the composition and digestibility of proteins must be determined okay so we go to the next slide and this is by red that was looking at the DS score you know you can see at the top can indict di score decrease protein Melanesian then be going to say dirty or food and agricultural organization of the United Nations has developed methods to evaluate the protein quality of food food items and in 2011 the digestible indispensable amino acids Cordy IaaS was recommended as a successor to the preview their previous method okay so we're not in a disagreement right now I'm even gonna forego like I'm not gonna argue about the animal having different amino acid quirements or even though that's like that's pretty funny right like why are you assessing anyway so I'm not gonna have that argument what I'm gonna have is I'm gonna go with everything so far FAO they're endorsing you're over the PDS a lot of experts endorsing over the is okay over the PD cast okay so now in slide 31 it's made for starving children okay mmm-hmm this is what it's made for so I would agree if you're in a caloric deficit and you're in a country where there's very little protein and you're only getting 30 grams of protein a day let's just say that the animal like take the animal stuff out of it and like the way that the method is flawed over to the FAO points out yeah so let's just say it's legit I would agree I would say get your protein from meat I would agree because that's what it was designed for as you can see in looking at our post exercise skeletal muscle the DIA s does not attempt to consider how scores translate into optimizing more downstream physiological targets of interest to a physically active personal athlete so it wasn't designed for that system it was designed for starving people in countries where they were not getting enough protein and they weren't getting enough protein as you would call high quality okay so so would you recognize that it wasn't developed for that system yes based on the scientific literature but you're inferring it now for the amount that I still think it's a relevant measure of protein quality because it is a Mino acid profile and allele digestibility yeah it is I'm starving country when people are starving I agree but as you can see it's looking it's still looking at amino acid profile right do you concede that it's looking at the at the relative content of amino acids in a particular food yes and it's looking at the ileal digestibility which i think is an improvement over the I think it's got elements even though they fair's point out his flaws and ten years from now we'll have a better system right but right would you agree probably plenty now probably ever better since imagine okay but it's the best that it can kind of go of but again it looks at and it's not just my opinion that it's not used for that this is like in sports medicine 2019 and I agree you're busy with other stuff you probably haven't seen this article that came out and they'll in February right have you seen this article I have not seen together ethically so so basically can you look at the now in the 2018 Journal of International Sports of Sports Nutrition slide 32 society of sports nutrition because you like to say it's all about muscle protein synthesis right that's an important factor okay it has been proposed that muscle muscle protein synthesis is maximized in young adults with an intake of 20 25 grams of high quality protein about this grand about about 20 25 grams of a high quality process high quality protein okay do you disagree that like eating four or five times a day at a twenty to twenty five grams of high quality protein whey be whatever you want to take tie score whatever under your you know the scoring system you agree with do you agree that that is the amount to maximize opposed when it shows that that does for a four-hour window acute muscle proteins is this yeah most of the sports organizations suggest that for acute protein right intake but if you now I again I'm going with the consensus so if you take that twenty to twenty-five times four or five times a day multiply that what is that that's eighty two hundred hundred hundred twenty grams of protein today is that is that enough for a big athlete proteins in fact is that enough for like a 250-pound athlete I would say no so I'm not I'm not saying that I do I think you need more protein than that right so muscle protein synthesis is only one factor right can you tell me what the other factors are tissue regeneration and repair recovery right yeah yeah okay so I think we're on there on the same page that twenty twenty-five grams has basically been shown in a single sitting over a four-hour window in what we call a cute short term that's been shown to maximize muscle proteins in this and that is because twenty and it's been shown actually can get less with like egg you could get like 17 grams or something but it's basically or hitting two things you're hitting leucine you're getting one point eight to two point one point eight to two grams of leucine which is basically like a foreman right it's like telling the others like hey you should build protein if you don't have any leucine and if you had all the essential amino acids you want except for leucine you wouldn't have the form and telling all the workers to like build the muscle basically that's what leucine is so you're getting enough leucine and you're getting eight to ten grams of essential amino acids that is what is important in the acute stage of muscle proteins is this you're getting 18 grams of and we can get more granular and like it's you know point zero grams per pound of body weight but it's this is basically accepted and in fact they've shown that like even if you're 400 pounds you know you probably you play don't need even more than 20 25 grams for some reason there's something in that number about getting the leucine amount doesn't really matter how big you are you know there's a small percentage all that say you might need a bit more 2.5 or whatever but consensus is this 20 25 grams and I'm sorry this is like long but it's like it's important to like burn it down okay so so by the way just going back to your deer scoring you're basically looking at like a rules for jiu-jitsu don't like a DJ Jitsu tournament and you're trying to apply them to MMA so just because jiu-jitsu is involved in MMA it doesn't mean that a scoring system for for like IBJJF or whatever that doesn't mean that that's the best scoring system for MMA right sure yeah you could get points for like ya know whatever okay so essentially and this isn't just my opinion okay this is scientific literature not an article that you just pulled on is amacom but that's not how science works you do is pull up an article so slide 33 and it's very clear this is just very obvious it's not it can't it cannot just be about short term acute muscle protein synthesis right it can't be because you wouldn't be hitting the 1.6 the 2.2 so this states my cute anabolic responses are not necessarily associated with long term muscular gains the topic can only be answered by assessing the results of longitudinal studies that directly measure changes in lean mass with the provision of varying protein dosages okay so you agree that it's not just about short-term as both losers okay so what it is Joe it doesn't matter at a certain point it doesn't matter because yeah if let's say you're gonna have four times a day unless so you can have a hundred sixty grams of protein and you have forty grams right of protein four times a day that's 160 grams so if you're gonna optimize muscle mass and by the way like how much how much much all have you put on in the last 15 years no I'm not sure man I put none right basically I'm about the same right but anyway let's just say that you're a bodybuilder and you and we told you about a stack are you trying to stack on as much muscle as possible because it's like even like when I get like I'm like 190 193 maybe sometimes like if I go over 200 I just feel slow I feel slow with the handgun I feel like I just feel slower punching like whatever so it's not everyone's goal is to optimize mass or mass as quickly as possible right but let's say that your goal is right clearly it's not enough to do that you have to hit the 1.6 to 2.2 grams right right once you hit that amount you have to do two things you have to hit the muscle the the short-term leucine threshold and amino acid in the short term right and then you have to hit the so what you have to do two things you have to maximize the muscle pose instances in the short term and you have to get enough protein during the day right at one point six to two point two is that fair okay so once you hit the one point six to two point two let's say you have 40 grams it doesn't matter you follow me you even quoted doesn't matter the amino acid profile the food as always no because as long as you hit the essential amino acid amount and the leucine amount in the 14 you can hit the leucine amount and the amino acid amount in virtually all of these vegan forms of protein is that what you're saying no no if you're having like first of all you could do it with like if you do beans rice and vegetables yeah you'd hit two grams of protein for like 500 70 calories now again you could like you know that most athletes supplement right yes like I can got slides if you want for scientific proof but you would accept their like elite athletes even more so over percent suffering with protein powder anyway they stop reminding you with brush and amino acids because it contains leucine isoleucine is what are you over 50% are supplementing with protein powder and a higher percentage at least just athletes period yeah okay even more it's probably if your goal is to like do something and like take creatine or you know a protein or like you know these athletic endeavors like you pointed out the thing that Patrick does and we can get into the right by the way the misrepresentation of from Robert Hurst of us into his you know Patrick's records if you want because there was a lot of claims that were made that were completely false again so basically if you get enough protein if you hit one of the windows if you hit the 1.6 to 2.2 with plant protein you can hit the muscle protein synthesis and like all of a sudden he's like I'm saying there's no benefit in animal protein for an amino acid profile versus plant protein no no not if you're getting enough protein so you're saying if you're getting enough protein as you have acknowledged of the rate ratio of plant proteins no no no it's pretty it's not difficult at all I'm talking about leucine if you were like if you were really messing up and eating like people just don't eat healthy you might not get enough leucine but like if you're planning to become as big and as strong as possible and you're dead do you need a specific workout plan but this is only assuming that you're taking supplements or is everyone's taking so chief no no no no you can do it with supplements you're not seeing the people are taking supplements but you can do it but are you assuming that people are taking supplements no you can do it on a whole food diet plan with with just food with b12 like right a supplement b12 nothing else you can achieve the same amino acid profile as me yeah I mean I want to touch on that I'm not saying that the only that is the argument but I just want to throw people off like depending on where you live you might want to suffer a vitamin d based on you have Sun I just wanted like don't I like try everybody should do that anyway and it particularly d3 okay so what I'm saying is as long as you get that amount of protein and if you're eating if you're exercising to optimally build muscle you're exercising a fair bit right yes you're burning more calories right right so you eat more calories and I don't think I don't know where my sliders we're deep into the woods here and this is getting really good the question was but it's this is what with his assertion was that the amino acid profile of meat is superior in context it's important when you look at the FAO and the goals that they're doing to try and stop world hunger it is no important in the Western world number one and not important if you're an athlete and hitting the rep but you're getting between one point six to two point grams per kilogram so what you're saying is that as long as you're getting this one point six to two point two grams per kilogram yeah of protein whether it's lentils or peanut butter or that you have enough amino acids to achieve the desired results no and it's essentially the exact same as if you're hitting that 2.2 grams grams it doesn't matter do you think that's true if you're getting 2.2 grams of protein and you're doing it and you're not doing it in the way that you said where you're not planning it and not getting making sure you're getting enough leucine which is you wouldn't have to try I agree but there's a certain quantity that you will achieve there's a plateau so it doesn't matter once you've got that amount right other point that you had about protein quality is by jest ability so that's the last point that I want to address okay how am i doing good ok so slide 34 because you basically claim that ok even if there were enough amino acids you can't digest it as well more precise data collected the more precise data collected so far in humans assessing real specific oral allele nitrogen digestibility has shown that the differences in the digestibility between plant and animal protein sources are only a few percent contrary to historical findings in rats or determinations using less precise methods in humans and just so you know I understand that you haven't seen this probably the it just came out last month published by Stanford so I get you haven't seen now I take this one step further there's only at most like two or three percent different and digestive plant protein and you know how its assessed in the pigs they give them raw food so they give raw beans raw grains and you have said one of the reasons that it's less digestible is because of trypsin inhibitors yeah and when you cook you would definitely break them down mm-hmm are you getting it so when you when you heat food the likelihood is you know it hasn't been tested we know that the digestibility is less in plants by a few percent only a few percent not the forty percent versus a hundred percent that he was claiming last time that's old science I'm talking about current science right and there's only a few percent difference and they imagine that not only if you heated it but you would guess equivalent you might even get more because you're killing the trypsin inhibitors by heating it so that whole nonsense about the the quantity you were wrong the quality the GI score was not designed for that it doesn't matter when you get enough protein so as long as you get enough protein you're using measures for a organization that is looking at hunger I am we're talking about if people have got enough I agree if you're in like a developing country and you have very little diversity of plant foods and maybe not enough in this manuals you should be eating the animals I agree but that is not what it is designed for and it doesn't matter the amino acid profile doesn't matter and the digest meat doesn't matter when you get enough protein let me pause you first from here because you've been going on for a long time yes amazing points Chris this has not been that good for your arguments so what are your thoughts on what he said so far and what are your thoughts on what he's refuted about what you had asserted about his show I think he's made some good points and you know my original argument and what we started out talking about was so you take the the film and the claims of the film the specific claims of the film and then you also take the the question and we start talking about which was is there evidence that a hundred percent plant-based diet is better than a diet that contains animal foods that's really and for the protein come on and there was a lot of claim there were a lot of claims in the film that we talked about about you know dairy products causing cancer dairy products contributing to cardiovascular disease chicken and fish causing cancer red meat clogging the arteries that we address and haven't had a chance to go into detail on in this show so protein yeah I'm talking about protein and what you just did that you segue into something else so can you answer definitively do you think I've presented very good arguments against your rebuttal about both protein quality including the amount and the ratio and about protein quality and quantity including digestibility and amino acids cause I think the protein quantity is it's still an issue or the question of getting but how I mean you've got to have some ideological arguments Chris I'm sorry but you're like I have disproven your a bottle on protein and on b12 I think the quality and quantity still matter the quality the so even though that scale was developed for the FAO there's still a difference a quantitative difference in the amino acid profile didn't argue with the adjustability I didn't argue with that that was not my point but if it's about amino acids and it's about protein content and digestibility if what he's saying is correct and there really is no need to eat meat that's what isn't but that isn't that is his argument for protein I mean you can like come up with some other like you we can go at nutrient if you want to look at nutrient profiles and like then we can look at that but you've got to admit I presented some good arguments in both favor of quantity and I hadn't seen that last okay you from two thousand so I just want to sum it up I want to sum it up my slide verdict just one last slide on this well I mean yeah one well I got slides proving the outcomes as well but if you just want to look at this is not me this is not me making up like a it's like oh I'm a vegan I'm just making stuff up like there's a bunch of bullshit that's put out by vegans about arguments that are totally green yeah and honestly I think vegans are like the worst people for their own movement I agree it's like like throwing blood on people that are wearing like fur jackets or whatever think it's ridiculous right but that doesn't don't this don't lump me in and the film in with vegans and you've done a far better job of explaining things here than you did even in the film yeah but it's very tricky is worth three and a half hours in right well I would have made a 10 hour film and I it was upsetting sure you really people say oh you first of all the color audience that were married half of the athletes you found you didn't put in the film because they stopped being vegan completely not true you're also a bunch of experts we didn't put in the film that we couldn't put in and we didn't put them in because there wasn't room it was like I understand in filmmaking it's called killing your babies there was amazing scenes that were being really convincing that we couldn't put in like the evidence in the film is far less than 1% of the evidence that I why don't you guys do it as like a Netflix thing we series while because wild country we do like seven hours I would like we're consistent like why is your thing to do because like how many people are gonna sit down how do you many people gonna watch this well I know I mean I don't know millions so when when we're talking about like we don't really have that much time left unfortunately because we are here at three and a half hours in and I have another one right after this but what what about the film do you think he hasn't refuted your criticism we just put that last slide yes please what is it again in slide 34 and also I've got a bunch of slides showing that actually here we got there's no research to suggest that protein recommendations are different for athletes allow following a vegetarian diet than for those on an omnivorous diet now that is the handbook the textbook that is used when you become a board certified specialist in sports Dietetics so this what this is basically saying is what you said earlier the amino acid profile once you reach a certain point in a certain doesn't matter grounds for you've got to reach that amount anyway even with meat that's the thing okay so yeah so I'm and and again what about the film do you think that he hasn't refuted your criticisms I mean rethink III would love that's going to be there's the blood flow and endothelial function Automation let's get to the meat and let's do it let's start through the erection erection that's the most scientific part of the movie was it was the other thing Chris well I mean just talking about inflammation and endothelial function and we'll take cancer and dairy the chicken and fish in cancer cancer I can review all of that all of your claims one look at the election and the Dolphins things that related to endothelial function let's why don't we talk about research about endothelial function yeah okay right okay that's related so okay endothelial so regarding those with this because it's already 2:30 it's just a shame because like all the other claims he made before all right what other ones were involved in the in the interview or in in us in the fellow Mike nothing when you said and I've seen you say this on interviews we have 22 years of research showing the single high fat meal impairs and öthey lleol function hmm that study was called it was from 1997 so now multiple studies and I can put them up if you want so that's 22 years from the effect of a single high fat meal on endothelial function and healthy subjects so this compared a nine hundred calorie diet both were on nine hundred calories one group pat was eating 50 grams of fat in one group with zero grams of fat the high fat meal was an egg mcmuffin a sausage McMuffin I'm not talking about the two hash browns and non caffeinated drink off from McDonald's yeah I'm not one well what at which one are you talking about a bunch okay well I got a bunch to actually contradict that so that's the same study the same researcher that did that study found that taking vitamin C after the high-fat meal completely eliminated the the effect that it had on endothelial function which suggests that a healthy omnivorous diet with plants wouldn't have the same impact there was a 2019 review and this is will be like Kresser dot CEO slash game changers adding nuts avocados olives berries spice blends orange juice red wine and protein including milk protein to a high-fat meal prevent endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress we've got several studies that suggest that dairy and egg proteins improve endothelial function 2015 controlled trial with 52 subjects dietary proteins including milk and egg improved endothelial function 2006 study adding dietary protein to a high fat meal prevented postprandial endothelial dysfunction we have 2009 study followed subjects for 12 weeks a low-carb diet improved endothelial function whereas a low-fat diet decreased it 2007 study with follows your all of these studies show the animal proteins don't increase and you have to know more about nutrition and it's really okay so first of all you just you compared a low carbon high carb I am NOT a I'm not for health I'm not promoting high carb all that wasn't the point the point is that low carb diets that contain animal products and that milk and egg protein have been shown to sort of endothelial function not worsen it right so we can pay him in the film was the animal protein worsens endothelial I because that is the scientific consensus and we keep going back to the tell us why tell us all that is seafood consumption protects against endothelial damage seafood is an animal protein Mediterranean diet which includes animal products improves pulse wave velocity blood flow markers of atherosclerosis these are studies in the peer-reviewed literature yeah but we're not for them so what's wrong with us so the industry funding studies what you do wait wait who said anything about these being industry funded about what you do see is compare everything is healthy compared to what healthy or unhealthy compared to what so if you have a low carb diet and you replaced a bunch of white sugar and flour you might not see it's gonna the outcome is going to be a deeper that's a claim that was made in the film is that animal product animal proteins worsen endothelial function I just listed a whole bunch of studies especially those suggesting here's one that says influence of food patterns on endothelial biomarkers a systematic review the conclusion was that healthy food patterns abundant in fruits and vegetables had a a beneficial impact on endothelial function westernized patterns higher intakes of processed meats sweets fried foods refined grains were positively associated to inflammation which makes my point in another no it makes my point which is quality matters is no McMuffin and Egg McMuffins and you show that I'm not showing that my studies are okay but let's let him explain his studies so for example slide 71 I I purposely didn't include those studies because I don't think that they're a good thing to compare to so slide 71 okay this is oh this is nice because there's a graph right so you can see so everyone's saying like that fat in the blood that's normal well what do you mean by normal yeah lots of people do that that's normal that doesn't mean it's optimal when you see the fat in the blood and by the way it was a film we couldn't throw everything in so when you see fat that's called postprandial like penis that means after a meal fat in the blood right that is associated with up to 50% decreased endothelial function which means you nest nitric oxide is produced which means that the arteries can't open up as much less oxygen less nutrients to the muscles okay so that is a surgery as you can see in this graph I don't know so the solid line is the the tribe no solder line is how much your arteries are dieting flow mediated face so dilation right so as the triglycerides this is after the meal okay which was by the way a shake of whipping cream and liquid chocolate and nonfat dry milk okay as the as you eat the meal you can see that the triglyceride 0 that's the fat in your blood see between 2 and 4 hours it kind of Peaks we measured those athletes at 2 hours and yeah this is not just a film it's been done for over 20 years in the scientific literature so as you can see in the graph right Joe as the dotted line goes up that's the appearance of more fat in the blood right you get that liked essence the milkiness of the blood you can see that very clearly that the flow media dilation drops so it drops by 11% okay if you look for example that makes sense so that when you have those fat in the blood your ability to your arteries to expand goes down there's no like what that's not an egg McMuffin that is a milk and whipping cream and that's it so now if you go to slide 73 now I agree this had some so they compared now they're here yeah we can skip the next one that was 11% okay so here what I've done is the only thing I changed about this graph is I put the green dots for the plant-based meal and the red dots for the Allen West meal so they were eating Korean barbecue egg milk oil mayonnaise rice and vegetables and on the other hand they were having a vegan meal of soup kimchi vegetables orange juice apple so as match for calories at 800 calories the green is in red and the so the green is plants and the red is animal-based so I don't know if you want to go into there basically you've slide 74 again please try to remember a lot of people listening oh sorry if you want to read the mean you can if you want here changes of serum triglycerides were negatively correlated with changes of FMD for meat fur mediated dilation well low-carb diets often will lower serum triglycerides and they can finally not post not post panda li not after the meal for that which is important to test because that lasts for 6 3 hours and what do you do again you eat another animal-based meal so the next part draw this out good then how is it that triglycerides go down over time if your body's because your body adapts to it so Joe can you read the second this study suggests that acute HT G's hypertriglyceridemia that's the fat in the blood which causes endothelial dysfunction via enhanced oxidant stress and that and this may pave the way for the development of our thorough and powerful atherosclerosis under cronic so what that saying like in the short using short term and chronic long term is under acute then it affects your endothelial function your ability to exercise and perform and in the long term effects chronic collisions like heart disease and if you go to slide 75 remember that chart that we looked at with the green dots and the red dots 8.2 percent decrease in FMD two hours following the animal-based meal two point seven percent increase in fmd two hours following the plant-based meal okay so you got less blood flow so Chris makes out there's no science no evidence it was just this crazy thing that they made up it was the co-chair of the cardiovascular Committee for the NFL that has been researching this for years I didn't say that James I said there was a lot of other evidence contradicting it so right but we want to bring up study you can add effects of dietary carbohydrate restriction versus low-fat diet on flow mediated dilation this is what you've been talking about peak flow mediated dilation at three hours increased from five point one percent to six point five percent the carbohydrate restricted group and decreased from seven point nine percent to five point two percent in the low-fat diet right 12-week low carbohydrate diet and proved postprandial vascular function more than a low-fat diet right because the low-fat diet has a bunch of like white flour and stuff in it that's the thing but that's why there's often the low carb diets due to their diets with animal if we're talking about protein the claim in the film was that animal protein causes endothelial dysfunction somehow we've gotten off talking about fat and I've just I'm not gonna mention many studies that show that dietary proteins including milk and egg improve endothelial function no they don't fish okay right here nobody Joe so what are these you can't just say a study right because I Chris can bring up dietary proteins improve endothelial function under fasting conditions but not in the post prandial state with no effects on markers of low-grade inflammation attrition in 2015 study okay but dietary Pro doesn't even necessarily mean animal-based programs right no its including milk and egg including yeah Chuck tonight this the bottom line is that he can present any study I'd have to dig into it see the funding whatever because it's always what's compared to so you can show a huge benefit for eggs if you compare it to Lorde right you can this all these were proteins that included soy soy milk and egg and they all improved endothelial function yeah it's and then another dietary protein milk or soy to a high-fat mule prevented postprandial endothelial dysfunction and then there are the two low-carb studies that I mentioned there's controlled trial that found that a low-carb high-fat diet improved pulse wave velocity which is another marker of endothelial function there are studies of the Mediterranean diet which is a healthy diet pattern that includes some animal products include improved pulse wave velocity seafood consumption protects against endothelial damage yes can I had it compared to beef it does can I just say like for example you said you were trying to refute the study about the increased risk of cancer colon cancer between vegetarians and non-vegetarians right the three times increased risk with those about white meat like fish or chicken once or twice a week and then you go to a meta-analysis which is not comparing you're comparing fish to bacon or beef of course comparing any that these are controlled trials that look at dietary proteins milk is an egg but Chris first of all you have emitted that you don't even know how to read it the science is that fair do you honestly feel qualified to read even a single paper yes but you don't know how to read a forestation research I took a master's level research methodology class I'm referring to studies that are review literature it's like and you haven't answered the question if protein impairs endothelial function why are studies showing that milk and egg don't do that George don't move George film studies showing but like the heart rate went out when you a knock out without touching someone just because you can show studies that I can't like I haven't had a chance to read and dig into doesn't need me my point no no I gave like the film has been reviewed and has been accredited by the defense health agency yeah right so you think that they like the science your basically your your your debunk which you failed miserably to debunk the film right I have proven again and again that your points were invalid I have presented data with healthier meals you try thought I was going to go to the feeling someone McDonald's I didn't I showed one with just basically dairy just Dairy increasing in a knife showed three or four studies like dairy proteins then I am talking about and I interfere with endothelial function and actually improve it and the bottom bottom line is Jo right that at each step of the way chris is not in line with the scientific consensus okay not on protein recommendations not on definition of carbohydrates not on and the thela function not on heme iron it's just not it but you shouldn't be having him on to say he isn't he said himself he's not an expert in nutrition he is unable to read us and unable to read a single study and understand it I am not qualified that's a mischaracterization okay then tell me tell me what the competence interval of this in the forest plot so listen i'm presenting i've never anyone i'm saying anything about put myself out like I'm the the expert that that is is doing these studies that same way that you did you collected information on the scientific consensus which some leading researchers with thousands of years something that there is not was good there's there are many experts that would disagree but a same thing is like saying no it's not the same at all it's absolutely not the same that there's the the consensus of experts that agree that we should be on a hundred percent or even 95 percent plant-based diet is the same as the consensus on climate change no not even close to the parallel is that the scientific consensus says we should be in predominantly plant-based diets and that vegan and federate vegan diets are propyl for all stated lifecycle I've shown that you can get enough protein I've shown that the quality Deer scoring doesn't matter I've shown that the b12 stuff that you got is completely wrong like what else do you want me to show you you want me to show you that like even despite having lower creatine levels because people have pointed out in the film all you said as long as you get all the amino acids that's enough you didn't point out that the study said they didn't tell the vegetarians have lower creatine stores therefore it may affect performance they didn't test it I've got a bunch of studies where it has been tested where they had vegetarians and meat eaters had equivocal fat free mass equivalent equivalent time to fatigue despite lower creatine levels and we know that creatine is ergogenic i've also got other studies showing that when vegetarians actually take supplemental creatine they get increased games of over one pound of muscle over the meat-eaters so despite lower creatine which we know the most studied supplement because their intake of creatine is lower yes and so and so when they're supplementing they see a bigger response you could look at that the other way you could say you should have more creatine in their diet and then they wouldn't need to supplement with that to get the bigger response right but I'm saying it points out that despite lower creatine soles which we know are go genic which are performance-enhancing they still have equivocal fat free mass muscle and power output and time to fatigue and when you add creatine in you get a benefit now I'm not saying that everyone should be taking creatine but if you're trying to build as much muscle as possible I think you should and by the way meat eaters also tend to supplement that are trying to body build with creatine as well so I'm saying that despite the fact of lower creatine which we know is the problem would you argue that's like the probably the most well studied and best supplement that we know of that can help yeah ok fair enough so despite lower creatine people on plant-based diets can still have as much muscle mass and when they hate creatine they get even more than the meat-eaters and I've got by a bunch of science to prove that too so basically Joe if someone watched the last episode where he tried to debunk the film for 2050 minutes do you feel that i fairly addressed a lot of the critiques and i've can address a lot more he talks about nutrient quality he likes to refer to like diet quality says that we're lowering we're lowering certain nutrients yeah vegans are low typically in b12 and be calcium zinc because they eat a bunch of shit but meat eaters are low in about nine so he likes to point to a nutrient score which favors that's not comparing equivalent vegans vegans and vegetarians in general are do you know these smokeless they have a higher drink less they have a higher diet quality and jack apples too right because i do all of the things that are better for health including eating a plant-based diet because he thinks that just the only one thing that they don't do better is more plants so what he's saying that you lump in meat-eaters with people that eat the standard american diet when you say the meat eaters you're not talking about people who are eating organic gets sixty percent of their calories from ultra processed and refined no that's why they're nutrient but that's what they are saying just said that i'm not comparing like Joe Rogan's and his diet versus an equivalent is that you are saying that vegans are typically more deficient in certain nutrients they are in certain nutrients but that's because a lot of people aren't smart don't like and so you're looking at the overall group of them versus the people that are doing it as recommended by these studies that are showing the appropriate amount of amino acids they're doing it's just they're balancing it out and you variety you're not landing it I didn't think about it I don't count how much protein I'm taking I just need a wide variety and if a really good source actually is nutritionfacts.org and he's got this useful thing called yeah he doesn't like that because it's not in alignment what's wrong with the nutrition facts that org oh it's it's just has a very strong plant-based agenda yeah cuz they well because they follow the science so anyway forget all of the useful videos are on there you do like three minute videos for people to learn about the science gives all the the references but the useful thing the really usable thing is he has like the daily doesn't you know about what all of the evidence is Charlie should be eating but you're eating meat or not all of the evidence showing like how much legumes how much fruits how much vegetables you know with flaxseed and you know these types of things so it's just like it's like a fridge magnet you can throw on your fridge and James made an excellent point Chris do you have anything to say in closing no thank you for appreciating felt a bit combative no you knocked it out of the park you did a fantastic job I think you mean inmates me can say well the let me explain my position coming in here I felt like you'd put your film out I felt Chris felt the same way having you in here while he did debunked it was just gonna be a waste of time I did put your position out he was gonna chance to be drunk but I've also felt that would be unfair to not have you come in and explain and refute his debunking and I think you did a fantastic job I really appreciate that my pleasure and love to come back on and talk about God is unless awesome whatever man let's do that next time awesome okay thank you Chris thank you everybody [Applause]
