hello freak bitches you are in this this is position now with this film coming out to help a lot of people I think this this film is not just gonna you know tell your story and in and you know open up a lot of people's eyes as to I hope so of the AOL situation on but I think a lot of people you know you're such a powerful guy that I'm hearing from them Joe I'm sure you are and and and you know and they they know how to find me or they will you know find me and I'll do what I can some I give everybody as much of a chance as I can there's the line of what's soul to abuse survivors that I think it's horseshit and that's basically they get quote-unquote empowered and I hate that word because it takes the strength other word power what's what sounds more like more like power power or empowered to empowers like sandy making aware Birkenstocks or something else uh so I'm not that big on empowered but it but they like I did my friend sam cedars podcast a couple weeks back and and he said I don't want to give away with the movies I said listen man it's not that kind of movie and it hinges largely on the fact that I survived rapes as a child well like I heard from several people said you know you really should have had a trigger warning on there and it's like what the fuck do you think I was doing what the fuck do you think I was doing when I said it hinges largely I was warning you that what it was about right there but someone has empowered you to have a way to take issue with me because I'm not completely basically you know the whole world isn't base around me you know I got rape when I was four years old everybody shouldn't be thinking in terms of that all time cuz they've been through their own shit and they're dealing with their own shit and they're trying to survive so if I can make them more sensitive this issue if I can show them that it matters to them that they deal with other people have been through this kind of trauma and we want to reduce it as much as absolutely possible that's good but after that if I'm going to find a way to set up a situation where I'm always the injured party and that prove again and again that I'm persecuted and no one's thinking in terms of me then I'm never gonna get fucking healed I'm never gonna get fucking healed so what I did was I went out and I tried to help other people when I help other people I realize how far along I've come and I realize there's really something in it for me to do that it's not like I'm this altruistic guy it's like I'm saving my own life and like that AOL investigation that took such courage to do it know what would have taken courage was turning my back on those kids and walking away gonna go I don't want to know what's going on in there how would I live with that guy how would I live with myself that but day you know like I is nice everyone said oh gee that what he went through when he was doing that investigation what about the kids and the fucking pictures that's what I want everyone to know about thanks for caring about me but it's the kids and the pictures I give a shit about it's the kids that are suffering right now somewhere within the sound of my voice someone you know I mean in this broadcast like where this is on someone in the next apartment or wherever some kid it's going through this shit have the courage to know about it that's all I ask you have the courage to know about it and save the contemporary children so you don't have to deal with a bunch of fucking maniac abuse survivors with that's and if anybody can defuse the turnaround scape guys coming in now denna if anybody can diffuse the term trigger warning you're the fucking guy well thanks Jesus goddamn Christ stop we're gonna develop a nation of permanent children like if anybody can tell their story and doesn't need a fucking trigger warning it's you and this this idea I don't I don't need trigger warnings if you're gonna show me something show me something I and if I don't want to see it let me know what it is before you show me a little tell me what the the the matter is about yeah no need a goddamn trigger this fucking term is disgusting it's a disgusting time it does damage it just sets people up to sit stay in the pit you know to wallow it's empowering them to wallow like well I've got hurt and again because the whole set it's like sorry shit man but I'm telling you what I know you're in a pit of your own shit I know you're used to the temperature and the smell of it doesn't Muir use to that it doesn't bother you that much anymore but when you stand up and they fucking hose you off and then you go in the house and take a real shower and put on some clean clothes you're not gonna believe how much better you feel so stop letting other people tell you that you have to expect the world to do the impossible and that's me they like you telepathic about what the fuck you've been through get to the point where you can stand up and tell them the story yourself when it's appropriate and don't put up with anybody who was truly being insensitive or snickering about any of this shit fuck people who tell me people walk up to me all the time and tell me like well you know the good thing is those guys getting arrested in the eye and Bobo tickets like you're endorsing rape to me you're fucking endorsing rape to me motherfucker I don't want anyone raped ever not even rapist rape is illegal how about making jails lawful places how about that for an idea how about for someone going to jail and realizing the law protects me sometime I'm not gonna be raped I'm not gonna be menaced here I'm going to admit maybe they'll will start thinking about getting reformed but Jesus Christ don't joke to me about rape don't tell me you want them all killed and sweep them under that rug because I was born without blood on my hands I don't want a fucking blood on my hands now man so don't guess these stupid ass fucking lightweight things and presume I'm gonna sign off on them cuz I don't I ever want anyone else ever raped and if it happens even if it's of a rapist I'm opposed to it and I don't want them fucking killed either no I want them to live with what they did now this is a difficult this is a difficult thought and is a difficult subject but did you after this is all said and done a horrendous moment in your life many moments in your life did you try to figure out what would create a person like the guy who did that to you yeah you tried I did how much time yeah and I can tell you what created him he was taken out of an abusive home he was put into foster care and abused many more times and he was gone and he was gone there was guy and he was succumbed by the agony I was put through by him I survived somehow I made it so call me lucky I'm not I didn't become him I didn't become one I resisted I didn't I didn't pass along the poison maybe I did in some ways when I was difficult or whatever but mostly I didn't mostly when I'm mad I'm mad because it's a career like Hendrix a cry of love it's a cry of love that I make it's a cry of love my act has been a cry of love it's like I don't want the innocent hurt anymore I don't want people victimized because of greed and cowardice and bullshit you know I don't want that and so I do what I can to stand up to it did were there moments where you wanted to talk to him what do you want I would love to talk to him I would love to talk to him to show him that I've been didn't become a monster like he was I would I would have I would have almost become an advocate for him in the sense that like well maybe let me know if they're mistreating you in here but he died in prison no one claimed his body and I don't know where his grave is if I knew his grave it was I go put fucking flowers on it not for him for me the idea that someone could do that after someone did that to them scenes insanely counterintuitive it's like if someone's the only thing that saves you but really saves you really is redemptive and really saves you to me it's one of the things that you covered in the film that I thought was in really a very powerful moment where you talked about this thing that you didn't become him that you maybe if your sister didn't come down there and catch me dead you could have been dead it was close man it was close but you also that you could have been one of them you could have been someone who that would be worse death yeah how I would rather be a victim a thousand times than the perpetrator once and that's not any did you contemplate the mechanism did you try to view tried to understand the mechanism that turns an abused person into an abuser what would what is that I don't I don't think I'm as nuts and bolts as here because I listen to you and I know how much mean I can't what detail you go into so I understand how how and what you're asking but I can't be there's enough of me that's been through enough that I can't be quite as thorough as you're asking me to be the answer that I get as close as I can and I understand what happened but then after that point I like I'm not one of them and I can't go far enough to say well then of course if you get past this point right here then obviously this is the I can't do that it's that that is what is too much for me so you know one of the reasons I was interested in making the movie was when when Barry you know told me that the guy had died in prison and I said how that make you feel and he said it made me sad and I said because you didn't get any closure you don't even get to confront him and he said no he died alone and I was really blown away by that and I thought I should really make a movie about this this is like you know this is Jesus stuff you know that's this is yeah and so so you know that was what that really did motivate me to make the movie you know [Music]
