[Music] we gots no bells and whistles we gots no guests we ain't got shit this is the hundredth episode and it will go to 100 the way it began with no form not knowing what the fuck we're doing sitting in front of a laptop with snow this stupid karaoke snow effect yeah I listen to it today I'm G on the way over here it's unlistenable there there was times where there was like 15 seconds 20 seconds of dead air we're we're just fucking sitting there like looking at things yeah that wasn't really supposed to be on iTunes we should never let it go on iTunes yeah what it is you know was just we were just fucking around we just would start it was it Anthony cuneus show that was basically I remember a while good one Justin TV came out we used to always be on the road in the green room and I always tried to like set up like a video like in the green room thing we did it a few times the Joey Diaz and then Joey Diaz got pissed and twisted my finger remember that he got mad because he didn't want the camera on anymore and he grabbed my hand and started twisting my finger it was crazy like he got really well generally I think Joey has to be funny all the time in his eyes and when Joey's backstage if he's just sitting there like what what you want to do well I I'm not even hungry you know he doesn't want people to see that you know he doesn't want people to see the normal average everyday Joey he just wants Joey when he's on right you know so yeah after that that that incident was like hey I'm not doing this anymore and then we tried it again Joey's a lot more sensitive than you think yes man yeah you know Joey Joey said something to me the member when I came down when I when we were headed to the show in Portland and Joey got mad yeah that came out of nowhere to it was just me and him sitting there waiting for you to come down it was really weird and I mean the bottom line was I had to take a shit and sometimes it's probably me you know when you have to take a shit sometimes you know time it well sometimes like you're running out the door I'm like goddamn I think I gotta go let me just see if I get this out real quick it's like oh my god dammit I do have to take a shit but I haven't had enough lettuce today I hate that when you have to speed up a shit the worst it's not quarter it's not healthy the worst is when you're thinking about not taking a shit and then you do you know god I can't believe I was just gonna walk around for the next couple hours with that inside of me yeah or the girlfriend shit where you get a new girlfriend you can't shit in front of her I shouldn't everybody deal with it yeah yeah I don't mind if they do it either it's life yeah it just kind of stuck to you you just meet this girl you trying to be like all sexy and hot and your bathrooms right next to your television still take a stinky shit hope you can deal with it if you're not you don't get no more this good dick that's what you gotta tell her that's commodity you didn't look through my camera by the way that I left you I didn't and if I did I wouldn't know me I I did my first what not my first but my one our first our second home movie sex movie oh really and we were just like let's see what it looks like you like no because it was no it was a side profile and I noticed that my gut just kind of sits on her ass when I noticed that before so now I'm like looking at 24 hour fitness and shit like that but I left my rest on her ass like a fanny pack yeah it was crazy and I left it here though and immediately I saw him like oh my god that video could easily have just gotten now and that could have fucking that's how it happens that is that happens yeah yeah you fuck around leave a foam behind exactly uh yeah Jason Tebow has this thing with Sam Tripoli they every time they leave their phone around or somebody gets their phone and it's unlocked it take pictures of the day yeah and or put like black dicks and stuff like that like I Jason like galactic unless last night Jason's did his mom know it was and I like practic did his mom she left she was like oh look at these photos I took and so he did his mom's Facebook and put like his mom left her phone behind yeah so he took her phone and down on Facebook and put pictures of black dick yes it's all right it's a black this place is something like I really like black MA for something like whoa really yes mom yeah his mom's pretty sweet though she's a lesbian she's just hangs out with the boys type thing yeah well mom's pretty sweet he said like Cartman [Laughter] sweet I had one friend that a mama was a lesbian growing up but he never admitted it man I took it forever took forever before he came clean oh he knew about it everybody knew his mom was living with this woman with a crew cut with with like big arms she had like she would wear Larry the Cable Guy clothes yeah she would wear like sleeveless shirts like sleeveless vest and shit and she had these like these big like floppy truck-driver arms you know and she was she was a dyke there's no getting around it she was but she was you know my friend did not want to come clean though wants to be normal man everybody wants to be normal remember Joey Diaz stories about wanting to be a white kid yeah he's not white that's right well yeah I mean that's kind of ridiculous you know which is that's called a slurp cuz he can you make that slurping noise can't you turn your microphone just fucking deal with it man when I was listening to episode number one in the car that was another thing that the mic sucks so bad there was parts where things were dropping and just blew your speaker's out like that so that's pretty annoying you know one thing I didn't know is a lot of people you know say why you stitcher I had no idea so I talked to the president recently and we were talking about the whole incident and stuff like that the incident that RSS incident we had a beer and you know he said a lot of things that I had no idea that stitcher did and one thing was that stitcher normalizes the whole audio so when there's big loud bursts and stuff like that which is what we should be doing we should be we actually used to do that but it made that the audio to quiet because it for summer I don't know audio engineer but it didn't work yeah we need compression I've heard that compression was actually not the way to go though a lot of audio engineers that work at radio stations here in LA actually told me that that's not the way to go is to to use a software post but who knows host yeah yeah but then you have to edit it you have to put it through post before you well I think it's just a plug in in what the program I use which is logic and it automatically just does that right but you have to run it through the program meaning you can't do it live right right they're doing it live yeah they're doing it live and I guess there's like icing there I'm talking about the atom Kroll show yeah I have podcast Envy I went to his setup it's so dope he's gonna mean there's something cool about that you and I I just shown in my office right we always do it this way and it's either in your office or in my office right that's what we do it there's something cool about that but his setup is pretty fucking sweet radio show you actually got this one of the same mics that you use it I guess Marc Maron and him both use and we tried it out and it sounds good well ours is a lot louder but I think a part of that is this show is a little more unstructured so there's people leaning back and yelling and stuff like that it's not really any of that going on a man show there's not really any of that going on the Kroll show you know I think for our purposes these are better do you listen to any podcast besides you know or just some kind of here and there I listen to disinfo I listen to psychedelics along psychedelic salons kind of cool because it's a podcast but really it's a bunch of old audio recordings like old Terence Mckenna recordings or stuff like that so I listen to that stuff but honestly I tried to listen to the news or I listen to talk radio for two reasons one you know to see if there's anybody that I agree with and two to see if there's anybody that's just completely out to lunch like I listen to Patriot on Sirius satellite radio the reason why I listen to it is just it's all fuckin bananas it's all these crazy assholes that want to burn gold and they're ready for the whole thing to come tumbling down they got their guns ready and this is Obama what he's trying to do with this Eric Andre you know those guys you don't fall for that shit that doesn't get in the back of your head like oh my god damn right we need to collect gold no you don't you don't come on man I think if this shit hits the fan Gold's not what we're gonna need we're gonna make bullets and gasoline that's what I think bullets gasoline guns places to stay somewhere you go where there's no radiation when the shit hits the fan there's so many human beings have devised so many ways to fuck each other up that if something ever really chaotic happened at this point in time where we really went it's like nuclear warfare man the golden can help you dog every time I'm away from LA this is the reason one of the things that maybe we should leave LA someday because every time I'm away from LA like I was out of town this weekend and when I was away I was like now's a good time if shit was to happen mm-hmm this would be a good time because I'm kind of out of the crowd I could escape easier you know cuz there's not a whole bunch of traffic and so vain and like I think I have like a whole suitcase of shit I have my computers and stuff my I think at a certain point time it becomes completely unnecessary to being such a large group of people the only benefit of it is that because there's so many people you're gonna get and especially because it's such a like a desired area you get a lot of fascinating people here yeah and like if you moved it at Denver like what you can do with the podcasts like Freddy Lockhart out on a plane I think what I could do is there's three comedy clubs in Denver there's two comedy works and there's one improv I could talk to the people that are coming in for that I can interview them make it like a radio show kind of yeah there's local comics there's a strong local comic scene in Denver so I could always like to have those guys come on and we could do Skype - I did Ariel Helwani his MMA show did it yesterday and I did it through Skype it's pretty badass man how did it sound it sounds he sounds great I used that stupid snowball microphone the only thing that's kind of fucked though is that you can't hear your own voice right I'm some ways to set it up that you could definitely yeah you could use these mics yes as an example yeah and if I had it set up like this like in like if I had it set up like this in Colorado and you had it set up like this in California and we just Skyped it together we could do a podcast it'd be pretty easy but then once I show you how sweet Colorado is you're gonna want to move - yeah there's not as many of your type of girls out there yeah change of standards yeah I think I don't know that I'm hippy is just as what's mostly there right like people that are working out and hippie yes boulders a lot of that boulders hippie and boulders people in really good shape right well no one wears makeup no one looks like a whore yeah that's kind of a bummer to get the girl pregnant and erson there's not a lot of girls like the ones that you're around all the time in California there's not a lot that's very rare for the whole world yeah well that's you know I I go ups and downs you know my dating is not it's it's it's like a stock market graph you know it's like I don't really look for ways yeah but what I'm saying is living in Los Angeles is giving you access to these girls that that's worth it he died with a hard-on you can find hot chicks in Colorado they're just not gonna be quite so needy yeah it's fucked up you know ever since I got in this relationship I already see my stand-up going away just like how it was does it's like hey if you want to have sex and hang out with this hot girl or do you want to stand up and hang out with four guys that you yeah barely now you got a tricky situation because if you really want to do stand-up you can't just do it during my shows or half-assed right so I'm making myself good at night but then you know have you been writing because when I'm you know I'm not writing as much either yeah you're weak but it's easy to do man I did that when I was in high school yeah I just have a whole joke about it about how when is in high school I played baseball I did all these sports until I started getting laid and then I was like whatever would all that other stuff my parents like what about baseball much yeah fun this new thing I think I like it more right no like once you start having sex like why am i playing baseball yeah what that's that shit's boring yeah i watch i watch have you you don't have your first set on tape do no no do you yeah watch the other day it's awful it's horrible what sucks is just just everything so do you like the new ones though I like the new ones definitely it's definitely like before you could you could see the nervousness on stage and I mean this was 2003 or whatever but it was gross I can't even it's hard to watch my sets from like last night yeah I killed it's still weird you know it's hard even if you're killing but man if you're not killing oh it's painful so painful yeah you got to figure out bro if you really want to do it because if you really want to do it there's only one way to do it you got to go gangbusters you got to like put together an act you got a rare opportunity man you're on the road with me all the time so you get to do these sets in front of these giant crowds I guess I you have how I look at stand-up is more as I enjoy doing it kind of like I like doing it playing baseball you know I like bowling but I guess I'm not looking as it in a career way yeah and I don't think I ever wanted to do it as a career wise I think I think if anything it's just a workout for this podcast even to make you more comfortable yeah it's just more comfortable and you know thinking up funny ideas and you're just being creative you know because if I'm not doing this then I'm painting if I have to be doing something and now right now it's just you just have so much in you you need to get out yeah shrooms really these nights to reset that though you need to sure me yes soon man it's it's a Sherman like the other day and it's it wasn't the best one but it definitely just opens up how you look at everything so reset yeah definitely a resetting I do that every time I get in the tank yeah thanks a big reset you need to try that but yeah any any any opportunity that you have to just fucking to step outside of the whole thing and just relax let's take a look at this let's assess this you know from an even position so many times in life man you're just on momentum right you know everyone step from the next it's like there's something pushing behind you and you just keep moving have you ever forgot to turn I forgot to put take off a condom after sex like not like oh no like like sometimes you know like I'll have sex in like then you know when I come and they'll take the condom throw away put a new condom on so I can continue and then not come again but I forget I have that condom on you're getting way too personal I know I know I'm trying I was trying to clean it up a little bit but I was rooming and then I went to go piss and I'm sitting there going uh and was waiting into the condo yeah I didn't know the condom and I did hear that water and I'm like what the floor I'd be the laziest motherfucker to be bothered you never nobody down there I didn't know was on there but it's crazy how much pee comes out so fast because it was like a full balloon when I looked down and the first thing you do fuck does it stay on your dick I don't know it stayed on pretty I guess pushes you stride or something I don't know but but but what's crazy your first thing to do is like holy shit and so I just like kind of like pulled it off in the weight of the pee dropped into the toilet and just start spraying out back out of the toilet you know with piss everywhere fucking that doesn't even make sense how does that condom stay on you while you're pissing did it didn't it didn't fall on a Lube did you use I didn't you know I did he is I think I might have had some flesh loop around no I didn't know I said no I just so it's just whatever Lube was on the condom yeah yeah wow that's fart a condom it was at a condo that's ridiculous did you go over your balls that's a that's an old joke a friend of mine Amir Galan um fuck I forgot what his fake name was he used to have a fake name that he's to use on stage I forget what his name was but anyway he he had this joke about the first time put on a condom it's really tight I got back from the bathroom the girl was laughing at me I was like this is fucking painful why are you laughing she goes doesn't have to go over your balls fucking idiot he had a bunch of great jokes his Owen yeah my friend got his girlfriend pregnant they were having anal sex yeah the baby looks like shit stupid but anyway you're so lazy you don't take off you know I just god I was shrooming having sex ever feel like an incredibly lazy person though do you ever like look at some of the shit you say um like lazy in general in life yeah just like I I always think I have some kind of like if I I got my thyroid checked but it was fine I always think that I always have had some kind of like you know I'm always feel like I need speed like I need something like when I drink so much coffee it doesn't feel like it doesn't anything are you do you think you have a DD or something like that do one of those fucking buckle up Republican guys there is no way out I was a kid they were just nutty they're just nutty kids stop coddling them no I probably think it's because I just don't work out I don't do shit like that that my body's just in fifth grader unit is slow right your body yeah you need to kick your body in here but all this humping should be doing something for you yeah absolutely not be firing up your fucking testosterone banks bang bang bang yeah no yeah sure I don't know what were we talking about we're talking about you being lazy as fuck yeah IIIi think it's either exercise or it's probably some kind of deficiency of some kind probably that I I need like well I think I know that uh I know friends that are on that adderall shit they just said I needed it to concentrate and okay yeah I guess but it's speed you know I can't think you're gonna last very long on speed yeah I don't like what it feels like I'll have a cup of coffee during the podcast and cut one cup of coffee is fine but if I have two cups of coffee during the podcast after the podcast is over I feel all amped up I feel like shit II really I don't feel that at all you only get like no it doesn't work but what I do notice is that I clinch when i when when instead of feeling that energy I'll find myself like clenching my teeth really hard I don't know I don't know where I do it all the time I noticed on the way home yesterday because I had two cups of coffee here yesterday and knows I was dreaming like why am i clenching my teeth like I don't know what it is like it's like it's all going to make my jaw dude you've got to be one of the weirdest motherfuckers I've ever met I do it all the time if you if you look back at old you streams you'll see like this line on my I do this I bite my cheek and are you thinking about anything what you're doing doing it I'm just like like you have this energy that you got to get out yeah my squeeze off around yeah wow maybe you have some like unaddressed energy issues you know maybe you feel like started doing something like like throwing in the discus or something like really physical right maybe you would like feel much better I've been trying this xbox dansgame unconnected when are they gonna have some sort of a martial arts game where like a robot does certain moves and you can kick it you know I'll get like moves forward and you can leg kick it it moves no punch it I don't have to do much I used to be a target I think this Kinect thing I don't know if you know what Kinect is it's like that that webcam thing that they put you put on top of your TV and it wrecks your body it works I don't know like I'm not haven't played that much but the games are played fucking bad-ass it's like where you just hold up your hand like you can do Netflix we're streaming through movies going like this with your hand moving it left or right your string through movies and then if you want to pick one you push you pull your hand out and grab it and it's kind of like whatever Minority Report or whatever but but they have games too where you don't have any controllers anymore so how how accurate is it how effective is it you know from what I understand it's not the best but I have never noticed it not being accurate I think it's pretty accurate so I've heard these oh as long as you're not playing like a first-person shooter or something where I think it's good I think them for that I think I think it's really based on lighting and clothing and because like the girl is with was wearing a dress and it couldn't detect her separate legs so it was kind of fucking up so she took off her dress and then it worked perfect it's a trick I want you to be a whore exactly that's really what that's what I thought it's because you have a dress on too much clothes on what are you doing over here that's crazy so now what if you're using it as a first-person shooter how do you pull triggers um see I I don't know I've been played a first-person shooter but what I would imagine yeah I don't know that'd be weird yeah I don't know how they're going to do it we can't talk we can't talk about that one thing but there is a crazy first-person shooter that we can't talk about so I'm out now why not because I don't think it's known somebody tell us this no the video that I showed you that Kevin Pereira might have showed us oh right right right yeah yeah that's all incognito I didn't know what the fuck you're talking about yeah because you got to think of a guy if you're doing a first-person shooter you got got to deal with two things one how do you simulate movement like how do you go forward know you're running how do you run forward and how does the Machine know you're running back yeah because you're not moving forward though you know I think it's something with your hands like because with the dance game it was like you did like something like that that means forward you go like this and you shake your hand to the right that means you're shooting well ideally what you want is like a giant dome or a ball rather and you'd be inside that ball like a hamster ball right and that ball you have like some sort of a 3d helmet on like complete yeah you know what is it virtual reality complete virtual reality helmet on and then you would be walking around with this ball you could walk in any direction you know it wouldn't feel totally real like you would kind of be realizing that you're on a ball and then you're stuck in this you know in this thing but that would be I mean other than that how the fuck else could you simulate movement unless you just did it inside like the virtual reality done wouldn't even be virtual anymore you'd have to do it inside like put a program and then make a program the exact parameters of say an airplane hangar right and then you have an empty airplane hangar and they walk around inside that hangar yeah I think it's all wired and think you could do it that way but then that kind of defeats the whole purpose of virtual reality right yeah the idea is that you're supposed to be able to do it wherever you are yeah would you ever go to Burning Man No why not too many hippies I learned about hippies when I moved to Boulder I liked them in theory yeah I liked them in theory I don't I don't like a lot of people that are asking for money all the time I find that should be very annoying I don't like people playing shitty songs and wanting a dollar right you know for the most part they're cool but you know there's just there's too much of that hippie movement that wants people to help them you know and this is how I feel about that if I felt like everybody was on the ball and everybody was doing their best and you know I'm a generous person and I think one of the things about being generous is if you have the opportunity to do so it feels really good to be generous especially if it doesn't affect you it's not like you're being generous and it's hurting you you know so I think it's it's important but in passing like say you're passing love to the left and there's a big circle of people man the real problem is just a lot of fucking people that never keep passing the love they take it and then they walk away you know there's there's some people that are always there for you there's some people and they're doing their best and they're there they're living their life and you're doing your best and you're living your life and you're helping each other and you hey man can I borrow your truck I gotta move fuck yeah man come on over do it anytime you got my shit you know you know we're friends you help me I help you we're all together but we all know those the few people that don't contribute they always need something and they don't contribute and my experience that's my experience with hippies that's my experience with a lot of people that you know are like really into like socialist ideals a lot of it is because they're fucking lazy man they're fucking lazy and they don't work that hard and they don't do their part and they somehow or another feel like the whole system is unfair man which fuck yeah of course it is course it's unfair of course it's corrupt course it's fucked up but that's not why you're a loser there's a lot of people that aren't losers most people are losers because they're lazy as shit and they want to blame other people for that and they want to blame society and they want to blame look Society is completely fucked but guess what it's not this one person that makes it fuck the whole thing is its fuck because it's on a foundation of bullshit it doesn't make any sense but knowing that you see what it is make your path make your path figure out something that you can do to feed yourself okay figure out something you can do to put a roof over your head just figure it out man fucking figure it out it doesn't mean you have to be a fucking asshole to be successful doesn't mean you have to be a part of the system man no just don't stop asking people for money stop being a fucking mooch get your shit together okay that's my problem with hippies my problem with hippies is part of the whole idea of being a hippie is being like really nice and being really relaxed and sometimes life does not call for that sometimes life calls for you gotta get off your fucking ass and make something happen man yeah you know that's there's a lot I had a friend who is what his girlfriend was having a baby this is many many years ago and I had a fucking scream at this guy this guy was unemployed and he he was like you would what he couldn't get his shit together he couldn't make something happen he was trying to be a comedian for a while that didn't work out and then he was trying to do some other stuff he's trying to do some radio on a budget and we have this conversation and I'm like man you've got to rely you're gonna become that fucking guy you're gonna become that an unbelievably pathetic guy who can't feed his kids right you gotta fucking do something man you got to make something happen and you know it's not hey you know we really need some food do you think you could help us that's the hippy approach to go to people and you've got to make your own fucking way you got to make your own way and that was my problem with Boulder and that would ultimately I'm sure it'd be my problem with Portland and it's a bit of my problem with San Francisco and it's not that I'm not a kind person I'm a very kind person but I recognize the difference between someone who's in need and someone who's fucking lazy and there's a lot of people that just weak they're weak is shit man and they have no philosophy to live their life by they have no discipline that they've developed over years of trying to accomplish things to the point where they have this sense of personal sovereignty they can take care of themselves and I usually everybody needs help but if if somebody will help you if they know that you're the type of person that will help them and if you know that you're the type of person that does their best the what drives me nuts is when you someone wants help like motherfucker you're not even helping yourself like look what you're doing for yourself and you want someone else to step in and manage your fucking situation that ridiculous man that's that's that is the number one problem with the whole idea of everyone together man the real problem is that everyone doesn't do their fucking part and that's the real problem there's a lot of lazy bitches in this world yeah well the reason why I was asking about Burning Man is I often thought the same thing like fuck hippies you know cuz I been there done that I hate it you know I hated the people to the lazy if there's good there's legit hippie right but I hung out with bad hippies they got bad you know so everything else it's like MMA fans you know I have a lot of friends there MMA fans I've friends have graduated from Harvard friends that are fuckin I know guys were scientists I the guy who created beavis and butt-head Mike judge huge MMA family there's a lot of intelligent MMA fans yeah but there's a lot of idiots yeah but I was looking at these videos lately cuz the girl goes every year where and so there is some fucking cool shit going on at Burning Man I'm sure like and I guess you can rent these big RVs you know and and that's the way to do it to have your RV don't like live in a tent or whatever they have showers and stuff but there's this thing called I don't have you ever heard of it it's cut they're called a let's see what are they called most its zo tropes have you heard of a 0 zo trope is the I'm sorry's otro zoetrope zo e TR ope what it is is it's like a carousel type thing like a merry-go-round and each kind of you know couple couple feet there's an like a draw or there's some kind of sculpture like it's like a monkey hanging from a vine and then the next one like you know three feet over isn't the same monkey but it's kind of changing a little you know so when it turns and you have a flashing light that just flashes at a certain rate looks like the monkeys are moving so it's in the middle of this desert and there's like they have these statues of like people diving down into the ground that just melt into the ground they have like these monkey that are spinning check this out right here here's here's some here's a monkey one I don't know if you can see this here's a monkey wow that is bad and it's fucking trippy so anyway so basically they've done is animation animation yeah and just like the old claymation models that used to use for King Kong and shit yeah or like a little flip book where you draw on a flip pick and you flip it that's badass man I'm down with the artistic end of it you know I'm down with the the whole idea of all these artists getting together and doing cool shit I just think there'd be a lot of stinky people I just wonder why I don't or maybe they have why doesn't a collection of people like yourself do a comedy show why they're there because that is you know I'd rather not perform there if I was gonna go there I'd want to hang out magic performing wants to like a like a Woodstock of comedy psychedelic comedy there would be so much mushrooms and so much everything else you want I would be too fucked up I would I wouldn't want to be talking on stage through a microphone that's the last thing you want to do when you're on shrooms I mean yeah you just don't do Sherm's that hour and a half two hours I think if you're there you just want to experience it that's what I would want to do yeah I'd perform enough man I perform plenty you know I think I Freddy Soto used to say this back in the day you know people used to offer Freddy gigs at like bars and stuff like that it's like no thank you appreciate it but I only do comedy clubs man that's it and that was his he just is like it's not worth it man you go to these bars and everyone's talking and you can't do your act right you rush it because you're trying to get their attention he was totally right you know he's totally right that's kind of how I am right now I only do shows I'll do here's my show I'm doing it some at this theater come see me I'm not this comedy club come in that's and then there's no problems there's no hassles it is what it is but if you're just doing a fucking look you're at a tent with some speakers and you're on the stage and all these people are all they're all fucked out of their minds but you know what why should they pay attention to you they shouldn't you would feel illegitimate standing there asking them to if you knew that everyone in the crowd was on mushrooms you would have nothing to say it like in less I'm on mushrooms - what am I gonna tell you guys I'm not gonna tell you shit man you're communicating with the air the alien overlords right now you know these beings that have come on asteroids and their spores have infested this earth you're communicating with them through eating them what I'm gonna tell you some stupid dick jokes yeah but you're you're pretty pretty known for being a psychic psychedelic speaker I mean you always do the marijuana shows here in town and stuff like that for the same reason - the same kind of people yeah but I think part of being into psychedelics and understanding psychedelics and have had a psychedelic experiences it sort of negates any idea of you wanting that sort of attention like doing a show yeah like when you're doing a show the beautiful thing about the show is that people enjoy and they have a good fucking time to come see a comedy show but that's not what you want to do when you're jazzed out of your head you know if you're on psychedelics you don't want to go see a comedy show you know I don't want to see anything structured I certainly don't want someone on stage like forcing their like there's a lot of things you say on stage in a comedy show that's just to get a laugh you know that's what it's there for it's there to spice up the show to have more fun and those things will stand out like like fucking wet shits in your underwear they're just like oh what's this if you're on mushrooms every like jokey joke that you have which is blood but bring Doug Benson some black lights and some body paint it might be a good time Doug Benson would just be hugging girls ha you can have a hug too never met anybody who's hi more consistently than Doug Benson yeah every now and then he'll send me a tweet you're high right now aren't your a text message you're high right now motherfucker it's so funny because I never knew that was real like when I first wanted when I first met Doug I thought the whole marijuana thing was kind of like an act kind of like an Andrew Dice Clay kind of like you know like he was doing it I mean he might have smoked weed but I didn't think he was the the crazy stoner in just after hanging out with him that first night hell fuck yeah immediately he's like every five minutes eighth let's go back to your hotel room and smoke another joint yeah those guys like to go deep man there says there's some dudes who go real deep those guys involved in the medical marijuana like those those look like normal and those guys go so deep we were not normal but the cannabis cup that was the deepest that I've ever been there was an inn on Melrose in Hollywood I was one of the judges and it was at a head shop and they closed the head shop down they papered up the window so no one could see inside they put a doorman in the back locked the front and then they turned the whole thing into this cannabis cup party really fucking bold move man because they did this shit in the middle of Hollywood and the place was just filled with weed I mean it was unbelievable and no one stopped they just kept going deeper and deeper and deeper till I left there I want to get something to eat I was like I'm just no way I can drive home right now I just gotta hang out for a few hours I had a hangout I mean most the time when you're high driving is not an issue because driving is not any more complicated than walking you know I mean you you're as long as you're not smoking indica as long as you're not smoking some dopey weed you know you're if you're driving and you're high you know just be extra careful watch what you're doing it doesn't affect your hand-eye coordination I mean I do jujitsu and we die kickboxing we there's not a problem but but I was so high then I was like no fucking way man I was there's no way I'm gonna drive this thing and risk not being in control of my senses I'm gonna have a cup of coffee and have some food and just fucking sit back and read my cellphone for a little bit go over my notes you know sit down for a bit before I Drive home it was too it was too stupid cuz like you get to a certain point when when people are like everybody's handing you cookies here's a vaporizer bag hit this this is a new blunt paper that I developed hit that and everyone's past and joints left to right it's like a never-ending like a cyclone of joints getting passed around it was fucking ridiculous but you get to this point where you're not even high anymore it's not like you're high anymore it's like you're not there it's like you're you were in a room and you know the room has one window and it's a circular window and the room is like four by four wide you can't even move any of the toilet it's just you you in that room in that circular window and that circular window is now how you view the rest of the world you're looking out that window go what the fuck is going on out there cuz this is crazy I don't even know what's happening out there that's what it's like it's like you're detached from the world you're so high you're detached you know but those things if anybody ever wanted like some sort of argument against the cause right go to one of those cannabis cups man the good thing is man everybody's friendly as fuck I've been to shit a hundred medical marijuana shows or you know parties or parties at the Playboy Mansion I've never seen so much as an argument never seen a raised voice yeah never seen a push never seen anybody get crazy not even girls you know I mean every time you go out some girl we sent talking shed to some other girl everywhere in Vegas and LA anyway so if you stay around the night long enough and pay attention you're gonna hear some girl yell at some girl right yeah totally but not in in when in this weed shows was we chose everybody's is so nice yeah this is people if people really realize what it could do for you you know so many people like I have a friend who's like super organized and like he's like really ambitious and he said he produces television shows like a real go-getter very nice guy and but he's so anal and but just fucking wound up about shit he only wears black he won't wear anything other than black this whole like you open up his wardrobe it's black dress it when somebody does that or they only wear the white t-shirt like John kept-kept Barelli do that he only wears a white t-shirt and you know like everything that's like his outfit yes uniformly seems to work yeah does he wear it like when he goes out on dates only that one dad I don't know but there's definitely jasc amount of date see what's up yeah but like there's people like that that like only wear certain things well this dude isn't just in badly in need of a joint all right I keep telling them I go dude just trust me man just trust me just try a little weed it'll help you relax Mike you're a good guy got a lot of good things going on you just need a little fresh perspective man and that's totally her look at you had a live proofing the other day on that podcast 98 you know it was like you just need smoke we immediately went after smoking weed everything was great you know every podcast aka the disaster disaster a Brian Whittaker apparently is very upset with the depictions of him from that podcast tweeting mean thanks to you yeah he started attacking me on Twitter just like today it's like dude we're all right the thing I'm saying is I'm trying to make sure that people that are at home can listen to this podcast and understand what's going on instead of having a million people talking at once we don't attack on you I understand what we are saying so for the people that don't know about that podcast and it's not worth listening to it wasn't a good one but there was just he just had an issue where he didn't know how to be on a podcast he didn't know that you can't talk while other people were talking right and it wasn't you know he didn't have a chance to prepare he just got into it you know he didn't even know he was gonna be doing it we've talked about him to me we have he's a good dude he's just out there doing his thing it's hard out there for a pimp yeah but at least it's easier when you work at the improv you know you get stage time cuz you you get a lot of people that hate on you man of course I've always had that ever since I started talking you I've been getting haters respect the red band yeah cuz people well whenever you do something you mean even you do comedy people look at it and god I look so easy I could do that too yeah you ain't even funny I could fucking do that but then they you know they look at you and lose you know how to make edit some videos or something fucking I can do that too right you know they just they look at someone who's in a nice spot and right I think what the fuck why isn't that me ya know it's hard to not be jealous man there's some some ingrained shit I see with my kids it's really interesting that three-year-old in the one-year-old eye sometimes a three-year-old would get upset at the one-year-old if the one-year-old getting too much attention she'll take things from our own stuff and it's like they just it's just nature nature wants you you want to collect all that love you know that's why people develop great personalities they develop great personalities because they realized somewhere along the line something you know with rewards is that you know when you have a great person now had the reward as people always nice to you you get all this nice energy people want to be around you that's the reason why great personalities get invented because people become a whore's for other people's love you know I mean that's really what it is I mean it's it's a beautiful thing in both ways but really the root of it all is that people really want positive attention so when you see little jealousy and like little kids and then you see jealousy and like grown adults you know you see like really petty shit and haters and I love to go on like those gossip blogs you know and just just to read I don't even know who these people are you know but someone will you know it'll be someone from The Bachelor or someone from something I just like to read the comments just I don't even know what the fuck the story's about half the time I can't paid his baby and you have mom and they're in court whatever whatever what's going on the comments I go down to comments and it just hey yeah they say evilness and it's ridiculous because when people the the biggest thing is like if it wasn't for Rogan this that doesn't that I'm like yeah if it wasn't for Rogan he saw my work he liked what I did he higher talking about me like I'm not even here I know it's but but what is like a company like NBC the way like Jay Leno should you know people are managed a like if it wasn't for NBC you would be nobody you know that's it's it's me getting Joe seeing my work and then hiring me a job it's really simple he's an artist hello he's an artist and he was creating things that I thought were very worthwhile and so I hired them it's it's really simple pretty easy and you know and people that you know there's a weird diner in people like you know whoa how are you guys friends you guys are so different like you don't have to be the same as your fucking friends man that's that's silly right you know if everyone was the same then you know I'll be running around saying the same shit and cock block in each other listen to Paula Abdul opposites attract is that what you said I heard forever your girl the other day it's the music on the podcast Joe yeah I do too man but we can't do that anymore the serious serious deal is signed Lee sign yeah it's all done I mean I haven't wrote my name on it they did just oh yeah yeah but I was gone I'm gonna so we're gonna have it unserious it'll be 12 episodes we have to get ready we have to pull music if we have music on we have to check them over episodes episodes that we've ever done exit night 12 but what's what's your five top five that you've got top five well my number one favorite just just be for sheer far out factors always Duncan Duncan's my favorite because just Duncan's just so fucking weird and like when he starts chanting Buddhist mantras and talking to you about the bhagavad-gita and you know and he just gets me going man Duncan and I and he doesn't have these conversations he says with anybody else either he's like he and he and I we have just this weird chemistry when we get together it's all crazy talking the other day I called him up to call him up yesterday because I said hey we're doing the 100th podcast today you know maybe you want to like walk in like halfway in and sit down with us I was thinking like maybe that'd be cool to have like guests come over while we're doing it right and he goes I would love to because he's a middle of this show these putting together yeah and he goes I didn't mushrooms last night man I was surrounded by elves they have so much to talk to you about yeah I was scared to fuck around he said I was surrounded by elves he said I did more mushrooms that I've ever done I was surrounded by L so Duncan's gonna be in the podcast next week tell us this whole this whole thing and you you recently went truman up in northern california sylvain it's like north of santa barbara wouldn't the world be a better place if people just did that if they had retreats you know instead of going I mean even have these wine tasting retreats how about right next to the wine tasting retreats a mushroom tree yeah go there everybody's gonna be nice to you it's all soothing sounds and you know you're in a comfortable room and there's the shaman are all experienced everybody who works there's professional you know you pay a couple hundred bucks a day or whatever the hell you're doing just blast it's pretty amazing how much better wine tastes when it's at the vineyard I don't know why because it's all the same it's modeled you know is it well the ones who offer the tours are they like really known labels yeah oh yeah these are like the big dogs so these are for wine remember the name I don't remember buy wine by the bottle like like if it's I've got a cool bottle I'll buy it really yeah there's kinds of wines I like like I like more lows I like you know shit like that but I just usually go by the bar like oh that's a crazy cat on that you know yeah I never used to go if I was on a date perhaps back in the day I would order a glass of wine or a bottle of wine but I would never like order a glass of wine while eating dinner but now I do all the time yeah I do all the time like I'd like a like a nice strong red wine with like a steak like it just tastes better it's like this little you know this is a thing that the flavors all combining and as I've gotten like like Matt Lichtenberg my buddy is a huge wine fanatic he's like he's a he's a wine geek I mean he has this crazy wine cellar in his home with some insane amount of money worth of wine in it and he's one of those guys that can tell you why a wine is good and what year it's good and you know what what part of the country it comes from and all that kind of shit and when when you're around a guy like that and he they know so much about wine then you start to sort of appreciate it like oh okay this is some weird tasting art form it's like they're trying to create this ultimate taste and it's a very specific taste and if you're not it's a weird thing like the whole idea of acquired taste I used to think that was so stupid like why would you acquire a taste for something like caviar the fucking stuff you know it's super expensive and it really kind of tastes like shit when you first take it why wouldn't you just okay it's it tastes like shit forever and this is what it is I have to worry about it anymore but no people get into it and then they start getting more and more expensive tasting you're getting stuff that's thousands and thousands of dollars salty fucking stupid fish eggs well wine is kind of like that too and that like the first time you try wine like a little kid or something like the fuck would get into that but when you really like like get a nice Pinot Noir and a delicious steak you're cut into that Stig mmm then you have a sip of the wine ah all the flavors together it takes a while to appreciate it but knowing someone who knows as much about wine as I do I mean he tells me so much about you know like you know it's all about how they put it in what kind of barrels they use to store it and how they store and how long they store it and how long how long has it been bottled for and it's pretty amazing that one of the wineries I went to they they did cheese pairings which is cool because you never you think okay they're gonna mix it this cheese with this wine yeah it's gonna just taste like now if I still use the word faggot which I don't I might throw it out here right there okay I like cheese you do you like wine I do listen it just sounds fruity Tooty yeah it does say I went to a cheese pairing wine tasting dude you know wet that pussy gets when you're going to a wine tasting that's the most ridiculous wet puss because they're still normal for the first time in their life like that normal Brian's a good guy he's not taking me to see poison in concert that's right so wine tasting and in the middle of Northern California he's an amazing guy yeah that's cool you know it but you went for the fun of you didn't win no it was more like hey want to get away not you no internet no work I would like up there it's beautiful yeah it's the crazy mountains there's a huge lake at one point I forget the name of it north of Santa Barbara is this humongous lake where it's just best fishing no other families up there is it just couples there's no families I saw families but it's a lot of bed and breakfast is a lot of nice historic old hotels you know that you go in and there's just like every rooms unique that's what we say that like this place called Peterson at the end or the Inn at Peterson is this mirror seniya nez yes yes right next Tom like us used to always rant and rave about that it's amazing there was aa Strich farms where it was just huge fields of ostriches running around you can go there and get like ostrich eggs and like hang out with ostriches but they're running around they look like dinosaurs they look like it's it's amazing man I highly recommend if you just want a weekend out out of LA take the kids go go to some farms it's pretty relaxing Jeff ostrich is a creepiest fuck man yeah all birds are creepy as fuck yeah you know I've been joking around about it about you know in my act a little bit about the mass bird deaths that happened but about how birds are really dinosaurs that survived but they really are I mean that's that's the the closest relative to the dinosaur is the bird and an ostrich is a fucking dinosaur it's a big-ass weird-looking dinosaur yeah with the taste delicious you ever get the ostrich burger yes Oh strong thanks bye make oh yeah I'll bet you cook you got to have it rare though don't be a pussy you don't have to worry about mad cow with those bitches just get that shit rare fire that fucker up or over feel that that raw rare ostrich meat so delicious man yeah it's good stuff would you go camping here in LA tent camping shit you know go camping where I can drive home the only time I go camping is going too far away to drive home and if I have guns on me yeah I'm going hunting with Ricky Schroder are you really yeah we're going we're going to this ranch where you could shoot boar and they even have bison at this ranch and it's like you pay them for whatever you shoot and then you go out onto their dev this giant hunk of property out near Riverside out near San Diego that way and so I'm going oh that's cool man yeah I didn't want to go for a while I'm supposed to go hunting in October with Randy Couture natural reina Dora we're going for a TV show so before that I'm gonna get some in with Ricky that guy loves hunting man he got it when I talked to him about his eyes lit up and everything he wants to come back on the podcast oh I was gonna say that Ricky to me was one of my favorites I might my favorites were always that out of no we're people like the Ricky Schroder or even Kim prayer I think was one of my favorite ones of all time Kevin was awesome Rick has got some interesting stuff going on right now - man he just got some serious skin cancer removed from his face serious yeah oh you gotta be people walking around outside without sunscreen man be fucking careful if you see some little mark on you man people die from weird skin you know little things when you're out there getting burnt you don't think it's a big deal and then you get melanoma he had a big chunk of his face removed man he's got a big scar right on his time did you get checked a lot yeah well I'm not at risk because I'm fairly dark-skinned I get tan pretty least easily but I don't fuck around the Sun man I don't but he's Ricky's right he's pale you know he's like white you like paper you know you got to be careful as fuck and he's always out in the Sun he's like mr. outdoorsy you know he's got this giant piece of property and he's got property in Colorado recount Ricky Schroder is an interesting guy man he's a super outdoorsman character he's always out there like chopping wood and shit and getting things done you know he's like he look like wishes he lives on a farm or some plate that I think growing up poor or rather growing up super rich and growing up rich and famous from the time as early as he can remember he was a celebrity and he was rich so he's always had so much fuckin money that I think he likes driving around pickup trucks he likes like doing like manual labor and shit like that but when you do that you got to put your sunscreen on homie yeah especially California out here this fucking Heat the Sun constantly beaten down on you people get cancer you gotta be careful I have a bunch of moles I'm a very moldy motherfucker but my mom's had a few cut out and so yeah I saw I recently went because there's this one that I have on my back that always is like crunchy you know it's like you know it's kind of it's it's like it's not good yeah it's not good it's not crunchy it just feels like different than all the other ones you know and sometimes you know if that was your problem they'd pull that out and all sudden point you get think clearer and right you start going to the gym I just that that mold was like a little vampire sucking the life out of you so I went there and she's like no that's fine it's normal and I'm like really that's why is it no that's just kind of his or whatever and then she showed me pictures like if it ever looks like this comeback it's Annie Oakley style look at your back exactly what the fuck what is it what is it supposed to look like when it's bad it's like it's like right around it looks kind of like when she showed me was like oh yeah yeah that looks bad you know not this little no mold that's a little flaky or whatever yeah when are they gonna fix that moles can kill you yeah keep a good eye on your mole because it might be a bomb how you supposed to see that especially be gotten in a weird place like what if he died of a mole that was like right near your asshole who looks in their asshole yeah you know look at assholes and hotel rooms it's like girls asshole you look at girls how so if you banging her from behind your own hotel room yeah cuz that's the only time where there's good lighting and good mirrors I'll sit on like the counter and just like fucking spread open really once in a while you should check it out just to look at it hmm I mean always last time you looked near baho it's been a long two exactly what if you open it up and there's this big purple I wait for signals from it if it's sending me signals saying is something wrong constant itching weird noises then I'll go check it out Kenny G a so have you ever had an itchy asshole like it for like a couple days it was non ck but Dane Cook that's weird that does happen I I actually we've all had HD assholes I was thinking about itchy assholes I was like oh oh yeah that's right there's like three thousand jokes for about Gucci assholes yeah there's quite a few I mean did the issue with Dane and Louie obvious it was a we really had done it first but yeah but whole jokes are quite common yeah if you if you think about a subject and it's an obvious subject for a joke chances are someone's already done a hundred jokes on it you know you know when I looked up the other day you know I was writing this chapter in my book and it has to do with porn and so I I was talking about the moment that I I've realized that the internet was taking porn to a whole new level was the moment I forget who it was it might have been Duncan sent me an email and the email heading said home run and then I opened up the email and it just said I love people in all capital letters and a link so I clicked the link and it opens up it's belladonna on all fours with a baseball bat stuffed in her answer I mean it's stuffed in there fat end first which I didn't even think was possible and I remember doubled face-palming like the home alone kid and going this bitch is just taking to another level she stuffed the baseball and then I thought about it or is she taking it to another level and I went and did a Google search and there's two million eight hundred thousand hits for baseball bat in the ass yeah it's it's normal and you know what normal shit no you know was she when she did that she used to tweet it about that where she was stretching it out for like a whole week like I got a big anal scene you know she had like all these butt plugs and she just spent the week getting ready for doing shit like that oh you know she doesn't do porn anymore I heard I heard she retired well she had that really sad interview I don't remember what it was for whether it was Nightline or one of those shows but you know whether they they you know they made her feel bad about it and you know and they asked her you know what happened to you how did you become this porn star and they kind of like go over her past and she'll like that and then at the end she was like you know I'm done I'm not doing this anymore and then they found out afterwards she had done some more movies after they you know after she said that all right it was weird was like you know you kind of wanted to root for her to get out of it and then she's still in it and it's like you know fucking not everybody could be a ballet instructor okay some some people gonna be porn stars and by the time they're that age were they're gonna be porn stars man the least of their problems is fucking on film that's the least of their problems is that baseball in their ass that's the least their problems the big problem is what what have you become that you're letting someone put a baseball bat in your ass what has happened to you to get you to this point it's not the bat itself that's not the real issue it's who who are you like what kind of a strange person are you that you you know you've got your asshole up in the air and there's a giant log in it a big fucking bat and then there's two million eight hundred thousand hits of that always yeah but then you also think about is that only is bad if you look if you think it is bad you know like if I don't think that's good if it's like hey I could put yeah I know but it's like hey I could put baseball that in my ass that equals twenty thousand dollars okay so you think you think it paid that much cuz I don't think they do no I don't think they do either I think it's a couple grand if they're lucky and I think that might have been during the heyday you know I think nowadays I don't you know those girls were getting like half-million-dollar vivid deals you remember I remember hanging out with Jenna Jameson's husband and he was a producer and he was giving me the whole skinny on how much money there is in the porn industry and this dude you know he had all the numbers and I was like that is incredible like there was so much money and then the internet came along the Internet just robbed them all yeah sucked it all the way and now I mean how the fuck do you make money now doing porn I think I think there's definitely still money there it's more of you just have to do more like I know a lot of these girls they'll do like you know like a spanking video and make 500 then they'll you know do another video later that day where it's just them masturbating and they get a thousand you know so it's like then you think of it that way it's like all right you just make $2,000 today this isn't for a website is it yes most of these are websites you know fetish websites or you know exchanging content I think that the the weirdest thing about knowing all these porn stars I think the saddest thing is not even what how they got into it or that they do it cuz I don't have a problem with it is that their future because a lot of them don't have it an idea yeah once that they're like one pleats yeah they're like fighters I mean is that where you go to you know like a truck stop and is that really older woman then you're just like wow she used to be a yeah you know Playboy bunny well you know look this this Avenue this Internet Avenue has opened up the door to the point where there's way way way more porn stars and they're everywhere back in the day you know and porn is so much more available when I was a kid there was the way he got porn was magazines when I was a kid VHS has came out while I was in high school I remember we got one it was like a big deal in her house you know and my dad had a couple of my stepfather a couple porns laying around the house too and I got to watch those two it was like what the hell is this you know to go from like it never existed or every now and then you saw a magazine and the weird thing about those magazines were they had rules so you'd buy a porn magazine but there was rules and one of the rules was the man couldn't have a hard-on yeah they still have those rules really yeah like worried they can't show insertion and you know in certain mags but some magazines they can yeah but back then was all magazines back then there was no magazines that showed hard-ons right and I think I mean none he could find and there was like you know you'd ask the guy at the counter if you were bold you know the books too you really want to ask him okay how come nobody's dicks hard what's going on here you know you don't really bring it up to him but there was always like these weird poses where they were being like not just one but like 20 different poses and in each one of them the girls like moaning like she's an X II and the dude doesn't have a hard-on right again every one of them it's like what is the message that they're trying to send you you know what is the message that they're trying to send you is it that this is just how the universe works and that women that are way hotter than you could ever possibly imagine will always wind up with gay guys and you're gonna be alone by yourself jerking off under pictures of them what is that what it is what is the the message well I can't they have hard-ons they're naked in there they're and then the this reality of it all comes into play because you see all these 20 different scenes like this bitch is not giving up in every scene she's super enthusiastic she seems non-judgmental this guy can't get it up and she's doing everything for him she's posing she's got her ass up in the air she's lying her back with a leg spread sucking on her fingers she's letting him pick her up and he's holding her by the ants and his dick still limp it's still limp and this bitch is just there for him the whole way she's like super some way eventually he's gonna get a hard-on I know it I just keep posing for him until she's in all these weird poses and never loses interest never has the you know should be like at least the 18 to 19 pose she should be like what the fuck like what's going on like why do you have my leg split spread and you know you're laying your limp dick on my pelvis right you know like like a drowning victim just pulled ashore you know it's like slop I mean that's what it's like he's got his limp dick and he's laying it on her pelvis like who's that for like what who doesn't want hard dicks like who was whose there's like this is where this is where we draw the line you want to get all naked crazy and pretend you're fucking so if you had to look at a dick it was either hard or limp you would pick hard all the time if I had to look at a dick it depends if I'm beating awful the last thing you want to do is be beating off to a dude with a limp dick so I'd rather have hard dicks yeah because you can't even imagine that that would feel good you'd feel like that the guy would be embarrassed and that the pointless and she's she doesn't feel good because he's not even excited and so there's a lot of like weird shit going on there at least if the guy has an erection while he's feeling good it feels good at least she's happy that she can give him an erection it's a much more positive experience is that hotter for you if the dick is black or white I can't really relate to black dicks see I always relate to a black dick if it's big but in a little tiny micro white dick yeah I'd rather have hard black dick fucking a girl because for some reason to me that's work not here or something like that big black dick really yeah really so you find yourself saying that as you're doing the stroking motion why whisper it what for real that makes it makes it more naughty to you yeah it just seems like you're oh you're getting fucked for realsies I remember some girl some girl came to the comedy store one night and she gave us the rules of being a porn star she was was I think she was Ron Jeremy and she was like you know rule number one is don't fuck black guys until they pay you you have to you can't do it right away don't fuck them until they pay you rule number two is no anal for a long time you got to keep it keep it to yourself I'm like you have strategies on what you hold back when you do porn oh yeah honey it's a business oh yeah honey it's a business Wow yeah I think they strategize when to give up for the black dick you can't just right away start fucking black eyes hey hey hey hey settle into that a little like some girls like like jenna jameson never fucked a black guy well that's a big thing important once you go black you're actually considered different really if you did it's like a weird so why do girls why do any girls do black guys just I mean for their career why do they do that maybe I don't know they're just easy yeah they're just they just want to fuck black guys I guess yeah maybe maybe they don't care maybe they're there for equal rights I guess but a lot of the porn buyers or southern and stuff like that and once you fucker black I don't want that stupid just look please there's a disproportionate amount of all interracial porn sold the deep south yeah I still hold joke about that that's right yeah it's true story it's true statistic yeah disproportionate amount so then it's not black guys buying that stuff it's it's scared white guys don't look that wine woman oh man I can't believe we're doing our knitter oh yeah stop looking me in the eyes stop bitch oh yeah I think that uh that whole black-white thing eventual is gonna go away I think we're all gonna be like one strange shade of grey you know one mocha one something Mexican yeah yeah this it's not the black-white thing can't last it only lasted back when people couldn't move to other places when you were stuck in China and everybody else was in China while you fed off the same gene pool and he produced Chinese people you know but once the Africans got to you know the northern Africa and Egypt things started getting weird and they took over you know Cairo and then they move into other places and then the Moors you know hit Sicily and then all these no fucking the Spaniards come over on boats and fuck the American Indians and then eventually eventually we're gonna be a world culture I just don't see how you can keep people from interbreeding for the next millennium I just don't see it happen I think in the next thousand years we're all gonna be one shade you know they think that's what happened when the ender Thals you know Indiana tall's got is assimilated into the population they used to think they went extinct but now they think they sort of went extinct because women wouldn't fuck him but men would fuck the women men human men would fuck Neanderthal women and make babies with him but in the end at all the men were like what the fuck nothin nothin they just got on the outs hmm that would be weird what would that one final specie look like yeah well it's the end of the world once you make Jesus well it's got probably gonna look like aliens yeah you know I mean you look at the gray alien the model alien this big big head and you know sexless body and you know and no muscle tone and that's probably the next stage I mean if you look at monkeys and then you look at us and what is the difference well are our heads aren't the the the monkeys have smaller heads our heads are bigger our muscles aren't as big we're softer we're not we last longer we we have you know nutrition and information all that stuff but physically we're far weaker than the chimps you know and then well then they're gonna be more weak than us with bigger heads their heads are going to be bigger they're going to be more more smooth and less muscular and sinewy because they're not gonna need that they're never gonna be in combat you're never gonna be fighting for their life against other bodies and try to take down animals to eat them they're moved way way way way past that shit that's I mean the the the human alien connection you know for a lot of people they believe that what their alien image represents whether it's real or imagined what it represents is humans from the future and that the eventual metamorphosis of the human animal the the morphing the evolving will ultimately lead to something like that we we look at inherently all our issues well first of all with sexual issues we have emotional issues we have you know anger issues we have all these things well the all the depictions of the aliens they've gone completely past all that shit you eliminate all your your sexual issues if you can reproduce you know outside of a male/female environment if you're able to reproduce completely in in laboratories or in you know petri dishes or whatever the fuck they're doing you know if you if we if the human animal moves past reproduction in a natural way I mean that might be what if they found out that babies were 100 percent smarter and they lived twice as long and they were you know five times more resistant to diseases if you raise them in a test-tube if everybody raised them outside of the womb and some new machine that someone created well every woman would want that why would you want your kid to be stupid because you want to carry it around inside you you selfish cunt put the baby in the machine right you know and so that that's what they would do and that's inevitable they're gonna eventually come up with something like that the human body can only do so much you know the human body they're already figuring out artificial parts they already devised artificial hearts they've called with artificial leaves that make photosynthesis they're gonna have artificial womb artificial electricity you know yeah is artificial trees yeah so we were gonna be able to make electricity yeah we're gonna be able to make electricity the solar power and there's another thing that I got from transcendent man that uh the great kurtzweil documentary that I watched fuckin awesome shit man but he talks about the upcoming advances in solar power solar powers can be the shipments gonna be right driving cars man they're gonna have solar powered cars are the next 20 30 years it's it's all moverá Lee is moving us towards the aliens man I mean they really might be the ideas I don't believe I don't believe they exist or that they don't exist I don't believe that you know people are really seeing flying saucers and I don't believe that everything that people see is a government spacecraft it was very possible that could be something from another dimension or something from another world or something from some some even even hokey ridiculous cliche description from like a 1950 sci-fi movie I'm not discounting the possibility that but I've looked at all these different people that all their stories and all their did it doesn't jive man it doesn't jive to me I have a awesome bullshit detector I'm currently reading this John Mac book John Mac was actually a professor at Harvard who start he had started doing post la past-life hypnotic regression shit with people you know hypnotic regression not not past life but in in their past like abduction stuff because he was dealing with all these different people that had very very similar experiences where they were abducted you know repeatedly over many times in their life but I'm looking at the the work and I'm reading his stuff and I'm like god this is so embarrassing it's like squirrely work it's like this guy is he's gone he's made a conclusion in his mind already and what he's doing in his work is not like he's not exploring all the possibilities he's kind of like pushing towards this conclusion and the latest one that I'm reading is like it's so sloppy because he's telling all these stories about all these people and all the their their depictions of their experiences how about you tell me how crazy that person is in a 1 to 10 10 Lee asked me what do they what do they think about astrology what do they think about tarot cards you know what do they think about crystals or mind-reading what do they think about the Loch Ness monster I want to know a lot of other shit about these people I don't want to know about what their experience was like you know first when I was 8 you know I was alone in a cabinet I knew something was there with me I saw the dark eyes in the corner of the room really were you on lithium we are you crazy are you crazy at all is anyone else in your family crazy because there's a lot of crazy motherfuckers out there and they tell some crazy stories and all you need to know about this whole UFO abduction experience the one most important point is that it all happens at night well when the fuck are you dreaming when the fuck do you have the most realistic bizarre dreams the other night I had some crazy fucking dream I was on a dragon I was reading from these Scrolls that the words would light up on fire as you read them so you could only read it once I mean this is cool last dream but it was a fucking dream alright it was really obvious to me when I woke up like wow what a crazy-ass dream well what what is a dream what a dream is as your mind reaches a certain state in REM sleep where rapid eye movement takes place and all sorts of crazy chemicals psychedelic chemicals start being produced by your body and they all pass the blood-brain barrier and you have all these nutty fucking experiences and you and your cousin Mikey and you're on sleds and you're running from Godzilla what is that is that real sleds should we investigate with their sleds in space the weather Godzilla is real no no you should say when did this happen oh I was sleeping oh you were dreaming right yeah probably when were you abducted by aliens oh I was in bed do you think you were dreaming no it was so real oh okay let's write a book on how real it was and you guys say no no real a lot of them the interviews that they do with them are so telling they're they're really fascinating and not necessarily that the people are stupid and it's not and not even necessarily that they're there they're lying because a lot of them I don't think are lying I think what a lot of them are is first of all people live some boring ass fucking shitty lives they're boring as fuck and if something happens and all sudden that something gives your life meaning like oh my god instead of it being some sleep paralysis thing where your your brain has this endogenous dump of psychedelic chemicals that are natural in the in the brain anyway instead of that being the case like no no no I have been visited and I have information that I have to give to the people of the world well you know if you have a natural psychedelic experience or if you have a real psychedelic experience where you take a drug and you know you're planning it out and either one is gonna give you a very similar experience and that experience is what you're doing is totally wrong everybody's fucked up you need to get your shit together how about an analysis of yourself an analysis of life on the planet and let's look at this other than the way we're looking at it right now because it's obviously isn't working this is the theme to every mushroom trip the theme to every acid trip - theme - every time you eat a pot brownie you want to reconstruct the whole thing and put it back together again in a way that's rational that makes sense you know and this this this this experience these people are having when they're the aliens are telling them while we need to get your shit together yeah yeah yeah yeah you're high dude you're high you're right you're tripping you're seeing things in a closet it's that simple there's no evidence man there's no all these people that are tall I got a Nick on my chin look this is where they pulled out the implant get the fuck out of here crazy do you really think that aliens are gonna leave like little scars on you and they like point you pinched yourself you crazy fuck you pinch yourself and made your own scar you naughty bitch not to mention that there's so much technology now that that people probably do kind of like pranky shit you know like I got these like helicopters that look like you know and stuff like that well there's also government stuff something that guy in Philadelphia the other day thank you whoever you are some guy came to the show and handed me handed the manager a book and the book got to me and it's all patents on aircrafts that the government has like US patents for experimental aircraft so very cool fucking nuts man they're this crazy looking klingon looking ships and UFO looking things it's not it's not a boat you just put it together yeah he put it together seven it was pretty dope that's pretty sweet yeah and so you know I mean you just look at the things that the government has and has admitted to designing and creating like a fucking a giant amount of a man when we were doing fear factor we were out at Edwards Air Force Base near Edwards Air Force Base I think was Edwards it's out like near we were in Palmdale whatever the Air Force Base is out there it's a big one and I think it's Edwards and they were flying stealth bombers and do that is some crazy shit this was the beginning of the Iraq war it's like 2002 and they fly those things overhead dude you sure to god you swear to god you're in Star Wars man you swear to god you like that is that is some shit from the Death Star when you watch something fly overhead they don't make much noise and they look like fucking alien spacecrafts it's dope like you look at them like Dunn is a fucking stealth bomber you can't see that thing with radar man that's that's something designed to sneak up on you and fuck you from the sky and you can't even see it coming I mean it's black like the sky so like you look up you see just blackness and it's black - you're fucked yeah you're fucked it's badass yeah it's who designed for killing who do you want on the podcast in the future what is your dream people to get on I know it isn't Adam Carolla coming yeah Adams coming next week he's gonna be here on the 26th Adam Kroll will be there so that it was out of seven days from today yeah yeah yeah yeah Adams gonna be on you know what man the my dream has already been not just reached but surpassed I when we first started doing this when you and I first started doing this in Episode one we were just fucking around man we just sit in front of computer and we just thought it'd be fun to have like some little kind of silly show that we would do for like people that were on the message board you know that's mostly what it was and people on Twitter you know but now it's become like a radio show now it's become this this way to tell people about shows that we've never had before you know it used to be you would go on a radio show and you know you would hope that some of the people are listening with your fans or hope that you could say something funny enough to convince them you know on the radio and it's in the morning your fucking half awake is random yeah listening Syrena people listening and who knows what you're gonna jive with the DJs like there's a radio station in Houston that apparently is still mad at me for being on there their radio show back in I guess I was like fear factor day is like 2002 or 2003 and they apparently still talk shit about me about what they had me on and I remember they wanted meat and I was probably tired and if I came off rude I didn't mean to but they wanted me to eat some stuff first of all they wanted me to eat some big hamburger they had and I'm like no no thank you like I kind of like I watch what I eat and also in the morning I have hypothyroidism so I take a thyroid medication and when I take it I can't eat anything for like an hour and so I was on this radio show they trying to get me to eat this stupid things they made an easy-bake of it I was there exfil meant that's did you yes some people mad at me are you so mad they still talk shit about me like I'm the worst person they've ever had on their show and I didn't even know that I didn't even know they had an issue until I left and apparently they were talking about me when I wasn't there when I was there they were nice as pie to me but then when I left they started talking like what I was so rude they had a gag and I wasn't into their gag and I didn't remember with it it was stupid shit it was stupid and you know what they're not comedians man and they're maybe they're not on my my vibe not on my frequency they're on their own frequency and they thought it'd be fun they thought it'd be cool if I played along but I didn't want to eat their thing and they didn't adjust they didn't adjust so then I'm like why the fuck am i doing this and then it's like look when you do radio stations there's a lot of different kind of radio DJs some of them are really cool and easy to do and easy to do their shows and other ones they want more attention than you and they're a little squirrely and they don't like the fact that you're on TV and they're in the radio and they get to be kunti you know they get to be weird and they're looking for something to be wrong with you so you're if you're coming from some fucking television showing you want to eat their stupid Easy Bake Oven thing you become an asshole instead of if that was me and I had a guest on my come on easy easy big oven and you won't do it oh I'd be like what kind of an idiot am i yeah I'm getting this gotta eat something this is all I plan for this fucking thing I could be asking him a million interesting questions like we could be talking about all kinds of crazy stuff but instead I'm pissed that he won't eat my fucking tuna casserole out of a fucking Easy Bake Oven so these people apparently are still upset at me well used to used to have to deal with those kind of people in the past now I don't that doesn't mean anything anymore every show that I do now I do nothing for no press I mean III did Preston and Steve I called up for Philly but it was after the show's already sold out but I did because I like them because they're cool guys but like when we do these shows now we have our own radio station we have our own our own ability to promote the show and probably more listeners than ever then compared to that radio station it hates you yeah well that in it's all 100% your fans those are I hate that word all Harper said people who appreciate your work right so they already are enjoying what you do they are enjoy your podcast they're already there for you they like you you know and so they want to come to the shows and as opposed to you know doing a radio show and trying to get people out there to listen and like you and that's why people like those people these mediocre folks in Houston that's why they you know they have like this that's why they have power there they're only power was that they're the ones who get to talk on this radio show I mean why would it they don't even they have no talent there's nothing going on there they're just talking people they're just dum-dums that are in then they play music they sort of hijack your attention span for a few minutes while you wait for the next cool song to start playing and they're just sitting there reading your Wikipedia page so Joe Rogan I heard they wouldn't even be a problem for me it just don't you know I just I don't know why they're still upset at me because apparently this is some recent interview I don't know who they are even know where it's station is I don't care Houston it's there look if it's all these years and you're still upset that I wouldn't eat your thing that's on you that's on you 107 I didn't do anything to you I didn't break your window I didn't like your bathroom on fire you know if I just didn't eat your thing that's on you it's the whole world is filled with different kinds of people Matt and if you try to make everybody happy you will fucking go crazy I know when I've been a douchebag in my past I know when I've done things where I could have made this go smoother I could have just this isn't one of those things this is just stupidity and I didn't want to deal with stupidity you're gonna go back - yeah I'm gonna Houston I think August August can't wait to be funny yeah I'm doing that September again in Austin - oh really yeah that's always a good time yeah and plus now it looks like I'm recording the special in June so if that happens then I'll have have to have all new shit by the time September rolls around so I got a lot of work to do all right that's exciting man I've been writing a little hot lately man cuz I'm trying to finish this book I've been writing like crazy man writing is so fucking satisfying it might be one of my favorite things to do I love the idea that you just sit in front of that computer and these ideas just start dancing in your head they start dancing the only start ranging themselves on paper and then sometimes like when an idea will come out and then another idea will follow it and you step back I step back and look and I'm like wow this crazy thing that just like happened through me you know this crazy idea that you know just happened through me and then it all like puts itself onto paper and then the next thing you know there's a hundred pages actually no there's 200 pages it's like well it's it's it's such a fascinating process man the creative process of actually sitting down and writing it's amazing man I tried last night I was gonna write just for a little like an hour and then get in the tank but once sometimes every now and then you tap into a vein and you got to stay there you can't go anywhere you know and I get I just had one idea that I needed to write down before I went into the tank and as I was writing that idea down something about writing like say if you're thinking about a word like if you're writing the word experience it takes longer to write that word than it is to think of the concept of experience so it allows you to deeply consider everything you're saying and then oftentimes like when you're writing I can seem so much smarter writing than I ever could just talking you think yeah I mean you talk very like smart yeah but I'm wasted but I'm Way smarter writing that I am talking it's it's because you can consider everything much more you know you get a chance to look at it you know you you really get to know someone like and that's another beautiful thing about this podcast you get to know someone when you're talking to them for a long time you get to know like how their brain works you know like you could write things out like that's what that I always used to drive me crazy about presidential speeches and shit like that that they have people writing them for them that is so fucked up this time right because they have to give like a speech like every fucking day almost can't you just speak from the heart yeah but but there's probably things they have to just touch on they're probably not like writers like this is what you have to say it's more of like taking your ideas and making it a speech for him because I mean they literally have to do like probably two or three speeches a day if you live in Obama's like yeah they're always going to colleges or talking here with representatives you know they're always doing speeches if you look at his schedule there's that one time where they followed him around for a week I forget what program did it and it was just like his schedule is pretty much from when he wake up just going from one place to another giving a speech give me a speech in speech anyway write your own speeches pitch I think he does actually and one of his most famous speeches one that he wrote one of them the ones when he was running for office he's he's a smart guy and he's a very good speech writer but the whole idea of having a speech written out for you by a bunch of other people is kind of offensive to me it's like what the fuck are you doing being the leader if you've got all these people telling you exactly what to say and you know you're following all these charts and graphs and this is what the people want and so let's give them this and this is sort of in the middle and we'll lower their expectations expectations with that and then they'll hit them we'll hit them with this to make them happy it's just it's like so obvious that we're being played you know that's what drives me nuts about speech writing about the idea of it so this is like they're not even trying to pretend that you know they're not playing you they don't even try to pretend this guy wrote this shit himself you know he's just up there reading off a fucking teleprompter and you're just going yeah and nothing changes yeah I couldn't never do that I could never do speeches or anything like that you could if you wanted to give speeches on podcasting or speeches on something that you know a lot about like if you want to give speeches on how to be a good video editor you could do that you could easily do like a seminar on video editing you know if you ever wanted it like if people like we're into your internet videos and you could come up with a bunch of bulleted points of things that you need to consider like hey Bri VD you know this you wanted to make it under 10 minutes you want this you want that you know this is my best video and this is why and the good thing about this video is it starts off in one point and then it goes back in time then it brings you forward again you know and then you can you could you know you could easily do something like that anything that you're into man you could teach other people how to do it did you hear that flip video is no more what Cisco bots flip video and they axed him they killed it yeah I always thought for some reason of flip video was very successful and a big money maker it seems like everybody's got flip video see a lot of them my own Norma had it when Norton was at UH Austin he taped all sets with that show yeah they killed it for some reason is it what is it so good is it a big deal well I mean it's it's it's just kind of weird that they did that you know he would have never found out about that 20 years ago yeah it would just would have desired unless you were reading the technology page of the New York Times you know how the fuck would you have ever known you know now you get like an email alert from CNN to tell you that flip video has been eaten up by Cisco yeah you know yeah you know who Scott Adams is the guy who created Dilbert uh-huh he got busted going online defending himself under a fake name I sir yeah sound like the weak shit ever how'd it get by stead I don't know he got busted and then he he like wrote something about it admitting it and it's he this is what he wrote according to wise and fair denizens of the Internet this after he's been busted according to the wise and fair denizens of the Internet this behavior is proof that I am a thin-skinned troll asshole dick Fame whore egomaniac douche nozzle misogynist that list might sound bad to you but keep in mind that I was starting from a pretty low base so I think my reputation is trending up that's pretty funny Wow yeah it's in the OSI weekly if you guys want to read it it's kind of interesting because they're you know they're like wow this so he what he did was he logged online and he he did under the name planned chaos and he pretended to be the only person in the world who doesn't hate him because I guess he's been getting in trouble lately I don't remember what what it was I don't remember what exactly he said he said some things that people thought were questionable and so people were shitting all over him I met him he was on an episode of news radio really yeah that goes to show you how old Dilbert is don't worry it's been around forever man and it's terrible those those cartoons are like the lowest expectation ever for humor and for entertainment value yeah it's amazing that they can make so much money like I used to read doonesbury and I remember doonesbury is the smart one man it was really smart the only time to me was even remotely interesting was when they had Rowell Raoul Duke it was the hunter s Thompson character who would come in with guns and start shooting shit up and you know it was like hunter s Thompson's they kind of like he has his character Raoul Duke from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas you know he liked the not the novel is sort of based on very loosely on him and this his friend Oscar and the crazy shit they would did when they were on drugs in Vegas right and this this guy from doonesbury just sort of co-opted that character sort of stole it stole his intellectual property and started using it as characters inside of his Doonesbury comic I thought that was kind of cool like oh that was kind of funny that he did that it was kind of those were fun but other than that like most of it was like really like nothing it's like the jokes were like fool like every like Marmaduke or something like that Beetle Bailey I wasn't shit still even a possible you know Bailey still around yeah I think so I think who would cry if the cartoon section I remember when I was a kid though I used to like the cartoon so I used to like farside that was fucking brilliant and then they just got you know kind of went away when I was I was at Garfield guy growing up obviously so Garfield and far-sighted with my - Calvin Hobbs pretty so you do like I do I mean but but then you get those ones like whatever that fucking Cathy oh oh yeah fucking there's some that don't make any sense and you have to wonder how those people keep their jobs is it like some sort of a government job where you can't get fired yeah or that Prince Valiant or whatever that one that was like remember what was that one where it's like all medieval knights and yeah I always tried to get into that one but I could never fucking do it after the worst man yeah they're the worst there is there anything worse than fucking stupid cartoons there's no there's no lower standard you know like if you ever like read a cartoon and laughed now like holy shit that's our sorry first I definitely really yeah first I just you never read any of the first I never got into it man it's I think like stand-up comics some cartoons are so bad they like turn you off to other cartoons Wow like I've talked to people that have been to like shitty comedy shows like no really in a live comedy right like well you're not in a lot of comedy okay what are you talking about have you ever gonna see Louie CK okay go see Louie CK and then tell me if you're in the wild comedy cuz you might not be into some douchebags at the chuckle hut you know great that are telling nonsense jokes but go to see Chris Rock go to see you know Dave Chappelle go see a real comic you're gonna love comedy man don't get crazy you go see Joey Diaz and if you don't laugh you don't have a fuckin pulse alright there's something wrong with you you know you're not enjoying that Joey destroyed all weekend in in Philadelphia he's so fun to have around man no one makes me laugh one that guy he's so fucking fun to have around but as we were saying before he gets wired he is angry at you yeah I'm just reading these facts that were on digg.com today of facts about masturbation and that's going through that that male kangaroos have been known to give himself blowjobs and female quirky plants have been witnessed using wooden sticks as dildos what you imagine what dick dinosaurs have dicks right right can you imagine how big that dick is and then like of a dinosaur fucking combed like how much cum that would be if it does or comes out are you 12 bro I was just thinking that theater dinosaur come dinosaur dicks how big would the load be if a dinosaur combed yeah and here's another fact what 30 percent of suicides by males age of 12 through 20 are attributed to auto-erotic asphyxiation - oh here's a photo erotic asphyxiation yeah 12 to 20 that's silly that's insane you know here's a fucking interesting statistic that's real 70% of all pornography gets watched during nine to five hours really yeah 12 percent of a porno film is watched at a hotel room on average that makes sense but 70% being during the internet or downloaded from the internet while you're at work 9:00 to 5:00 how many people are watching this podcast or listening to this podcast at work a lot how many people are masturbating while listening to two yes two people right now and only one's hard one of them is crying it's struggling trying to make shit happen there's too much porn I think at this point it's almost like it's too easy to beat off you know it's all it's all out there it's it's it's almost like unavoidable like it used to be hard as hell to get some pornography when I was a kid like we were talking about earlier about magazines man that was way you got magazines man and you had to go to a liquor store and ask for the back shelf and you know nowadays man this it's it's so fucking easy to get nog Rafi nowadays you could just specialize on one particular type of pornography you could be like a weirdo foot guy you only want foot jobs girls jacking guys offer their feet and you could fucking stack monitors to the top of your room like like a movie screen 50 feet high and every one of them has got a different video of a girl you're gonna got off with her feet and you would die of old age before you watch all of them there's a there's this shit that I was reading about where guys who go to graveyards after they bury somebody like recently like like they go they like the next day after they bury somebody and they dig him up and fuck him Oh God like they check the obituaries and find like a young team you know oh where was this happening it was on the internet I read it person people doing it in there was an old Kinnison bit people doing it in morticians office in the mortuary then you know remember that bit I could see that happening dude that bit is what got me into Kinnison really I've told this story before but in an interest of brevity a girl that I was working with did the bit for me because she was telling me how funny he was and she was lying on her stomach in the parking lot oh never ends and I remember thinking like wow what is this guy like this guy must be the funniest guy ever and then I got a hold of his HBO special I got a chance to see it that's what that was probably the one moment when I was 19 years old with that girl on her stomach in the parking lot telling me that Joe that was one of the the one moments one of the few moments in my life where a spark went off in my head like wow maybe I should do that maybe I should be a fucking comedian you know when I was 19 I had no idea what the hell was gonna happen in my future I don't know what I what I was gonna do but I was already starting to think like maybe you know maybe I have to find something you know maybe it's not martial arts I have to find like something else to do it maybe it was this this fucking guys on a stomach you know pretend to get fucked in the ass like there was nothing like that back then man but I think his joke was based on a true story that was in LA some people got arrested for paying the morticians to spend a few hours undisturbed with the freshest male corpses oh god oh god yeah I think if I was a mortician and I think if we get a hot chick that there'd be sometimes you're sitting in this basement by yourself he's like I'm definitely not touched this videos online this photos online has guys fucking dead bodies there's a big fuck it there's a votive photo online of a guy with this I don't know if it's still up this is years ago this is in the late 90s early 2000s and it was a whole sequence of photos from start to finish of this woman being on the slab she's clearly dead you know and then you know him put putting his penis inside of her yeah it's like whoa dude you know he didn't just take these photos of someone's daughter and someone's sister someone's wife he fucked her and took pictures of it and and then put it online you know it's some fucking crazy shit I wonder how many people who get into like what what the number is how many people get into being a mortician or being how many of them for the sex yeah fucking around bodies I'm sure it's very high man I'm never surprised that the things I hear and I think if you were into fucking dead bodies that would be the number one thing to do I bet hope good is the meat and the dead body is it cook is it I'm sure I'm sure it's Jesus here I mean I don't I'm saying I mean it mode persons but his rigor mortis set in do they can they fix that today is there a way that they can have rigged mores not sitting like what happens when they embalm them don't they pump out all the what is rigor mortis what is it come that's where the but yeah do you know what it comes I think that's when you died the body just defends up but I don't think it's I think it's a squirrel off the road yeah I think it's immediate I don't get to mean I think it's a case it takes a few hours out yeah so maybe if you get the person right after they died they'd be still pliable yeah but don't you like when you die you also you just automatically piss and shit yourself and all that crap just clean them up man if you're gonna fuck a dead body you can't have high standards sighs kind of have to warm them up maybe get some lamps or so heated blanket and let them sit in there for a while yeah I'm in a warm tub not warm enough to cook them you know the cool thing is that you could just pretty much fucking rip skin if you would like one of the fuck that ass really hard you know yeah we never have to worry about her getting hurt yeah that's true I guess he could think about it she's a gagger going right through the back of her throat something about disrespecting dead bodies it's particularly offensive yeah particularly unsavory you know the idea of disrespecting someone's body their vessel while they're gone you know it's so like it's so inhuman you know there's something about it it's like it's very creepy right yeah one of the creepiest things that I'm eating it even someone's body after they're dead yeah I was listening to Casey Kasem they were he story out I don't know if he's still around they had him on the radio though he might be dead but they had he was there playing ones from the 1970s I was on in Philly and Philly has this one badass radio station I tweeted it I don't remember the name of it it's like wo GL w gol and it was all like one badass song it would be like Pink Floyd and then it would be Michael Jackson and then it would be like you know Sam Cooke I mean it was like some serious fucking jams one after the other knows that this pool hall that we were playing at and they were they played like repeats of like the countdown show and I forgot like Casey Kasem with the camp now and he would you just pull that out I don't never first time I've ever done that - that was hostile here we go this this request comes over here Casey Kasem with the countdown I can't even I have to if I heard him I can do it you know he was Shaggy's really yeah oh yeah I didn't know that yeah weeks but he was the one of the songs apparently was about cannibalism and I don't know this song but it was about some people that it was like the Donner Party it was about like you know some people that you know the Donner Party story they were headed to the west coast and they got stuck in the mountains of Colorado and they ran out of food and they'd some people died they ate the dead bodies to stay alive straight Parker made a film about it did he really yeah a cannibal - musical was it cannibal the musical was his verse movie he made in college with Matt stone it's fucking brilliant that's really funny is there from Colorado - yeah I fucking love it it's isn't it's a brilliant movie cannibal the musical yeah okay I love you Emma's on that shit but Casey Kasem was going off Casey Kasem about this sometimes you have to make decisions and it was like the decision was like we like stop playing like what the fuck is it like you have to make a decision between eating the body or dying yourself and you're like what the fuck Wow what what a weird you know top 40 or whatever the fuck it was or you know maybe I mean I think it was a request you know I only like tuned into it halfway while he was saying it but you know it was one of the weird things this nest song deals with cannibalism it was like what well in history of people had to eat people to stay alive there's only like a few recorded instances right there's a soccer team that crashed in a plane crash and they made that movie about them remember there yeah was a lot Boone yeah there's spooning that guy's ass out there's frozen ass meat with a spoon that has a freaky ass movie man when that that airplane broke apart yeah yeah tubes made out of metal aren't really meant to fly through the fucking sky yeah you know what's thinking the other day is what happened to all those lost people you notice how like all those actors from lost where such a high in their career and now do you see any of them they burnt off you didn't want everything to do them Jack was pissing me off man you know after a while Manny he'd really annoyed the shit out of me man he drove me nuts he was so phoning it in at the end when they were all standing around that tub and someone comes back to life Mike this motherfucker is just phoning it in man that is real yeah he chose me drove me nuts because he wasn't appreciating his fucking his part he was he started off that such series as a winner Jack was the fucking hero he was the man you know he was the doctor he was handsome all the girls loved him and by the end he was a junkie and a loser and you know what they did was I guarantee you that guy's annoying I guarantee that actor is annoying and they're like to fuck this guy like well let's just start making him a douchebag and start slowly like making it more and more annoying yeah fuck yeah they must have done that because our if he was so cool everybody else sort of like kept their their thing or became more cool as the show went on you know like the really hot girl with no ass what's her name really pretty one with the dark hair Kate yeah she sort of became cooler as time went on we got her shit together you know raised that girl's baby you know she had like a lot of good positive attributes John Locke became like mysterious and sort of magical and sort of figured out the world Jack just became a junkie just became a fucking loser man yeah he just slowly there's the reason for that if you saw the last episode that last episode can suck my dick I ain't aint fuckin with that man I I think this you worry that much and there's some freedom in walking away for it man you watch so much of it am I supposed to see what happens there's some freedom just saying no you don't have me anymore you fucks you can't you can't own me bitch I'm not your whore alright I'm not tuning in every week to watch your stupid commercials just so you can trick me with your silly storyline I don't even watch TV anymore it seems like but once you start fucking throwing in like time travel and shit like they did now we're in 1970 alright you don't even know what happened your fucks you can do anything you want your fucks there's a reason why yeah you want to know I can tell you soon as they can see liked it now nope I don't want to know don't want any love that you want me to know and that I don't want to know I love that there's freedom in that man all right he was a girl the whole time he was a girl oh good good you seem like a girl he was Kate seemed like he was on his period for ten years fucking twat anything else before we get going there was some questions on the the Rogen board that I'm perusing through and some of them we've actually already answered and some of them here's like one what are your thoughts on listeners supporting the podcast the podcast financially it's not necessary the podcast as I said is a great method for me to promote shows and promote all the other stuff that we do and we get sponsorships the more you guys listen the more we get sponsors I mean we just have this flesh light right now but that's mostly because we're gonna be moving a serious very soon both obviously it will we'll be live and free on the internet it'd still be on iTunes for free it'd still be available for download on the website for free but it'll also be on Sirius satellite satellite radio just so more people can listen to it and just you know I like Sirius I have it in my car it's it's an awesome service and I think it's just another avenue for us to to get heard and you know we're not even getting paid for it the same thing as like stitcher and all that I'm for all of those things and the more these things that we do the more it you know it's like I've never had this many people come to my shows I've never had I mean this is it's obviously this is a good thing you know it's obvious that there's a benefit for me in that and the promotional aspect of it and it's a benefit in people that they get this free entertainment man and it's a benefit for us too you know over the course of the year or so that we've been doing this one of the coolest things that it really made me appreciate I was bummed out when I had to come back here from Colorado you know I have this idea of raising my kids in a place where it's a little more calm there's less people there's less of the pressures of Hollywood there's sort of the bullshit materialism of this area this part of the country it's a silly part of the country there's a lot of cool people here but it's also a very silly part of the country so I was bummed out man when the dog got eaten by the mountain lion and when mrs. Rogan got pregnant we had to come back I mean it was to me it was like fuck I was gone I made it out of this place I was I was I had escaped and now I'm back again but what really like made me appreciate this place was this podcast and was having all these cool people come over all the time having re over having Eddie over having Joey over Evan Bert Kreischer and Russell Peters and Tom Green I'm like you know I sit back and I go god this is so much fucking fun you know somehow or another we have like a real legit national radio show and not even national man worldwide because we had a fuckload of podcast fans in Australia mm-hmm that's on the other side of the fucking planet and when when I asked them about the podcast they went nuts so it's it's it's a worldwide sort of a thing man and you know and who the fuck knew when we did this that it would be what it is now who knew that every week would be in the you know the top five of iTunes who the fuck we had never had no idea completely by chance and slowly along the line it's morphed and slowly along the line it's evolved and slowly along the line it's become you know like something it's it's it is itself now you don't I mean like now we don't think about how to do it like we came over here like Brian came over here today and we didn't even have to talk about when we talked about just normal shit like we always do but we it's our 100th episode man is a big deal but we're like but we should do it we were like well we should do it together yeah it's just sue you and me for the hundredth and then that was not all the thing we had to talk about it's like it is its own thing you know it is it's got its own life to it now and all the people that send me emails man and all the Twitter messages and all the the people that I meet in the comedy clubs I appreciate the fuck out of that I think it is one of my biggest accomplishments in in you know my career is this podcast and that message board and both of those things and that the whole the whole internet group are bringing all these cool people together and the the positive energy that I get from all these people that shows and the positive reactions I get so many people coming up to me and telling me that this podcast helps them think differently it changes the way they look at life it changes the way they view their friends change the way that you view how they interact with other people you know I couldn't be happier man I couldn't be happier that we did this and this wouldn't have happened if I didn't give in and come back from Colorado if I decide to stay in Colorado we would have never have done this well what about the idea of getting like a female sidekick female sounds like a whole whole Robin it's not really done with that oh did you hear that he slept his coffee again that fuck I love you yeah if you hear slurping man that's me blame me um yeah you know Adam Kroll had a really funny girl on his show he had Teresa Strasser for a while and she's really funny and now he's got this new chick and a lot of people in the Rogan Board didn't like her but I thought she was funny well the crazy thing about that is they odd he auditioned a few girls like Esther little Esther went there oh that's how this girl got it yeah and but what's crazy is like if you go to his website and look at all the comments per episode every single one of the girls that he did like all hate like his his audience hates so bad that girl on any girl that's on his show I feel so bad or Brody Stevens those so the girls and Brody who's the new girl you know I think her name's like it's a Jessie or something like I'm looking for I'm gonna look at right now because I feel rude that we're talking about our own yeah and her name yeah it's gonna be could I have Adam Carolla on yeah he's gonna be on this this next week next Tuesday yeah yeah in your formula that you've been working with on on it calm oh and an IT it's yeah it was done this way yeah I was reading them did you read the case study that yeah that's pretty interesting yeah a lot of people look I've been taking 5htp and I've had some some pretty powerful results I feel like it makes sentences form easier I feel like there's more circulation in my brain or something I mean I don't know what it is but 5-htp has given me a very tangible benefit there's some other stuff that I took that gave me is some good benefits as well but what we did would Chris did with this nootropic formula it's go like alpha brainwave neutral book for me I was gonna call it what we did was take all of the best nootropics which are nutrients for the brain and condensed them into I think it's like two pills and it's all these people the case studies had some really positive experiences with it yeah I'm excited it's all legit stuff it's all stuff that people have reported actually helps brain function we're gonna combine it into one thing and I think nutrition and you know mental nutrition and physical nutrition all of it is one of the most underlooked keys to happiness for people you know I mean we have a friend that got on antidepressants and this motherfucker eats Cheetos every night it never works out and I was like yo dude you know if you took care of that body I guarantee you you would feel a little bit better I mean you you yeah I mean I'm not saying you don't have an issue that maybe needs to be corrected chemically cuz I'm not I'm not inside your head but I know for a fact my own brain if I didn't work out I would not be nearly as happy yeah I would have all this extra pent-up shit and you got to get that out man and you got to treat this fucking vehicle good give this vehicle vitamins man I drink fresh squeezed juices every morning every morning when I'm at home I squeeze I get ginger and raw garlic and carrots and celery and I blend it all together and you feel so fucking good it's great getting all those raw nutrients in your body and your body you know two people that I know I have a lot of friends who are very very smart but they almost think that there's something vain and and trivial and foolish about taking care of your body you know they smoke cigarettes or they you know they eat shitty food and you know and they never exercise they never take care of themselves like man you're missing out on a a big chunk of life it's annoying it's annoying to have to go to the gym that's why it's good to learn a martial art or it's good to like to pick up a sport or racquetball or something where you're forced to move around you know where it's fun it's part of the whole game but find some way find some way to take care of your fucking body find some fucking way man take some fucking vitamins even if it's just multivitamins and fish oil even if it's just that that will make a fucking difference and so many people don't man so many people just ride it out and they just hope it all is gonna fucking stay together I switched my 5htp to Chris's brand which is called Ron or rollover our cameraman which one it is it's the blue bottle yeah and it's it's great - it's at 175 milligrams I think it wasn't you feel a difference after taking photos I've been I've been taking it for over a month and that in the resveratrol I think are two of the best things I have take I take I mean I take fish oil in a multi multivitamin every day but I think those two are the things that I've noticed the biggest from how much do you think cigarettes fuck with you Oh a lot definitely yeah does it bother you though that you're doing that you're poisoning yourself with cigarettes because I've seen you before dude there's there's times that I've seen you when you like smoking a lot well you take on like you have a grey quality to your face it's almost like it's a serious matter and you when you quit you you know what is that great you know what that is is I have a great beard no I don't if I shave it's great for the first three days no man I mean I mean like your eyes like around your eyes like you there's something about smoking something about a lot of that cigarette smoke in your system we're like your whole system looks like yeah you know it looks like your whole system is being poisoned slowly well it is why are you fucking crazy bitch I will you won't know what makes you say you're gonna quit wait for the first stroke the best part is that what's gonna do it I'm gonna go be all my grandfather go completely the your grandfather had a stroke yeah from smoking really yeah oh look at you living smart yeah it was like 65 oh so you feel like you got a few years yeah okay well what isn't there like a point of no return like where you've done so much damage that you can never heal yourself up no I mean well to a point if you get cancer obviously but I mean there's a chart I think like after a year you're pretty much back to normal you really your lung capacity and all that stuff there's actually a thing where like if you quit the first week the first day what keeps you from quit quitting I mean you've taken those nicotine patches can't you just jam those yeah I mean it's just doing it I mean seriously smoking see I wish you could tell the the addiction I wish I could too because meirin's complaining about it all the time he's always on his Twitter talking he's they're putting nicotine patches on she it's always gonna be there like that voice in the back of your head even if you quit is still there Joey's in denial yeah Joey likes to pretend he's not smoking yeah you know me dog I don't need that shit meanwhile every time before a show he's bum cigarettes off you right yeah I always have to buy two packs every time I'm hanging out with him helium gave me some cigars helium was the shit I fucking love it there yeah two helium's we did this month in Portland and filling both of them were fucking awesome for those folks that are interested in the Massey Hall in Toronto show the only tickets that are left are like single tickets but you know man if you want to go separate seats yeah sitting separate seats or you know get people to move or something who the fuck knows man just go and have fun it's gonna be chaos and I'm doing it with Sam Tripoli but other than that it's sold out and for the June 11th I think it's what is the date by the way sim Tripoli got a fauxhawk going on now really yes silly bastard Sam Tripoli is awesome and he'll he'll be opening for me and I said June he's so excited about it - he's like I'll never play a bigger show that in this ever he's gone crazy and by the way San Francisco is May 12 through the May 14th and that's at cops comedy club yeah June 10th is the Vancouver date and April 29th is the Toronto date and April 29th a guy said there's only a few tickets left and then the other thing is Cobb's in San Francisco yeah it's already selling very fast at 12th through the 14th because that absolute death squad who's gone there yeah probably whoever's around you know if Joey and I can do it though you know how we do it it's like always getting a bunch of headlined gigs now which is very nice yeah Ahri's headliner all over the place he's doing doing comedy competitions he's doing you know comedy festivals he just got back from Atlanta and he goes it goes a ruler's something I was like well I just feel so weird and then someone said because you're the most famous comic here he's like oh I'm not comfortable with that and I go you're not comfortable with that because that's responsibility you feel like responsible for like the young pucks you know like is that what it feels like you say yeah that is what it is like I go you shy away from every responsibility possible you know even being like the most famous comedian let go up don't look to me I don't know nothing I'm get out of here and he just runs away it should be so much bigger I mean I was talking to Mary Kerry when we had around the podcast and he was like she was talking about how she saw you and Ari she's just like it's I what's that guy's name Ari Shaffir he was so fucking hilarious Wow you knew his name offhand well we talked to her freely five hours on the plane too but yeah that she did remember his name yeah I mean look it's it's - it's tough these days for a comic to get notoriety just for their stand-up you know you have to you have to get on something where people see you there's just so much entertainment value you know you have to have a Comedy Central special you have to have something and an Ari is that a bit of a disadvantage just like Joey is and that they're both worthless ruthlessly dirty you know which is really hilarious but it's hard to clean that shit up for you know seven minutes spot it live at Gotham or something like that you know it was always hard for me to when I when I first started out to clean it up for like a ten minutes at or seven minutes at seven minutes sets are hard in the first place because it's like just getting a joke out it's like fuck you know you when you want to do a set you want to open up get there their respect get some laughs and then slowly settle into your view of things you can't do that in ten minutes man in ten minutes you got a slam home with some shit and then just get the fuck out of there and you know that that's something that already hasn't done yet he hasn't really really knocked one out of the park and then got a half an hour Comedy Central special then got an hour's coming central special and he doesn't do enough updating on his website either he's I mean you know I was look I've had a web site since 1998 and there's thousands of blog entries you know I mean I and I'm a busy guy you got to write things you got to give people things like Twitter look I write a lot of shit on Twitter's like hey the podcasts about to start or hey you know I'm about to do this gig or hey you know come see me here but a lot of the rest of it is just me writing things that I think are funny and interesting or some link that Sony sent me that's interesting I'm retweeting it and I wanted entertaining you know I want to make sure it's entertaining and because it's a part of that whole system of promoting yourself of getting yourself out there or B of being able to work and Ari hasn't really embraced that you know he embraced the Twitter bit a little bit he writes funny tweets every now and then but he needs to be like real proactive of like his website it's nothing he's got a wife and kids and a job and an excuse to not be doing all this stuff you know but at least he's doing his podcast on your desk squad Network and it's the skeptic tank if you're looking for that's what already calls it it's really good and I've been on it mayhem Miller has been on it he had with Steve on his I know yeah mayhem if they're under death squads he's gone itunes to subscribe to desk what has made our ease it has the same Tripoli's podcast Tom Segura who was on yesterday they're all grouped into one pocket yeah and think about that man you'd have never thought you'd be doing something like that yeah I mean you know what's weird is it the whole thing is that when I was in middle school you had a or something like a high school freshman in high school you had a shadow of the day job where you picked what you wanted to be when you grew up and you shadowed them for a day right so I shadowed a radio station because I wanted to be a radio DJ and I shattered the the morning zoo WNC I 97.9 is the day Buster Douglas won and they had Buster Douglas on the on the radio station I think I've talked about this before but yeah a long time yeah yeah it was crazy cuz we actually Buster Douglas knocked out Tyson yeah and we were actually in Columbus Ohio like when we did your DVD special and we are on that radio show and the guy was still working as a DJ and I was like you know what you were the guy that when I was a kid that I hung out with this guy all day took me to breakfast took me to lunch and now now look at this it's like I'm an adult and you're still here ya know it's uh it's interesting what podcasting has become you know Ariel Helwani and I I did his podcast yesterday I did it through Skype yeah which is pretty badass I did the video portion of it through Skype and I just used the microphone and listen through the headsets and I'm like this is crazy and we're doing in real time and it sounds awesome yeah you know it sounded really clear it sounded great yeah you know you can it's a different world man we live in a different world and we got lucky we snuck in right on the ground floor you know totally never expected that I remember all these other people were doing podcasts at the time because I did Adam Carolla's podcasts way before I even moved to Colorado you know I had done it you know and it still hadn't done my own what's podcast in general it's weird how they used to be popular like four years ago like when they first came out and iPods just first came out and they were or whatever it was huge for oh no look he was a huge ones back then I remember like Kevin Rose and all those guys from tech TV has Kevin really the guy started Digg yeah same guy same cameras yeah crazy bastard yeah well him he's got some idea well now he's not with dig anymore and everyone's pissed because they he pretty much it takes supposedly gone to shit since he left everyone's mad at him I guys so that's that's what I've heard Oh Kevin have you been following I like dig still I use dig all the time I like dig dig calm if you've never been is an excellent portal for interesting stories yeah there's always like I will scroll through the first four or five pages and every time I do it you know there's always something interesting the pops up that's where I got that Dilbert story and you know there's always Charlie Sheen asking for custody of his twins oh that's the fucking perfect thing to happen right now it's exact the end of the podcast this goddamn phone to ring cuz I'd never turn it off Malibu now Malibu please Malibu California all right sorry ladies and gentlemen for that that's a sort of an inside joke on this podcast that I'm a retard I never turned my fucking phone off the real problem is I'm always usually on the phone right up into the time we start and then doesn't there's a bunch of them and they're cordless you know so they're all floating around I never know where the fuck they are and I usually just pull the plug out of the wall I did it yesterday but actually plugged it back in and right before the show showed today because I had to make a call you don't give a fuck and I wouldn't either the point is we've done this for a hundred episodes now do some knuckles we had a good time red band and I have we've more than surpassed our expectations I never had any going into it I don't think you did either no never thought it would be like this I thought this was actually going to last a month I thought like you'd get sick of it a month and that's the craziest thing about that you still yeah you know you still do it you know yeah I thought for sure I'm pretty good at doing things once I get once I get started I'm pretty good at sticking to him you know but it's the one I realized it was crazy when I realized think weird things was happening was when I asked the crowd in Boston I did the Wilbur theater back sold out and I go how many an Eddie Bravo was there and I yelled out to etics I had my tenth planet jujitsu shirt on and I was like Ted planted in the house then I and I yelled out how many guys listen to podcast and they went fucking crazy it was like 90% of the crowd I was like whoa really really and then I realized that I'm like somewhere along the route maybe that's why these crowds have been cooler lately like over the last like six months the crowds of God noticeably cooler and they were always cool they were always cool there was always a huge percentage of cool people but there was always people that didn't know what I was up to and they were just you know a factor UFC or Jamie Kennedy wasn't in town so they went to see me I mean it's like they don't know what they're doing just wandering in there but now it's it's completely changed like in Philly the whole crowd it's all podcast fans because they find out about the show long before everybody else that show was sold out a month before we were ever there you know I mean that's that's never happened to me before if the best case scenario was like the last time I was in Philly which was like we sold it all out just before I got there but this was sold out like way before that you know so it's it's I did an extra show you did more yeah we shut the fuck up god damn it who is this again same thing I don't give a fuck about them that's how I roll all right ladies and gentlemen at that note I'm pologize to the phone this won't happen after episode 100 I'm gonna have that shit straightened out I'm gonna fix it we will be back next week as we said Adam Carolla is on on Tuesday and I think we're probably gonna do one either Wednesday or Thursday I don't know who Duncan Trussell is coming on next week - yeah and Joey wants to come on next week - I should have Duncan in Joey we haven't had this combo together for a while good combo that's a good combo ladies and gentleman it's been an awesome 100 episodes we have enjoyed the fuck out of it we thank you very much everybody that enjoyed it we're we're so happy that you did and I appreciate all the Twitter's I
