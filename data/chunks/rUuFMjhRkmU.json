nobody knows ah right we're live jon ronson how are you fellow hey how are you doing this man pretty I'm glad I can tell you the number of people who said you should do to record the number people have said oh my god Joe Rogan so good about Bohemian Grove oh let's talk about psychopaths you have to come on well I'm friends with Alex Jones and Alex Jones told me many many many years ago that they're burning effigies and Bohemian Grove they're worshipping mole like the owl God well I want to even grow up with Alex Jones oh that's like going to Disneyland with Mickey Mouse yeah it was kind of my it was kind of my idea I I sometimes feel like the kind of side I mean isn't strictly speaking true but I kind of sometimes feel a little bit like Alex Jones is Simon Cowell because before this is like way back in the mid mid to late 90s when he was like really famous in in Austin but kind of not that well-known outside right and I was working with this producer John Sergeant basically what we we noticed something which was there a lot of people on the fringes Islamic fundamentalist neo-nazis and militia people we'll all had this one thing in common which as they were all conspiracy theorists they all believed in you know the evil power of Bilderberg and Bohemian Grove so I thought it'd be good to try and infiltrate those places but I didn't want to infiltrate Bohemian Grove alone because frankly I was scared so with Mayor Alex Jones when he was rebuilding David Koresh's Church Waco and he said had a gung-ho he was rebuilding David Koresh's Church yeah that was the first time I met Alex Jones I wouldn't know a Randy Weaver III became friends with the Weaver family who are the weavers out there Ruby Ridge you know yeah the company white separatists and so I've got me defending Weaver and his daughter Rachel and then I went with Randy to to Waco and I'll extrude there was this kind of crazy by Waco I was like who the fuck is that what year was this was about nine probably 1998 maybe that's when I met him yeah yeah man in 98 yeah he was he was amazing I mean I could tell like I drove through asked him with him like he went to buy a new suit because he was like you know giving a big talk at Waco I'm like yeah everybody the clothing store was like excited because Alex Jones it works so ID was like a big deal in in the neighborhood but but then but then I wanted somebody to sneak in to pay me and Grove with and I asked David Eick first I said could we go do Bohemian Grove video that's where they transform suspects giant lizards oh did he tell you that for real yeah he's a really good yeah he said that's where they transform ourselves back and he's kind of abandoned all that housing yeah he gets mad if you bring it up yeah what you can't you can't get mad man yeah yeah you know we made a lot of speeches saying that people transform the lizards yeah you got to own up to that show good I hope you said those exact words this is going back a long time he said woods he certainly strongly implied that he believed that it was at Bohemian Grove they transform you see I think you're in the clear because he gave many many interviews where he talked about that that was a big well it was kind of in the early days of the internet when you can get away with saying stupid shit like that and you didn't have a bunch of people on reddit that immediately could debunk your Twitter or Facebook well they just knew something that you didn't know and like what the fuck are you talking about yeah I transform the lizards well one of his his big like a piece of evidence at Bohemian Grove was where they transform themselves into lizards was because of this woman called Cathy O'Brien who said that she was a kidnapped sex slave and that she would be like let loose into the gardens of the White House and George Bush Senior would like hunt her and I his second game and so she wrote this book about this cold it was cause something like the crisis of democracy there's called the transformation of America and she said it was at Bohemian Grove she was a kidnap sex life at Bohemian Grove and you know that's where it all happened and and she was lat and Bohemian Grove was all based around this this this river and a Russian River and and so that's where the Bohemian Grove rumors first started with with Cathy O'Brien that's all arias yeah and so I thought like it can't be true that like George Bush and Henry Kissinger all go to this club and on the Saturday night we all put on row and have a mock human sacrifice in front of a giant stone owl I thought I can't be true so I phoned up David I could I said Gucci lecoeur Jonah come with me he's like no and then I thought well remember that crazy you know a guy we met at wake up Alex Jones maybe we should ask him so I've called up Alex Jones and I said Tootsie fancy try to get into a new girl and he was like yeah I'm gonna get a cab we'll get a hidden camera we'll get it or get it run in their faces as devil worshipers will confront them going about their globalists devil worshipping evil so that was the video he made a video about this so you were in involved in that yeah I was in this video okay now I remember you okay yeah I remember you in that it's a long time long time ago we so we all went there we all went to Bohemian Grove it was me and my producer my cameraman and then Alex and Alex his wife violet and and his friend Mike there was that six of us and we were like strange bedfellows fun and Alex was like you know well at one point I said to Alex like have you got like a contingency plan like if we managed to get in and and like you're you know you're uncovered have you got a contingency plan I don't said yes and I said what is it he said I'll say to them don't get any closer and I'm like that's your contingency plan don't get ready guys like a threat I was going yep so his he was just gonna scare them yeah he's gonna that's him good Eddie close so that was Alex's I don't think he thinks that far ahead oh shit that's a problem it really did but put on robes yeah I really do have like a bundle of sticks that's supposed to represent a human being and they carried it out there and light it on fire I saw it all with my own eyes but do they say that it represents a human being like well know what what they say is that it represents dull care like all the troubles in the world ago this man of wealth and power have all these troubles in the world I've gotta say it was white people problems for those real first world problems yeah 1% of first world problems yeah we own is that all paid in the US for two weeks here you guys have so much stress you need to burn a fake person make you feel better it's so hard being a billionaire how do you do it how do you run the world until it was a weirdo so Alex Alex his plan and this is how we were going to get him we were going to rent a boat and likes a little ong the river and then get out and then climb up the mountain and get down the other side and I get in that way um I was thinking this is a this is an ill-conceived plan and then we met this local lawyer called Rick it was that this preppy lawyer he lived in the town Monte Rio or Occidental and Rickard had been and he'd infiltrated Bohemian Grove just because like everybody in the town wants to know what's going on in Baden Grove so we met Rick to get some tips on how to break in and Alex told Rick his plan and Rick said look if you're going that way you're gonna get yourself killed and Alex wrote down this was my favor one of my favorite bits at all weekend Alex wrote down on his notepad going in that way - killed said what you need to do is lie go to Eddie Bauer and get yourself some preppy clothes and just walk up the drive just walk up the job mmm that's a smart move yeah so Alex was like really torn because part of him he admitted this to me afterwards part of him was worried that like in the Wickerman me and Rick had all these other people that we've met all part of this kind of elaborate plan to lure Alex into the forest and like he would be so rich so the upshot was that Alex and Mike decided to go in separately - me and Rick oh yeah so he didn't trust you that much no he didn't trust ya I'm he didn't didn't have Wikipedia back then it couldn't just Google you or anything right couldn't Google me did he know of your work did he know who you were really I wasn't particularly well-known back then I wasn't really well-known the same to say that Alex Jones helped launch you we can help and you guys went in there and yeah Alex gave me this VHS tape by the way back in 99 or whatever the hell you got guys actually made a tape out of it yeah yeah well Alex and I did this thing I did a special in Austin my first DVD I filmed in Austin and Alex and I dressed up as the bushes I was George Bush jr. and he was senior and we ran around the the state capitol with like these bush masks on we I've seen that video did I have a big boo hole inside Nicole like Satanist globalists um at one point I'm definitely but I don't know if that made it into the video but we actually sang a song there's actually a song I don't know if we've ever played this song it's so ridiculous Alex Jones wrote a song about like the the elite and it has it was on the video was on the video and we're all like dancing around to Alex's Jones song and this is 9999 or maybe two there it is yeah back to the beginning so here well that's me doing from the belly of the beast clashing with the lies and disinformation no compromise one day closer to victory it's Joe Rogan baby this is a song Molech and friends yeah you know I feel like I know at Alex's if Justin Moloch by suggesting but he didn't grow yeah location I was wearing a style project t-shirt remember style project style project calm [Music] [Music] [Laughter] was so stupid and 666 uh bushes had Alex oh that weekend didn't that's the only time you've and Wako you know wake her first and then I lost touch with him after that he reeked and he liked me again actually after I wrote the monastery goats like he didn't like me after I wrote my book them which includes all this stuff about being sneaking into Bohemian Grove uh-huh because he thought I was too much of a debunker of Bohemian Grove but then when I wrote the men who stare at goats he liked me again because he felt that I was like a bit of the minister it goes this kind of like a conspiracy book and all right yeah so um how much different is it then should we keep going with this bohemian girl yeah yeah okay so Alex and Mike decided to go in via the undergrowth like I I saw them so they went in through the bushes they wouldn't say the bushes there was a lot of poison oak I just walked in yeah a man Rick the lawyer this kind of preppy lawyer oh it's only the funniest thing I've missed out of this story was it was the night before we were going to infiltrate Alex Mike decided to practice being preppy [Laughter] they woke up a dead like the code or that said their motel room talking in a kind of effeminate way about micro processes well you know I think I just a nano technologies the future yeah and then so then they went in through the undergrowth am Ian and Rick the lawyer were up the drive actually with our producer John surgeons and and just as Rick said you know we gave the security guard a kind of I rule the world type wave just just preppin we were in act like you know ice-t used to say yeah when used to rob things iced teas so just act like you know act like you know what you're doing yeah we walked him and there was this Bank my memories okay there's this big bank of telephones this was like before cell phones well I guess there were cell phones but very few Ave there was a big bank of tariff and then there were all these camps it was like a giant redwood forest and I know all this little camps everywhere and all the camps sure enough had weird like almost definitely kind of Millia that little red light remember one of the Cubs was called like devil eyes or something and it was like little red eyes you know poking out of the think it was a Halloween type upset and then some of the camp's had like grand pianos and hot tubs and they're all these old men all of whom you know mr. burns little trucks tone up and down and like a golf carts yeah sort of more like posh pickup trucks okay like leather kind of stuff you'd get like like a universal studio 200 something and and then we saw and there's like all this owl stuff everywhere no the reason of this some conspiracy things get really annoyed with what I'm about to say is that because everybody really loves the idea that like they're worshipping Moloch the giant devil owl but the reason why I sighs I could tell they're all these like our sculptures everywhere it's because like it's an owl sanctuary like there's little cabins with like stuffed owls in that's like an owl sanctuary so but wait a minute it's an owl sanctuary like they actually take care of owls or like an owl preservation area like this is a place where Al's nest no Alex okay so this is that was if you were worshiping an hour guard though wouldn't that be a cool place to make your sanctuary where the Owls actually nest like well I guess so unless you can't totally debunk it there mr. ronnson well that's true and although wouldn't like if you're worshiping a giant owl God wouldn't or the regular-sized owls be like false gods I mean I'm I'm buskins maybe or you know I don't know if you have like a a great monkey God and the monkeys lived around with a great monkey guy lived you feel like they worshipped them yeah like they were shipped Molech okay I'm with you now yeah still nonetheless minions I tell you have children we were wondering about maeín wreck and we saw this giant the giant owl right of everybody's like legend it's funny I remember thinking it was stone but then a few years later somebody else infiltrated Bohemian Grove for some magazine and said it's not stone it's like plaster of Paris or oh it was something bad but I'm sure they're right so you guys were far away from me I remember screaming like all the way up to it so is there a security guard like when you walk down there was one guy sitting in a little Hut and he didn't ask you anything didn't ask anything you just weigh like a joy enjoying your evening and where is Bohemian Grove yeah what state it's in Northern California it sits next to this little town called Occidental it's like a know through road and then you go up the road to San Francisco yeah north of Napa is northern Alba yeah hmm and I'm missing Alex and Mike and I said God hates Alex I'm like hey I did a what personally said keep walking there's owls everywhere and it's camera said the chase is everywhere how's Mike said I thought was everywhere did they see out on me Lee talking about work our owls were oh I think at this point Mike was convinced that every time they saw an owl it was like you know it was Moloch really oh jesus fucking christ yeah so so what were you thinking at this point you think what the fuck have I got myself into hanging out with these guys they're gonna ruin my whole investigation well no I mean I was nervous um because you know the closer you can get this microphone the bird focus we don't have our heads hurts okay sure so yeah I was kinda I was nervous but I said I thought it was kind of fun I felt safe with Rick the lawyer I felt like nothing bad would happen to me because he looked so rich and pretty and that's like every horror movie where things go bad you're hanging out with Rick the lawyer yeah I thought I'd be fine with Rick the lawyer yeah the head so then the bell rings like gets to dusk and as a ringing of the bell and if all these old men like drift down to this little pond and they told sit on like grass one side of the pond and an Alex and Myka they're like a few rows behind and there's the giant owl on the other side of the pond I remember what she'd this moment which I thought was really weird was this old man comes up to me I'm like this is like nearly 20 years ago so I don't remember like all of the details but but this old man came up to me and said something like like I was way younger than everybody else there and this and this guy says to base it's your first time and I said yeah I said are you gonna love it burn em burn em and I did the sort of impression of what was about to happen and in the in the pageant and there was this look of like real fucking intensity on this guy's face and at that moment I thought to myself like there's Alex and Mark like a few rows behind me convinced that this is like evidence that the globe Lolita blood-drinking Satanists and then there's all these like men of wealth and power who are really fucking into all themselves and they might be into it in a different way to the way Alex and micro into it but they're fucking into it and I thought I'm the only sane person in this entire fucking network were a rectal lawyer and wreck made wreck we're the only sane wonderful tenants dropped off in that place once they invented viagra you know who's like rich old dudes they couldn't get it up it's not a lot to do you're bored yeah it was it was a weird way to spend your summer vacation I didn't see any like famous people but at one point we passed this display cabinet and there were the names of the guests on the in the display cabinet and I'm a missing Dick Cheney's name oh yeah for sure that's probably gets his extra hearts yeah have you ever there's a photo of I think it's Ronald Reagan at Bohemian Grove yeah the mighty nipson yeah yeah yeah yeah pull that up Jamie cuz it's a crazy photo so this has been like a weird spot where these guys have gone for decades well since I guess since like the railroad came through San Francisco like like you know the turn of the 20th century I think that's pretty much when it started who the fuck started this Thea there is there's Nixon is Reagan who started this thing and look at the big redwood behind on some majestic tree yeah okay what I what I heard and as I said it's been like 20 years since I've you know thought about this stuff too much because once I put it in there I kind of forgot about it but but but the story I heard was there when the railroad was coming through San Francisco all the rich white Republicans and unlike Bilderberg this is a vey Republican Club thought you know fuck there goes the neighborhood's you know we're gonna lose our elite status we need to set up a private club for ourselves so they set up the Bohemian Club in San Francisco and then Bohemian Grove in you know a couple of hours north so then this this ritual starts this you see there a man wearing lederhosen appears in like a stage cut out of the giant redwood and he's got that leaves all over his later hoes and it's like leaf covered later and he starts singing this like song and and the symphonies they're like the San Francisco Symphony well there's a video of it pull a video of Alex Jones at Bohemian Grove yeah Alex Alex was a few rows behind us and he was filming it all like with a camera that had toppled over 45 degrees it is it is bag and yeah he filmed the whole thing yeah he did it like on a sneak tip yeah oh did he film as early as like like the pre-show later hos and everything um seeping in fine just some dude in a row in front of a giant fucking owl yes its toppled over sideways yeah yeah full screen maybe we'll get a bit I'm a few Rosen from yeah so then this happens all these men in in robes and hoods all descend in front of the giant owl there you go okay and they have this ritual where where this papier-mache effigy like comes over on the pond in a gondola and they say to its you know we shall burn you tonight dole care and then the voice of dokgo goes he shall not burn and then they go year after you don't know see how you're after you and this happy Grove we burn thee and then they lift it up and throw it in the fire and and the FT goes that makes noises yeah do they have like a speaker system yes he's the speakers and there's a what you can't see in the video is that there's an orchestra to your left I've been fuck knows where the guy in the leaf covered later her son's gone at this juncture but he was on he was like basically sitting on a giant redwood she's getting sodomized by Nixon Dick Cheney Reagan's coaching them there's probably about a thousand people in that crowd the other side of the pond Wow when the fireworks go off you get like a glimpse of how many people there are there's probably a thousand people Wow now one of the requirements like how do you get in there you get invited today I met Harry Shearer who got invited Harry Shearer from The Simpsons yes sir he was the only person who'd been to Beeman Grove who was willing to like talk about it to me like after we left and he said he was invited to these were his words he said he was invited to do the place up like the word ooze that had a ridiculous and but he agreed with my interpretation of it which is basically that it's not evidence that the secret rules of the world who actually Satanists who do actual human sacrifice which is basically the way Alex was we're spinning it but it's this kind of weird overblown pageant what what I think is really interesting and I think this is where Skull and Bones comes into it is that there is this weird proclivity amongst the elites to create these ancient ceremonies for themselves and none of them are actually ancient they're all only what like hundred years old at the most right but they're do not for a reason right they want to create this kind of Masonic ritualistic you know Millia for themselves and I think there's a weird psychology going on there because I've been you and me we wouldn't well I mean I wouldn't you wouldn't no I wouldn't yeah but I might I would have to be really fucked up to do it I have to be under the influence of a lot of different things but the the idea behind it I guess is that you you get closer if you're all doing this ridiculous shit together that somehow another through tradition or through ritual that you you bond and maybe it gives you a kind of mandate to be in an elite I sometimes wonder whether like a skull and bones - it's not just about bonding but it's also about creating this kind of specialness for yourself right right right yeah that gives you a sort of you know doesn't make you feel so so insecure about the idea that you're a global elitist who's ruling the world was another thing about skull and bones as well they were saying that part of the ritual they do like really humiliating shit to each other and they film it so that they always have this like inside intelligence yeah maybe yeah yeah I've heard that but but i but I don't know if that's to better but I've heard that well young Jamie was saying that Tom Cruise might be leaving Scientology is there any evidence to support this start magazine well that's about as good as I guess funny because going Clare has a loving heart I think the movement well it certainly did I mean it exposed it well what it all deals with I think with this this Bohemian Grove thing and is this sort of cultish mind sets these weird sort of mind sets where they engage and otherwise preposterous rituals that to the outsider like to us like we're watching this owl God and a fucking bundle of sticks and burn the this is so fucking stupid but to those people it represents this thing they've all kind of agreed to do this goofy shit together and there's some weird power in that yeah I agree with that it's it's definitely there for a reason well it exists in so many different cultures that's the weirdest part about it it's like you go back to like the Aztecs and the Maya like they would when they would and make these human sacrifices they would wear these crazy outfits and plumed headdresses and it was all this like yeah in a tough world oil in the Isis - sure yeah yeah but it's bizarre the out when people start wearing outfits and engaging in rituals you know that's the that's a weird aspect of human behavior that seems to be really prevalent it's like it's not like an isolated incident where there's only this you know like if you go to Africa and you see like or Asia or you know you see like these people that have those those things that extend their neck those little bars those women put like God what are they doing well it's it's very isolated yeah it's like one group of people that do it or the women that put the plates the Surrey women that put the plates in their lips like what the fuck is that yeah it doesn't catch on doesn't go anywhere else like bizarre ritual but it's only isolated this one very specific area but rituals themselves like really wacky dresses and the weird things that people do it's it's so common it's it's almost like every culture has them and the people involved by the way when my book then came out the Bohemian Club made a statement I remember about my book well they said they said something along the lines of despite Jon Ronson's objectionable chess passing we appreciate the fact that he's putting a less kind of sensationalist spin on what he saw then what Alex Jones did and so they kind of appreciated the fact that I was I was being less hysterical about it than Alex and they said you know it's it's overblown it's an overblown pageant but it couldn't be more innocent or something along those lines that's it to ask why and by the way it could definitely be more innocent I mean look the Mickey Mouse parade at Disneyland is also an overblown pageant and that could not be more innocent it's not that's really literally as innocent as things get yeah what you mean Grove could be way more innocent you're you're burning someone like and you're saying you I burn thee and then you have screams that play out over a loudspeaker that's not innocent that's wacky as fuck like it's hard to just just stating the facts it will be really hard to soften that up yeah you know like saying that you have an over sensationalized version of it like what that's not of all like it's really sensational or they're saying that I definitely had some truck this is what me and Alex fell out because I felt what we saw was bizarre enough without having to put a spin on it what was our to spin Alex's spin was practically that you know it's possible that they were killing an actual baby I mean a long way oh what buddy said a one-party center very yeah we overheard these two old men that when we were walking down the road I mean it's true the me and Alex were like separate Ternes you know but he said at one point we overheard these two old men going yeah we're gonna get him elected and I thought like I don't know that Alex didn't hear that but that's that's a bit fucking convenient so that's exactly the thing Alex would want to hear at Bohemian Grove who knows what that conversation when the bow takes something out of context like that it could have been a total complete joke yeah it could have been elected to let the local shrine have anything and the boys who knows what the fuck they were talking about yeah alex is one of those jumped to conclusions confirmation biased characters that often times has some really fascinating information I'm as much I admire about Alex I mean I meet just a friend is a piece of extraordinary broadcasters crazy mmm he's crazy it's my friend I'll tell you right now he's out of his fucking mind but he's right a lot of the time I mean one of the best pieces of work that Alex did was 911 E and in that he exposed some stuff from news broadcast that was really shocking about the use of agent provocateurs to which I always thought was utter horseshit and then it turns out not only is it not horseshit but its standard operational procedure has been proven with this Occupy Wall Street crowd they infiltrated the Occupy Wall Street group and did all kinds of crazy shit in the park we're trying to get people to join them and arrest them and what the agent provocateurs did during the WTO protests is they would they had these peaceful protests and they would come in dressed up and like all black and they had military issue boots and they were smashing dough's and breaking things and then they gave an excuse for the cops come in and close down the protest well they literally set up a no protest zone where people couldn't go to work with WTO badges they had a WTO badge with us a line through it like saying no WTO they were literally telling them they couldn't go to work with that on there's a no protet like a fucking pin like which is completely against everything this country's supposed to stand for right and so these people were you know these agent provocateurs were working for the government and they literally came in to try to break up a peaceful protest by turning it violent and then they were all held up in this one house and Alex documented it all not with his own news footage and his own reporting spin but basically just using actual news stories and different coverages by different local news stations and showed like what the fuck actually went on these people were all released these guys were all held up in a building somewhere and they negotiated their release someone did somehow okay and you know at first I was really super skeptical because I was like that sounds like nonsense but then you the more you peel away more you realize well this is something that they've always done it's like a standard president look if you've got a bunch of people that are protesting and they're ruining your elite globalist fun like the best way to do it if they're being peaceful is to have people that pretend to be amongst them start smashing things then you have an excuse to come in and arrest everybody and that's what they do so he had a really fascinating video on that showing evidence of that being used before that there's a bunch of tactics or in place it's not simply as innocent as that law enforcement is set up to enforce laws and to preserve peace it's not it's not they do a bunch of creepy shit and you know that's that's unfortunate but that's when you start talking about conspiracy theory well that seems to be conspiracy fact you know it just seems to be something that standard operational procedure when they can get away with it what I'm hoping is that with all this WikiLeaks shit and all this Edward Snowden stuff and all the the details that have been revealed about the NSA and and what we know now about security in the internet and the cloud and it's everything can be hacked everything can be compromised I'm hoping that all goes away because I'm hoping that it's just gonna be way too transparent mm-hmm but you know I don't know but Alex Jones thinks what they're trying to do is get down to 500,000 people he's got this idea and I say yeah well everyone 500,000 people these really grandiose things he says like that do you think he really believes them or do you think he's like like would you know he's trying to make something that's so huge that everyone's gonna like draw themselves towards him um he's not a liar he might go further with things then I would you know he might not have rational conclusions he might approach things with confirmation bias but when you spend five hours day on the fucking radio or whatever he does just going over wacky theories and selling gold gold and bonds dried foods they got dried food keep the dried food in your basement you know it's after a while I think you'll lose your fucking mind and now if you work at a strip club you get sick of hookers you get sick of working with strippers you know if you're selling drugs all day the last thing I want to do is take drugs yeah I think alex is like inundated with conspiracy it's like it's overwhelmed you probably can't see the forest for the trees yeah it's just saw chaos to him that's all everybody's in on it so the globe really people are turning into reptiles left and right burning owls babies whatever they can I don't know man yeah I don't mean you'd have to ask I love the guy though he's a great guy I love hanging out with him he's a lot of fun we had we got on better again as I said after the minister Coates came out because he really he liked that book don't have any had me on his show and then like all of his listeners said I was a sail for the world or Die Michelle too sometimes they say that depends depends on what I say yeah when I was talking about chemtrails then they got really mad at me Joe Rogan's a shill debunk chemtrails Adi okay didn't even debunk I just fucking science I mean there's like real simple science behind what happens when a jet engine passes through condensation in the atmosphere it's like it's been they've known about it for fucking ever this idea that they're spraying clouds like what the fuck man and that they're controlling you with these clouds but when I did this sci-fi show we talked about it and you know I brought in aviation specialists and I talked to different scientists and I talked to a bunch of different people about it and you know what we decided to print or we decided to show on the television show unfortunately you're doing with 44 minutes of TV for an hour you know you're a bunch of different commercials so you kind of you don't spend I think to really debunk something like that you have to kind of like spend a long time with it and actually show people like actually get a jet up in the air and film it and show how this this plane is actually leaving these clouds because it's passing through haze wouldn't be too hard to do if you had a really good budget but we didn't have really good budget and it wouldn't be that entertaining you know we had to make it like short little snippets which is like a real issue when you're dealing with any of those debunking shows is that they also have to be entertaining and they also have to fit within a format where they have to break every five minutes wherever it is for commercials what does it have seven minutes or something like that yeah whatever the fuck they do you know they're constantly having commercials so it's like you have these little tiny chunks of information and it's really just entertainment yeah more than anything so you know I don't see myself as a debunker because I think yeah what I saw it behaved Minh Grove for instance was was really it was art there was a kind of intensity there which which I believe is very different to our Alex felt was going on but it was still odd yeah well it's undeniably odd right I mean it is odd yeah yeah and rituals exists for a reason and one reason is that though I mean I don't know for certain but I but I would say it's this idea you know you know we love to this is a bit of a non sequitur but my most recent book is this book about public shaming yes called so you've been publicly shamed and what I've noticed happens on Twitter is is we will we will reduce somebody to a label will reduce somebody to the worst tweet that they ever wrote will demonize them and then will dehumanize them because we've just destroyed somebody and we don't to feel bad about destroying them so we called them like sociopath or something right it's this whole like mental trick we play on ourselves like what's it called cognitive dissonance this idea that were good people but we've just destroyed somebody so how do we make sense so that's all we just say or whatever sociopath or something so it's all about it's all about labeling and reducing and and demonizing and destroying people that we don't like and it's also about having an excuse to be a real asshole all you have to do is find a reason why you can unleash your fury on people and it's a free shot it's a free shot because if Jon Ronson says something fucked up there's a million people that could find out about that and they don't know you at all and so they have a free shot they've never met you they're never gonna meet you meet you they live in another part of the planet and they could Justine Vicki fuck that guy and they could just start typing a bunch of shit and it's this weird thing going on where everybody's kitted themselves into believing that you know you can lead a good ethical life like I can lead a good ethical life but some bad phraseology and a tweet or something can be a clue to our secret inner evil yeah what you're really are what you're really back yeah and I just wonder whether there's some kind of connection between it so it's about you know between that and about the rituals that you find a place is like Bohemian Grove and maybe the connection is that it's all about tricking yourself into believing that you can do evil shit so like when you give yourself like a ritual at skull and bones or Bohemian Grove that makes you feel oh I'm separate and different and better and that gives me a mandate to rule the world I can inflict this carnage and other people because I'm different to them I'm better than them and maybe on Twitter we do the same thing in our own little ways which is like oh well you know we're better than that person because that person just just misused their privilege or that person just just you know showed their true inner it's all about kind of it's all about setting yourself apart from people so that you can behave in in in ways that hurt other people and you don't have to feel bad about it maybe that's the connection well people have a tendency to pile on it's always been the case that's the reason why you see like when riots break out that that sort of exploits that type of pile on behavior people will do things in large groups of chaotic moments like a lot large groups of chaos rather that would they would never do with an individual you know as far as like assaulting people or I mean there's been instances where gangs of people beat up and killed people and the people that were involved almost didn't feel responsible because they were one of many that stomped somebody or kicked somebody or ran over somebody this snowflake doesn't need to feel responsible for the Avalanche yeah yeah exactly that's a great way of putting it and I think diffusion of responsibility is a real issue with human beings when it comes to large numbers any times as large numbers they don't feel responsible for any repercussions or of their actions if there was only two people in the world and two people in the world that somehow or another invented Twitter and they were communicating with each other and one guy you know said something questionable and the other guy quoted him and said Jon Ronson's is a piece of shit here is proof you know fuck this guy let's shame him what's this let's is only you don't you know there's no one there but you what you're trying to do is they're appealing to the bully instinct of people to just pile on and I'm torn because sometimes I think publicly shaming people is a good thing like if it's actual social justice yes absolutely righting wrongs but the problem is I think these days were in this really bad situation where people have decided to not differentiate between a serious transgression and an unserious chance it's a nice liberal person who tells a joke that comes out badly is treated with a similar level of ferocity as like a racist cop from McKinney Texas well mostly that's a very good way of putting it I think most people are not living life even they're going through life with a deficit and they started out with this deficit by having a bunch of fuckin shitty experiences when there are children their shitty parents and bad time in school and maybe they've been picked on and maybe their jobs socks or maybe they have unfulfilled sexual expectations whatever the fuck it is most people are going into any situation with a headwind or a tailwind I guess it is when someone's something behind you po1 right Taylan right headwind is you're trying but there's push behind them they're like accelerates their reaction to anything and they're almost looking for something that they can blame their bad feeling on they're almost looking for a target to unleash all their existential angst and frustration and life all their unfulfilled expectations all of it is on Jon Ronson's shitty tweet yeah you know and I wish he stopped teasing someone else watch shitty tweet but I have experienced it before I have experience but I found it adorable I would retweet people and stuff when they did it to me but well I always liked it I notice because after my public shaming book came out obviously you know a lot there was a lot of pushback and a lot of people went for me and I always really liked it when people went for me in a kind of ridiculous way because it actively tweet that one and it would make me look good I know is what my favorite one was all these people started like going for me and one person wrote why I'm I wasn't I just stayed completely silent I'm one person why isn't Jon ups and applying to any of us and somebody else wrote because John Dodson only replies to men honestly like I'm like party upset at you for well okay well in that particular instance it all started with justine sacco I wrote there's a chapter in my book that's that defends Justine Sacco who's the the aides tweet woman remember right on the plane listen man that lady is probably on xanax and wine and she said something that she thought was funny that be funny if she was your friend I might be funny if she well she was my friend and she too if she sent that to me in a text message I would fucking laugh yeah you know I'm going to Africa hope I don't get AIDS lol just kidding I'm white yeah and then the words he gets on the planes family yeah she gets on the plane turns off her phone yeah while she's asleep is like just tails to shreds by the sixteen hours yeah hundreds of thousands of people and one of the most like extraordinary things about it is that her inability to explain herself became part of the hilarity that was that was the tail we're like oh my god we know something she doesn't one person tweeted we're about to watch this just in psycho bitch get fired in real time before she even knows she's being fired and I just kind of think of anything more unjust than that so so I wrote this really passionate you know polemic defending her I think that you know we had gone crazy we'd lost our minds unless it was the most in judicial thing you could possibly think of yeah and a lot of people that you can imagine can really object it to that of course yeah it's because they have the green light to object I mean it's not that you're not saying something reasonable I thought it was one of the most important stories I ever did because like for thirty years I've been writing about abuses of power like in the psychopathy test where pieces of power in the pharmaceutical industry or or you know the worst excesses of psychiatry or psychopathy so whatever but whatever the the people abusing their power over there and whenever I like gave talks about that I'd like everyone would love it you know people would love it and then I write this news story this new book where I say you know what the people abusing our power now they're they're us it's like we've suddenly got all this new power on Twitter and social media and we're massively abusing it and the pushback is ferocious well because the pushback is from the very people who enjoyed abusing this power yeah yeah I've been talking about this for a while and I think that what's going on now with with people and the Internet and this this newfound ability to communicate that we find ourselves and this newfound situation we find ourselves in where anyone instantaneously can comment on virtually anything that happens in the and if what you say resonates or offends it can become a hot button and it just like gets all these ants just find the sugar now they just dive on it and they just swarm and it's almost like a mindless thing because I think that what we're experienced is an adolescent stage of a new level of communication that human beings are experiencing yeah I think that this new level of communication is starting off with the ability to just tweet at each other and it's gonna eventually go into some weird virtual reality place that's unless people fillet you know my friend clearly yeah a couple of years ago my friend Adam Curtis exactly bones flip phones I live in the desert well cut your own wood in the forest yeah basically my friend out and Curtis said to me who you'd love by the way if you don't know his stuff you'd know it don't know god you'd love him he made the power of nightmares and the century of the self these great doc BBC yeah and we Adam said to me one time that you know he thinks that the internet or definitely social media is going to be like one of those John Carpenter movies from the 80s where everybody's yelling at each other and everyone's like killing each other eventually everyone flees to somewhere safer like the suburbs and maybe that's just odd you know I noticed myself fleeing a bit from social medias yeah I never I when a long time ago I worked maybe ten years ago or so I would argue with people online all the time and then I realized what an enormous waste of time it is and also I realized that I'm not picking the people that I communicate with as opposed to the way you do it in real life the way and one of the things that I would do in real life is I would avoid anybody that starts arguments in his shitty all the time people were insulting and shitty I would argue I wouldn't argue with them I would avoid them but on the internet I was like engage these people you know like I'll get you yeah you fucking loser you know but you realized after a while like oh this is a new thing and I'm applying to it like the sort of same strategy that I would apply to a heckler at a comedy club and you really can't this is this is a totally new thing and no one knows how to do it yet it's is we don't have the benefit of hindsight to be able to step you know we're talking like mm you know 2001 we didn't have the benefit of stepping back and saying well this has been going on for a long time and now we understand how to how to deal with people but back then we didn't and I wish a lot of time had some fun but wasted a lot of time and also you you get emotionally charged up and invested in these people that in real life you probably wouldn't want to hang out with them yes folks to be with yeah or maybe they are and I'm just the Internet is turning us into you know these are named pathetic psychopathic figures I mean you know maybe from admin who left at least they'd be sweet well you wouldn't know them first of all based on their tweets because a tweet is one of the worst representations of you yeah you know it has to be kind of extreme hundred and forty characters yeah I mean sometimes it can be poignant sometimes it can be funny but like to sum you up from first of all to sum you up by your writing is difficult enough as it is when you're writing chapters and paragraphs without any back-and-forth it's hard because I don't think we are just who we are as an individual I think we we are we are who we are based on who were interacting with and how that works out like that's who you really are you that's one of the things that's so important about choosing your friends because your friends aren't just someone you enjoy they kind of help define you and when you have a bunch of really good friends and you communicate with them well and you get a lot out of it it changes who you are you become a better person you can get become a better person or a really good relationship and you could become an awful person and a bad relationship you know I've been in bad relationships before where I didn't like me I'm like this person hates me I don't even like me anymore like what what the fuck is going on and it's because we're we like to think of ourselves as completely autonomous but I don't think that's real I don't think there's anybody that's really autonomous I think we all need human beings and we all we all cherish human interaction me as much as you want privacy you don't want it all the time I mean if you had to choose between no privacy or no people I would take no privacy every time yeah I like people people are great you know I don't want to be bothered all the time and that's when people think the woods seemed like a great idea I'm just gonna go Unabomber I just and live in the woods and no you don't you don't you don't want to do that like we we literally are a superorganism we are not like one individual experiencing the universe solely on our own where we're all constantly interacting with each other yeah which i think is part of the reason why so but social media public shaming is so fucking traumatizing to somebody on the receiving end because there's nothing you know to be to be to be ejected from society to be told you not as good as everybody else to get out is that deeply traumatizing but then the people doing the shaming they don't want to think that they'd only think that they've just potentially done something intensely traumatizing to another human being that mangled up somebody's mental health so they just think oh I'm sure their phone you know saw their fire that person who just showed up saw their phone you you know as a guy pleased to edit Gawker who reviewed my book in one of the papers who basically said Oh John Watson so sweet you know but it's fine you know if you if you a man being publicly shamed it's fine it's no big deal they're just fine and then and I was look at this I think of fucking you know I've gone around the world me nice people they're not they are not fucking fine is that whether you want to carry on doing it or now you have to accept they are not fine you know people well a few weeks after that guy wrote that review some guy in Israel had been falsely accused of being racist committed suicide you know they're not fine it's that you can carry on doing it if you want but it's a really severe fucking punishment well this mob mentality has existed throughout history I mean when you go back to the punishing of the witches in Salem or you know what they do in Africa have you ever seen these these witchcraft accusation things in Africa where one person will tell someone that someone's a witch and then everybody else in the tribe believes it and they're burning people there's only disturbing videos but it's like this pile on where I think part of what's going on is there's a real fear of that same thing could happen to them and so they lash out that one person like with with real commitment so that they're in half out of the group they're in that group yes they're safe for that day yeah because we can only handle destroying one person and I notice with Justine Sacco one person at night tweeted somebody HIV positive should rape this bitch and then we'll find out if her skin color protects affirm AIDS how do you know how many people went after that person no one was like we were too everyone was too excited about destroying Justine to simultaneously destroy somebody who was inappropriately destroying Justine's it up has got a fucking total free pass at night imagine the mindset of someone to think that the best way to respond to someone's inappropriate joke is to rape them and give them an incurable deadly disease I'm Justin I feel totally justified Justine was asleep on a fucking plane and everyone knew that and that's why everyone loved it so much well didn't she write a bunch of other ridiculous tweets like she's trying to be tweets oh yeah I mean oh it's a few I had them one was I had a sex dream about an autistic kid last night I don't know what something about you know it's just stupid shit I read she's fun to drink with yeah well I had a couple of drinks so she wasn't fun the first time cuz she was her fucking crush just a couple of weeks later probably took years off of her life huh Jesus poor Justine the second time was she okay better the second time and it took her a year was a year she was basically here to recover yeah she was basically fucked and in the wilderness for yeah you know I noticed actually out to my book came out one of the push backs was like well you know Justine suckers fine now you know she was only like unemployed and you know deeply traumatized for a year and I'm like for one fucking joke that loudly oh yeah you know god yeah well that joke was representative of the hardest part yeah that's this is what we fucking do and it's such a lie it's like all these fucking Miss Marples or these amateur sleuths on social media thinking that we can spot somebody's true inner evil through a little bit of phraseology that's what happened to Trevor Noah and it just happens over and over now and it's yes Schumer and it does happen over and over and over again Amy Schumer in Trevor Noah though they're stand-ups and especially Amy Amy doesn't give a fuck like you yeah but she gives a bit more of a fuck then III just think everybody who's at the receiving end to that it she does but it gives her an out first of all she doesn't ever say anything that is indefensible cuz she's very smart and also I think as a comic everything that she says that's ridiculous if you want to debate her on like wine I mean she plays the role of a dumb person saying ridiculous shit all the time like that's part of like a persona that she'll adopt and abandoned onstage she'll adopted and abandoned and you know going in that's what she's doing it's a part of being entertaining it's like you know Richard Pryor doing the dopey white guy voice do I think he's really a dopey white guy now I was like hey my mom she's a great old gal no he's doing a fucking character of a dopey person it's easy to mock it's the same thing that Amy does when she's she might not change her voice but when she says ridiculous shit she's she's clearly being a comic and doing it as an art form right you know so many times I'm you puck cuss by the way and she hasn't done it in a little while right she's been she's got her a show I haven't talked to her in forever she's busy as fuck she's got that movie coming out but she's very smart yes very smart so she wouldn't welcome any opportunity to defend anything like that she doesn't take herself like ridiculously seriously or anything like that she's a very smart girl but I think as a really woman wouldn't want to call me a boy I think there's like a serious change going on in the way they're human beings act towards you so do you like it no I think it's really bad it's stressful who would have thought did the publicly shaming part yeah I mean what I do like is the fact that there's a leveling of the playing field and social justice obviously that's things I really like but but the problem is that you know it's that the I think the problem a catalyst like I went to college in London in the 80s and sometimes I failed with social medium with the social justice movement it's like the worst fucker who used to hang around the Student Union yes now gets to decide everything right and it's partly because of like the 140 character Twitter thing so basically you know in the Student Union in the 1980s we all cared about social justice but it's like the most unforgiving extreme fucker yes is now the one who's actually setting the agenda and not only setting the agenda on social media but because the mainstream media is so in thrall to social media and doesn't want to get hurt so it goes along with it it's kind of creating an entire society of surveillance society and colleges are where people first start exercising that muscle and it's the most rabid version of this issue today it's one of the reasons why a lot of comedians won't perform in colleges anymore Jerry Seinfeld just got a hard time from a bunch of people because he said that colleges are too politically correct and Chris Rock is saying the same thing and I stopped doing colleges a long fucking time ago for the back season yeah well I did a college once and this is a perfect example of it but this is a guy this this example is perfect because this is before the internet and this was a guy that I actually talked to face to face like someone said you know like I would do colleges and I'd fly into these towns and you know they're bored so like I tell my jokes and then sometimes I do like Q&A with them you know just for fun cuz it's a fun way to like you know the kids get to ask questions and you get to fuck around and come up with things on the fly and some some guy said do you know any joke joke sore something like almost science right and I said I don't remember anyone I go I remember this one two Jews walk into a bar they buy it like it's it's the end of the joke it's stupid it's terrible that joke a guy came up to me after the show and said that joke do you did about juice is very offensive I said what's offensive about it that Jews are successful at business what's offensive that I use the word Jew two Jews walk into a bar they went to a bar what parts offensive are you just looking to be offended are you actually offended and he was flabbergasted he didn't know what to say because he was a fucking 19 year old kid and he thought he had his he was an awkward a socially awkward person and he thought this is my opportunity to be right yeah and he just I'm offended like and there's all these kids supporting each other yes you do have the right to be offended and they're all fucking dumbest shit and they don't have any life experience and they really they don't have a nuanced view of the world yet and they're exercising this new muscle this new muscle of learning how to call someone on their bullshit man and the patriarchy on the is missus cisgendered bail heteronormative bullshit that you see every day and they're they're like finding this this opportunity expresses rich and then eventually hopefully they'll settle in and hopefully those sort of like as time goes on they have more experience they'll sort of realize how ridiculous they were you know when they were younger but it's like a natural inclination to like you know you fucked up and you know you've done wrong things so when you see it in other people call it this one kid that said this to me I mean that was the extent of our conversation I said that's ridiculous like it's not offensive I go I'm first of all I don't tell I'm not racist and if I told the racist joke it'd have to be really good you know and then and he goes we shouldn't ever tell racist jokes that's not true I go if you make me laugh with a really funny racist joke I'm thankful cuz you made me laugh I don't think you think that everything you say is a fucking sworn statement an affidavit that you're getting giving in court I assume that when you're doing the art of stand-up comedy you're going to say things you don't really mean because they're funnier than what you really mean and that's part of the art form just like when you listen to a song you know Bob Marley didn't really shoot the sheriff okay probably didn't shoot anybody and it's like it's it's it's part of the art it's making shit up and when you take that away because people are going to be offended well then you remove almost every movie that's ever been made you remove almost every book that's ever been written you take away almost every standard comedian set and you just get you fucking nerf the shit out of the world and everybody's boring and that's not the answer it's not the answer I think this is a missus all the reason why I I'm so happy to have done the justine sacco story in my book cuz and I had so much pushback and each time I get pushback I feel more and more happy that I did it like a member gave a talk in Norwich one of the first talks I gave was in Norwich England and somebody in the Q&A somebody said to me so we called out are you a racist and I was like because I defend it just in and it's like you know so for 30 years I'm writing about abuse of power and the first time I say we are the ones abusing our power so when he yells out are you a racist and then like try to fill it but isn't that one person is our you're just dealing with really simple thinking like that's just not a nuanced objective well-thought-out view of a human being what they're doing is looking for an opportunity to call you out on something yeah looking for an opportunity to shame you and that's what the problem I have with all this social justice warrior bullshit that's going on the world is its manufacturing a lot of hate and its manifestations protons gender rights pro-gay marriage Pro pro-peace pro-choice pro-life Pro left-wing ideology you know those like do unto others as you would have them do unto you this whole idea of like creating a more peaceful world and the way they're gonna do it is by ruining everybody who doesn't agree with them and shitting all over them and insulting them yeah I'm not distinguishing between most actual social justice and what's the kind of cathartic alternative social justice like the destruction of just aid the destruction of Justin doesn't do any good for anybody but she wasn't even intending to be racist she was trying to make a Liberty I'd be like Koch's I'd be like Trey Parker and Matt Stone right this isn't someone after a cop that shot a kid yeah with a fake pistol or anything you know this is yeah exactly and this is the real problem and the inability to distinguish between serious and Christian and the unserious transgression and what is creating as a kind of surveillance society it kind of started where everybody's more fearful everyone's scared to say things the great thing about social media was how it gave a voice to voiceless people and now people are fleeing social media because they're realizing that the smartest way to survive is to go back to being voiceless see I don't think that's true I don't think they are fleeing I think they're jumping on droves I think some people are jumping off but I think that what you said the great thing about it is it gives a voice to people it's also the terrible thing about it and but I think what this is is as I said before is like this adolescent stage of communication we're reaching this new level of interaction where we can interact with each other instantaneously and that's just never by the way Tesla predicted this - Tesla predicted smartphones a hundred years ago and I tweeted this quote today that somebody sent my way absolutely fascinating it was not just a quote it was a piece that Tesla had written in life the 1920s amazing where he predicted smartphones like literally described a modern smartphone scroll down like his actual words like no no it's not below that you actually read it when Wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain which in fact it is all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole we shall be able to communicate with one another instantly irrespective of distance not only this but through television and telephony like phones we shall be able to hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face despite intervening distances of thousands of miles and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will do this do his will be oh do his will huh - do Hey oh do be amazingly contempo compared with our present telephone a man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket holy shit fuck about is unbelievable fucking unbelievable you read that paragraph you think to yourself oh my god you know when we have that world for ourselves what an amazing world it will be there be a world of curiosity will be a world of like understanding strangers of nuance of context and so we have the world and we completely throw away curiosity we throw away new arts we throw away context and what we have instead is condemnation well with dummies but not with everybody with a lot look I'm Way more informed now that I ever would have been if I had grown up in the 1960s mmm like if I growing up in the 1960s I was a 47 year old man in 1967 I wouldn't know jack-shit I would be a tape I mean that is true but I do feared you know my I mean I do feel that you know maybe there's two types of people in the world those people who favor humans over ideology and those people who favor ideology over humans and right now the ideologues are winning on I don't think they are no I just think they're making more noise and I think that it's it's really a matter of who those ideological people are surrounding themselves with I think they can be swayed into a more understanding nature and we can decide this is what somebody wrote about my book which I really agreed with somebody about you know we can decide who to listen to yeah justine sacco the problem was that the bullies 1la everyone was too scared to defend justine nobody defended Justyna know i said you you brave bastard look at you yeah well a woman called Helen Lewis who writes for the New Statesman wrote a review of the public shaming book she said that she tries to defend Justine at night she wrote I'm not sure the joke was intended to be racist and straight away yeah I'd straight away she got this fury of well you're just a privileged bitch too so she said to her to her shame she shut up that's what happened that night like everybody shut up and it wasn't just on social media like the mainstream media all got involved it was like you know and and that became like the dominant narrative about justine sacco was actually yeah had a racist and and anybody who tried to stick up for her just got got screamed um well um almost only defending her in defending her I would say she's probably little racist she's which you can't really think like that that it's okay to say that if you're not a little racist but in cracking that joke and saying something like that which is uncertain unquestionably a racist joke just kidding I'm white lol right that's fuckin racist yes for me it's like a bad Randy Newman song I mean randy newman's and short people so people got no reason to live uh-huh like but he also said I love LA yeah is that tongue in cheek as well yeah this country because these things look at those mountains look at those trees look at that bum over there man he's down on his knees you know so what London omen will do is that he will acknowledge his own privilege and then do a kind of grotesque extreme version of it the comedy he does that install people it does it in our level a and I think that's exactly what Justin Sacher was doing in that jokes he was acknowledging her own privilege and then mocking it by doing color grotesque version of it and the only difference between Justin and Randy Newman was adjusting what just wasn't any fucking good at it right that's a good point I see your point it's it's hard to argue that it couldn't possibly offend people but the idea that she knew she was broadcasting it to all those people that were offended I think people just don't understand what the fuck is going on say things all okay you know what when the New York Times extracted my book and if fact-checker the New York Times phoned up justine and said like so before you got on the plane were you surprised that like you didn't get any replies cuz while she was like you know all happened after she turned off her phone and fell asleep right and she said i had 170 Twitter followers nobody ever replied she's like yelling into an empty room she probably got unreasonably cocky because of that exactly yeah and she got on a plane and so she's probably on xanax and drinking which is what a lot of people do when they get on planes that's like a fucking this lady was explaining to me that that's she was like like she was bragging about it like give me a glass of wine and I don't give a fuck about anything she was it was hilarious she was just talking and I was like I wonder how many people take xanax and get on planes and I apparently talking to people that take xanax it's super common they get anxiety they're gonna get on a long plane and also sleeping pills people take a lot of sleeping pills and they get on planes you know speaking of xanax I always it's when all of this was happening to me like when the New York Times you know extract came out and and it was just so noisy it's one of my noisiest stories ever in the book came out it was incredibly noisy and I went to the studio to do this video like talking about my book and the woman on before me was a doctor and she was doing a video about her book and she said what's your book about and I said public shaming she's old did you read the piece in The New York Times about Justine Sacco and I said I wrote it and she said oh wow god he must be so happy at I said actually I'm not happy and she said why aren't you happy and I said because everyone's there's so much noise and then she said - what'd he want and I said xanax hard wrote me a prescription for like 60s addicts of which by the way I've had one and a half I don't abuse Madonna Express or fuck is easy to get medication it's very easy to get medication United States go to the right doctors meaning go to any doctor yeah fuck take it I took like I took like a half and was it like that made me feel a bit I was no longer anxious I felt groggy and the notes of way up what would I rather feel groggy or anxious welcome to America that's our dilemma groggy anxious caffeinated or on adderall but then I thought God like when she said to me what do you want like all I could think of to say was an accident did I miss like an amazing opportunity like I don't know anything I don't know anything about you know where they're like much like way better thing since our next I could have asked oh well if you're like really into painkillers I guess but you'd have to like say that you're on pain so I think the thing about xanax is you could say you have anxiety and they'll give you medication yeah you know I know guys do what had - he went to a doctor - prescription because he use a social justice warrior and he said a bunch of incorrect things that people attacked him and so he had to go to the doctors he's freaked out like he got a taste of his own medicine but that fucker I saw him like six months later still shitting on people online like hidden didn't learn from the attack on him like it's almost like they they get caught up in this they get addicted to this drama of shitting on people of attacking people yeah it's weird you know what's inside I mean I don't do it anymore do not pile in on anybody anymore even people who deserve it I tend not to pile it on anymore I'll tell you what were thinkin so comes from the fact in my book the sack for me anyway my book the psychopathy test I am really critical of like labeling culture I'm really I'm critical of like the fact that the DSM is 886 pages long and as a mental disorder for everything yes and most people I think agree with me that that's kind of it's like easy to agree with me about that but then on social media we do exactly the same thing we label people right and yet said the very same people who agree with me about the the kind of you know what's wrong with labeling culture in the world go home and do it themselves in social media I have been really toying with this very strange idea lately I had this conversation with my good friend Duncan Trussell and we were we were talking about labels and in self-definition and the sort of imprisonment of definition and I said well even words like names for people like my name is Tom you know fuckhead you know whatever and as Tom you know you're a Whitmore and as a Whitmore you know you're you supposed to stand for something in this world like that I think we're outs then yeah we're Ronson's goddammit you're a Rogan Stephan up boy they think these ideas of like having a name like a label like you're you're coca-cola you know you're Jamie Vernon you know there's this I think having instead of just being you like having names even names themselves like we'd say oh well you know what do you expect it's that fucking Jon Ronson guy you like all sudden you can be boxed in and defined you're not just a human being who is sort of like existing with these other human beings you are a labeled human being yeah and that label can be great you know you can be the Dalai Lama or that label can be shit you could be Donald Trump you know and you'reyou're right now Donald Trump is an easy pylon yeah everybody will jump on him he said a bunch of racist things about Mexicans and much a dumb shit during his speech announcing he's gonna be President he's an easy pylon and he's also a guy that sort of embraces self-definition he embraces his label so much so that he puts his label on the top of a building Trump Towers this is a the Trump casino on the Trump this and like it's a part of the definition yeah I think any sort of definition like that like Officer professor you know doctor you know how about people that want like Cosby was making people call him a doctor when he got an honorary doctorate no I guess maybe you know see really it was a big joke for him because he was drugging people you know allegedly yeah new news right now it came out he admitted to 2005 and just just happened oh my goodness he made it in a 2005 deposition that he obtained quaaludes a sedative of the intent of giving them to women he wanted have sex with according to records obtained by The Associated Press on Monday the admission was contained in records that were unsealed after the AAP went to court to compel their release Cosby's attorneys had repeatedly sought to keep the record sealed arguing that they would be embarrassing this was a case that Cosby paid a woman off and then because he had paid her off part of the deal part of the arrangement was that the records were to be sealed so they went to court and Wow he's fucked now give her like three and a half minute jewel or something that's another thing I was reading this what a monster what's the statute of limitations and all of this stuff cadaveric questions I think can be well 2005 I can't imagine the statute of limitations is well if that's 2005 that's when he admitted it but when was the actual instance mmm that's a monster shit that's really that's dehumanizing shit I think we go that's a long conversation it's sort of semi-related the definition of Bill Cosby because Bill Cosby is a sort of iconic individual and Bill Cosby as a celebrity and because of that he was worshipped and treated like a celebrity and I think because of that worship he sort of had an expectation of worship and also and this is total armchair psychology from a dude who went to college for three years and barely paid attention but the I think the expectation of that and the years and years of that much like being a spoiled child leads you to be a person who expects that from people and can even justify horrific behavior because you actually do think that you're better than someone the same way royalty does the same way you know you know people who have not grown up their life not Bohemian Grove as a reason in a lot of ways I mean I think there's I think it's related in a way to the idea of labeling labeling and you know I just well you know that's not a human being that's a police officer officer Johnson you know you refer to the judge as your honor you know you can't go hey man you know I know you're reading off a book but don't lock me in a fucking cage because I had a joint order in the court he'll refer to him as your honor you know I mean like that all that stuff the fucking when they used to wear of crazy wigs and outfits are they doing there well they're separating themselves they're differentiating themselves and their labeling though they're putting themselves in a very distinctive position labeling it's it's really one of them it's one of the worst things that's happening in this country at the moment their ID in in in the psychopathy test aroused by how these kids as young as one and two are getting labeled bipolar because I've learned so in love with the checklists that a kid goes to see a psychiatrist with a temper tantrum and and so it scores high on the bipolar checklist so they're then given anti-psychotic medication at the age of like literally one and two you know that's how much labeling culture is out of control you know as a journalist the question I love asking is why you know cuz I opens doors mm you know why you have to go Smurfs but with labeling culture including label and culture on social media it's like it closes doors labels close to us questions open doors well they certainly define in like a very concrete way this is what I felt you know I felt most out a step lately with the whole Rachel Dolezal thing mm-hmm cuz when I heard that story I just thought that is so mysterious and complicating nuanced and you know maybe she's maybe she's mentally ill or maybe she's not whatever's going on here this is like really fucking mysterious and interesting and I had like a thousand questions and so I went on Twitter expecting that that would be Twitter's response to they'd have like a thousand questions right but no people were either like ridiculing her or attacking her like yelling blackface or whatever oh but there's plenty of people supporting her her positions being trans racial those are my favorite those people are adorable right I just thought fucking out I can't you know what I thought I thought I've been the journalist for 30 years and I'm sick I don't know where to go with this but I thought I'm really sick of like damaged people being other people's play things either ideological playthings or playthings for mockery or whatever and obviously is nothing wrong with comedy and satire and mockery I mean that's fine but nonetheless so glad further I'm just sort of second of cruelty yeah making other human beings uh playthings stead of you know for whatever reasons instead of like curiosity well if it was as simple as play play things like just just straight-up mockery I would expect that you would get some clever humor out of it but it's hate there's a lot of anger and hate and this whole public shaming thing sort of goes along with that I mean there's some people that I follow that I don't agree with and but unfortunately I agree with their position on a lot of things like a marriage like you know equality for all like there's so many different things that I agree with like extreme left-wing people on that it's really problematic because when some of them adopt this sort of social warrior public shaming stance I'm so torn because on one side I want to go after them but on another side I I agree with almost all their positions on equality for women and equality for gay people and a koala I mean there's so many of the positions that I have the exact same stance on but I don't have this stance on public shaming well if I do my stance is public humor you know Mike stance whether Chris Christie says he's gonna lock up everyone who smokes marijuana you know because marijuana is so dangerous I'm like Jesus Christ if you have a fucking mirror in your house you're morbidly obese and you're telling people that they can't have a substance that has never killed a single person ever over being overweight is one of the major causes of premature death in the United States of America having a heart attack is one of the major causes and having a heart attack is almost directly related in most people to being overweight I mean it's a huge issue and this fucking slob is on television telling people that he's gonna stop marijuana cuz it's dangerous you know hey stuff and hotdogs in its fat face like to me a guy like that has to be mocked because it's gets there and that's my job just like the fucking crocodile sees the wounded antelope and it gets too close to the water hole it can't help it it's got a snap at it if I'm a comic and you say something stupid like that and you are just as blatantly obvious target like that is a dangerous person in my in my opinion yes because he's a person who could dictate policy well yeah I make laws and he's a person that literally can lock people up in jail yeah yet he can get people's freedom taken away yeah you're punching up and you're being funny and there's nothing you know I'd be a real dope if I was gonna start being against things like that I guess you know what what my books against is the disproportionate punishment of people who don't deserve it bullying yeah it's been going on yeah it is it's also having a lack of there's a lack of perspective that comes with a lot of these pile on bullying things like the that was the woman's name again Sacco adjusting the Rachel Dolezal thing first of all she handled herself very well on Matt Lauer yeah I should say by the way that me sort of saying order that stuff on Twitter was right at the beginning before she'd said anything I was like say look we don't know anything about this woman you know we don't know anything like everyone's jumping to conclusions nobody knows anything and I was just like a screamed at for that and she had some other issues though that were exposed as time went on and one of them is she's a plagiarist oh yeah yeah she plagiarized some art she was selling some art that she clearly plagiarized and she's just deceptive she lied about her background she said she was boring @tp she's just not a truthful person and sometimes when people don't enjoy their life you know I've met a lot of kids when I was young that you know came from really fucked up backgrounds and those are the ones that told like the really big lies and I think that a lot of those lives were because they didn't like their reality you know and that's they didn't ask to be born like that you know there's a mystery right with people like that you like so what happened right why do you feel that way what's going on where's a virtual Dolezal at the minute this breaks on social media everyone's just like you know fucking racist shut the fuck up there's no questions really angry because she's appropriating a disenfranchised segment of society has already been stolen from from white by white people you know and I had people tweeting me to say you know you're a white man this isn't your story you know you're not allowed to have an opinion because you weren't born with the right amount of melanin in your skin so your mind is not working right when they said this is your story you can't come into this this is because this isn't your story that's bullshit I well I felt it kind of was my story because I've for 30 years I've been writing about troubled people and I've come to conclusions about the way you should regard other people or the human beings with sort of interest in curiosity and compassion not cold hard judgement so that's where I came from in that story it's also that you say that it's not you're not allowed to have an opinion or it's not your story that is you what you're trying to do is you're trying to silence anybody that doesn't agree with you everyone that is a human being that witnesses a story you witnessed some public thing that's taking place you were absolutely allowed your opinion and if you're not gonna allow people to speak up about things and have opinions about things whether these opinions are informed or uninformed that's all gonna be sorted out in the wash but just to say it's not your position to talk well then you're publicly silencing any people are you know exactly what that is the opposite of of course is democracy yes I mean I was reading people I went off social media after all of that because there was so much screaming and I was reading people basically saying okay let's go to Jon Ronson into saying something outrageous and then we can get him though they said yeah you know why they'd say that is because our the the young have decided for some mystifying reason to create an incredibly stressful world for themselves I don't think they realize what they're doing um but the the Rachel Dolezal thing was to me it was a perfect example of how ludicrous human beings are how ridiculous our society is and how this woman is like first of all the n-double-a-cp was founded by white people it's something a lot of people don't know and black folks weren't even allowed to hold office until the nineteen seventies well I like the cotton cloth yeah and a lot of ways well it was actually founded by New York City intellectuals I believe I hope I'm not doing this wrong that they they really it was in response to all the lynchings and you know they were like they were just they were compassionate intelligent progressive people that were trying to figure out a way past this horrible situation that the world it found himself in post slavery where there was all this resentment and there was there was lynchings and this the chaos that is the south and you know I think we're still dealing with the reverberation the repercussions and the reverberations of it right now with this Confederate flag debate that's going on all throughout America now it's like America's just sort of kind of waking up to the fact that we'll fuck man a hundred or so years ago you were allowed to own people yeah you know and the people that wanted to be able to own people had a flag and these people put that flag on a car and drove it around on TV and we didn't think about it yeah you know and now we're thinking about it and you know I record but I was always disappointed when the dukes of hazzard was on TV though because of the fly know just because it wasn't as good as Wonder Woman is a good attachment what about Daisy Duke well wonder one was pretty fucking hot too yeah I spent a lot of time with the Ku Klux Klan you know from from a book they're my I discovered this some politically correct faction of the Ku Klux Arkansas what yes the run by a guy called Tom Robb who decided that the Klan had a really bad image until he's got to do something about this recently no this is like mid-90s since I've heard about it in my book then why is he back in the news no there's another group another faction of the Ku Klux Klan that was allowing black people and wanted to allow black people in oh really what is the kind of thing that Tom would have done in fact Tom was accused by other white supremacists of kissing a black baby and he had to cut a denier to get to here to a black baby but I went to polyps I went to Tom's house and he directed so he'd band I went for his big annual convention and he'd band like the robes and the hoods whoa they were allowed to wear robes one day yeah yeah phone across one day oh my god yeah and it was the day that I turned up they were all standing around this giant cross it's lying on the ground and they couldn't remember because they were all so rusty they couldn't remember whether to soak it and then raise it or raise it and then soak it all that's all they're all starting around and then Tom comes over and they go Tom we cut do we soak it and then race it where is it and then it's okay Oh Tom goes you soak it in and raise it huh how the hell you got a lights okay and huh then Tom looks at me as if to say I'm so sorry that my members are such idiots like Tom preferred me to the clown and then II and then they had this love here in his garden and and they were all doing this kind of personality skills workshops like Lyle filling out this multiple choice like which strengths and weaknesses most apply to you always remember like one of the strengths the weaknesses was mixes easily which normally would be like a strength but if you're the clan it's been it's gotta be a weakness I then another one was warrior and one of the class men was like going well I don't consider being a warrior to be a weakness and then like the person doing the test was that was she being a warrior can be a weakness and he thought it was warrior and it was worried oh god yeah warrior are you a warrior like the owner says that yeah I an Englishman I'm a warrior oh I see yeah well I could see someone saying I'm a warrior but I couldn't see it as a question are you a warrior yeah I would think the question would be a little bit more straightforward like do you worry a lot I've got to say it a kind of genetic most poor choice question and answer thing warrior would be like I don't want to have it that are you a warrior yes sir I am I'm a warrior for the white race warrior now what is the reason why they burn the cross it's a cross they could across lighting not a cross burning and it goes it's a glass-half-full sort of a thing I think it goes back to the Scottish I believe it's all to do with like I can't remember they told me you know what it's like being a journalist like you know everything for short motor time then you move on to the next door you write your story forget it all I've got a terrible memory anyway have less it's like being a podcast or two that's we've talked about things and you know we've done 667 episodes now yeah so we're good night at 667 yes so did you have you mystic six a target Russell evil alright thank evil he's great yeah he could play evil one time I was I went on a road trip with the clan from Harrison Arkansas two simple long turn like 17 hours I was in a car for 17 hours with the Klan well at at one point Tom turned to me the leader and I said can I ask you a question and I said what and he said do you think I'm weird Wow yeah and I was like I think you're in a transitional phase between waiter not weird oh so you were playing like psychological yeah when I was in the car with Gamelab but saying he's a transitionary period like what did you mean by that well cos he was trying to you know trying to do an image makeover more politically correct it didn't really turn out and did he feel that by people were inferior to white people do you really clearly feel that well he would probably call himself like a white separatist but he wasn't honestly I mean I've met white separatists like Randy Weaver and they're far they're far nicer people than tom was a Randy Weaver who's the Ruby Ridge guy record separatist I really got I got him well with the Weaver it's gotten really well Rachel his daughter and that story is a kind of a fucked up story right like he was they had a house along the woods and they were killed by snipers all right yeah this is a really bad story so they were this is the first story I ever did where I feel like I kind of twisted it round so that the people who would normally be the villains were the good guys you know the people in normally be the good guys were the villains that was felt good about that so basically they were family of lie you know they believed in Bohemian Grove and Bilderberg and I where I am try to infiltrate Bilderberg one time by the way I got chased away by by their henchmen I don't know if this time to tell that story little bit on okay so so they moved to this cabin up in the woods on top of the mountain and Idaho Ruby Creek Idaho and Randy would hang out at the local Aryan Nations with the family that was his big undoing was that he would take the family up to Aryan Nations who were just you know were fucking nuts like violent skinhead nuts and Randy would take his family up there for like picnics and away days and so on so Aryan Nations like pretty much every white supremacist you know group in America was heavily infiltrated by by undercover officers and they saw Randy and saw his family and could tell that Randy was less crazy than the other people there so they approached Randy and said you wanna become an undercover informant and Randy said no so then Monte thought that was that but then they sent a guy to ask Randy to sawed-off a shotgun so he said okay fine so he sawed off a shotgun slightly below the legal limit like the guy pointed at me - no sawed it off there so we sawed it off there and then they said aha we've got you this was an undercover cop you've now committed a firearms offense you will go to jail unless you become an undercover informant for us and Randy being a being a twat said no fuck off and he kind of embarrassed the feds in front of his wife he said look at those two guys over there guess what they just asked me to do and so Randy was like an idiot and then he he locks himself up in the cabin with his wife and kids and dog and then and so they surrounded the cabin they the ATF and this went on for like a year that they set up cameras in the trees and surrounded Randy's cabin and and one day the the the ATF people got too close to the cabin and disturbed the dog and the dog starts like barking and the dog chases the agents down the hill and Randy's little boy he was who is like 12 years old or something Sammy chased the dog down the hill with a gun because Randy like an idiot had armed his kids and so they all run down to the bottom of the hill an agent jumps out and shoots the dog kills the dog Sammy says you killed my dog you son of a bitch and starts shooting wildly and the agent shoots Sammy in his arm and basically shoot his arm nearly off and Sammy yells dad I'm coming home dad and starts running up the hill and the ATF agent just shoots Sammy in the back as he's running up the hill just you know sort of volley of gunfire so so Sammy's now dead this story doesn't get any better I should tell you Sammy's now dead Randy gets Sammy's body puts him in the shed and then the next day oh one of Randy's friends is there and as a shoot out and one of the agents go bill Duggan gets killed too so now I've got two dead people you've got a dead agent and you've got Sammy dead the jury's always been out as to whether the agent was killed by Randy's friend or by friendly fire so anyway the next day Randy goes outside and an FBI sniper called on her if she shoots Randy in shoulder so Randy runs back in and Vicki Randy's wife is standing in the doorway holding her baby and a sniper shoots Vicky through the head and kills her and they pull Vicky's body into the cabin and aniseed stirs like a 16-day siege or something and that at the roadblock down at the bottom was kind of where the militia movement started like all these local militia people or form at the bottom of the roadblock for days and then discovered that Vicky's dead and and it's I mean I've seen some amateur footage and it's just so sad and and I've become really good friends with Rachel who's Randy's younger daughter who was in the cabin full of that time and and in the end the government admitted responsibility and paid each Randy's daughters a million dollars age and they killed Randy no Randy's still alive Rose you know yeah Randy now goes to gun shows where you can have your photograph taken with Randy Weaver yeah five dollars he sells himself quite shirt it's a bargain yeah historical figure sir that's so one of the people who visited Randy's cabin I visited around his cabin with Rachel and another person visited Randy's cabin was Timothy McVeigh and well shortly before blowing up the Murrah Building in Oklahoma have you ever seen the conspiracy theories on that about yeah I visit her della hem City the place which you know about right the place where you know I you know I know I've got a kind of reputation for being a debunker of conspiracies and and the reputation is Carol in most cases but I've got to say of all the things I investigated when I was doing a lot of stuff about conspiracies the one where I thought this is a bit fucking fishy was Oklahoma City yeah oh it's it's most certainly fishing what's most certainly fishy is the efficacy of that bomb the bomb that they used the fertilizer bomb that blew half that building apart when you talk to bomb experts they go that is like really really unlikely they said that the amount of damage that a bomb like that that's made out of fertilizer can do is nothing in comparison to what that building was like and also that that building looked like it had been blown out not it had been blown in but blown out meaning that there was bombs planted inside the building and then there was all these news reports as another one of Alex Jones's stories there was all these news reports that he played these clips of where they were talking about FBI agents removing bombs unexploded bombs from the building and that there were more than one bomb and then they had this you know this narrative that they blamed it on Timothy McVeigh and was the other guys named Terry Nichols Terry Nichols yeah yeah and that it was this fertilizer bomb and remember there's like there's all this they were looking for a guy from Iraq and there was all this like the different stuff that was going on in the news like right after it was over but then they had settled on the story that he had done it and they had done it all with this fertilizer bomb but it's it's it's a weird one because I mean I don't have an answer and I I don't even have a theory like who could have done it or how it was done or what would have been done I mean look all we know is someone blew up that fucking building I mean if it was just him and Terry Nichols it was just Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols that to me is no more crazy than it was a bunch of other people the planet bombs inside the building it's all a heinous act of horror and murder yeah the way it the weird thing that we discovered when I when I was doing the Oklahoma story was this place called Elohim City if you have you heard of this place so I visited Elohim City the old they'll put this is like this got a white separatists stroke supremacist compound and the Arkansas Oklahoma borders and in the Ozarks rookies bar yeah I turned up and they audit the Riverdance for me oh Jesus yeah I've just been chased through Portugal by the Bilderberg Group and I bonded with them over that yeah everyone all of this all of that crowd back Thanos knew about Bilderberg and I said yeah I've just been chased by the Bilderberg Group which I was I I it in my book then when I was trying to infiltrate secret societies I went to Portugal with Jim Tucker the he right he worked for this magazine called the spotlight which was run by this kind of white separatist group called the Liberty Lobby in Washington DC well basically everybody kept telling me about this kook or the Bilderberg Group that no runner heard of back then only only real mich aficionados that her to Bilderberg back then and much in the same way that like kind of law I feel like I partly launched Alex Jones his career I also feel like partly gave the world Bilderberg because that was the first like mainstream writer to write about it because everyone saying that there's a screw cut the Bilderberg Group and they secretly rule the world from inside a secret room and I said if you ask Big Jim Tucker he'll tell you more so I so I phoned up Jim Tucker and he said yeah it's true they always meet once a year the five star hotel with golfing facilities that's where they rule the world he said you've caught me at a good time honestly unless something out of like some Spade I had a an office of Phoenician blinds if you were a trill bed he smoked like 80 a day he said he had emphysema which made him sound even more like someone is smoking he died a couple of years ago but he lusted a fuck of a lot longer than I have put money on him and I I met him in March and I thought he'd be dead by May but actually lasted about another ten years Wow yeah I only died recently like a couple years ago and this was like 96 so Jim said he said yeah I've discovered where they gotta meet like my secret source has told me that they're meeting at the Caesar Park Hotel and golfing resorts in Sintra Portugal and I'm gonna fly over there and I apologize on my semi American accent I'm doing here he's now gonna fly over there and climb up the drainpipes and get in and confront and red-handed going about their covert wickedness so I said can I come and he said okay use the term covert wicked that might be slightly exactly I'm pretty sure he said he was gonna close up the drove a white supremacist Luther Savio Jim Tucker flew to Portugal and scouted around the Seas of our hotel and we decided that our cover story would be like he'd be like a sales would be salesmen but we didn't look anything like fucking salesmen I was like at early thirties you know skinny little Jewish guy he was like this big Southern gentleman so we looked like really fucking yeah like if I could have been like his Tori boy like we were like Scotty well I try to talk to waitresses and stuff this was the day before the Bilderberg Group was reportedly going to arrive at this hotel and then we left and we started getting looked in my rearview mirror and there was a car following me and and a chase ensued like through the street sir but I mean I say a chase I was going 30 miles an hour so so we say but I keep thinking you know I kept thinking fuck if I speed up he's gonna speed up it's gonna be like a fucking chase so it's very obvious it was fine he wasn't trying to be sneaky no well I stopped the car and he stopped his car like behind me so I I thought I've got to say something to him so I went over to the car and I left knocked on the window and there's a guy in dark glasses in the car looking straight ahead and I'm knocking on the window and he refuses to look at me like obviously his orders were to follow but don't engage like I'm suddenly in a world where I am like big followed by somebody whose orders are to follow and not engage so I freak the fuck out so I get back in the car and I phone up first I fold up my wife and I say I'm being followed by the Bilderberg Group I am fucking terrified and my wife goes oh you're loving it no I never found it it's just embassy and I've forgot the British Embassy and I said I'm being followed by the Bilderberg Group and then the one for the British Embassy goes and then she goes go on and then she says woody do do they know you know do they know you're here I mean what do you what are you doing here and I said I I'm essentially a humorous journalist out of my depth can you phone what I also said to her to my shame I didn't put this in my book I thought about all of this in my book then what I didn't say what I didn't put in my book was that I also said to her I said I'm a humorous to enlist out of my depth I'm a bit like Louis Theroux and she's like oh like she's heard of him and not me and I'm like yeah but actually Louie often cites me as an inspiration approach ago that Louie actually speaks highly of me so then I learned she says she says this is she said this is this is like the most startling thing that happen that day she said well the good news is if you know you're being followed they're probably just trying to intimidate you intimidate you and the dangerous ones would be those who don't know we're following you and I'm thinking first how the fuck does the press officer at the British Embassy know this hey what if these people are the dangerous ones and I just happened to be like naturally good at spotting them like I'm an anxious person I I will spar like I suffer from anxiety like I will spot if somebody's following me right right yeah so anyway so then she so I go back to my hotel and the woman for the British Embassy phones me back and says that she's spoken to the Bilderberg Group and they've said that nobody is following me of course yeah so I'm like he's behind the tree like I'm by the POE I'm going he's standing behind the tree and he cos will not just sit tight I'm sure he's kind of I'm sure it's gonna go like so I went down to the beach Jim Tucker throughout all of this by the way is loving her he's loving every fucking second of this it's his dream come true yeah I go down to the beach am petrified I want to like abandon the story like drive back to England from Portugal because I'm afraid I'm gonna get like stopped yeah in pretty much didn't get and get the ferry from Paris so like a two-day drive but fuck it right so then I had a cameraman with me David Barker cuz I was filming some of this for a documentary he convinced me to like stick it out so I went to the beach in the night and then I came back to the hotel and I swears God does is to men and dark glasses sitting in the lobby of the hotel and as soon as I walk in they both grab brochures and start reading them I'm like fuck so I go up to Jim Tucker and I said this is two men in the lobby and reading Brosius and they're only pretending to read brochures jim says howdy how do you know and I said you can tell by their demeanor and then later when Jim wrote all of this up for his conspiracy website he like transcribed this conversation and he said I said to Robson how could you tell I'm not son replied you can tell them by their smell build a burger smell like yeah power and their henchmans smell like badly paid power so anyway that was basically a but the next day we we went back to the hotel and stood at the bottom and watched all of these people driving up the drive Henry Kissinger David Rockefeller yeah and they already did turn up Vernon Jordan who was Bill Clinton's lie man bhai you know like like like Bill Clinton's lie you know man in the background lots of people in the background is there an official explanation for the Bilderberg Group yeah well much later on like after all of this happened I managed to interview three members of the Bilderberg Group including the secretary general an including one of their founding fathers who was this British politician who's still alive called Denis Healey who was a big Labour politician in the 1970s and he said and I believe him the Bilderberg was set up after the second world war because there was this big move against ideological politicians like post Hitler now we're doing anymore Hitler's so let's cut it create this sort of globalist one-world New World Order I mean you know that the phrase New World Order I think is is true having a word trying to create like a one-world government where business would be more important than politics because business people are more trustworthy than ideological politicians I think that that was there that was their thesis back then so it's kind of centrist almost kind of liberal in her in a way if you buy that Jon Ronson I got a bridge to sell you Portugal well I think that that was where they came from but of course what they didn't account for or maybe did account for it and didn't give a shit was their CEOs would be just as fucking evil and and and malicious and ideological in their own way as politicians and so that's why build a book became this kind of Mourne affair presumably became more than the Farias thing yeah I think if there's only if there's ever gonna be one antidote for power it's it's information it's being able to expose all the dealings and secret organizations like the bilderbergs or to a lesser extent the Bohemian Grove type folks yeah like I think the only thing that sort of mitigates that and diminishes that is everyone knowing about that and more people excuse me know more people know about the bilderbergs now than ever before the Bilderberg Group is like something that well people will say it they don't really know a lot like I'll say it I don't know much about it I know that really important rich people meet and they discuss things and every single person's ever been president has met yeah I said that actually to the secretary-general of the Bilderberg Group when I interviewed him skagle Martin Taylor I said you know you've got so many like up-and-coming politicians who end up being like president or prime minister and he said thank you like he took that as a compliment like you know we're good at start spotting the next and Denis Healey said to me lovely idea yes dust busting and Denis Healey said to me the idea is to get these rising politicians and introduce them to the heads of business and hopefully influence them to be more sensible and more globalist and less less nationalists at the earth pour them out yeah yeah yeah I mean it's a network I mean no question right no question no all these places exist for a reason I take a bit of credit I think you might book them was the first time Bilderberg like was ever discussed in kind of mainstream the mainstream world and then shortly after me this journalist called Charlie Skelton Kaiba long who's another sort of mainstream writer for The Guardian and he goes every year to build a book now and partly a result of him and partly as a result of me suddenly build a book is discussed in the mainstream world but when I went to build a burg and now like loads of people like turned up to protest Bilderberg and so on and they've even got a bit of a website now I think and they certainly admit existing now and they didn't used to they kind of have to right yeah examination thing yeah so that's partly to do with with them and partly to do a Charlie Skelton your book them you know I'm very fascinated by extremists and I'm very fascinated by I'm very fascinated by the spectrum of human thinking and behavior and that we're all kind of terrified of people that are on the far end in one way or another we're terrified of like extreme lefties or a terrified of extreme righties you know did you when did you it was anything like really revealing or unusual about that journey of trying to write that and and in your own mind did you try to like one of things I try to do when I watch like Isis videos or watch like radical fundamentalist Islamic guys talk I tried to imagine myself agreeing with them and being one of them and being happy to be one of them that like you know like there's there's some there's some appeal and some draw to being extremely confident about what you're saying even if what you're saying is absolutely ridiculous like stoning people for homosexuality and you see all of that happening on you know social media yeah which I read about in the new book either you see this kind of joy in approval that mutual approval yes I mean that's what I think it's a problem with Twitter's it's become like a sort of mutual approval machine that we surround ourselves people feel the same way we do we approve each other and that's such a great feeling if anybody gets in the way and says I don't agree with with what you're doing here you feel ferociously angry about them and you scream them out and yeah so I think this kind of mutual approval that goes on and both on social media and also in extremist groups don't you think that people say things a lot of the things they say they say knowing that people are going to approve so they tailor these things in a way they like they lick their finger and put it up in the air and they catch the win like oh the winds going this way I'm going to say something that it puts me on the moral high ground yeah I get a lot of retweets yeah yeah and it's it's it's I I think it's kind of damaging I mean you know like you said before you know I come from a social justice world so I believe in all the things that they believe in I believe in Gammage I believe in all of those things but I at the same time I feel kind of uncomfortable when I feel like there's a kind of ferocious conformity go yes that you have to you have to say it like every time somebody dies you have to I remember one Robin Williams died like I was I was doing a bit of I was promoting some show I was doing or something I'd written and I didn't know Robin Williams had died and so I tweeted like something about some show I was doing and I got like a can of you know 50 people immediately tweeted me basically saying how dare you promote something when you know were all so upset that Robin Williams has just died because I hadn't noticed one was and there's a there's that kind of conformity again the kind of our IP conformity does it everybody has to the our IP and it's all good it's all coming from a good place it's all coming from places there's teaching us how to care and teaching us how to like level but that's not because how do they know that you didn't know or how they are whether or not you knew well I didn't know but but yes really common I mean you can't be expected to be a breast of every single news story especially something like a suicide something that comes on it's not like something you have to pay attention to like you know a military operation that we're all aware of no this is a random celebrity decides to take his life how could you possibly be forced to know about that and I'm the problem is you know like on on social media we see ourselves as non conformist but what this does is create a kind of a fearful conformist world where you have to say what everybody else is saying yeah we're conforming to nonconformity yeah it's like I would see people that were you know they dress like rebels but they dress like the same rebels they're typically unique you know you don't you see someone who's got you know their their hairs dyed pink and you know they don't give a fuck but you don't give a fuck like everybody around you doesn't give a fuck like you're wearing a uniform yeah whether you know it or not you look like someone's going to Catholic school like you might think that you're some sort of a rebel but the real rebels are indistinguishable from everyone else and the way they dress and the way they they look cuz they're just people you know we're there there are no real rebels like all real rebel is just someone who has their own opinion that may or may not go with the standard opinion that we're being supposed to that we're supposed to absorb yeah but the idea of conforming to nonconformity is so ironic though it's like the one thing that you are rallying against is the one thing that you don't even realize you are becoming yeah and it's you know the the the negative byproducts of all of this are a bigot makes people fearful mmm-hmm it makes people shut the fuck up yeah and also what it is it declares war on human nature you know this is the reason why I really wanted to write the public shaming book because I felt like war had been declared on human nature instead of try work out why people transgress you know in a sort of compassionate way it's it just it just destroys people for transgressing and everybody transgress it's every human transgressors and when we so ferociously destroy other people for transgressing we're shutting off really significant realities about humans which is the fact that if we try to understand each other it would make the world more compassionate and we would understand why people transgress for yeah and I think that what we're talking about too is you're not talking about rallying against someone who's committing horrible atrocities someone's committing crimes against humanity torturing people murdering people you know you're talking about differences of opinion yeah I mean some people's transgressions are so serious it deserves to overwhelm them and they deserve to be defined by them and we're all like sort of in commiserating and we're all sort of in agreement we're all sort of bonding together on this like hey like as humans we we're not going to tower this behavior because it's evil yeah yeah yeah but this is all a long way away from the question which was about kind of hanging out in it with extremist groups and so on I mean I discovered some things that I think people would have known at the time and one was that they were all conspiracy theorists you know that was what United the Ku Klux Klan with the Islamic fundamentalist group I hung out with called Al Muhajiroun I spent a year with this Islamic group could hell Mahad sure Russia spent a year with them yeah I became like their their chauffeur they said to me oh my battery their head of the group said to me after a few months like I have let you into my life I've given you much I want something in return so I was like wow and he said what can you drive me to office world photocopying done like crush the pilot state so I've become like it so first up driving him everywhere and yeah that was awkward did you go home did you when you said you were them for a year like no help me only lift like a couple of miles up the road for me up in the morning bye honey I'm gonna go hang out with oh my needs to buy some collection boxes for Hamas and he said needs to be driven to the cash-and-carry no dad that's a very scary organization this was pre 9/11 I me know that most of the stories I've told him like today were from my book them which was pre 9/11 and so less scary like people thought they were ridiculous like no not that much that happened to that stage while I was there with them for the year though I mean all you know now so many like suicide bombers and so on and so many journalists get killed yeah that's I mean that could have been you easily if if you were dealing with a decade later yes or even a couple of I mean one was Daniel Pearl that was pretty good stages of the Iraq war right yeah a thousand two or three so I was only what four years and I was the first one man that was the first one that had the video yeah I remember watching that online against my own better judgment and has been haunted you know you can never get past that one and what's crazy is the one that when it had such an impact and then I've seen oh a few of them since then and they didn't have nearly as much impact it's like slowly but surely you get numb to it you know the first person I've never watched any of these videos but I was in Brooklyn and the taxi driver told me that he watches like all of them I said I've never watched any of their when he said what I said the one you really shouldn't watch Daniel Pearl yeah yeah I haven't watched anything cited a war he meant by that there was a lot of conspiracy theories involving that one as well there was a lot of conspiracy theories that there was that he was killed by the CIA in order to keep people out of there and justify our attacks on Islamic fundamentalists and that they had killed him because he was going to reveal information about all sorts of different shit and there was like a whole video dedicated to describing why these people were not Arabs and that their accent was wrong their size was wrong they were built more like American military people and I mean yeah the conspiracy theories it's a weird thing it's a good are conspiracies no uh I mean you know I got chased away from Bilderberg oh yeah look into Bohemian Grove there are conspiracies and there's also stuff like the operation Northwoods where the Joint Chiefs of Staff had signed that the paper saying they were gonna try to fake attacks on American civilians they were gonna arm Cuban friendlies and attack wonton I'm obey well in order to get us into a war with Cuba I mean so it's not like it hasn't been proposed or it hasn't been even acted out like what happened in the Gulf of Tonkin I mean there are real real conspiracies that actually do happen even in its own little way my book the minister goats kind of proves conspiracies it proves that that they will - in your book sorry to interrupt you but was the difference in your book and the movie okay in the book I mean I never actually went to Iraq the you and MacGregor cut so it's kind of based on me goes to Iraq in the movie in real life I just hung around like military bases in America so Fort Meade and Fort Bragg at the end of the movie Ewan McGregor manages to walk through a wall and I never managed to walk move is counted tongue-in-cheek yeah the books more serious the book the book starts off with the kind of comedy of all of this crazy stuff they were trying out in the 70s and 80s that trying to kill goats just by staring at them trying to learn how to be invisible which by the way laughter after all of the while they adapted they went from invisibility to trying to find a way of not being seen so I'm like that's you know I feel like camouflage no I haven't I'm gonna interview this guy who was a military guy that was working on their remote viewing yeah who who was that I would have probably met with December's name he would psychically spied the lock best months not that's not soon determined that it was the dinosaurs ghosts a dinosaurs ghosts yeah was that one he really said yeah he character whore yeah who show me pictures of his hot girlfriend yeah he was one of the main that Dame's chomik monocle like all of these real-life stories a lot Russian way over his head dude his baton way over said so I met me remove you Det yeah I tell you what there being a black op military psychic spy isn't as glamorous as it sounds very stressful stressful plus you've got biggie black ops you've got no like budget you've got no car you can't you don't you know a lot of coffee machine you have to bring your own coffee and to work yeah a couple of the remote viewers told me how annoyed they were that because they were black up they had to bring their own coffee into work plus what does it actually mean to be a psychic spy working for the US military what it actually means that flat for 20 years you go into some room at Fort Meade and try and be psychic there's kind of a shit job yeah I interviewed another guy I forget his name but we actually tried it out and we tried to Remote View things did he did he get any luck no it was me and this guy DJ Grothe who's a oh yeah he's got the Randy guy yeah yeah yeah he's a dabangg kareena skeptic and he and I were on the same page or like you know we came up with some random shapes we're supposed to envision this area and then we went to the area and he was trying to find hits and I'm like man I mean you're talking like angles and like you fucking anywhere you go that's man-made you're gonna find angles that are similar to this and you know we picked out a few colors that were you know like super common you find those colors you know you get some really lucky hits but think about all the shit that we were wrong with and he's all about like it's just don't think too much just you know let it come to you let it come you supposed to scribble shit down and yeah it's so mind-blowing lead um and the Edie dames guy was telling me that they had actually had found Osama I think was Osama bin Laden he was saying sorry for can't remember correctly because I was all nonsense to me at the time yeah but they didn't go after him because they didn't want to win the war they didn't want the war and because the people had a vested interest in keeping the war going and that was sort of his idea behind why this remote-viewing wasn't successful but he was citing all these different instances where remote viewing was successful yeah yeah I remember one time they were looking for Noriega in general Noriega and the remote viewers were like called in to find one of the remote viewers there might have been a domes actually one of the remote viewers psychically divined that Angela Lansbury knew where Noriega was oh that bitch yeah for the Lancefield up what I discovered though if it just been remote viewing I wouldn't have wanted to have written a minister at goats because I found the remote viewing thing a bit boring but then what I discovered just to asking people was that was all this other shit going on like they were try to fast for a month try to burst clouds just by pointing at them try to kill goats just by staring at them and and and that stuff was so fun to me and and then I discovered after like a year of like interviewing these guys I discovered that like there was a line I'm in a really crooked line but a lied nonetheless between somebody's crazy endeavors in the 1970s and 80s and some of the kind of exotic and interrogation techniques that were happening at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib so in the book because because some of the same people like there was a colonel called John Alexander who was involved in like exotic you know sound blasting and all the non-lethal weapons and he's a guy should have on his shirt he's incredible guy so the men who stare at goats the book sort of starts funny and gets dark where's the movie kind of stayed funny and and kind of didn't go into the darkness in that way how much money they spent on that remote viewing thing there were 120 million dollars I think twenty million dollars was there any one piece of evidence that they could point to that was like no every so often like a unit would get sick of it like it was being run by the I don't know the the DEA or you know the US Army or military intelligence and then they'd get sick of it and then they'd remote-viewing right it's a Ted Danes okay that's on him no it's his website yeah he's older gentleman that it ended up back with the CIA in 1995 the CIA's greatest weapon has the power to change your life forever oh so now you're using it like and look they have a live support gal look she's pretty to need live support calls pretty girl well they have an angry black guy who could beat your ass nope pretty white girl is that funny it's like welcoming I'm smiling at you my have beautiful eyes do you need life support call me sugar I'll show you how to find your dog here's something interesting you know the guy the first guy who ran the remote viewers back in the very earliest days of remote viewing was a guy called Sidney Gottlieb and he was the same guy who ran MKULTRA in 30 days like so all the kind of poisoning people where spike in people's drinks with LSD going off to Cuba to try and assassinate Castro by putting like a bomb in his cigar or poisoning his wetsuit so all this really dark CIA shit that was happening in the 50s was run by this guy Sidney Gottlieb and he was the same guy who run the remote viewers in the 70s I was that was kind of interesting that is interesting yeah well without a doubt they've definitely experimented on people to try to find out whether or not they could control them that's honor oh no question there's the south of operation could artichoke I became friends with Eric Olsen whose father was Franco said who's the guy who purportedly was given LSD by the CIA and then jumps out of a window in New York and killed himself do you know that Ted Kaczynski was a part of the Harvard studies on LSD oh really yeah there was a german documentary called the net that sort of highlighted this and it was all about his participation in the LSD studies and how it pushed him off the rails right and then he went fucking crazy and went it went off to teach at Berkeley saved all his money from teaching and then went to liver the woods okay and Kenneth didn't Ken Kesey cos LSD I do I do not know if that's the case maybe he might have been but the Kosinski thing is pretty well documented that he was a part of those studies but and you know I mean I have a friend whose sister is out of her fucking mind she went on a couple LSD trips and took way too much and to this day that was like 7 years ago to this day she's all fucked up hmm so it can happen especially if you have if you're mentally unstable to begin with and you get dosed and spiked you know it's totally possible yeah I mean people that have a slippery grip on reality any really traumatic experience and any real anything that's like super perturbing to your state of consciousness has the potential to set you off the rails in a way that you might not be able to recover from I mean it is possible yeah and they did a lot of LSD with people I know it's worse shit than that there was this thing called artichoke where they were like experimenting and I believe this has all been verified they're experimenting in in getting people hooked on how and and then withdrawing the heroin and making them do cold turkey as a means of getting information out of them Wow yeah and that was like related to MKULTRA I mean yeah you talked about can some conspiracies being true MKULTRA is a conspiracy that was true yeah there's plenty of those that are true I mean when look especially when you're dealing with the Cold War and this terror phul terror terrible thought that the Soviet Union was ready to drop bombs and your children any day of the week and that they're doing things like this and that you know the Nazis had been doing things like this and we know about all the experiments that the Japanese it did and The Rape of Nanking and the horrible things that the Nazis had done yeah to the the prisoners of war I mean I learned some American didn't MKULTRA start or in the early days of MKULTRA some Americans were some American soldiers were kidnapped by the Koreans and then they were seen on TV like said we renounce America and they would try to work out like how the Koreans I and my memories really sketched on us but then they're try to work out like how the Koreans have managed to brainwash these three American servicemen so easily and that was one of the reasons why they started MKULTRA I might be getting confused well that's one of the reasons why I wanted to ask you about your work with extremists because I always won like is it appealing like when you're mean obviously you're not a white supremacist or an Islamic fundamentalist or anything but when you're with them for a long period of time when you're embedded is there any to draw is there any somehow or another is there any pull towards like thinking an inclination is there an attraction to either ideology oh you know not never to their ideology but what I did always like like throughout my writing career the times I'm at my happiest time so I think a story is really working is when something shifts in me like I spend so much time with conspiracy theorists and then suddenly I'm being chased by the Bilderberg Group and I go fucking nuts and like I've become like paranoid and that's what I know like at the bottom of my brain I know that like what's happening to me is terrifying but the fact that I've gone through this really big change means it's going to be a really fucking good piece of writing and that happened in them and it happened in the psychopathy test to actually there I became completely drunk with my psychopathy spotting powers like I went on a course to learn how to spot Psychopaths and I got so drunk with my psychopathy spotting powers that I changed and like my friends were saying to me like you've really changed Peter stone who wrote the screenplay for the monastery at goats told me he was concerned about me because I was so convinced I could spot high-fives everywhere what do you look for well yeah nuances of language the first half of my book the psychopathy test so it teaches people a despot psychopath and then the second half becomes like a cautionary tale to not get so fucking drunk with your powers that it turns you a little bit psychopathic but like nuances of language you know there's a like a twenty point checklist but where it all comes from lack of empathy lack of remorse I I went I started meeting like CEOs and and doing the psychopathy checklist on them to see if it's true that you have you're more likely to find psychopathy at the top of the tree than the bottom I'll give you one example is that true yeah I think that is true I think you are more likely to find Psychopaths that they're at the top of the trees and at the bottom because capitalism will Ward's psychopathic behavior but isn't the definition to that a psychopath is someone that has power whereas a sociopath or someone like there's some sort of a you know the whole cycle it's so super thing there's a library yeah there's a loner to pay out there is - and different psychiatrists and psychologists will use the terms like I mean the upshot is that I don't think there's any real difference some people will say there's a difference because they'll bring their own sort of analyses to the situation but but in general you're talking about a kind of a lack of empathy a neurological lack of empathy whether it's neurological or whether it's through childhood abuse that's another big matter of debate amongst those people but but I'll give you a cat a classic example from the book I went to meet this Haitian dictator called Toto constant in jail in upstate New York I'd met him a few times before but I met him in jail and he kept on saying to me I want people to like me like I really want people to like me he kept on saying that to me so finally I said to him isn't that a weakness like wanting people to like you it wasn't that a weakness and he said no no no it's not a weakness because if you can get people to like you you can manipulate them to do whatever you want them to do whoa yeah so I said so were you the sort of person who doesn't really feel like empathy and he said no no empathy is a weakness so thatthat said well that's clearly telltale I've I've I guess he figured like fucking I'm in jail it's not to kill either like I'm not getting out of here I also sometimes they're like like I said this would all KGB spy I'm at one time like I said will you a bully at school and he said yes yes yes I was a bully he said it was English he said I would get up from behind a tree and I had to have it like my bag would have bricks nests and I've hit somebody over the head Jesus Christ yeah and I said he said but I don't get the bullies I'd only get the bullies so I said and how did you feel about that and he said I felt good and I said and how did he feel now like all these years later looking back on it how do you feel now and he said I still feel good and I said so you're not the sort of person who feels empathy and he said you've really got to the nub of what kind of crank I am he said when a dog dies like one of my dogs dies I feel incredibly upset or I cry but the human beings that I've hurt and killed don't feel oh yeah so if you can get them being honest about their absence of empathy I don't want to hear that I do what I don't I mean I do but I don't want to know they're around man yeah there's something disturbing about someone who's just not willing to ever join the community you know they live amongst you and they're just trying to yeah pray that we'll see the world in terms of predators and prey and it would be foolish not to exploit weaknesses yeah you know I think there really asks I could pass out that there was some people yeah that's I think a lot of people there the one thing I don't like about the sort of psychopaths sporting world is that they they're not interested to a large extent and what turned somebody that way because they're just really interested in the idea that there is another species out there that's just this other species there aren't quite human they look human but then it's kind of like Dave Larkin the lizards right there's people out there who've adopted human form but they're not quite human right but I'm really interested there's his other psychiatrist I met called James Gilligan who basically says all violence is an attempt to replace shame with self-esteem so these people were like so battered during their childhood so humiliated so abused that they try and regain some self esteem by committing violence onto other people mm-hmm all violence I don't like oh I don't like statements that are so absolute it is a big statement right but as a kind of humanist I like that because it's giving some humanity back to violent people it's saying you know this is you know it comes from a place of damage whereas the psychopath spotters will basically say no no they're just look they're like another species okay yeah you know what I think that's honestly I think this truth in both camps well I think there's certainly some people that are like that and there's some people that are violent just because they're angry at stupidity are they angry at aggression or they're they just need some release in their life and there they're bent down with all sorts of stress and they can't handle it and they don't have an outlet yeah you know there's a lot of people that just they're lacking an outlet and I liken them to overflowing batteries like a battery that like I think of a human body as your human body is designed to exert a certain amount of effort to put forth a certain amount of energy during the day and most people don't even remotely tap into their reserve of energy they sit down in their body you know just conforms to their office chair and they're there all day and at the end of the day they sit in their car or they sit on the bus or the train and they'd make their way home in which case they sit on a couch and they sit in front of the television and their body just is constantly storing up stress and it has this desire to exert energy and it's never met with what it needs it never it never has its needs fulfilled fulfilled and so then you're in your car and you're in traffic it's someone cuts you off you know you fucking piece of shit you have this unbelievably angry response because your battery is essentially found that you there's an opening you know it's like a hole in up water balloon should water just start squirting out of it it can't help it it's like so bent up with or pent-up with pressure and if you instead of doing that to somebody in another car who can't a you if you can go home and he do it on social media everybody hears you including that person and it can really damage them yeah well there's certainly you keep coming back to that so it's any kisses from books on your mind for a while hey do you mind if I go no this is a great conversation I really enjoy I'm so glad that we did this because as I say for years people live like oh my god you could have gone true I think we could have a hundred of these any time you're back when are you back come around la face yeah my son's thinking about moving here so yes okay great if he does I'm not gonna fucking leave I can't be on another city to my son I hear you yeah okay beautiful man well definitely either way one way or another when you're back at town let's do this again I've really really enjoyed it I've written and so your most recent book is so you've been public we shamed and I'm sure it's available everywhere right like Amazon and all that jazz all that good stuff and
