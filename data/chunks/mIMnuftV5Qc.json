people and for sure they got so heavy they're strong oh yeah strong mountains strong lead yeah yeah now you have that here that - oh we didn't elevate you have a lack of strong weak mm-hmm in fact sometimes the week is too strong you know I figure we were Oh Canada no England England we have some lead in England I was like this is a really good week it's not too strong it's like I don't feel like I wanna roll kick like roller skates the pie was it hash know whose it was weed but it was like it wasn't like you know some California weed is so hard it's so stony it's so powerful that you sound and I'm just like you get hit with any like whoa I got to manage this yeah your mind it becomes a job yeah it's like but whereas with this weed it was like silly weed like you you hit it you felt I you felt good but you didn't feel too fucked up and it took like four hits not to like - it's a california week it's also you adjusting to a different atmosphere yeah yeah yeah and England man

need to do it like once a month I'd love to keep tit keep figuring out a way to avoid this this is what we have to do it to do a steady one of these in life because I think one a month is perfect for us to have shitload things that we haven't talked to write about ya know because we talked so much about on the phone about things and we teach other clubs about things that sometimes a lot of stuff gets like tread to the point where we can't bring it up organically in front of each other anymore we've already talked about right what you're talking about on the podcast doesn't come out seamlessly so we have like one month between podcast we'd build up a lot good shit yeah we do it's good you has been a months until about right you know I might yeah I've been fucking around with this bit why I can't tell them but I can't tell you it's not ready yet I'll tell you after we're done with this you can't know yet someday you're gonna be it's gonna be a good bit it's doing really well right now

much like Boston was at one point Tom a great comment town and now is a little bit deprived you know there's not that much there anymore there's a few clubs have died off not to make comics coming out of Chicago you know when kids start out there they try to get out of there and go somewhere where the scene yeah you know there's a few scenes left in the country Denver's in my opinion one of the big ones underrated underrated underappreciated scene Oh Denver is fucking great you know what else has got a good scene in Atlanta believe yes you're fucking great see I'm just gonna see Marshall Giles

said god that's a duffle bag that's our that's our fanny packs that sura makes a hemp gear they make a hemp key that i wear as well and they've decided to make a hemp fanny pack but it's so big it's like a backpack that's yeah I use it a camera I use it for a camera bag only that's pretty fuckin killer though I'm gonna use it for traveling I think cuz it's tough it's like strong will help is amazing material man I mean I really should have made my t-shirt that I have but it would have been even more expensive than the ones that I have now I like the highest the higher primate sure it's highest quality cotton I could get and really thin light con so it's like real comfortable but people were like make hemp shirts that probably is the move his happens to superior form of cloth yes much stronger I like him shirts t-shirts my have a hep key man shrunk like crazy holy shit bamboos another good one too this is really easy to grow yeah you can get really good bamboo like sheets your bed sheets yeah using this for a long time also towels rugs I spent the naturally antimicrobial as well so really in him bamboo grows fast as fuck yeah it's not a show about them taking bamboo and using it to make houses because you chop it up and you know use the fibers up and they make a cardboard or a plywood out of this bamboo fiber but it grows like nothing it's all of you can almost walk yeah what a nutty fucking plant and they use it for rum occasionally you use it for pool cues as well some guys have been doing that recently because the the strength of bamboo compared to strength of other woods it's like through the roof yeah on that kind of man yeah vertical line apparently you have to splice it and compile it when you make a pool cue dirt but it has like a fucking like a crazy hit to it like that like extra spring to it you know I would just why make sense we're about to do some manly shit right now play pool Brian played to pull with me a couple times but since that he's learned that it considers poo and I consider pool two totally different things right Brian yes what's the difference you're addicted yeah you just you're you're hardcore about it like you do a hundred games and a night where I'm used to like hey we'll just have some beer play a couple games for pool you know at the bar you're like let's play a hundred games and let's beat it four five eight Toledo doesn't even lock into about game 7-7 that's it he gets loosen up and you're in fucking trouble I got a steal a few games early otherwise it's gonna be a bad night hallo and here's my wife my wife has

I'll just still it was a bit eighty percent average can't worry about what you look like your photos don't worry about what you actually look like you know right okay if you look good in real life and they got a picture you like run guys don't care like Brian there's a million pictures of you right how many photos of you are there the fans that would give us the faith love it literally thousands that's not going on now I stop it you stop maybe so get too much and then I just found myself always doing it when I was around jezic and I was like alright people just ask for it though people do ask for that's for what the fisheye video no them good the buff I got this dude in behind and everyone wants this video so I did always get behind and ruin the pictures and you probably like a thousand

sorry growing podcast I'm gonna start my own podcast that's way too smart thanks for next week next week next week we're doing it and you're my first quiz ok what it was gonna be called it's gonna be called the questions with Brian the questions with bryan callen shark same questions I'm gonna ask his questions and it's gonna be all kinda be in the beginning Bryan Callen questions Ryan Callen yeah make you your neighbors importance okay Bryan Callens questions that's good that's over there Brian Collins they're really beautiful it's we just got we just got my $5 your name is on the front of it that's really important yeah people know who the fuck you are right yeah well you've been take teaching me about I'm so lazy with that stuff but it's important because you know you want to get your it's it's fun to get an audience's connection with those feet yeah so you know not just the podcast but Twitter all that stuff you know you're interacting with people regular basis and people really appreciate it which is surprising me I had no idea that so many people listened to your podcast and I do that when I do the show and people come up to me and they and they they thank me here they say I listen you on the Rogan podcast it's a powerful medium you know it's amazing we never had anything like it before I mean in human history as far as we know right the idea that you can just have a pirate radio show and it's legal for now always me talking about that how long how long before it's illegal Brian SOPA hears you think so motherfuckers diggin IRC hacks we're getting yeah we got to get bigger and bigger to the point where they can't stop it the ceiling hope there'll get big enough to the point where when it rolls around it's too big to stop there you go I mean that's exactly right you've got it you've got to figure out they want to pass legislation you're going to make the problem better probably not well there's also people that are interested in launching their own satellites for communication and for internet if they shut down the internet there's private companies that are talking about the Tesla guy in fact who started PayPal he has a company that launches private satellites yeah they're gonna come up with a way to keep the internet going no matter what at this point in time there's too many companies like like Google's anti-sopa right aren't ya yeah I mean come on man if Google anti so easy for that is also because you can technically under that law hold them accountable for fraud other things in there like yeah and my website was essentially have to shut down I couldn't you know I couldn't keep all those torrid streams yeah by the way we've done just fine without government intervention okay listen we know just fine so we don't need we don't need a yet another group of government laws it's so gross everything is goings not regulated nowadays a stand-up comedy and fucking yeah that's it yeah this is not much is not much that makes sense anymore it's we're in a real weird time where they're they're scrambling like you said 40,000 laws they passed last year human beings figure themselves out they can we can we can get along well you know and by the way one of the other things is that that human beings actually in even primates are very good at cooperation and working together like we said there's always going to be people who do the wrong thing but for the most part if you look at the way societies work and you look at the way people actually behave in in catastrophes like tsunamis and things they don't panic and run in the streets they actually work together and help each other they get very calm and they start helping each other and they become very communal I know that's that's that a social that's how we've survived through the millennia by cooperating with each other by forming societies by forming rules for those societies and we didn't need these huge central bodies organizing and running us and sucking and strapping the money from the system you twats yeah right exactly I see half my money won love bitches death squad
