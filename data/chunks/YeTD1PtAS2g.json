the gyro can experience what is that a law about obscenity how do you define obscenity that was the that's the question in a lot of trials right well community standards and this is why it's it's in trouble and by the way I would love to know we're all like the fuckin libertarian political organizations were when max hardcore went to jail for four years because they nailed them when he when he mailed stuff to fucking Tampa Florida stinkers type of stuff and they trapped him and got him on some obscene community standards thing but wait wait wait where's everybody sticking up for max hardcore this guy did four years for adult pornography it's fuckin adults there was no children it seems really strange that you could have something that is not illegal that is obviously it's marketable I mean whether or not it's healthy to watch that kind of shit it's obviously people are watching it and there is always that argument that certain types of depravity keeps people from committing things in the real life that they can get through it some sort of a fantasy form and it keeps them from being a creep or a violent person in their real life and if someone signs a fucking waiver man at what where do you cross the line where do you decide that this is something that this guy needs to get locked in a cage for because you don't agree well the whole country is full of shit when it comes to free speech and free thought because all of us and I mean both I should say all ideologies liberal and conservative have an asterisk like you're free to say this and do this as long as you and for the Liberals it's what they call hate speech and anything that's racial or homophobia and for the conservatives it's hey don't fuck with God and country but both sides are equally phony when it comes to like when's the last time like you know a feminist stuck up for a guy who said something about women that was unpleasant because he has the right to say it never like where were all these people when Tracy Morgan said what he said why did nobody who didn't like him stick up for oh yeah I think this is just like they don't have that much of resources so it's not like they can jump into the fray for any little situation they don't have that much time when you're running some sort of an organization that's looking for violence against women or anything but but you don't have you have to look and concentrate only on that I don't fault them for going after you know or not going after cases where guys like Tracy Morgan got busted or now they only have a certain amount of things they want to concentrate on well no I mean I fault after him because I he's like why don't like when people went after him why didn't they just stick up for him and go we don't like what he said but he's got the right to say it there should be no penalty for it that's what I mean and none of these groups which would take them two seconds to put out that fucking memo but GLAAD has never done it none of them have done it no they know they don't devote any resources to helping anybody else out they develop resources to pushing their ideology and their ideology is that this guy needs to be punished right because if he's punished and it costs him a lot of money then people are gonna stop thinking like that right I'm gonna stop expressing themselves like that which I can see their point up to a certain point well you got to realize like if is it okay with the where does this where does this where's this line happen is it okay for Denzel Washington to play a murderer and a gangster in a movie it is right okay why is it not okay for Tracy Morgan to portray a guy who's pretending that he would stab his son if he was gay right because he's not telling the truth he's - he's obviously doing a character that is like completely over-the-top and says ridiculous shit all the time that is that's his stick I'll by the way I was incorrectly I apologize you just straighten me out when I said the women's groups I should have said the gay groups I was thinking that with Tracy said something that was anti woman I forgot that it was that I actually forgot the conflict I'm saying why doesn't the group who so you say in the gay dudes are women all the great ones are I mean let's be honest who hasn't seen a transsexual and fall in love come on it's an open society folks yeah I think Tracy got a you people have to understand that there's people that want to see him do that you might not like it but it's like dice I love dice I've always loved dice I want to see him go fucking bananas it's a form of entertainment if he does it about Italians which I am I will I will laugh I will laugh along with it because I know you know if he's making fun of us it's it's mostly true shit right you know but for whatever reason some people want to pretend that you know some of his ridiculous over-the-top stereotypes aren't funny it's like it's it's a cruel arias character is character fucking hates that right now I love it it's great entertainment you don't swallow my load you chew it who takes that seriously why would you be angry this guy why I mean it's this is just this entertainment it's comedy and it's a it's a valid form of comedy and this is where it gets weird it's like when when a guy's creating art and believe it or not Tracy Morgan's creating fucking art when he gets on stage and he does stand-up you he's not trying to fucking piss people off he's just going with this is a one of this is one of the styles of comedy you say completely outrageous shit we all know guys who would sit like Brian Holtzman is one of my perfect examples you know Brian sure I'm Jimmy yeah he did a joke about Susan Smith after after Susan Smith got caught drowning sure sure he goes on stage like two days later he goes hey Susan Smith case is she drawn to kids yeah I heard those who've had kids I heard they sat that close to the TV they always spilt their fucking milk they don't put away their blocks those kids will not be missed and we were laughing and gagging the whole audience it was a combination of laughs and gasps and that's a valid piece of art sure that's a valid piece of art he doesn't really mean that right he hasn't if he had to choose he would say yes please go back in time and stop her before she dies our children he's a character he's playing a crazy accentuated character he gets into a zone and he does this this thing on stage and he sounds like really offensive shit and it's fucking funny and I enjoy it it's art or even when you're just being yourself and exploring a ridiculous dry set but we never people never stick up for that and the same people that would defend Mapplethorpe or any other form of art piss Christ in a jar are the same is the same mentality that will attack Tracy or that will attack a I miss what he said are Michael Richards it's a fraudulent stance and and every side does it it drives me fucking crazy I think there's yeah his because people have this idea a lot of people I should say have this idea that if you don't agree with them you're wrong and you're you're you're if you're you're against them you don't it's not like you can enjoy different things or have different ideas about different standards of living and what you shouldn't shouldn't be able to do no it's not that it's if you don't agree you're wrong and people have to understand that different people like different shit right you can't force someone to not like porn you can't force someone to say you're not gay you know you cannot be gay we're not all you can't do that it doesn't work like you have to let people do whatever the fuck they want to do and then you just gotta kind of accept that that's them and I wish a lot of these phony artists like a nice a phony like it mean meaning singers I think that they're hip by attacking Christianity like I have no prophet at Christianity fucking sure it's right there but it's like none of them address Islam none of them address the fact that they're afraid to attack is and that's what drives me crazy because it's if this fucking fake edge it's that it's this fucking fake I'm being dangerous but it's really they're looking both ways before they cross the street and they're acting like they just bolted out the front door and it fucking drives me it drives me nuts yeah it's there's a certain amount of posturing that people people get into when they start talking about certain political issues and certain things certain ideologies and it gets to like that gross place where people just start clapping and you can tell they're disingenuous and it just they're milking off this thing for their own ego they're milking off this reality for their own ego instead of just sort of trying to you know trying to look at the big picture because the the big you mean what you're absolutely right why doesn't anybody want to make fun of Islam I'll tell you why because they'll fucking kill you yeah they took shit to an entirely different place and so anybody who wants to pretend to be edgy it doesn't involve going that far i mocked them but I mean I can't careful where I put the joke I'm not an idiot you know crazy no you right now just admit it to self-censorship for the same things you just find it more reasonable because you say that your take on it is well I you know I'll take it back a little bit you know as far as I'm sure but you are clearly saying that you wouldn't say what you normally would want to say because they're dangerous sure but I will say that that's why I'm not saying it it's not amazing yeah it's a terrifying thing in 2012 that we still have a faction of our world that you have to literally can't draw their guy but I also won't say other things on stage for fear like you know I mean it's like you know niggers a rough word to pull off you better have a reason yes before you say that on stage you can't just go out and I would never say that somebody right um but it's like every everything has lines and stuff and reasons I don't say it and I do self-censor and I think we all do as comics you have to we're not crazy I'm sure but I never want people penalized when they don't that's the difference yeah well it's no it is already what the fuck son
