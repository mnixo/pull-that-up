the gyro can experience you've um you've kicked the green bitch yes yes after a 24-year intense relationship with the Green Goddess or the green bitch depending on what mood she's in I had to stop and I've come in for some I've come in for some some criticism for this and and I feel it's important to say that I hugely value and love cannabis I think it's a wonderful herbal ally and I think that I don't think that I would ever have written my books of historical mystery if I had not encountered cannabis rather late in life I did not smoke any dope until I was 37 years old and I'm now 62 Wow and roughly rad about the age of 38 that's when I started getting into historical mysteries course it's total stoner stuff before that it was all curved affairs you know right so but suddenly something opened up for me and I'm very and I'm very grateful to the herb for that and initially my real again I need to emphasize this I think the problem I eventually ended up having with cannabis it's not the fault of cannabis it's the fault of Graham Hancock I think my relationship became abusive with the herb it was not initially initially it was something I would do evenings and weekends I would not try to write while I was actually stoned I would do my day's work and then chill out in the evening with a pipe or a joint that was that was high was for me for quite a while and I went through my first big historical mystery book the sign and the seal which was published in 1992 with that pattern in other words that I would be I would be smoking only after I downed tools at the end of the evening and I was ready to chill hmm and that worked fine but then when I started when I started writing fingerprints of the Gods which was the biggest book I've ever done a five million copy bestseller all around the world when I started writing that I thought I'll experiment let's see if I can be stoned and write and I discovered that I could I could bestow that right and I like being stuff so much that in a way it urged me to just write all the time you know because then I had this I had this incredibly good reason to be stoned all the time and took away all the physical boredom of sitting there in my chair in front of my computer screen just everything went away and I went and drifted into this space where I could explore ideas and manifest those ideas down down on the page and I literally that's when I began what was to become ultimately an abusive relationship with cannabis was that I would fire up in those days my joint or my pipe at 9:00 or 10:00 in the morning and I would I'm a hard worker I work 16 hours a day very often when I'm writing so come two o'clock the next morning I'd still be there smoking away and as the years went by this became a permanent daily pattern for me whether I was writing or not I would be stoned from the moment I got up until the moment I went to bed and most people who came by my house or talked to me on the phone they would have had absolutely no idea because I was I was completely in control I didn't seem high I could hold a rational conversation I was I was just fine and I just felt I just felt really good and this is how it went on for many years and later on about in the early to that round about 2005 actually I think perhaps a little earlier one of my kids told me that you know this stuff the smoke is you don't need to have combustion products why don't you use a vaporizer so I bought myself a volcano on the internet and and and then I heard that the British government was going to ban the use of ban old peripherals so I bought myself two more volcanoes volcanoes are quite expensive but that shows how dedicated I was make sure you cover your bases I had to make sure that I covered my bases and then I would be vaporizing from 9:00 in the morning until 2:00 o'clock the next morning seven days a weekend and increasingly strong strains and this is one thing that I would say if we lived in a regime an irrational regime where there was no attempt by the government to police our states of consciousness we could have much more choice in the kind of cannabis we get hold of for example I would have liked to have canvas with much more CBD and maybe less th see when the varieties I was smoking were very very th THC loaded that's the difference in effect well okay I mean there depends how much you buy into the research on this but but the a lot of good science has been done and the suggestion is that THC can promote or reveal I don't want to I don't want to blame the herb for anything I it can reveal certain psychotic tendencies in oneself hmm and this is the well-known paranoia which which many people associate with with smoking cannabis the CBD is an anti-psychotic agent so the natural herb is balanced with CBD and THC and and it looks after you very well but where we go into intensive reading of the herb focusing on the element that makes you really high which is the THC then we get get a herb that is somewhat unbalanced as a result of the interference of humanity and and and but you get more bang for your buck you know that's a very that's a very strong herb and and I began to like a particular variety called cheese I think it's called cheese because it smells like you know old socks or Stilton you know like a blue cheese mhm and I found a grower who lived local to me who was just having amazing green fingers and and I would I would buy from him and and I would sometimes have you know five or six ounces of the herb in my house because I was blazing through this stuff at a tremendous at a tremendous rate that's enough to you you could get in trouble well that's it so that so that's where the paranoia starts to become legitimate you know because actually they can no they can't break down your door and they can confiscate your home and take away your liberty and fuck you up forever you know they can do that and and so every time I heard a ring at the door or you know a Carl came up the street I would I would you know get paranoid get paranoid and you were high so that was high did you get paranoid when you were high well this is one of the reasons why look what happened to me was that run about 2003 I started for reasons of research initially working with ayahuasca the the vine of souls this is the the powerful psychedelic brew which has been consumed by shamanistic cultures in the Amazon for thousands and thousands of years and it's not called the vine of souls for nothing it's a it's it's an extraordinary portal into other realms and and in some ways those realms are associated with death and perhaps what waits for us after death nobody knows the answer to that but in ayahuasca you have certain experiences relating to that and right from the beginning when I started to drink ayahuasca I mean this sounds nuts to anybody who hasn't done DMT or who hasn't drunk ayahuasca but you do meet intelligent entities and more and more around the world people drinking ayahuasca are meeting this goddess figure she might appear as a serpent she might appear as a woman she might appear as some kind of panther or Jaguar very powerful tough love kind of lady who reveals to you the truth about yourself and just says you know you fucking deal with it because that's how you are and and what the truth that was revealed to me from quite early on was my relationship with cannabis had got out of balance and I needed to get it back into balance and of course I ignored those messages completely because I was so I was so much in love with my cannabis relationship my wife said that really it was like a head of mistress you know who I spend all my time with was the cat was the cannabis rather than rather than her and this went on for many many years now the paranoia aspect okay I'm going to bare my heart here and you know I believe in being honest the paranoia aspect began to affect my relationship with my beloved partner Santha who I just loved from the bottom of my heart and she is that the best the most the most pure hearted generous spirited loving lady it's possible to possible to imagine but I started to develop all kinds of suspicions about her which were completely groundless I started to imagine all sorts of stuff going on and then I started to act up act towards her as though those suspicions were real and all of this was also related to my consumption of cannabis it was not caused by my consumption of cannabis I think this is a latent aspect of my own personality it was being revealed by this over abuse of of the of the cannabis herb and and therefore I was making my beautiful partner's life a misery sometimes not everyday but sometimes and she was patiently putting up with this but she was suffering and we went down to Brazil in October 2011 and if I had been told when we got on that plane and went down to Brazil that when I came back two weeks later I would probably never smoke cannabis again I would have laughed in the face of the person who told me that but the encounters that I had with the spirit of ayahuasca whatever that is I'm willing to accept that there is no spirit of ayahuasca that it's all something we generate out of our brains but for me she manifests as a real like a goddess and the encounters I had with that and I do think she's real that's just my personal belief system right and those encounters that I had were incredibly powerful and she took me to a place that was something like hell and she took me to a place that was something like the judgment scene in the ancient Egyptian religion now the judgment scene is a place where your heart is weighed in the scales against the feather of truth and harmony and cosmic justice and you do not want your heart to be heavy in those scales you want to be able to look back on your life and say I did good I did not add to the misery in the world I did something worthwhile with this incredible gift of life that the universe gave me and and everything you've done every second every minute of your life is completely transparent every thought every action everything you did from the moment you became conscious until the moment of your death is laid out before you and there's no hiding from it like we great at creating illusions about our own behavior and persuading ourselves that we're behaving just fine in the judgement Hall of Osiris which is also called the Hall of Mart where the scene takes place all of that stripped away and you confront the truth and I was put there and I confronted the truth about myself and I saw the way that I was behaving towards my partner and and and I was shown that that this had to stop otherwise otherwise I was going to pay a huge price for it and it I had a series of terrifying terrifying experiences which my partner santa-santa the shared with me because we were drinking ayahuasca together and at a certain point entities came to her and and she had the experience of her heart being pulled out of her chest and the entity said to her and she thought she was going to die and the entity said to her we're gonna do this to you to teach grammar lesson and Santa communicated that to me and I would rank that as probably the single most terrifying night of my entire life and I've had some terrifying nights that was just absolutely scared rigid and I and I came out of that with a feeling a very clear feeling inner in ayahuasca we have sharings the next day after you've drunk the brew you share with the rest of the group who you've drunk with the experiences you had the night before as much as you want to share and what I shared because I still didn't believe that I could stop smoking cannabis what I shared was that I was going to change my relationship with cannabis and and to get to a place where cannabis was serving me again rather than me serving her and and that's what I believed but when I got back to England long flight what's the first thing I do I get out my vaporizer get out my stash fire up the vaporizer and feel a nice bag of of vapor you said it's sort of surgical well I miss it I miss it you know this was a cannabis is such a beautiful sensual Ally if she's used right do you think it's just an imbalance issue with the CBD THC ratio let me let me just let me just finish with water with what happened to me so I fill up the bag and I'm down there in my basement and I take the first and I take the first draw and I'm suddenly filled with the most intense feelings of horror and loathing and it is exactly like I'm back in that space that ayahuasca took me to and I try a second puff and I can't do it I physically could not continue I I knew that I just I just could not continue I expressed the vapor out of the i crumpled up the bag i put it away and the next day i got rid of several ounces of cannabis yeah I know I know it's terrible it's a terrible thing to do but but but for me it was the right thing to do 24 years non-stop relationship with cannabis definitely abusing the herb I had got to the point where the only rational course of action was what I was shown in ayahuasca which was to stop and I don't know whether it was because there was way too much THC and not enough CBD or whether it was just me not being responsible for my own behavior I go I go around you know saying that I believe in adult responsibility and I do but I don't think I was being responsible I don't think I was using the herb in a responsible way I don't think I was using it in a respectful way and I paid a price for that
