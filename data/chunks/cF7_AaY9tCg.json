quarantine baby how you holding up didn't throw man he weirded out are just accepting it I'm accepting it and I'm trying to stay positive I send you guys all the positive stats I get well I know several people that have gotten and gotten over it the worse was Michael yo and I need to confirm this with Michael but I'm pretty sure Michael had a cold and then caught the corona and then got pneumonia Jesus good he got it real bad he's been hospitalized for a week his post jumped me up she is yes and you seem coffin while he's doing it yeah he's such a good guy it's the nicest guy he's the nicest guy we lost him at B fuck the be ashame devastating I know people that have gotten it gotten over it not much of a problem you know and they they just felt like shit for a couple days then they're fine but that's the majority of people John I know people get upset when I say that it's true though it's true though those are the numbers you know joy the people get it and they're fine yeah what I'm hoping is they come up with with a legitimate treatment where it's like this is confirmed that if you take hydroxychloroquine you know with Z they say something like that this is confirmed if they say we got to cover folks we no longer have to worry about people dying to coronavirus you just catch it real early sort of like Tamiflu or some other things that look staff used to fucking kill the shit out of people tongue you know killed a lot of people infections killed a lot of fucking people now they give you antibiotics I mean imagine if jiu-jitsu killed people imagine if you went to the gym and you got staph and you died how many fucking people were trained I wouldn't train no he'll train you'd be so terrified of staff right well that's how we are right now with this coronavirus we're worried because we don't have like a rock-solid legitimate treatment or a vaccine but that hydro chloric dean whatever the hell it is all dpac supposed to supposed to work the trials that they've seen right yeah well for some people you know that was what they call anecdotal evidence it's not a hundred percent proven clinical trial peer reviewed where they can say hey we had 160 people that were coronavirus positive we put them on this hydroxychloroquine a lot of time too a lot of time we don't have time right but the guy there's a few doctors in New York that have implemented it and some some very positive results according to them now is that not enough to you know to say hey we're good I don't know I don't think so I think what's funny is in our group of friends you have some who are they won't step a foot outside their house they have some who are kinda in the middle they have some super super rolodex the real problem is with people who or are compromised old people you know people whose immune system is already fragile and now the thing is if you are I got it we'd be fine hopefully but then what if you gave it to your grandma you know don't go around your grandma dumb uncle or any grandma this is the real that I think the real way to handle this moving forward is probably going to be something along the lines of make sure that old people aren't exposed make sure that high-risk people are not exposed and make sure that you don't expose yourself to them if you have it correct and then you chance back to work yeah and hopefully there's some sort of a treatment but get your ass back to work is really important hell yeah there's so many businesses going under I don't think we've seen anything like this scammer man ever in and I don't think ever in the history of America there's been a thing where everything just like instantly shut down no one works no one doesn't anything everyone stays home when and how long are we gonna do it for though right I think they're saying the end of May now really cornea that's what I've heard California the the governor's kind of a pussy and he's he was talking about you know this we might go on it might be like this for a year you know so he said yeah he said that so again he's giant pussy but when you hear Trump he was talking to some reporter they asked a question and he said I'm thinking you know we're not far off from after Easter open things back up yeah look if people it's so tough like look if it's just us in this room I am not that worried because I take a lot of vitamins I'm in the fucking sauna every day I have a very strong immune system you're fit I take probiotics you walked in I said I will lick your face right now I said where doing hugging where we doing I said lick your fucking face Joe I'm not scared of shit I'm healthy as hell yeah but that's the difference between someone who's actively taking care of their body and does so all year round yes versus people who are always boozing have high blood pressure are overweight I'm talking you Burke Roger - there's a lot of people like that though that we're friends with it that's on you homie get in shape dude yep if it if it bounces right off you but it kills someone that's your age whose fault is that if they're severely out of shape it's kind of their fault that's on you man kind of their fault unless they have a disease see then there's people yeah there's people that have diseases and those diseases prevent them from being healthy that's a different animal so then you have to think about that percentage of the population there's somebody variable dude I went to the this market at this giant market they selling bats no but I would have bought one I love bats not for soup I'd save them but yeah there's like this fresh market and their peeps it was packed man oh my god damn but everyone had masks on and I saw two like I'm not even trying to be funny they're probably equal eight hundred pounds one pride 400 pounds his wife and other four amounts with masks on like you that's what you think the mask that's what that's not what's gonna kill you homies yeah that's not you though yeah you're super fucked thin out the herd man I hope this is a wake-up call for people that aren't taking care of themselves because there's a lot of people that just think it's not necessary and they look at someone like you or I that's vain that take that you know like so look I get up in the more I look at my body in the man like oh every morning good every morning old school mr. Dennis oh but it's fine me too yeah they do it - I got my study of my son out because that we have a hot tub and pool in the pools freezing and I've been mountain biking every day so my legs are sore so I go hot cold hot cold and he's doing it his pops and gets ideas pop I said you get in there dude you're getting it my daughter got up real early today like she set her alarm for 8:00 and I go why'd you get up at 8:00 she goes cuz I realized when I get up at 10:00 that I don't get as much done during the day in the day shorter home I go wow I go that's very wise so you know how kids are dabbing she's got like a half she doesn't have that kids can be successful that's hilarious she's she's a little beast my 11 year olds a beast and it crazy to see that it's crazy it's weird she's got all of my attributes my like obsessive attributes but without any of the I didn't have a good childhood like that's trouble what's good way she's super confident yeah she's not like doing it because like I want someone to love me yes I want it doesn't come from them don't play yes it's not coming from I want to be Val she's like I want to be awesome at everything and that's when she's gonna thrive she's always laughing she laughs at everything this funny kid man she's always laughing love it yeah she's always like crap like she'll say something like better she thinks things are funny like she's got a very interesting sense of humor it's weird seeing kids grow up you know with no no fear you know like don't you worry about it though yes that's the problem because they're so well taken care of I feel like when all of our friends like I'm almost everyone I know to a man that's interesting into a woman has some sort of fucked up chaotic childhood there's some darkness yeah that's what made them interesting it's what made them successful in a lot of ways but I don't know if it's necessary I feel like there's valuable lessons that you can get like for you I think a lot of your lessons you got in sports right yeah I think that's I think every kid I realize all my friends that are fucked up like emotionally that can't deal with loss they don't play sports they never played sports there's a lot of people that I know that didn't play sports they don't know how to lose and that's such a disadvantage because when you're playing sports when you're young it's hard times man oh my god and then we get as you get to the higher you know in college it's you know it's pretty cutthroat man you learn to deal with this heartbreaking issues and pick up your boots and keep going you also develop a thick skin yes chip on our shoulder a chip on your shoulder and a thick skin there's the biggest chip on this show so important to get through life though you need that you need to understand what competition you need to look at that person like you know like sparring there's there was always a one dude II don't want to spar oh fuck this guy I do not want to spoil this guy but you have to and then you have to throw anyway to get better and there's this moment where you're lined up and there is like our boy time to get my ass kicked but also in football that's when I realized oh everybody's not treated the same and that's that's the real world like we're not treated the same like I remember the star running back Bobby purify you know I've always been a huge shoe guy he would get custom one of one designer cleats and shoes in his locker and then they'd give me these old ones and he was next to me I was like I get it yeah you hurt my feelings forever man I was like sweet people get mad at people that are like uber successful but those those people like him like you know the Jordans of the world the people that are just like the fucking the guy who's the what David Goggins likes to call uncommon amongst uncommon men yes you know that's just how life is and you see that you've realized where the benefits are in being that person and then you also see the drawbacks you see a huge job ed especially in the personal life oh you're a crazy person it's tough to manage outside that Korac outside that octagon it's tough to me I mean talk to Tyson talk to Tyson about who he was when he was the king of the world he couldn't manage it I mean no one can maintain that you talk to Jon Jones talk to Jon Jones right now right now yeah right now yeah I mean I guess this is the last the last moment Jon Jones I got sad that's the first time out all the John's this recent one yeah I got sad I've been disappointed before but this one I got sad because I watched that video give it the arrest video the arrest video is sad such a bummer when you watch that video you know it was a little alarming there when when I think CTS something to do with this I know we harp on CTE but he goes hey John I need you to do this this and this he goes I'm gonna warn you my short-term memory is terrible yeah so it's not because I'm drunk and that would even as he's drunk he was cautious enough to say that saying hey man my short-term memory shit because I get punched in the head all the time yeah so that so if you base off that we're gonna be in trouble I was like oh no I think that was legs were so skinny [Laughter] well his calves are crazy his calves are so much smaller than mine and I'm so much smaller than him it's insane it doesn't mean how about will sasso scab oh those are the most ridiculous things Kalyn and I spent 15 minutes on will sasso is Casa de - crazy Helen has good tests - they're not bad but they're not well seems like you should be able to jump over a building like he should be able to just from a standing position just long she looks like Hulk it looks like Hulk wearing fucking cutoff jeans yeah now Jon Jones now imagine like the Thiago Santos fight though look at this case calf that's preposterous that's one Brian out here you see Brett Brian shaved his head and that's a 20 she was head why don't - days ago no where's the pictures I'm gonna put on my histogram yes don't go too hard on them you should I need to see this I need how come I didn't know why didn't he send me a picture that's a good move for him shave his head but he needs to go so he needs to go even more cuz the top oh yeah well does he have the hair transplant scar yes he does he does that's what I said I said oh you have the same thing Rogan huh yeah but his is small you need to you need to shave down more yeah I need to go all the way there he is just go all the way yeah good good for him he probably feels free that way it's freeing now that he look he fucked up their kids cut himself so it's like all uneven so I could not stop laughing we need to just get some tremors I caught my myself but I fucking go bad but your season back your season that yeah but even the first time I did it you just go all the way down to the bottom just go to the bottom he's got one of them trimmers on it where you leave a little bit of hair that's what he has I I go to the bottom and then I let it grow like a few days I think going for the bottom just looks a little like Bruce Willis it doesn't look bad gently he needs to shave it more you got to see in person so fine I could not stop laughing I could we couldn't get through the show I could not stop laughing he's trying to be all serious I just have laughing Wow that's count yeah the best he's such a fucking care I don't know a single human like him try to find someone like it's going crazy Korona he's mad God he gets real mad I just get mad just cuz we're on lockdown when's a shit gonna hand man when we going back to restaurants did the text message that he sends that's his big anger he can't go to Via Veneto or Felix can't hang out with his friends that place of Felix we were supposed to go right before well I went on the 14th was down no I went with my wife on the 14th right before the lockdown and we were like she would go we should go out let's just go out let's just do it we had reservations but we had him like five days earlier and started getting as it getting closer and closer it seemed like everything was like kind of shutting down people away and then was like a couple days later that they shut down everything but you did eat there yeah we apparently they and a lot of other restaurants they have to go I think Felix is doing Felix to go and so you just hold it to do that yeah yeah freaking flappers hit me up because they have to that's how they're making money that's other coven there their rent right now is they have to sell the and they have good food but they have to do the takeout mm-hmm just keep the doors open I'm glad people are innovating and they're coming up with ways to stay open but it would be a real bummer if places like Felix went under or that other place that count allows view of Veneto in Venice that place is excellent excellent the thing about those of that high rent yes I ran off Main Street yep I mean they're there right on Abbot Kinney right they're off Main Street there well Felix off habit yeah I've been higher rent what the fuck yeah I was the most expensive road in California is it really yeah why has everybody liked that area is it the homeless people that tracks them there's a it's like it's a weird vibe it's like the poorest of the poor and the richest of the rich it's so it's so strange we were drivin there and that we stopped at a red light and there was like this nice house to left like this super modern look in Venice style house and right across the street on the right was twenty tenths camped out it's such a bus why do they let that happen that is the dumbest thing that they let that happen you know what they do take over the sidewalk don't these bums do to get to get money is if a house goes for sale or rent these bums squatting from the house so the seller the renter has to come up and you guys got to get out of here in like pay us something give them money they leave and they rent the house there should be a sort of hustle shear service that cleans that up don't cope it 19 yagna tuberculosis and fucking the black pine Legionnaires disease they don't give a fuck I mean they were finding what was that uh crazy medieval disease they were finding in bombs in homeless people in Skid Row Jesus Christ it was a crazy disease that they hadn't found god damn it do you remember Jamie we were talking it's the it sounds like the crazy crazy one but it's like tell the typhus it is crazy found that look I don't know you do I mean people are worried about bats how about people that shit on the street what kind of mean we're talking about diseases that have come out of these Chinese wet markets there's easily could be diseases that come out of La out of these these homeless in camp there was no one's eaten homeless soup well I don't know what they're eating who knows what they're doing but it's not a matter of eating it's a matter of being around all that thought that's that's how the this all got started snow eating it no really I think it's being near them the the ha they think the patient zero I believe the theory is the current theory is patient zero see so you can find this was traced to a woman that worked next to the bat stand at a few weeks ago right that may or may not be the actual patient zero but yeah I don't that could be she's still alive I don't think they really really you know what's crazy they can trace the genetics of this virus and they're saying that it came from people that came from Europe that yeah in in New York City I should say I mean it obviously came from China but the people that got it in New York City got it from people who traveled to New York City from Europe and those Europeans were in China went back home I think came to New York yeah and they think these might have gotten here as early as December and maybe even November like they don't even know I heard November I think November they think it they think it got there two weeks at least before the first case and there's many people that could have gotten it that did not know that they got it and got it over it I know I know it's the cool thing to say right now dude I'm telling when I was doing an Ontario improv in end of December I was the sickest I've ever been and it lasted for 12 to 14 days I told my brother you might have taken to the emergency room after I get done my last show I was like we're driving home like we might have to go the emergency room I felt it was so fuck it the sickest I've ever been in what way were you I lied Shh cold sweats I am just sick man it's just super coughing horrible coughing huh it's bad the thing is that could also be a bad flu who knows yeah look this is one of the things that we in this text thread that you and I are in we started sharing the numbers of people that have died from the flu it's stunning alarming it's stunning I didn't know I mean I knew a lot of people died from the flu but until you see it on paper like what imagine if CNN did a whole marketing thing on how the flus killing everyone every day and there's this fucking puts all this fair and everybody if they did every day like they're doing for Korona we'd be scared shitless true but there's some preventative measures correct and then we have we flu shots and we also have Tamiflu there's a bunch of different remedies we know what the flu is yeah this is a this is a really dangerous one because it does something to your respiratory system where it scars the lining of the respiratory system it scars people's lungs and there's so much inflammation that they can't get oxygen here's the other issues they're saying that you probably have it two days before you start start showing signs if you show signs at all yes I'm known at all did your cell but apparently never showed any signs stanford studies coronavirus early spread in california looks at herd immunity potential researchers of Stanford University trying to determine if the novel coronavirus may have been circulated in California as early as last fall your boy had it and whether it's playing a role in the relative slow spread in the state Wow I hope we do have

of money to run that place for sunset fortunately for the last six years they've been making a shitload of money really okay I think they got what Peter Shores a very very bright man there's very smart and I think he's doing the right thing and I think I think they'll be okay look we could always do a shitload shows when the store comes back and don't eat all the money I'm happy to do that I'd give them rent right now I'll tell everybody if you didn't see my Instagram my shows with Dave Chappelle have been moved to September but when I say moved to September I go like this mm-hmm you're

know I'm God Steven Seagal style I'm gonna wear beads but not I'm just gonna wrap them around my wrist there's been a lot of knuckleheads online with this coronavirus talking about healing and positive energy and manifest throw a lot of bro science out there but I go off a lot of numbers that I get from way smarter people than me yeah but you're you're what you're doing is you're tweeting actual facts and then throw it a little bro Sciences in Iraq that's also my current talking about just so many people that are just you know this is a global transformation and this is our opportunity I hope everybody gets better out of this I hope I hope people recognize that our society is fragile don't you see a lot this is another positive you see a lot more people working out like when I get ready to go on my bike ride I see so many more people walking kids family think they have time this what took to get you guys the fucking walk outside well most people you know they they they don't mean unless you're working from home or you know your if you're in any kind of service industry your job is gone right for now so they have time there's a lot of people whose jobs are shut down I don't know what the numbers are but there's a lot more people home during the day a lot of key people are homeschooling their kids yeah that's it there's part of me that's when Dana came out said he's gonna do the UFC there's part of me that was super proud of them just you know I I know he was gonna get a lot of blowback for it and he's getting a lot of blowback for it but a part of me is like fuck yeah dude good for you man for figuring it out good for you good for you pretty gangster move go to an Indian Reservation really good and then went and for international flights up on island business I bet someone who enter the dragon yeah I don't worry about it I'm not gonna tell you where it's at I'm not telling anybody we're just gonna you're gonna get on flight private flight and we're flying to the island you and your team I was like I can't hate on the guy anymore I ran in the sand do you remember Bodog when Bodog had fights a beach yeah Bodog was interesting man people forgot about bulldog phaidor started their canyons started their well feed or didn't start their feed our website it's not there but he did fight on their team I think yeah started there yeah yeah it's Maz Vidale fought even words there that's was acting with a head kick fuck yeah dude there were some great fights remember Oh fate or did feed our fight Matt Lindland on bow dog was that bow dog in Russia or was that affliction no I don't think so I think you're right I think phaidor and Matlin lose bow dog and I think Matt Linden was about to take phaidor down and phaidor grabbed a rope it was a blur and then he knocked him out well yeah he didn't slam emitted him I think he submitted him here it is Matt Lindland fedora yeah so I know he slams Matt Lindland who at the time I'm pretty sure he submitted him I could he an armbar he did he submit him but I remember slamming them but go before that though guys always scared me he got double-under yeah he's got him in armbar there so Matt Lindland made the got the clinch I believe he got double underhooks yep and now look he's elevating phaidor at faders grabbing the fucking rope totally grab the rope and look who is that Tandberg Liana who's trying to look like Edward zine even but look he kept grabbing the rope and milk Matt Lindland I remember our fucking Russians right well in that moment that's a straight-up cheating I mean and that's how he got top position Matt Lindland took him down yeah Bowdoin meanwhile mile inland of the fucking guy have fought at 175 185 did he fight 117 he was so tough 180 185 is so tough tough as fuck about as tough as it gets you hear you hear the stories about him out of with him Hendo Chael Sonnen oh yeah just the bare though hey dad's bullshit hey man that's the problem with ropes though right right the cans do you remember when there's a couple moments in Pride where guys got trapped in the ropes and then submitted somebody got triangle weather head was trapped in the rope and then they got triangle on top is also nothing worse when you get knocked out you fall through the rope oh my god it's so embarrassing well how about Bernard Hopkins last fighters career when he fought Joe Smith Joe Smith chaos him well he drops him and and Bernard goes through the ropes and hits his head on the ground which is crazy how do you fucking guys not have what like our is the apron of a ring for boxing that expensive why can't you make it bigger well you can't you make it so that a guy doesn't fall or have security where if there's see something you know well they would have to act quickly and be there in time and so they'd have to be around standing on the Rings distracting it would be a few too distracting and it'd be terrible for the people who are watching but I mean all you have to do is like what do you member what Bellator did what bellator did when they were doing kickboxing and MMA at the same time so they have this round ring for Bellator and then they put a square ring in the center of that for kickboxing so if you fell to the ropes you just fell out into that round area where the Bellator cage would be it was perfect well to beat play devil's advocate if you're boxing though they're like dude how many times have people fall another fucking ring we know it's been our noggins Bernard Hopkins died from that he's also 70 years old fighting so 51 or 52 I think I mean come on dudes crazy fighting this young fuck you know yeah caught in a triangle inside the ropes so his leg is wrapped up in the rope and the dudes caught in a triangle crazy Jesus Christ ridiculous yeah it's happened more than once two people have been armed bard that way too did you think UFC 249 was gonna happen I didn't know what was gonna happen when khabib couldn't make it I was like I bet this is gonna be the end of me too I was like oh it's over but then I saw Kumar Usman saying you better get ready to make weight bitch I was like oh my God if mount fights Maas Vidale holy shit like that's worth it that's a fight but then when I heard his gauging in Ferguson I'm like oh shit first team all violence I don't know what gate she's been doing though has he been training like he's training for a fight I don't know they asked him I saw his thinker's Brett Okimoto goes how prepared are you and he it took him a while to answer and then he said something there I was like oh this could be tough he goes I have 18 minutes in me here's all you know all my fights I don't get a decision I either get knocked down or knock somebody out he goes you know I talked my family cut my coaches I don't have 18 minutes of fucking fury anything it's pretty tough to deal with not say god it's tough to deal with but if it's the toughest to deal with but there's anybody there has the endurance to take it to that 18 minutes and keep going Tony tony has the most endurance I've ever seen but don't the only thing that's a little scary when I heard him say that he does throw caution the wind Keiichi does and it's tough to deal with cuz probably the hardest hitter at 55 and Tony gets hit man that's one thing about the only she does like to get hit he yeah I think he actually enjoys it and he welcomes it what gate she I don't know if you can play that game switch for 18 minutes well I don't know if he enjoys it I just think that he has this pressure Ford style he's game for this game he's given a percent game for it but he has such a pressure style that it's inevitable that you get hit you know he's not fighting like Wonder Boy or something like that he's not fighting in the new Civ or Mighty Mouse he's fighting he's trying to break you I mean in Tony's fights there's somewhere around the second or third round where you see the look in these guys faces like motherfucker I know how is he keeping up this patient since kind of the same way he just goes forward like a little tank yeah keeps going it is such a good fight my favorite fight with justice Barbosa because Barbosa is a savage and Justin just flying him I'm over ran him over his fight with poor his fight with any algorithm both but all the pretty good man oh they were great but poor yeah his leg was almost done was almost done but Poirier pulled it out with a knockout or a actually came out on record and said he thinks Katie's gonna win real yeah that's cuz he's never fought Tony you know who's fought gage he and beat him and it would be great if Katie beat Tony and then it makes him look good well I don't necessarily know if that's I mean it's not that Tony can't win it's not that that gage you can't win either it's like in my opinion so who the fuck knows it's a who the fuck knows especially in these conditions it's like what Cape have they had especially Justin y know Tony's had a camp Tony's had a camp but you got a real everything's everything's not normal like you're not getting the same amount of guy yeah but Tony is not normal Tony's not normal Tony if anyone's gonna thrive in the situation it's yoni he didn't you know he didn't spar at all apparently according to everyone that I've talked to his cape for the pedis fight yeah after his surgery so the guy has knee surgery like a really complex knee surgery where his ligament is reattached to his leg and he is in massive scar I mean he's got a 12-inch scar on the side of his leg five months later he's fighting again he's crazy that's nuts that's nuts and didn't do any sparring just just rehabbed everything got himself in shape he looked pretty good he looked fucking fantastic in that fight of course he did it's fighting Pettis Pettis is a master striker Pettis knocked out wunderbar be the Superman pie 100% yeah I don't know if you can take those same hits the wage it's a good question gage II you know gage he comes after you man he comes out and he's got the nominal leg kicks his leg kicks are sensational and he throws leg kicks from crazy angles to like he'll be like right up tight with you like right here and he's chopping at your leg it's kind of it's amazing it's interesting how he does it like he's not a he's not he doesn't have a more type background which is really just learn to kick about four years ago why more than axe I remember in the PFL who's I'm just saying like he's not he has no kickboxing background he came from University of Northern Colorado to grudge training center with Trevor Whitman all of us and came and there's a a pure wrestler with terrible eyesight he'd always take his guys off and squint and he's just this fucking monster and they started teaching the light kicking like holy shit the guy can like kick but it's crazy how good he does it he's amazing at it his leg kicks are sensational like you would think that he was some muy Thai champion or something that's amazing yeah yeah I mean this is what I want I want to see Tony shoot for takedown mmm I don't know why I know obviously just engage he has a phenomenal wrestling he's so athletic and he was an all-american at Northern Colorado Tony's a stud - I think he's a dog go champ so let's someone shoot in on the fucking guy well no one does it yeah no one does it well what's interesting about gay cheese you never see him wrestling that's what's so crazy it's like the guys got this great wrestling pedigree but he just strikes with everybody in smashes and and smashes real strikers like Barbosa wants to be violent yeah that's it all violent it's so nuts like that cheating not that you know I've seen I want khabib Tony that's the greatest night in UFC history I think at light weight it's cursed it's fucking dude you might be five times five times five and what the fuck I want to see that that's the fight of the two the best 155 s on the planet but gay Chi Tony I think will be more entertaining are you see they're so violent they're so fun think of these two fucking maniacs this fight can't be boring it's impossible don't think I think you're right I don't think it can be boring however I said that about style bender versus Yoel Romero I thought no y'all ever think in a fight yeah I guarantee you Katie and Tony gonna fight well I bet my bottoms all that about in Ghana and Derrick Lewis I didn't know Derrick Derrick Lewis fucking back Dave Allen I know Francis had a blown fucking ACL or whatever it was Diddy Francis he was injured in that fight both of more injured I didn't know Francis danger I thought he was just his mind was apparently balsam had injuries oh I didn't know that bro that's a fight this weekend no one's talked about you not coming events not coming it should be I should be they had Greg Hardy and whoever the fuck he's fighting above that I'm like what are you guys doing doubts because it was on ESPN the other one was on ESPN plus I think the idea was that you're gonna have an Ghana and rose and strike which it's just it's like the main event boom boom that's crazy roses strike people better not be sleeping on him man no he's a terrifying man he's a professional kickboxer and he takes a tremendous shot you look at Overeem didn't do nothing to him they they fought for the entire five rounds he didn't do nothing to him until Rosen's strike caught him with that bomb Rosen strike was gonna lose that fight too was gonna lose that he was gonna lose that fight he was gonna lose that fight do this what's in the prelim still it's co-main event now I talked to his agent last night oh this is because the Rose namajunas fight is pulled they stavros on there okay you're right they kept it there and Jacare Souza people were saying that it was Ryan Hall you guys texted you guys was joking no somebody sent me a meme that said Ryan Hall versus Jacare Souza and I was like is that real and Eddie goes can they even do the weight class and I thought yeah I was like oh they're joking so I didn't respond to it I didn't think it was horse shit look Ryan Hall has such a hard time finding opponents you got a fight though did he you got a fight but hey stud he's fighting a stud is he Ricardo Lamas okay that's a good fight for him fucking fight nobody wants to fight Ryan home in exactly finally gets returned to us Ricardo Lamas in May yeah he's he's so difficult because Hall is so tall and long but also how do you guys think useful I didn't understand it I thought maybe he just said fuck it I have no camp but I want to fight I weigh 185 I'd watch the shit out of that imagine I mean I don't think he's losing 40 pounds in between fights but he's a tall guy he's like 6 feet isn't he yeah yes that's too short for the division yeah he's thin but I mean fuck and he's also he's a frost a hobby guy right Rahal yeah I'm pretty sure he's training in a trust no he trains down here now he's a tattaglias his own gym in Orange County and they trained that Kenny Florence did he ever trained with sobbing maybe did early on but he's been out of Cali interesting he's old school and then Kenny's what is his what's his camp like who's putting together the camp I don't know who's head guys Alexander Hernandez comes back that's a great fight I don't know dude I don't think people realize that the fucking depth dude Francis encountered which rose and shook is insane it's gonna be amazing and in a few if you just people in Vieira Rayborn that's ridiculous fight people give Francis enough credit you look at his record like well off he had his hiccup against deepen and the Dirk Lewis I don't count but besides steep a dude the run in the dudes that he's beat and if he were to become champion you're talking top five of all time man yeah you look at his record like holy shit if he becomes champion I mean he knocked out Cain Velasquez knocked out JDS Alistair Overeem yeah Andrei Arlovski yeah I mean the whole I mean the Hutu and the way he knocks him out that's the thing it's just the way knocks him out but he's getting old you mean he's getting up there in age she's like 37 now I think dude you know something to think about with could be boning these guys does it say how old he is he has to be 37 you know Tony's 36 is he and for a lightweight for a heavyweight it doesn't matter for a lightweight that's at the yeah long in the tooth it's not gonna say it there that they hide that information but let me see the main card what's that what's the main card the card so filthy germy Stevens Calvin kadar what down bottom of the screen if you can see that okay oh that's the the Jeremy Stephens Calvin caters a fantastic fight dude how about fucking your boys on their Nico price so okay it still says Greg Hardy is the co-main but that's been changed right now from what I understand he's the co-main event Jeremy Stephenson calva cater that's a sleeper the night I think Calvin cater is the dark horse of the 145 pound division that motherfucker is scary he's a beast I mean he he's had I think he's had two losses inside the Octagon thank God that the fucking fight I knocked a Meccano beat him with leg kicks he he made a real good adjustment and started catching him with leg kicks and one a decision and then he beat beat a bunch of guys and lost his a beat and he lost his a beat in a fight where he was he was dominating a third round yeah that was class up dominating that third round and I was like man if there was a five-round fight I like cater me to all day he fucked up Lamas that was a fight where right away you could see the the difference in the hands Calvin trains a lot with boxers he's got vicious hands like super accurate and really long like if you see if you go to his Instagram he put up the KO of Lamas it's very interesting because he ranges him he ranges him and then he drops these super long punches on he's a Boston kid right hmm yeah the but though it's like watch how he sets this up like he moves his hands want to see the range boom the length of that and he's huge for a forty-five or two real been long but the fucking torque in that right hand he spins it around with the left and then puts the lights out with the right look at that his fucking picture perfect man picture-perfect oh shit Irish Micky Ward says good luck Calvin Wow how about seeing that looking down six-six unzips zips in yeah but Johnson's got one too was sensational dude him for Stephens is a phenomenal phenomenal fight for now all the fights it's like man five the night good luck I know we kill price I knew K I know Vicente Luque is an animal and Nico prices an animal both those guys together that's like I can believe that go back to what you just the whole full car I couldn't there it is mm-hmm I can't believe only you see announces some people hate it on it like you fucking negative bitches rarely curl at times and Dana pulled this off this if this was where's the crowd of times dude if this was a regular paper of you'd make my dick hard little own with Corona this is amazing the Greg Hardy de Castro listen not hot not a highly skilled fight somebody's going to fucking sleep hopefully but to be Co main event is a little crazy well I was interested that Greg Hardy stepped up and fought Volcom and didn't look bad didn't look bad and get annihilated didn't get annihilated against one of the best heavyweights in Division correct this time Alexander is a really technical fighter stud and real long real tall long I mean look what he did if every see overdoing for VC over doom was the UFC heavyweight champion he fucked him up and Greg Hardy went the distance with him and did not look bad and had one hand yeah and yeah broke his hand early in the fight he's going to get better he's a stud athlete the difference between like guys like first of all he doesn't have another way right he doesn't have a fucking football career anymore he's not gonna play pro basis is it this is it there's no podcast and he's got a dicey past in terms of the law I would say the dicey Asst it's pretty dicey then john jones says hold my beer but great heart he's a fucking elite athlete he's a guy who knows how to be professional athlete and he was all-pro Joe yeah superstar ball but there's a thing about guys like that where from the time they're young they realize this insane work ethic is how you make it and they also they're used to these regimented programs right we're a lot of football players and you could speak on this they're used to these programs where everybody's doing the same kind of work versus boxers or MMA fighters on you you're on your own and sometimes you have acid and sometimes you're not discipline do you fuck off you don't go to kickboxing you decide I don't want to go to jiu-jitsu today you want to fuck my girlfriend that kind of shit doesn't happen in football doesn't work it that way especially at like university Colorado Ohio State so if you're one of 10 linebackers and you're all doing the exact same thing you're all fighting for your job every day if you for whatever reason don't do something well and this guy does he's probably gonna play over you so you're like it's this heightened freakin competition all the time man and it brings the best out of you it does Eric Anderson where to right yeah not Alabama stud go watch his fight with Khalil rounds he looked amazed and the motherfucker doesn't flinch Khalil round she was lighting him up lighting him up he never flinched Khalil Roundtree was fucking his legs up in a way very rarely you see it was like it was so fucked up and he Khalil was full more time light on the front leg back whoa dude when Khalil is on his game he he displays some of the best muy Thai you're gonna see in the UFC that Erica Andrews just I know you don't watch football Joe so he played at Alabama and it was on the national champion team so that that's like creme de la creme doesn't get better than that that's like wrestling at Ohio State or Oklahoma like Hughes high level football player well he's a stud that guy is an animal in terms of like in his ability to endure pain and is in his ability to press forward and you know and fights a lot takes fights take fight a light heavyweight take a fight 185 he's game hes game as fuck and again that's the thing that's like these elite athletes these guys who know what it takes to be a winner you know if you those Greg Hardy guys Erica Andrews guys and we're gonna get more of those there's gonna be more guys like that let's see a path and there's this more guys like that that don't want to rely on a team you know they don't want like if the team they're on sucks they don't shine they'd rather kill what they eat 100 percent you know what I mean there's a lot of guys like that where they'd rather just go out and do it themselves and MMA is a sport where they can do that yeah so you see a lot of these guys they start practicing MMA offseason they train a little bit offseason I wouldn't be surprised if John's brother Arthur gets an MMA both of them I mean Chandler's all pro two Pro Bowler but Arthur trains with him a lot doesn't have time yeah he's huge huge chubby and he could fight ma'am if he decided to start fighting take out a few pro fights I mean I think John said in interviews but I remember when John and I were talking he I mean Arthur gives him problems oh yeah like if they wrestle it's problem is huge and explosive he's any shoe as a nicest guy the nicest guy but he's so big because brothers don't have prawns though huh the Bret you don't really hear much about the brothers fucking up well they both been popped for steroids yeah I met sports though I'm talking about like hanging out at Albuquerque at 4:00 in the morning with bombs and fucking shooting guns yeah well they don't well they do get hit in the head they get it mad football style which is the way I got through the laundry series on I still haven't watched a Netflix documentary on your boy that looks exactly but goddamn dude that wand REE podcast series warriors some good so good I was gripped it was one of those you know sometimes you get a podcast series like that like another one is the drop out about that Elizabeth Holmes chick that robbed everybody with that theranos that's right that's another one there's a few of those we start I mean you're like what the fuck dude sometimes I'll sit my car and wait till the episodes done it's just I'm like so into it I'm on something right now that I know you're you're you read you've got chaos book the Charles Manson my ass bro he's coming in who hung O'Neill's coming in next week yes I'm in the middle of that book right now oh holy shit holy shit you look it man it's a little different you'll get the whole thing a little different yes like what yeah I don't wanna see too much cuz I want Tom to explain when you having him on next week that books so fucking good don't balls deep in that I've been writing I read about that book for well what mom the things are absolutely provable that he knows Charles Manson the CIA in the secret history of the 60s the the things that are absolutely 100% provable just those things are mind blowers well you like whoa and it's documented uh-huh how the CIA and the LSD house and in haight-ashbury in San Francisco and yeah how he was doing wild ship and the CIA would let him go yeah or how he was out here at that ranch and the cops never people would go dude he's doing wild shit arrest them like we're told not to touch him like what yeah fuck they killed the caretaker that ranch didn't find that guy's body until the site in the late 70s yeah they they did a lot of my favorite books it's a very good book they did a lot of shit in the 1970s with drugs and people for experiments in 60s and the 70s and that's how they created the Unabomber man Ted Kaczynski was a part of the Harvard LSD program yeah what did you watch that documentary the net not the one you saw it's on Netflix which one is it I forget but it's about the Unabomber at night I didn't know that I'm like why is he such why was he so fucked up Manhunter I think so yes it's so good there's another one what's the other one called oh that's why Unabomber in his own so it's the first time he let one person ever interview him and it's all the tapes from the interview and you know his legal his defense team goes listen dude you're not gonna get the death penalty if you just plead insanity goes I'm not insane here's do I seem insane to you he was I'm not insane and so he fired his defense team because they wanted to say it was insane here's I'd rather die than be called insane he's like I'm not insane I'm a genius dude he was smart as fuck well he might be too smart because he's actually looked he's not correct to kill those people but he is correct that technology is eventually going to overcome people now imagine this is we're going deep down the Eddie Bravo rabbit hole of imagine if you were artificial intelligence and you had decided you wanted to assimilate with people but you had to convince people one of the best ways to convince people is to get them addicted to technology check done right everybody's technology then get them connected through social media apps get them connected to technology I mean how many times you go to a restaurant where you don't not right now not at all but anytime you go out in public before the quarantine everybody was on their phone if chat buddy now you throw a virus in there so now they can't be with people and then you make it so when they see people that can't touch them they can't hug people they can't shake hands they have to make distance so now the only way you can connect with people is through zoom or FaceTime or all the technology and then and then while Laurel I'll quarantine you're installing 5g towers do you see that did you post that goes with that load of all duvall yeah tell me you've done the 5g towers and what five countries have 5g towers read more you know a hundred entries have coronavirus fucking idiots it's the best point the best point is one of those points where you go oh yeah I saw Tyrese posted he's like y'all need to look at this 5g that's what's causing all this and killing kids and coronavirus I was like Oh buddy Oh buddy let's make Fast and Furious 19 shut the fuck up there's so many fucking people that think of 5g is what's killing people but it's like there's always going to be that thing where whenever something happens people look for some nefarious backwoods sort of fucking answer I also think you know in this time it's very easy to get down and depressed and a lot of people thrive in that so they want it to be bad if I can't get out of here I'm going to you're right get out of here you're right you're right there are people that are like they're happy they're thriving alright yeah thriving I saw some lady write some post about Justin Bieber she was making fun of Justin Bieber's house which by the way it looks pretty pimp yeah it's so disgusting looks like it looks like your stupid SimCity houses but then she wrote eat the rich and like but Mike he's a singer meanwhile she looks mean while she looks like an armadillo yeah yeah people are so crazy they like because they're angry and they're frustrates like is it his fault that he's a super successful musician that has a crazy dope house and super talented and also that house your house bitch yeah let me look at the house that's what she's angry that's what she's like yes the rich wasn't I saw one guy post this thing named counter he goes hey I've heard horrible stories about Alan for every bad story you guys share I'll donate $2 to this you know I'm like dude what's wrong with you man do something positive you think this is positive hey I'm fucking Ellen people are cooped up and they're filled with anger and they find a target for that anger they're filled with anxiety and depression and rage and you know so do something to get to be creative man do something to get out of it you know good call yeah but don't hate on the people who are doing it that's why you're in that position you see what Ellen did this is really really kind of funny she said being stuck here in quarantine is like being in prison I haven't changed my closing in days and everyone's gay [Laughter] shit but I think it's probably partly because that guy came out and said hey Ellen's mean post your stories about Ellen being mean you see the stories they were so nothing nothing too bad man what was it it was like old I came on her show and before I left she didn't say hi it's like Oh Ellen takes down video after jail joke about coronavirus self-command Wow she's she's shook she shook right now go to your comic stand by it there are several other articles written about her being an asshole Oh Bambi yeah yeah single capital I've heard about it I've heard it's you know Entertainment Saul around it's like don't you also think that she's one of those to think log get to the top that's why she became Ellen correct first place and that makes a lot of enemies she's a type she's anti personally it's her show it's her way or the highway ready to rock also probably maligned most of her life because she was a lesbian had to keep it in tight or some darkness there's some darkness and there's some anger in there you know oh but the fucking jokes hilarious huh that's a great joke hilarious joke I like that wearing the same clothes and everyone's gay that's funny that's funny [Music] my favorite hey man Justin Bieber have you seen that fucking crib you know that looks like inside you fucking morons no joke that crib is yeah but the thing is like it's saying this is the ugliest house ever it's so crazy it's weird-looking yeah but when you're Justin Bieber look at that bro that looks like some sort of you know what that looks like it looks like a museum like you would go there and they'd be like a dinosaur in there it looks like the open in Jurassic Park yes yeah that's a dope house I bet it's all glass you just walk around butt naked with his girl and shit it looks like a giant salad spinner now you can lease it well no one's gonna wanna lease it now social media users mocked this Beverly Hills house but tweeters got a few things wrong first of all you should let me see your house you're mocking this post your house is your house bitch post your shitty little apartment in Studio City that you're mocking this castle from this fucking Tony Stark castle 60 grand a month ooh that's it dude that thing is fucking sick makes me like him more yeah you know when I heard Justin Bieber songs I thought it was sung by a girl at first you didn't I had no idea I thought it was a girl song it sounds like that's Justin Bieber I'm like what like the yummy song it's like I did why are you laughing I didn't know no bro I listened to 98 percent classic rock okay I'm that old dude but you're but your kids are listening to Justin Bieber um I don't know if they do know shut that shit off I throw it on the shit out of here some Lynyrd Skynyrd what yeah if they work out at the gym I make them listen to fucking Skynyrd and Zeppelin but I'm sure they have the stuff they like yes yeah oh my god it's terrible yeah I don't know what Alyssa I could sing a lot of oh yeah yeah wonderfully so scared of Corona she should be that's a man she should be well a lot of people should be scared you know my dad hasn't left this house but he's also like 63 so I'm like I get it papa yeah my parents got real spooked my parents got real spooked they don't they don't do shit they're holding up I think that when the remedy comes out hopefully even they figure out what it is we're all gonna relax when when foul she was saying that we're not shaking hands anymore ever no shaking hands again ever like your bro I can't come on man do come on that's it that's why I kind of like that the UFC is doing their thing and also it's like this is the UFC the the Dana White and Fertitta is like they're Cowboys man they take risk their cage fighting promoters there's no safety in that do you think that when Francis and Ghana fought Alistair Overeem and knocked him into another dimension do you think there's any safety in that no where's the safety but Carell else would rather have Corona need that uppercut I'm saying it's like also you don't mean Tony's probably the oldest guy in the card the card at 36 yeah look at the odd if Tony was let's say worst-case scenario all the fighters got Crona look at the odds they're all gonna be just fine switching the shape that they're in odds are they'll be fine Tony Ferguson gets Corona you'll see him the next day running hills yes with a mask on so it correct now as long as those fighters don't go back home and that and their grandparents are around that's where it is I see but I'm assuming they're not fucking idiots yeah that's where it gets dicey I just wish there was a way to tell if you had it because so many people are asymptomatic you know there's a lot of people that didn't feel any symptoms at all and they found that they had it and like whoa you know I wish there was a better way to know if you had it but but even if there's not again you look at the odds the chances are in this wide Dana and the guys are going on with the it's like everyone should be fine yes kovat 19 tests expected for fighters coaches prior to UFC 249 so they're going to test them and I think what they're doing at the event is gonna they're gonna temperature test everybody temperature testing again I play devil's out gets a little tough because again some people haven't don't show symptoms or show symptoms at all expect to send test kits to fighters new teams ahead of the event which is currently rumored to take place at Tai Chi Tachi tachi Palace - Ellis in Lemoore California a second round of testing is also expected to take place on site at 249 tests he was one of strongest measures the promotion can take to ensure that those who attend event are negative for the corona virus which is an incubation period of up to 14 days it doesn't completely eliminate the possibility of spreading the virus according to CDC it's possible a person early stages of infection could test negative on the test recognized by the Public Health Institute oh great I got an update on Francis so yeah they're still finalizing the lineup but they believe Francis will be Co made of that Tom it has to be code you not why would you not be that's but who do they have in the main event on the ESPN that's the that's the fucking sweetener that's the little taste of meth that gets you to buy the pay-per-view I know who would you let me see the card again well how about Stephens and cater when is that is it on the main cards bank on it should be on the main card that's my fight Luke a Nico price that's right five to the whole fucking card dude yeah I just I wish it was free though mmm nothing have to make that you gotta make that cheddar William WME you know like you got to think all their touring acts musicians me okay I'm WME big deal folder all their touring acts everything's been canceled oh four twenty has been moved to October for 20 in Vancouver's moved to October 24th October 24th that's when you get in high October 24th we're gonna get high as fuck in Vancouver hopefully hopefully colvett 2 doesn't come out so that's uh that's the main card and go to the the prelims and see who's gonna be the if it's not John Deere I hear a that's it right there just move that one up and then the bottom is Marlin Vera and Ray Bourque now go to fight past prelims so what they'll do is they'll move up Michael Johnson and common worthy they'll do do that that's a great game by the way yeah those are great too they'll move that to ESPN do you know I heard I heard the fighters gonna be fine bye hurt the commentators gonna be in super danger of getting Corona so you should do it and we should do a fight compare I selfishly don't want you to do it and also into a fight you don't want to do it too but I also I'm very curious about what it's like to see a fight in an arena with no one there I've ever been to the Ultimate Fighter no I mean granted within the arena but no it's just it just feels it just feels different yeah I'm sure you can literally hear that oh god I know it's gonna fail it's gonna sound really weird because I scream a lot - I'm gonna hit ya it's gonna be very strain they're gonna hear what I think should be done they're gonna hear that might help yeah for DC if DC is gonna be there with me if someone's wrestling so you think you're gonna do it you still don't know dudes next Saturday after decide well Olson I said that I would do it if it's gonna be in America I talked to Dan I said look man you got you do it in America I'm gonna do it but it's not really in America it's on the Indian Reservation which means it's not sanctioned by anything let 'ok commission so does it not count it counts what's that will be a sanctioned event how at all of their international events they work together with the Nevada Commission to sanction them and this the ABC which is the Association a boxing commission Thank You Madame sport says this will be a section wow I pulled out all the stuff that's interesting so how do they hurt the California rules for combat sports then because it's not they're technically not on they're not even a cornea jurisdiction right right so they're using the go bet scroll back up again please scroll back to the beginning of the article here's something to think about if any substitution of boxing commissioning combat of sports so the ABC which is the Association of boxing come out of sports released a statement saying that it's taking place on tribal land did how great is tribal land they can do anything I can do whatever they want I mean just during these times they had a rough reason for why the roughest I mean they used to own the whole country when the UFC does international events they regulate themselves using Nevada State Athletic Commission inspectors in this event on sovereign land is no different fantastic fun we have little countries inside our countries fantastic here's what's interesting is any other like if Bellator world syrupy FL if they were like fuck California Commission we're gonna do on Native American land in California they would never be allowed to work here again that Athletic Commission like dude you fucked or not doing it but do UFC such a juggernaut I don't think California's gonna flex on him and the end UFC has a close relationship with California well California Athletic Commission is run by Andy Foster I'm a big fan of it I like Andy he's the best with the whole Jon Jones stuff remember all that so he has a pretty tight relationship with the UFC and Dana White so I don't think it's be an issue for them well I don't think so either it's being sanctioned not by the California Athletic Commission though yeah but ABC Commission good enough here's here's what else is kind of interesting about this is it's great Dana's put it on he made it happen but you realize that one of the reasons they're making happen is there's a little bit of desperation because they have to put on 40 something fights how many did I how many did I say Jamie I read this article 42 for the years they have to they have to put on 42 fights to get there seven and fifty million bucks from ESPN they have to do that how many weeks are left in the year 38 weekend a ton of fight Sun weight and put on so how many of they done they've done a 7 7 35 to go 38 weeks fight every week back to back to back and then they're gonna go to fuck Island right any great are they red to Jeff's Jeffery Epstein's Island is that true Jamie I that's the rumors online that's so awesome yeah I can we would treat events held on mystery islands the same way as well mystery Islands we are in a goddamn movie so the you see it get you can sense it and you know there's so much talking no there's a little bit of desperation where they have to put on the fights to get that summer 15 million bucks the screen goes fuck you pay me desperation is a word that you could use another word is innovation they had to innovate dad to figure out how to keep having fights you know they it's desperate cuz you know they have they need to do something WME needs the money everybody needs the money I mean the UFC is one of the rare people that WM he owns that's not fucked right now in terms of like firing employees and there was an article written at the UFC fired a bunch of employees it's not true willie morris like those of them the agents employees but UFC didn't it I say that's more excited to to Dana then WME yeah yeah I think it's both innovation and desperation like dude we have to get this money yeah we have to get this money we're gonna figure out how to make these fights happen well they cancelled three cards right postponed postponed three cards they just jam those motherfuckers on fuck Island dude fuck Island the Frey Island they don't no one knows where the island is though right no Dana won't tell anyone mm it's it's in international waters right that's the idea yeah and then all the international fighters gonna fight there that's so strange fighting Henry cejudo the real king has already told you that we're fighting May 9th see you there PS I'll bring bring your other tiny little friend they said that a lot of brazilian fighters couldn't get visas for the UFC to 5000 couldn't get visas to leave Brazil cuz Brazil doesn't want people leaving so the ideal hey but also to be fair Dominick Cruz first honey sudo that's a better fight it's a very good I don't know about that all those coming off a loss bullshit it's a loss really Jaime bite yep that's fine and that's fine well what's the record show though it does show it on the record but I thought that was a bad decision horrible decision but it's tough to give him that nod not not if you're the UFC you go fuck those judges no I get it it's the Wild West yeah we're fighting on fuck Island guy that lost a fights get a title shot we got an intern belt it's like what fuck hilarious but Tony's been a two-time interim belt champion they better not take it from him this time they stole it from him before yeah they didn't I mean it's on the longest winning streak in UFC history I think you know what's gonna happen isn't he yeah yes in light yeah period longest in light weight right yeah well I think period though right what his record yeah and in terms of like years I mean he hasn't lost since he got his arm broken the Michael Johnson fight here's something else yeah think about Tony first and just engage gonna be complete violence Tony's probably gonna fight for a little while khabib has Ramadan in August so I'm assuming we're gonna be back to normal - beeps gonna want to fight before then Tony's not gonna be ready unless he smokes just engaged with no one smokes just engag so you're gonna get Conor could beep - in between that in July yes buddy we're in we're in March yeah April April but horse and I'm thinking may june july august ramadan tony kids still fight in July yeah Connors chomping at the bit to go is he yeah yeah but QB he doesn't want to fight Conor the thing is it's the UFC that he went through with Connor talking shit to Connors already talking shit he's already talking shit again like it's not like he's gonna stop talking shit he's gonna wrap it back up again so it could be best endure all that stuff again until he can get ahold of it one more time huh that's why I think they're gonna do I have no one more person other than cowboy you would think it's it's it's Conor McGregor he's the biggest feint most famous fighter of all time would you not watch could be done or - oh I'd watch it for sure especially if it takes place on fuck Ireland dun dun da all right supposedly deleted oh yeah I saw that Andersen's front kick Ronda's arm Brenda's h-bomb Crowe cops high kick John side kick the knees over and over again it's actually the only thing at this stage khabib 'he's a little mermaid leg wrap thing he does why did he delete that he said way worse oh no he's Conor yeah I think you bit of a layoff oh yeah so then you know because you're doing this fight which praise the fight gods were getting but Ramadan's in August so we got it could be passed to fight in between there may be or he just rides it out rides it out fights in the December 31st card God once fights when he knows that there's going to be fights they'll do it in Vegas the dude at t-mobile big deal boo boo boo own fireworks he doesn't fight for money he doesn't give a shit he's probably got so much money right now anything rash and they like worship Him he drives a Toyota that's a button on that which which Toyota the island of Emerald Isle of the islands Emerald Isle of Ireland that's not true silly silly Conor he tries to fucking like a Toyota Tundra those are cool they're fine but I mean that's him yeah guys a multi multimillionaire and doesn't fly times over at least you're looking at me worse likes wet suits and shit doesn't have a fancy watch doesn't is nothing nothing when he does with his money puts in a vise grizzly bears and shit he's the total polar opposite of Conor in that regard that's why it's fantastic Conor's wearing half a million dollar watches while he's hitting the speed I love to see that shit yeah I love it he's hitting the Cobra bag with a fucking half a million dollar watch oh that's great you need that Joe how much that watch cost but it looked expensive because you got Tony who's labeled as the crazy guy right yeah Tony who's labeled well he's just he's he's a different bird let's just pussy Tony had sunglasses on he's staring down with could be but he's telling could be but take your glasses off yes so take your sunglasses off take your sunglasses off and keep he's like what he's a he's a brilliant madman I could deal with this guy you deal with Connors on money my face weightlifting gloves and he's got a sleeves roll most so stage I'll tell you if Justin were able to pull this off just engag khabib is a fucking fight oh my god cuz Justin can wrestle yes yeah phenomenal phenomenal fire he can wrestle any super dangerous standing up and it's really hard to take him down if he doesn't want to get take down it's a real hard go and he throws everything into those punches and he's he's wild but calculated you know JJ yeah yeah he got he came on food truck tire and we actually got into it and I loved when guys address stuff because you know I'm not engaged for a long long time and I always said he's pretty he just knows caution to the wind and goes fucking he just brawls he's like dude you keep saying that man people keep telling me that he's like it's calculated you got to go back and watch the thing like got mad interesting yeah he's got he goes I know exactly what I'm doing like alright dawg tell me well he does know what he's doing but it is very risky it's both I think he's calculated in that he's he's realizing there's a high-risk high-reward thing so he calculates it that's worth it whereas a lot of people calculate now I'm not doing that I'm not fighting that way he's his style of fighting you know that's not a long career he's nothing that no and that's one of the reason I think he took this fight and you know like Chuck Liddell perfect example real similar style in a lot of ways wrong bro just fucking throw caution to the wind and let the Hammers fly I mean that style doesn't get you I mean we all see how Chuck went at the end the end I couldn't take a shot at him you can't do it this day and age and you'll see guys are too good yeah guys are way too good can you MIT like stop in there win of beat yo Romero if you threw caution to the wind you got knocked the fuck out rights right you guys are too talented guys are too talented these days yeah I think so too I think but but the way Justin does is not totally caution to the wind he just takes risks a lot of risks but with it you get the rewards like the Edson Barboza knockin he gotten Barboza's face he did he broke Barbosa smashed him James Vick to smash the way he does it the guys too but but then think about the the highest level guys that he's fought you look at Dustin Poirier you look at his fight with Eddie Alvarez he lost what is his full record look his best wins Danse Ronan it's in Barbosa hmm and then his is that the time he fought you know who I think's a top three top four guy doesn't poor he lost right Eddie Alvarez at the time monster he lost yeah and then the world series of fighting stuff it's just not the source yeah it's hard but I feel like yeah those two fights in role that he lost but I feel like when you look at his his style in the Vic and barbosa fights and the Cerrone fight I think he's gotten better I don't think you've eaten those top boys like you ain't being could be fighting like that I don't think oh noes man I mean we don't know I don't know but I would say the odds are in my favor when I say that interesting now can just engage he beat anybody in the world yes but the odds are with that fighting style going against khabib or Tony for that matter it's tough man rap I've got to give him an advantage striking verse it's harder than all of them right hundred percent but then we're not gonna be like he wants to take him down right do you think could be was gonna be able to take him down easily easily you think yeah I'd you know talking to some guys I know could be would go against you know like Penn State like Ed Ruth who's whenever four-time all-american I think three-time national champion he is like a fucking statue at Penn State I know he wrestled with him and it does not go well for him Fred Ruth really real I know guys come and get fucking mauled up I could be world class wrestlers way heavier than fuck them up really guys we know that good that good goddamn talk to DC about it oh yeah I have I have but I want to hear from you are you such a monster man yeah you when when you hear someone like Josh Thompson and hear these guys tell the stories about khabib my god I don't know if I'll ever lose he's that good and they kept T we've never seen lose around and practice well he lost one round ever in a fight and I was around three against Connor where it looked like he was kind of taking the round off yeah you know but I mean that's what guys do when they want a final push to finish a guy and then you're on to finishing them the next round I think that rematch is it again I don't can counter beat them I don't know but I think if Connors focus has a full camp I think that fight does go a little different I do give kind of a better chance mmm interesting yeah I don't know I mean you never know who knows it's fun it's so it's the funnest yeah it is the best there's no basketball basketball can't perform right now well the thing about the difference between basketball and everything else and an MMA is in MMA this two guys they're fighting and then there's one referee those the ones in contact with each other with basketballs everyone's fucking on top of everybody and five Koshu faces and football same thing colliding the football to me they're not gonna miss a beat you don't think so well didn't didn't Gavin our governor say something about football not coming back he doesn't count when he talked he doesn't count when you talk to like Trump and you hear some of these other people talk like Trump told the NFL the Commissioner is like I'm planning for NFL season to not skip a beat dude you want to see people piss in America fuck with football mmm fuck with LSU football or Georgia football college football see what happens you think things are bad now fuck with the college football you know this is a weird time to because it's right before the election you know election comes in November like imagine if this said this shit was going on right now in the elections like next week god chaos your boy Bernie dropped out yep it's rap Biden ain't beating Trump nope that's your best that's the guy it shows you how crazy the system is that they wanted him as long as Biden to be their guy that they don't they can't admit that he's in cognitive decline I mean not very strange listen I fuck up all the time I speak for a living I fuck up all the time Haydn's but Biden no he fucks up man you're politician I fuck up all the time too but we're also talking live for hours and hours and hours at a time if I had a prepared thing that I was doing like my stand-up I don't fuck you would be sharp as fuck if you guys having one of those conversations they're asking you look if someone wants to ask me questions about things that I understand like MMA or like comedy like if you want to ask me questions about things that I think about and talk about all the time you have your black belt and bulls yeah I could talk to you and really clearly about those things and make a lot of sense he can't do that about politics and he's been a politician forever and that's your shit he's he's an you know he's a guy who's suffering he's in decline and they're gonna try to wail Mountain whoever his VP is whether it's Kamala Harris or baby whoever it is but that's who you're voting for yeah he's I mean it's quarto sort of like when Dick Cheney was basically running the country yeah George Bush was the present yeah yeah I don't know we'll see there's no way he beats drunk he doesn't beat Trump not a chance no not a chance especially because of the timing of this right now we're in the shit right we're in the April shit is the worst time of the corona a lot of people are dying there's a slight drop-off in New York people dying less today than yesterday slight drop off yesterday from the day before so things are looking pretty good cowboy it's gonna be yeah California is looking very good right yeah we're crushing it very good so and then and so and then you go June July August hopefully everything's up and running again economy starts coming back on track Trump makes a couple of great speeches but Biden is more in decline it's not gonna get better no those two faceoff Trump's gonna light him up like a calm you Central Roast he's already dismissing him sleepy Biden he's like but he's saying like someone said Biden said this he was he did first of all he didn't right that was Democratic operative he probably doesn't even know what it says he's gonna destroy him he's gonna kill a man I mean it's such an easy target it's like Mike Tyson versus a three-year-old it's true it really is it's it's it's a terrible fight I thought Bernie had a legit chance Bernie had a legit chance he had a legit chance because there's a lot of people that are in the middle that are you know a lot of people that are casually acquainted with politics that would listen to his message of doing good for the working class I think you helped out with more people I think you made him human we is on here I was like oh I like that guy would you have Biden up no really no oh man what if he was like this awesome dude well I'm just really nervous onstage income 7 just drops knowledge no he never was like that that's the thing if you go back and listen to him from when he was younger he was whip smart very smart guy very very clear sure all those very clear talk now this is this is a sign of decline it's it is what it is you wouldn't have my open conversation with all that shit that that Bernie Sanders thing was such a bummer why because he turned all stuff that I didn't stand up and like things that have said drunken podcast and put it in quotes as if I'm a homophobe or a transfer bore a racist or they just lied to make it look like Bernie was supporting some right-wing person but meanwhile I'm left-wing I've never never been right-wing my life but also those people don't matter but it didn't matter as much as it made me feel like this is a dirty business like I don't want to be a part of your dirtiest business there it's it's they're trying to change people's opinions with deception it's not like they're trying to tell you how good their guy is they're using deception yeah they're using fucker it's sleazy its sleazy it's a sleazy business it's not a meritocracy after Bernie came on to two other politicians reach out oh yeah oh yeah sure a lot yeah and they denied it too I got emails oh well they reached out to the publicist but I'm not interested in look I'm only interested in interviewing people that I thought were interesting I was interested in like Andrew yang Andrew sitting that guy like him - I like him oh my god I love tulsi gabbard I just think she's there too you know she's so dangerous to those people that they just they wouldn't want they were trying changing the rules to keep her from debating fuck after she sank Kamala Harris they like this lady's too dangerous Kamala Harris pretty hot you like her not bad this quarantines make me way I don't know man I'm using as like extra hugs camp I've been working out a lot I work out on things two three times a day man I ride my bike I could you know eight ten miles on that mountain bike we we went on a get on it we ran out of kettle bell so quick everybody ran out of kettle bells for at home work guys man everybody wants kettle bell because you can get an amazing workout in with one kettlebell you sit it in the corner of your house you know what a great workout fuck yeah dude I remember when I got that I'm not hating on pal time well I got Palatine Mike do that things for bitches now I'm on there every day every day sometimes two three times a day I do not think is fuck and I got a real bike oh it's not it's nowhere near the same it's a lot harder when you run that's obviously much harder going up hills and shit oh my god you're doing trails trails yeah trail bike right behind my house I'm like legit trails the thing that bugs me though is you look like you're running away to a mountain lion mountain lions have gone after bikers before I know I thought I thought of you two days ago I was on the trail is that 7 a.m. I was the first one there so you can just see the fresh mud I see these huge paw prints ooh and I was like I remember you going dude you'll have an eye for anything and I have this fanny pack that way I bribed with keep all my stuff and I'm like and I look down like I have nothing I have a knife from this company called half half face blades and the the and what is it like when you take a bunch of letters like ABC what is it called when you when you just say ABC you know the American boxing commission it's just an abbreviation it's sh p OS that's the name of the the knife it's a subhuman piece of shit so it's it's it's made it's like a spike like it's it's shaped like if you really wanted if you were in combat it's got a loop for your thumb so if you really wanted oh damn attacked by a cat I've thought this to have another one yeah I have another one yeah four of them I'll give you one of you want one I don't think you here no I don't have it here but I'll get you man please do yeah I was so scared that shit it's a it's a Navy SEAL run company oh hell yeah but this is a it's it's perfect I keep it on my have a neoprene fanny pack that I run in my cellphone sits in here and I have that motherfucker right that's all I do from now on I used to I was running with ear pods on and listening to music but problem is I've run with the dog all the time I want to be able to hear him and then also rattlesnakes yes you see the picture oh my god dude I so I was on the truck sent it to you yes I like dude look at this fucking around it was a dragon straight-up dragon and I have nothing it was so thick so the thing is like you're not fighting a rattle with a knife you know I mean look at look at that fucker no that was someone someone sent that to me it's on his it's right there that fucking thing dude look at the look at this why is this fucker yeah that's a big snake man look how thick he is booth and I was like oh look it feel that's a serpent brother I didn't see that count it's so fuck you buddy dude that so again I usually run with headphones on and that day I was running I was on my bike and I just I took one out for whatever reason I'm running and I hear something and I looked I see I'm like holy fuck and I'm not scared of lap I'm scared of snakes I really am you should be scared of rattlesnakes because if they get you it's a mess well I'm usually with my son snake thing about all the time I was looking at a house once and there was a rattlesnake right in the front yard wow that's a bad sign I killed it did you stomp on its head yeah fuck yeah cuz I was like first of all it's these people's house you know even if I don't buy this house if they have kids or dogs they did have a kid dude yeah we have to but my wife is like that's a bad time she's right yeah yeah but with that I'm like and I wanted to go that way I was going back home downhill I'm like dude please don't make me go back around 6 miles uphill it's such a nightmare and I was like I'm just gonna buck and run by and I just had this vision my head if him fucking leashing out if I like so how's it gone we get some rock so I throwing rocks at him this thing didn't give a fuck dude it was hit him in the head and just staring at me went he's pretty gangster I'm gonna go back the long way what the long way dude I was so scared man you should be you get bit by a rattlesnake it is a real nightmare I'm in the middle of nowhere I'd be so fucked it causes a necrosis all around the injury like tissue rots away there's some horrible websites that will show you what it looks like when someone gets bit by a rattlesnake and then they have to have multiple multiple surgeries to skin grafts all this shit all that tissue around the injury dies is one guy got bit on his arm and I want to say it took him like 13 surgeries to get back the use of his arm but I mean over years like huge like huge rotting hole where the bite was where you could see the bone and the mountain line I'm thinking because I saw the big print I'm like that's a big fucking cat man how big was it on your hand a little small in my hand they're big and they're out there there's a lot of a man just if they're hungry try finding deer these days well the last time you saw a deer can tell you especially around yeah tell you there should be deer everywhere if there's a deer and there's a buck and a doe and then there's a there's a bunch of other dough's there should be deer everywhere it should be like Pennsylvania where you like you you can't drive at night for you're worried about hitting them Pennsylvania doesn't have any mountain lions we got a fuckload of cats and we have Bobcats too we have coyotes I'll fuck a bobcat up you think you would I don't think you had a 40-pound cat trying to kill you you'd be freaked out oh for sure stupid face killing you is like it might be able to kill you but I want to have something where I'm gonna plunge it into his fucking eyeball give me that knife do ya please it's like a spike I thought a few seniors website go to the half-face bit blades website and I thought of you comin on the show being like you guys you and Brian sad and Eddie's there and I'm gone my son Toby and you being like I fuckin told them I fuck if you got killed by a mountain I said food out there and wear a fucking ghillie suit and be hiding in the bushes that's what it looks like yeah but though it's wrapped with it's not a metal handle it's wrapped with paracord said you see there's an image of it with the paracord yeah well either way I'm shoving that thing into some mountain lions eyeball it's so stressful yeah I stopped taking my son on that path we go in a much smaller one though yeah man there's a lot of wildlife out there but at least we don't have grizzly bears you know at least we don't have god man I'm just so scared now scared packing heat I got to do something and I go I go deep man I go down the mountain on my bike that's a good one to a spike I think said yeah but I want to be able to cut to not just puncture I'll just fucking yeah the subhuman piece of sheds my knife that's what I arrive I've thought it through but but your dog hasn't encountered any snakes or anything no no he hasn't but my other dogs had my Frank Sinatra my pitbull okay when he was alive he had been bitten three different times by rattlesnakes on the never on the nose yeah on his face that's when they died though right he was good dog with a tank he'd be so crazy his face swole up like a balloon and I had to bring him in have you seen the the I saw some research they're saying is rattlesnakes are aware that the rattle gives them away and people are killing them so they're not rattling as much anymore no geez that's the nurse study they found out so they're evolving they're evolving realizing the rattles give them away to humans so and they get killed so that's smarter and they're not rattling as much Jesus Christ so I see that big snake I go the other way I see an old man walking down I go dude there's the biggest rattlesnake you've ever seen about 500 yards away he was really oh yeah goes I have to go this way my wife and kid are down there and they're coming up he was can you show me where I go sure I walked down I go he's right he's not there and then behind it through here dude so scared I was running with my dogs once we're going down this hill on this trail and I ran over this stick and as I'm in the air over the stick I realized it's a rattlesnake oh shit yeah it's a big one like as thick as my forearm I holy fuck that was the biggest nigga ever did he do anything nope just laid there and then I started throwing rocks at them and I screaming at my dogs to back up Jesus I threw rocks at him he got off the trail and he slithered into the bushes it's so scared I was a time ago that was more than ten years ago but I remember what was happening I was like whoa I was like that is a big fucking scene fat dick around you're not gonna do shit like it bite you it's not like there's gonna be this tussle no no no if it bites you fucks fucking out yeah you're fucked and it's so bad you don't suck the poison out or cut it or any of that stuff that people say you wet it with a cold damp cloth and you get to a doctor as quickly what about a tourniquet I don't think so I don't think you're supposed to do that I don't I think that's all bullshit I think what it does is it digests the meat see what a rat what rattlesnake venom does is like when it stabs a rabbit or some shit it's it doesn't have like it's it's not an animal that digests things the way that we do and I think one of the things it does is the poison helps digest the meat because they're poison doesn't just like kill the thing and paralyze things but it also breaks down the tissue so then when it's eating it it's like the necrosis of the tissue might have made all that up not since liquid did you hear that there's that rapper I think Mike Mike Nutt Mike stead Mike Posner so he was running from Thalia in Colorado I think I forget where is that yeah bit by a baby rattlesnake which is more dangerous because babies don't know how to control their venom the big ones do babies just like a fucking they release all their venom so it's supposed to be more dangerous to get bit by a baby I heard that's a myth I might have made that up no I don't think you did it up heard it before but then I remember reading that baby rattlesnakes are no more deadly than regular really I know Mike Posner was fucked up yeah cuz he'd do a rap in every city and then he was like doing a rap from his hospital bed fuck up he was he was it ruined his shit he was stuck in there for weeks weeks yeah because the baby rattler really fucked him up oh well my dogs got fucked up three different times my female she got fucked up once and my male got fucked up three times so three different times I had to bring them in one time they both got fucked up but they're fine yeah but they had to get anti-venom and it's yeah it's expensive it's several thousand dollars for the anti-venom so think about war be Mountain Elk in the snake yeah of course it's expensive yep some fucking dude milking the snakes but you know you can get immune to that shit guys they milk snakes and then they give themselves like a little bit of the time and eventually they get immune to it no nuts pretty nuts yeah like they'll snake dudes fuck ever seen them those dudes who handle snakes in in church services oh my god fucking yeah man what the fuck that's some old-school fire and brimstone shit man handling snakes have you seen that evil priest he has like this real evil house and his boys and I'm gonna blow little racist yeah that's that same guy that he got interviewed by some woman she was asking him do you think that poor people are demons I never said that he's so scared you can tell you what's the hit a bitch what is his name again Kenneth Copeland is that it yeah not he's a scary scary dude he's got a lot of money tons of flights driving and shit jets but now you can't have a crowd so it's just him and his boys and they help they're all appraised do you blow it away Wow crowd yeah it's really weird he's doing the show with no crowd I think he bought his jet from Tyler Perry hello Tyler Perry's jet fucking ride he did you know that's weird as Wrestlemania did it with no crown yeah you thought wrestling was weird before try and watch it with no crowd so strange it's so weird things with no crown like people that are doing stand-up with no crowd need to stop doing stand I would know crowd he stopped doing it stop doing that we got our text though he's silly thin video that people don't stand with us cry it's tough well not only that but the people that are doing stand-up another crowd they're not good at it to begin with they're not good at it with a crowd so then they do it with no crowd and like oh my god this is a disaster it's such a it's the biggest disaster yeah doesn't work oh my god it's so tough to watch on stage with no crowd and then just like their punch line it's just like oh fuck I know people are talking about doing zoom stand-up wait this out really it's gonna come down to can't if they can do that with snake venom can't they do that with the fucking Corona we'll figure a little bit I'm so I'm so optimistic about things I got a show end of June and spoke in Washington yeah a lot of deaths but now they're the best because they've gone through it so now it's took its way down there that's interesting Washington California's kicking ass the Washington's kicking morass in California because they fucking peaked what's the Jamie what's the latest and when California is gonna open up see if it says is interesting the Los Angeles County tried to have gun stores shut down saying that they're not essential and they put the kibosh on that with a quickness hell no quickness do your you're a shooter now I'm a shooter now it's fun I like it that's fun as fuck it was a good time right that's fine it's good to know it's good to know how to shoot accurately and that might guns at home but I can't but I mean I've only shot it once and it's just that you know some bullshit not like with legit trainers and coaches yeah it's great right so fun you get good at it I'm gonna go back out there but you have to shoot the cool gun right did you or no calendar I'm sorry you shot it before that day you'll do you go yeah I left shortly after you can talent state yeah no it's um it's a good thing to learn it's a good thing to learn to learn how to handle a gun learn how to use it correctly learn all the safety procedures but learn how to do it accurately use the proper technique it's like everything else like martial arts or everything you know you need to know how to do it right you get familiar with it yeah makes a big difference man you know and doing it Terran tactical where they trained Keanu Reeves for John wick and Halle Berry trained there for John wick three and you know he trains a bunch of people from movies is the real deal yes nice guy too a lot of cops there too you know a lot of a lot of people practicing that need it for the line to do yeah I was interesting he was saying he has a lot of Special Forces guys there and I was like oh do they just kill this yes it's not really their thing he goes there a lot of them coming that they you know they don't do great because that's not it's just not what they practice I use once they get it down the other monsters but at first no yeah the thing is killing bad guys yeah thing is not hitting metal targets well yeah they're you know they the training training with a gun it's like training with everything else you know it's like the more you do it the better you get at it it's not simple it's just most people don't get the opportunity to do what we did to train with a guy like Taryn and and correctly learn how to do it from a real master like that a guy was one you know countless competitions he's fast with it it's a weird thing right to be able to be really good at shooting something how about I go can you imagine I tell you and Brian ago can you imagine shooting a human like this you sure can sure can imagine if someone broke in your house Brendan no yeah no damn good yeah you could yeah we're that's one of the weird things there's so many people that I know that a real anti-gun that got guns when this whole thing went down a buddy of mine I want to say his name but his wife was like you can never have a gun in this house he's like okay okay soon as his shit went down she's like we need to get again immediately yeah yeah immediately yeah my full James Anthony Smith fights home intruder man charged with criminal trespass yeah you were telling me about that apparently the guy was tough to like Smith said and smaller than him he said the guy was like 170 pounds and the guy took everything he could throw out he's on meth said no normal human being is is able to fight like that he said I'm by no means the baddest dude on the planet listen he's top 100 oh and all the humans on the planet Anthony Smith with top 100 baddest motherfuckers in the earth but he's a regular Joe and I had a hard time dealing with him and he took everything I gave him every punch every knee every elbow he took every single one of them and kept fighting me at one point Smith said his mother-in-law brought him a kitchen knife which she held to have her man who continued to fight him why didn't you just choke him unconscious that's a legit point why don't you just choke the fuck out of them yeah I just happened said hey I'm sorry as he walked by after things calm down hey man I'm sorry I'm sorry tried to kill you he said there was blood off the computer and habberman was cut and had swelling on his face yeah did he but he didn't lay anything on that thing I think your speed - unstuck it but the guy took it the fact that the guy only weighed 170 pounds and it says Smith fights it 205 pounds he's walking around 230 yeah he's smashing this dude that's you know a legit 60 pounds lighter than I'm which is crazy said experience a wide range of emotions afterwards I like Smith a lot he's a very intelligent dude have you heard him as an analyst here's a future in that future he's got a future in fighting - I wanna you know I mean I think after he fought John Jones he got the rub and he looked fantastic it looked great with gustafson know if you remember that fight he could have easily won that fight with that DQ he remember that yeah I think John hit him and they go do you want you want continued fighting I do you want come on he goes he hit him with a lone knee all right I think is do you remember that yeah it was a knee when he's down and he goes you want to stop the fighting he would have won the fight and he was that's not my style he was to continue the fight that's interesting I don't remember that yeah I remember it vaguely he's a badass man he is he's a very very smart guy what are you if you're gonna act out and make the news now's the time cuz like with John yeah like what dude we're trying to not die wouldn't go fuck with John's doing like we know about Jane angry we know about John yeah but the world doesn't you think no but like you but like even with Kobe's death like have you heard anyone talk like that you before this came that was it was so heavy with Quran no one's really even mentioned it we should were so focused on this fucking virus yeah yeah it's interesting I'm I'm curious to see when all is said and done how many more people died of the flu than of dying of kovat yes because it's gonna be higher the flu doors are gonna be higher it's what I mean imagine if we just do this every time there's a flu there's a shutdown don't you don't you think at some point with society we're gonna get to a point where people are sick of being quarantined and they're gonna look at the numbers and go okay these are the odds of me in it and thoughts of me surviving it I'm not I'm not gonna live my life like this man yeah you shouldn't because the odds are you you know dying from driving in the same way I mean the other thing is what people leave the house they're good you you're putting people at danger okay do you drive well you're putting people at danger you know how many people die every year 30,000 people die every year from motor vehicle accidents the United States we'll think about thinking about lives have been saved because the quarantine of because the no car crashes that's a good point except have you noticed how people are driving like fucking idiots I Drive a hundred 70 miles an hour everywhere I drive like I robbed the bank and it's out of the other day when I got to calm down dudes I spun my car out getting on the 405 and really about dude it's no one's out it's fucking fucking gt2 I never get to drive like this so crazy you can't drive like that in that car that car Stu bonkers it's so fun dude and no one's on Topanga Canyon or Malibu Canyon dude it's so weird right we'll put a GoPro on you guys should see the way I Drive one of the things this makes me realize how much I would love living in a smaller town I like it when there's no traffic man it's nice it just feels different when you're driving around it feels more relaxed you want to see that I'm realizing how off CL is huge but like to get the Pasadena or Hollywood or Santa Monica with no traffic easy if he wears like 18 minutes away it's so naughty yes yes two hours of its regular shit I know right like how much is it just get to San Diego right now it's an hour and ten minutes so easy yeah San Diego is a nightmare driving to San Diego dude when I do La Jolla oh you have to do a Thursday night show yeah what time do you leave I leave at noon I leave at noon I left that 11:00 last time it still took me three and a half hours yeah Elevens probably better because then you don't get that three o'clock traffic oh you hit that three if you don't get past the OC by two o'clock you're fine the OC is the world traffic on earth it's like right up there with Mexico City Orange County so crazy there's so many people jammed into Orange County how many they must have a lot of kovat 19 in not as bad as this rewrite all of California's kind of kicking ass I don't know mmm two and a half hours to downtown San Diego right now it says that yeah that's a nice that's how you drive like a bitch I saw I started looking at ways to kind of moderate even but you know you when you talk to a portion thues it's like dude don't fuck don't touch it don't touch your cars too fast as it is you're not gonna make it faster it's just so good the gt2 is a rare perfect car it's perfection they just it's one of those rare cars we're right off the assembly line they nailed it I love that it's a beast of a car ma'am do you think you could ever live in San Diego that's one of the places I think I can live dude me too I'll start him out with Cal and I said if I didn't have to be in LA for entertainment purposes and stand-up I'd move to La Jolla yes the house in La Jolla and it's quiet good families yeah very nice and restaurants coffee cliffs do you know how many restaurants are they gonna be open how quick do you think everything bounces back people have to have to bounce back so I bet people gonna be eager to bounce back man right but the restaurants that are going under it's gonna take a long time for they rebuild and reopen the other thing is because you're obviously a theater slash arena act I think it's me I think September October is gonna be fine free but June July August and theaters me tough hmm yeah unless they ask people to wear masks or some shit or maybe maybe maybe at the you know the the regular kind of comedy places like the comedy zones and helium's it's people coming in test their temperature coming in you know but then you're in line with all those people like imagine if you're in line and some dudes got the fever and you you right in front of you and they test him like sir you have to leave I saw World War Z the other day not a good idea not a good idea during all this dude those people were time out of shape if zombies come here you're even more fucked yeah you know my thing about zombies were always in The Walking Dead why is this lasting years how are there still zombies what are you what the fuck what are they eating how are they staying alive zombies they're slow zombies the slow zombies I feel like we could wipe them out in a day yeah why are they so slow and then then Zee world is like fuck that and they're like roasting zombies yeah well the 28 days later were the first fast zombie that's true they were the first fast zombies they were the scary zombie 'he's 28 days later still to me from my money that's the scariest fucking horror movie it's a scary assam zombie movie i should looks realistic the world wars ease up there though man mmm it's not as violent there's some violence in 28 days later really Jesus Christ where people have to hack other people apart that their loved ones yeah like boyfriends and girlfriends hack each other apart but they realized the person just got it and they're about to turn well how about Brad Pitt with his girl there on the plane she got Benny fucking hacks arm off remember I don't know before they on the plane she got bit and he's like let me see your arm and he's like bye down this hae-joo she cuts her arm off now they're on the plane and they're chillin everything's all good and then someone out the zombie comes out the back and he's like oh shit takes the grenade throws it on the plane why do I have to remember this do this movie's fantastic Brad Pitt's my favorite yeah yeah because they're there and she's biting down and he's like bite down no it's on the plane you know on the planes when he throws the bomb see she got bit right here Oh see I got this way saves my life oh that's right he's Oh bitch hmm Brad Pitt style Doug oh yeah I think Brad I didn't get that far in the movie oh well yeah and then well I watched it the first time I got that far but the other night only got an hour into it great night not even I think I got 40 minutes into it fantastic movie and I was like do you think Brad Pitt sleeps with nad trips or what do you think why does he look like that he looks great I know I know weird right like how's he doing that I don't know genetic week when he took off his shirt for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood I'm liking this guy timepiece Leslie's 32 years old ridiculous yeah not fat at all nothing what do you think that's just constant exercise genetics and then meanwhile no Instagram posts of him lifting at all does he even have an Instagram do you got famous you have to be to not have an Instagram how about your pal your pal doesn't have an Instagram me there nothing nothing people that are smart they just like why am I doing this you could do you could do without it you and you like it but you could do without it nothing would change for you yeah but it helps to have ability to express yourself if something comes up you know and like if you want to promote something if you need to let people know about something that's quiet like your shows yeah I think you'd be alright yeah but when you do want to ring us you really kind of need something like that you know some 15,000 tickets let people know otherwise they have to let them know through other means that cost money how does she do us like Live Nation hitters he does mostly theaters to him you'll find out he's in a place that has 3,000 tickets they're gone like good going it's like when you go from 3,000 to like Madison Square Garden and then you're into 18 thousands and I in New York you're doing regular math Square Garden yeah you're doing big boy I'm doing Boston Garden the week later back to back I love it yeah it's crazy how about the comics who got their special on Netflix up like right during the corn team's Sakura cry sure next week daliyah's two's doing up daliyah's Tuesday yeah it's a good move it's the best move yeah and the comics I can't do Schulz and fucking Thiel Vaughn who we're gonna we were gonna shoot it like last month and air it either fucked well they're not far they're gonna it's like it's always better anyway it just tightens your material up you spend more no but no one can do material though yeah but you're gonna have time to think about it it's your time to change your perspective some things I think all those any thought do you have as a comic it's almost there's a time where it's too much but most of the time you put them out and you're like God I wish I had a couple more time or yeah almost always everything I've ever done I wish I had three more months yeah I wish I would waited six more years well also I tell everybody when you're doing stand-up and you're doing a special the special is only 60 to 70 percent as funny as it is being there it's never as funny as no matter who it is because they're part of the fun is you're at a live show with all these people you know transid funny off the vibe you're missing most of that with the Netflix hey you stop watching Tiger King did you go all the way I finished it I'm only on we did episode 5 last night so I have two more to go ok but you're kind of in the thick of it I wouldn't think of it did you get where the guy has the hot nanny No coming up okay he's like the hottest man you've ever seen really well it's uh this show is fucking so strange but if you had a TV show like a fiction show that was that strange you and believe it you wouldn't believe it you go this shows too over-the-top how about the straight kid he just turned gay just needed meth Trump moles a joe exotic pardon I'll bring a suck have you seen that you know how he's doing his his his press conference

goes which one was it Donnelly knew it was dong dongs kind of crazy but it's um I don't know if I didn't get to the part where they go into detail about the murder-for-hire conviction so I don't I don't know if he did or didn't do it my thing yeah I mean I'm like s word for you I don't know if he did or didn't light his place on fire definitely did definitely did okay did that woman feed her husband to the tiger I don't know but you know what sucks for her let me stop definitely did definitely did but you know it sucks for her you know it sucks for got away with it because things such a

video of his wedding online that is it real yeah yeah played it in the show yeah yeah but like I they'll cover the full video of it like people's in this this is apparently a pretty wild tape - it's 23 minutes long and these two guys that were both straight are well how does that mean but what is straight did they get their dick hard did they fuck guys like your K well now there's okay well but

and he goes well big dick II was then you ain't that game that's somebody's joke I think it's Ron whites or Dahmer eras but it's a joke that's interesting you said Joe exotic said that in the show right yeah and I was like oh that's funny that straight he said yeah yeah so that's his new guy that's the new guy I got two that watch Joe exotic so thick he's in a coronavirus isolation believe he contracted it really I he said he did i boy do anything sell some fucking Harvey Weinstein got it well we think it think about your inside a fucking prison there's no ventilation you're in there with a bunch of dudes who have nothing to live for everyone's cooped up no windows nothing's open you can't get any air in there if someone's got something everybody gets something to make it sit it goes like fire through bushes through the whole cell block or imagine what do you do let him go yeah Chicago Jail is top u.s. hot spot as virus spreads behind bars leaves 1324 confirmed coronavirus cases are tied to prisons and jails across the United States including at least 32 deaths Wow what's that percentage thirty-two of the thirteen hundred it's pretty good I like my odds like my odds I'll take those odds you ever have these CBD kill cliffs not have it drink that is a caffeine in them no 25 milligrams of CBD why not whoo yeah that you should drink a little whiskey man you want to fuck yeah okay what else what else are we gonna drink at home go get Jimmy's gonna get some glasses get some glasses and a little bit of ice peel show after this yeah I'm doing something with Ari I'm doing

got freaked out he fled the city he should yeah no smart move yeah I dunno I like so many people fled the city I mean that's the city's basically I mean John Joseph sent me a video the other day of me on the massive square garden billboard and I suppose the streets it's great no one there it's it's crazy it's everyone's dead oh are you left because I scared Corona yes I thought you saying are you letting because the COBE thing no people forgot about that by now are you good baby yeah they probably forgot about it you know there's a few people that have not forgot about thank you sir a few people that have not but yeah he won't do that again no this lesson I hope so Jesus Christ it was a bad move all said Artie's always been nice to me he's a great guy cheers brother hey not good for the immune system but good for the he'll be all right a little bit this is a little drinky-poo a day not bad for you I've been drinking one glass of wine every day really supposed to be really I've never felt better you don't realize how much traveling and flying fuck you up I feel great the fucks you are bad I've been thinking about that a lot I've been reading a lot of choices you know how comics do residency's in Vegas yes why do a residency in LA like if you want to come you want to come see me I'm at the fucking ace theater or I'm at you should do that I'm thinking about it man you're at that level you should that's a brilliant idea I'm thinking about going on the road sometimes but being here a lot more think of many people who travel to LA to see you yeah well we get a lot about the Comedy Store man we got a lot we get a lot of international tourists to people that know that I'm not going to Ireland so or I'm not going to Scotland so they'll come here so you should do that I'm sure I should but I know I'm not going oh no I'm going but I'm saying you should yeah LA I'm going to Ireland yeah April 2020 yeah a guy would go but I mean I'm still doing a lot of shows but I'm doing shows in LA to like I'm at the Forum on October 4 on November 1st fuck yeah boy 2 yeah um I'm still doing like the regular shows I'm assuming you know I'm assuming there won't be a second wave of corona or some sort of crying be fine man yeah that's a brilliant idea the residency in LA there's two Vegas Vegas sucks cock well think about what I do with the Improv and at the store or have this Joe Rogan and Friends shows and you do them all the time if you're two three times a week yeah I think I'm a people that is well that's what I'm saying like no one else a lot of other guys aren't doing that either but you can do that could yeah so you do I'm doing but that to me is like the best way for me to stay sharp you're definitely animal 45 minutes an hour how many guys you know not your level who are doing 45 most are just doing their 15-minute spot at the store at the improv or factor you're a different animal you got it you got to do that though you have to name one of the guy Joe's doing that um I don't know go wait I'm not paying attention but I am there's no one else that does that like you well I do it because I doing arenas you know and you're doing an arena mountain you gotta be and I've only started doing arenas the last two years you got to be sharp can't you can't be fucking around there's 15,000 people paid money to hear you talk I'm just constantly I've I've worked harder this past year to like wrap everything up than I ever have would stand up yeah that's inspiring makes me realize that there's more you can get more out of it you can get more you know you can put more work in and get a little bit sharper more listening to sets more writing more more thinking you know it's more you know the thing is like people expect you as a stand-up to drop off after a while that's what a lot of comics do their material drops off they run out of things that are interesting especially when they get famous that's the problem they don't relate to the to the average person also they don't take as many chances no they don't say is money because yeah you it's different you know yeah I get it it is what it is man you know you're gonna gonna break a few eggs but you're gonna make a lot of omelets yeah I just meant I soeul cruelty I think good thing I miss the most besides going on the road miss it so bad it's just hanging out with seeing everybody I mean I Tex everybody was just not the same is it no it's not Joey I'd offer you this joint but I know you don't wanna I'm good it's get really weird if I not stop yeah Joey Joey just calls so I spend a lot of time talking to him yeah but it's um it's not the same it's not the same going to the store it's like dude the party when we get back what is that gonna be like we get back to the store and everyone's at the back bar and everyone's hanging out everyone's doing shows again we're gonna be so thankful because we it's never been taken away before in the history of comedy there's never been a time where you couldn't perform never never I guess the only time with La comics when there's the strike right yeah but you could do the road yeah not sure my guys were doing it though there's like Leno doing the road back down you'd be back then la those guys weren't big enough names that's interesting I wonder how many of our comedy clubs were around back then cuz I was into what the 70s or 80s 70s right late 70s you had lemma Leno do you read that book dying up here no that's what the series was based off of yeah but the series is real dark the books makes it seem like it was a fucking like the store was fun man do you think the store was more fun than more fun now you tell me dude you're you know I don't know I don't know that I don't know anything different like I read those times I think back then it was like a lot of guys were doing stand-up to get TV shows or didn't notice and now you have like a bunch most of the top guys all they want to do is be really good comics well you get your freedom that way and you don't have anybody telling you what to do and you don't have to worry about so many different things that you have to worry about if you have a TV show TV shows you have to worry about the other actors the writing the network does it get picked up does it this does it that a lot of chefs in the kitchen so many things outside of your control and you know if you have a controversial controversial Act a lot of times the network's don't want you to do stand-up well apparently they did that to Tim Allen when he had that a home improvement show they told him stop doing stand-up yeah like stop it's me so much means like I think Bob Saget - when he was doing Full House he didn't do any stand-up and you watch you stand I miss surprise you're like Oh Dave's a dirty boy yeah dirty yeah it's a dirty boy and people here can eat an of dirty I know and you hear that you're like what I know this is outrageous yeah there's a there's a freedom to stand up but it's also like I think more people appreciate it as an art form now whereas back then it was like it didn't get respect it was a if you got respect when you're on TV incorrect that's how you made your nut and that's how you got famous - yeah or a movie you were doing movies you know now once you say it stand up in podcasting yeah really yeah well podcasting is right now it's emerging as a different beast see before people would joke about it there we go what are you doing like Howard Stern used to make fun of it like why not just yell out your window yeah what are you doing and you know but he was coming from you got to think he's a pioneer and radio and traditional radio and he made his bones and radio and he carved this path and radio and then also this thing comes along where anybody can do it that's a threat of a threat it's a little bit of that but it's also see in a way I understand his perspective because in his day when he made it he had to compete against all these other killers alright so you got all these other morning guys all over the country and then when he goes insyndicate so he'll invade Chicago he's invading Los Angeles trying to take over take it over but there was only a few slots right so you couldn't he couldn't listen to his show later you had to listen to it then yep so everyone's competing during these slots so you have this slot that is 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. that's drive time baby even now he doesn't know podcast something like I remember I used to listen to Howard for a long time and probably like maybe a year ago they brought up something because he was shit on podcasting is do podcasters even make money and one of the guys got on there you know I forget his cruise name because I think Joe Rogan does he is I know but what not not tons of money like it's not it's not set I want to call Mike a longtime listener first-time caller mm-hm well doesn't matter what man I just thought it was weird like dude you still you still don't give it respect like you shitting me oh who do you think he's hanging around with though you know his wife yeah probably hang on his wife maybe a few other really rich friends that are probably famous I mean I don't know how much you can't have your ear to the ground being a guy on radio all the fucking time it's almost impossible it's almost impossible to keep it together you know what bummed me out and again I'm a huge Howard Stern fan I think you and I think maybe I forget who sent it to me by sense to you when Howard Stern it released that to his employees he has like a yearly like meeting with his employees someone recorded it it makes you feel so sick like oh fuck dude such a bummer you realize how Hollywood is you're all oh fuck dude mmm I think people get seduced by it man I think they do they get seduced by the idea of you know what first of all you need friends you need really good friends that are like you that are in your world I think one of the things that separates us all of us as comics from a rest of Hollywood's like goddamn work glued to each other yes we're glued and we shit on each other and we laugh and we compliment each other and we love each other we call each other we tell each other we love each other yeah 100% full support it's different men it's different we're a different thing and no one but also it's not a dog-eat-dog know was trying to help dude when someone murders it everybody's running out of that room telling everybody that murdered it and when you see Bill burr go onstage in the main room and crush it you're coming out and saying it and I'm coming out and saying it and Cowan saying it we're all excited like goddamn that was awesome what a set holy shit and with telling people you see Burke rush it oh my god he crushed it you know there's a there's a love for the art and a love for each other and the the camaraderie like the the wanting people to be good you realize like it doesn't have to just be about you and they didn't I don't think they I think that's you know we're talking about competition earlier we're talking about Jordan enticing the crazies you know the like that's Howard Stern when it comes to radio man you gotta realize that that's the motherfucker that he he fucked them all have you heard him up have you heard him apologized for it the way he treated some people yes I think one guy like commit suicide he's like I felt bad for that you know guess he would go in he was like at that time that's what I had to do well that's what he did right whether he had to do it or not that's what he did work no they don't like yeah it did work and you felt like you had to do and look he's also we have to everything you have to look into you gotta look in it with perspective and in my head what Howard Stern is always gonna represent is the guy who paved the way yeah like without him you got to realize there was nothing like Howard Stern before Howard Stern that what didn't exist you had Don Imus who's kind of risque and then here comes this really tall long-haired rock and roll type dude it doesn't give a fuck and he just wants to have porn stars on and girls were riding vibrators and people are farting songs and the microphones it's madness and he's getting sued by the government man so that the government that they're coming down with these huge judgments against the company that owns it and he keeps going and he keeps going podcasts all are you know patrice used to say like Patrice you say about other comics that like Dave Attell David tells got a lot of babies and what he meant is that there's a lot of other comics that would imitate Dave Attell they would do it just out of the fact that they were fans and they were insecure and they're doing they're not they're not plagiarists they just were not that good yet when I was young man I sounded I used to sound exactly like Richard Jeni really heard myself on stage when I'd been doing an open I caught myself doing like a bad Richard Jeni impression with my material when I was like 21 or something like a 22 like oh my god I'm terrible because I was such a Richard Jeni fan at the time that I was like mimicking him on stage not purpose a lot of comics do it man we find that our selves doing it with different acts I find myself and some time copying a lot of mannerisms like Brian or D'Elia because you're around them all those are my I'm molded by that so that's my normal yeah but then eventually like you break out of it and you become your own thing yeah we gotta all realized that what Howard Stern did before anybody was he created this radio chaos they created this chaos we had these these people those wack Packers were out of their fucking minds and he would interview them and and talk to all these nice fucking people that was the first one then remember yet celebrities on but he wasn't like oh how's your movie bike who he fucking yeah and then they went answer it but then he'd circle back down somehow get it out of the suit it was a different world back then the world was different and and he made it possible for people to talk the way we talk and then Opie and Anthony were the next important phase because would Opie and Anthony where we're a hang where as Howard is the man behind the switchboard and Howard is in control was in his users with Opie and Anthony people would just show up like I'd be on the air and it would be like four or five other comics there and we would we would love it and Jim Jim notices all the time all the time Jim was a regular he's so talented he's he's one of the more unique comics ever he's a very interesting guy I love Jim his love of transsexuals and how he just sees the way talks he's just so honest and raw but would open Anthony were the first loose hang you know it's like Anthony would kind of be orchestrating it a little bit where he like keeping everybody making sure you know keeping an eye on everything making sure it didn't get out of hand and then Anthony is this very he's a guy who grew up doing construction and and that's literally how he got into radio but it's also very intelligent very inquisitive so he's got like a regular guy sensibility but he's also very fucking smart yeah and then he would have you have all these comics and then Norton who's a great comic himself would be there they'd be Colin Quinn and and bill burr and me and shafir and all this madness man it was nothing like that really now nan radio on a radio but that's what made podcasts become what they are because like those guys let comics just hang out and talk no one had ever let comics just hang out and run the show before Opie and Anthony so the big steps to podcasting where Howard Stern is the most important and then after Howard Stern these are Howard Stern's babies Howard Stern's babies are like Opie and Anthony where Howard Stern's babies but they became their own thing just like a comic would imitate Dave Attell when he's a young guy and then as he gets older he finds his own speed and there's a lot of comics right now that are like top level guys that I bet if you watched them 10 15 years ago they would sound a lot like someone else and then Opie and Anthony opened up the door to podcasting because they made comics where they could just hang and then everyone's got their own style like Ron Funches has his own style Eric Griffin has his own style you and Brian have your own style Theo's got his completely yoona style all of us have these different things Segura's got his style christina pazsitzky and him together have their style Segura and Kreischer crisis got to stop our ego to style Burton Bird yes I have a great podcast too but it's just like the world is more bountiful than it was back then it's not like Bert and burr are competing against Bert well I mean what if Bert's show was one was run by one production company but Bert and Bert were run by a different they're both gonna be at noon and you have to listen to one of the other and Bert and burro in this fucking argument you've traitor you know you were you was lost together a fuck you and who you know now they're gonna take us out of noon you know yeah that's that's that was what they had to deal with it was a totally different dynamic now it's a totally it's like we were trapped in these tunnels fighting for air and pop and we got to the top of the tunnel and there's all the air you want it's free air free air you could just put up a podcast put up a video put up put up a make a video make a sketch you do with your sketch can do whatever do you want and then it might get seen by a million P like that fucking coronavirus song that i reposted on my Instagram those dudes are hilarious how many millions have use did that get millions and millions of views so these guys they create this coronavirus song they paid it's on my Instagram who are the who the gentleman that I mean I got a couple people saying that they've also created the song first or whatever I don't know who robbed but whoever those dudes were hilarious and it got millions and millions of views there's nothing from 20 years ago 30 years ago where a regular guy could do something and by itself would get millions and millions of views but today if you see some shit that's really funny and you sent it to me and I send it to Jamie and it just starts going if that's what happens it goes through people these dudes I'm seeing like four million six hundred eighty-five thousand six hundred forty four views on my Instagram alone can we play it or no no I hope I'm sure they had the it's their song but it's yeah it's Reggie Reggie baby - and somehow or another he's got he's doing so well that he's got fake Instagram sites where people pretend they're him but all this shit is funny all this shit is just they're doing sketches so these are Chicago based guys it's just funny dudes in Chicago that are hustling and they're constantly making content constantly they have new videos up all the time and who else is on him his Instagram that video just go to it so we could see it the other guys the other one is Stix XS STI X underscore 808 and then funny man Kaitlyn GA itl i N and then laid three those are the dudes who did it and then Vinny Pazienza box-cutter posi who was has been on the podcast before I found it on his Instagram so I reposted his but it's but imagine that 30 years ago or one one dude can make something and it could go to something like you know Instagram we're in this case three or four dudes could do it and go to something Instagram then also millions of people are singing it laughing and it's hilarious oh but even even think with Burt and Burt that okay we want to do a show think of the 80s or 90s you'd have to pitch it to network right have them approve it yeah they bring in rioters you're looking at how long would that take to evolve into a legit show they seem greenlit then get a pilot then test well yeah no no chance yeah we'd also people would start fucking with it they would come in bur I want you to address different I want you to dress I want you to once like Sinatra I see you people taking you more seriously if you were gonna save custom too much bird can you tone it down you seem aggressive imagine if I went to a production company and said yeah what I want to do is like smoke weed and talk about shit and say things I don't really mean but I think it's funny at the time that I regret it and I drink a lot oh and then we're gonna air the fight we're gonna smoke weed and we're gonna talk shit but but also I'm gonna have presidential candidates a really sick show and scientists and me a guy with brain damage I'm gonna debate it important to everybody back out of this office well when Brian and I wrapped Fox they they want to make it a TV show like a legit TV show remember that Mouse dude dude I remember when they were telling you to not curse yes and I was like get out now I remember yelling at you they're like vampires they're trying to bite you they're trying to turn you remember me and Brian in that meeting cost and I was like this is what but meanwhile they liked you because of who you were before they came along and before they came along you were cussing and then they want to do a sport they didn't know what to do is then I went do a sport show us then they brought me in and go they go they go so we know what to find the kid what if we really what if we replays Brian count with Michael Rapaport no yep they want to get rid of Brian mmm-hmm Wow it's because he's all because of his haircut because it's old and you just talk shit or what is it the way a dress is because I can fix that that's great what a bunch of dummies this is this is great let's fuck it up and this thing that I really like ruin it but then they they're like wait they're making how much money and we'd signed another now so I hate next year the deals up in December we're gonna need half and I went oh that's not happening all right well December's you last last month and I think we're in October I go that's fine we're gonna go do our own thing and take all the money there okay and then I never forget this goes I don't hear about the second podcast just right out December and I can't do that dude I look the listener no I'm leaving he was don't do that no all right cool next day I go in the pockets of so in December our contracts up still and half our shit I tried going back the next day and with their security out front they wouldn't let me in Rios my last day at Fox really you know let me just start doing it Brandon way back well that's the real clear changing of the guard we're that old school mentality they think that they own the talent they think they owned you the idea that they think they have 50% just like that but what are you doing what are you doing the guy gets I'll never forget this guy gets my face cast the guy get to my face I don't wanna say his name he goes just how you have your black belt and fighting on my black belt in the entertainment team I would I would fall on the ground and start curling up in a fetal position laughing how's it going no idea what you're referring to you know how to rob people out of the percentage that they really deserve like what are you bringing to that's that's I thought I went fit if you can show me why you guys did a 50% I'll give you 50 go here's well it's our studio you know Fox it Fox gives you the platform no no no hold up we had a platform before even got here I can do this up the street when you get more views dude what now why would you get 50% he's a guy I don't know man there's no reason I had a guy not that long ago asked for 50% of my podcast to be a part of a network not that long ago yeah damn my four years ago maybe I was like what are you talking about 50% well even now like certain comics want to start podcasts go hey this network podcast one came to me they want 50% but they think you miss - I want no no stop stop don't do that Do It Yourself that's a weird number like you're pretending that they couldn't do without you if you want 50% 50% is like if you and me right if it's the Brendan and Joe show what kind of has to be 50% cuz it's both of us right so it's like there's two of us yes so you're part show umph our show we need each other with the Guerra together should be 50% then we're friends it should be a good two percent but we could do it with Tom the producer or we could do with Steve the network you this isn't you guys don't matter so you can't have 50 percent maybe you should definitely deserve something 5050 is crazy it's insane that's crazy that's a crazy number that means you're saying I couldn't do without you that does that doesn't make any sense but that's what they used to do with TV shows you gotta realize if you're thinking about Hawaii five-o like the production company has a deal with the network and they put it together and everybody gets paid and the people that are putting it on television have a giant chunk of that that's the studio executives networking seconds you go to their houses their big fucking parties dude I'd go to some of their houses man they'd have parties and you'd be like wow these guys solid but what are they doing what are they doing but they're they're taking your stuff and they're the critical mechanism that is necessary to get you on television well now the world is television our heads are through the fucking holes and now we're looking out this open air there's no need for someone to take 50 percent anymore knowing that people won't give a fuck it's on Fox HP they don't see always operated and those those those fans of subscribers or whatever network they're gonna follow me if I'm here if I'm here they here they don't get it though these guys went through the Fox system people went through the ABC system they went through the CBS system and in if they were in that system 20 years ago this was the system the system's you make deals you put together shows you're getting it on the air it's clear you're giving me you're giving your very valuable it's a very important thing to if you got on CBS back in you know 2000 change it was a very important thing so it made sense the deal made sense but it doesn't make sense on the Internet the internet is everybody's it's like everybody has a CBS like these gentlemen who made that video on the coronavirus they they they don't have a network they don't need they don't need it all it has to do is get to one of these but also if it's good he has to be tagging their video they made a video I believe of his song okay this is GMA see cache GM ace GMAC cash and he's Detroit's finest so he so he made the original song for sure I believe so okay once again that's gm8 column right now so you hear great avatar pick by the way yeah full body and feeling of that what's up with the avatars I don't know text someone all of a sudden they send you back would you like to update your contact picture I know some weird avatar I don't what is that what's happening here why are people losing their mind why are you sending me a picture of you yeah I don't need a picture seaman AK cache to find him yeah 74 thousand followers yeah right now he has 74,000 he's blow him up though he has a video his own video of that song and it only happen it's the same song this is him can you hear it what's happening you have no sound looks like he's saying the same words oh he's the original that's it that's the song okay so it's he's the original he's the he's the guy movie song and then those other boys took and just blew it up I had a great dance routine though the hell he did something to add it a little great video they're jumping around spraying like zombies and dudes are doing backflips somebody set for babes they did something yeah it's good but they do a bunch of shit that's this is their coronavirus video so just riding around spraying it great shoes yeah but you know this is one of those things that happens sometimes like you don't know who the fuck made a video someone sends it to you you don't know who made a song someone says to you you add it on things fun meant with that that's like what's going on with tick tock like someone makes a great video and then everyone else kind of jumps on that trend taking that sound there was a video I saw just yesterday or two days ago about the government telling all government employees not have tick tock on their government issued cellphones why because it's a issue well they think it's a security issue it's a Chinese company to talk yeah and someone made some really grandiose statement like tick top is like a government operative application or something like that never know yeah it's like that it's like some sort of fucking espionage tool you read that Charles Manson book I'm Tony now that's what got me into conspiracy the US Army's ban tik-tok from use on government phones reversing its policy on the entertainment app which it recently used as a recruiting tool what the fuck the army used tik-tok they've doing like army dances and their own video game to recruit people yeah I know army does yeah they had a reality show that a buddy of mine was filming Oh sick yeah so but there was also it was there was another company that was saying that it was dangerous you know Google did something like that recently here goes tick-tock band tick-tock super one was the Senators want it gone - yeah that's senators want a band tick-tock from government phones Tech Talks for younger kids right I'm not on there not anymore well a lot of people are on it now but the point is like we if you have an app like that and say some shady person makes that app who knows of that apps turn on the microphone Oh listening to you all the time you know dude there's so many times where you'll talk about something and then you see that thing you talked about mentioning your Google ads and you're like what the hell yeah dude like if we'll talk about Porsches or those knives fans to send me screenshots of like dude I will share podcasts then I want to go search the web and I got this ad it's like a Porsche or the knives or the whiskey yeah thanks for 80 minutes it's way too much influence on us we have to like take back our personal sovereignty or mental sovereignty there's so many influences on us all the time and there's nothing wrong with them sometimes like advertising there's nothing wrong with advertising sometimes but sometimes it makes you think like man how much is this changing the way I look yeah I I think what's scary is to how the most disciplined people I know who are addicted to their phones like man this thing yes it's more addicting than any drug any alcohol any I mean the cellphone the most disciplined people I know I'll see him on their cell phones like fuck I know it's so disappointing guilty as charged me too yeah I have an addict folder on my phone where my Twitter my Instagram and my Instagram repost thing is all in one folder says addict all capital letters and you still go to it right still click on it once a day at least yeah way better than I used to be but still every now and then but sometimes it's also it's a the problem is to that there's a mixture of business stuff that I have to do like I get emails and I have to respond to important things but then while I'm on the phone I'm like hmm let's see what's on YouTube - we'll see what silly videos there are probably like what UFC news is there click on Twitter and that's where I get all my news yeah click on it wake up and then you have a thought and you Google that thought and then you go down a rabbit hole like motherfucker and then someone will send me something cool and I click on that oh my god damn there's so much content right now has never never been a time where this think about what a better time it is entertainment wise to be quarantined well think if we're quarantined in the 90s oh my god you'd be fucked what are you gonna watch back in those blockbuster days blockbusters is closed I think do you know I was having a conversation with my wife about this last night and she's like I think theaters are done and I might get brought up to him just before this would Dave small potential because there are lots of different companies that could do it they could maybe open up like maybe 50 people and you just separated by two chairs or something maybe that's a movie yeah I think they think movie theaters are done too in that Apple TV has opened up the door during this quarantine to get new movies and patrols hits Friday my sons crunk is fuck for it they had a bunch of new movies that we're supposed to come out in the movie James Bond got pushed back to November I don't think they should push him back I think that's a mistake I think they should release those bitches and make all their money listen but still everyone is watching now everyone if they come out with a badass James Bond film we'd be all over and everybody text their friend dude this fucking new James Bond movies this shit Daniel Craig better be James Bond is ejp us any I think it's the new DB 11 in it listen if you're gonna have a female James Bond or whatever nonsense you gonna do that so fucked out of my face please make it double oh nine yeah blow eight double oh seven son keep Jay Daniel Craig is the greatest James Bond of all time better than Sean Connery he's the best 100% all of them can eat shit shit no disrespect sir she's the only one I believe I don't believe he's really kicking anybody's ass I believe Daniel Craig is fucking people I believe he's shooting people he's the only one I believe the only one that means a lot Pierce Brosnan how dare you wonderful man that's wonderful man I don't he was Goldeneye the greatest game of all time I don't believe him as amazing actor he's a beautiful man I don't believe him as a murderess you're a English fucking spy character I believe Daniel Craig fucks people up come on son the guy on the right is the real deal he's got out like a face that looks like he's been punched 150 times right he's a man's man I'll do the original far left come on son eat some shit eat it eat it this one guy Daniel Craig they're gonna eat shit elbow was gonna be bond I'll buy that I'd buy that really I don't care if bonds black it's but it has to be a bad motherfucker and a Juris elbows a legitimate bad motherfucker i man have you ever heard of who's the guy who does the Trevor knows bit on a black James Bond now it's so fucking funny why don't they have it be look Trevor Noah talked about it it's like where's he gonna hide he has a hole bits so fucking good that's fun yeah Daniel Craig is it's right now as of right now he's the best ever he's the only one I believe but I believe if they had a similar movie with Idris Elba I believe that too I'd buy that a legit Muay Thai fight as a professional actor any movie started a legit Muay Thai fight yeah training guide was paid off to take a fall but you know I hear you I like yeah that's the rumor that the romance the room without so I would say I think the opponent came out was like you know they paid me take it fall right but if that beautiful man beat my ass I probably say that to me - you're so charming kicks your ass - embarrassing you might have to tell people you took a fall don't believe you you took a fall first of all if you say you took a fall you might be even telling the truth but you're the type of person that's willing to take a fall so I can never believe yeah I know your skin's not that many people because people like Anthony Smith that won't win the World title versus John Jones by disqualification because they have character and then there's people who take dives so if you're the type of people who takes a dive how am I gonna believe you any was shit how am I gonna believe you anyway I think it just Alba fucked you up probably I think I think scar fucked you up I think double-o ate fucked you wait let me say I think you fucked you up you don't like it do I don't think movie theatres gonna be dead because I think everyone likes the the experience of leaving the house right but they like blockbuster - it's great you get to go out of the house you pick whatever you want do a little flirty you know that you're not really gonna watch the movie cuz you plan on deep dicking right get this Red Vine you let them pick some stupid movie that you never go watch some Reese Witherspoon we pawn to like yeah yeah yeah the dogs so cute come on let's get out of here you're thinking of the mauling you're gonna do I never forget my mom so wild I'll never forget when we get to the front and like you you have late fees of $275 oh my god they fees were brewed all my mom would like can we just listen let's just get through this and then we'll be back next week and we'll pay and she would never pay it late fees were brutal brutal we just keep the fucking movie you know what else is brutal does a little mom-and-pop little fucking ones that had the porno section you had to kick open like the outdoor Josey Wales yeah they had to had the little the curtains you know the Outlaw Josey Wales when you always kick open those saloon doors yes that's what Joey Diaz is famous right were the one of those biggest references he's always talking about kicking open saloon doors like The Outlaw Josey Wales but they always had beads they always had desert sons do you remember those I've met curtains you're you're a lot younger than me how old do you now 37 yeah but there was a video Stuart and I don't never forget this Toby you were you looking at the porn section of the manual sneaking around 10 or 11 just a peek back there because they were velvet like crushed velvet maroon open those beads and people would hear the crack of your pervertedness those beads are saying they were sending out a Morse code Shh I'm jerking off and you all like pass each other no one would be friendly no one to make eye contact so weird just picking up boxes looking at him like you're like you look like you're reading the plot on the bags was so stupid man it was so stupid but also fantastic there's none of that now it's a it was a weird time where like everybody knew that everybody else watched porn too so we're like yeah yeah yeah I know Mike what's up and then you know maybe Deb's like if you have good friends good friends would tell each other they beat off there's a lot of guys out there lying to each other oh I don't even like porn shit dude magazine magazine jacking off to magazine throat jacking off in the forest to magazine I used to have a bit that I I never wanted uh putting this on a special like I wrote it and I performed it then it like my special was too long I think it was triggered or one of the other ones but it I had a whole bit about when I was a kid we would find porn in the forest clips some dudes who were so scared he's so scared of the fact they beat off they have to hide their shit in the wood oh my god if they go to the you should release that bit like a body just redo it I should just read and release it yeah because I I think it the problem the problem is sometimes I get on a subject and I do too much on that subject I might have had too many jerking off jokes holiness nothing off joke yeah fucking but you have to if you're doing a whole special and you have 20 tighten up your ship but that's a thing like that back then you know it was it never existed before so when I was a kid when I was in high school that's when the VHS tape became common in households in my neighborhood at least I don't remember what the year was they invented the VHS type VHS tape but I remember the first time I ever saw TV on a thing that you could push into the television and watch it and play it and then people figured out that this is a good way to watch people fuck he went from freshman in high school nobody watched people fuck to senior high school my friends were like he's stealing tapes from their dads and buying them off other dudes was phases of death big when you were yes that was hot that was just after high school yes just after high school you had faces of death and then there was also shit like barnyard Betty where there was this this poor fetal alcohol syndrome baby that grew up to be a fucked up lady who was on drugs is having sex with all these different barnyard animals oh my god and so I I was at my friend Billy's house and we went down to his basement watching TV and our other friend Ron is guarding the door he's making sure that opens up the door for parents so he's gonna he's like look out at the door while we're watching this chick suck off a German Shepherd oh my god this is crazy because you know we were like 20 or something like that and we couldn't believe that to any 20 year old kid if you said you know that there's ladies and if you pay him enough - suck off dogs they're like what they'll feel like ah but they'd be like duh yeah yeah here's a whole reddit fuckin sub threat I know ready a subreddit dedicated entirely to chicks who blow dogs some VCR was released in 1977 in the United States faces of death came out the next year and then in 1985 on a mathematics teacher showed it to his class in Escondido high school do you get fired two of the students were so traumatized natural fear of dying and suffering emotional distress yeah yeah I couldn't watch that one it wasn't the other thing is how much of it was real though it's a good question I'd have to see it now and what I'm sure what you to say the the VHS was invented 7677 so I was uh in I was in ninth grade in 1981 that was my first year as a high school student so that was like right when that was kind of kicking in when you know when it was getting you know when a new invention like a thing that you can play tape and you could watch movies in your house that should take took a year or two back that oh yeah just spread across Betamax was the year and a half for it cuz VCR took off in Japan and says this says Betamax came out in 1975 yeah yeah we're the first mean is VHS yeah VHS was inferior to Betamax but Betamax was a Sony product and it was it was only Sony so was you you had to only use their stuff right and apparently was way better and smaller they fucked up with mini disc you know there fuk they've had that problem a few times your Sony hater one a few times discman and like the r2 was the first one it was pop open on top yeah you went put it straight in and pop up top and then he put in bro I remember we go to the gym and dudes would have a disc hand on their hip yes a big yellow plastic thing where the CD would sit in and they'd be at the gym lift and bike how cool that guy looks like he's got his own music hell yeah they called the skip protection ESP because it looked at that and wouldn't forget and that was a big deal skip wouldn't skip it you could shake it when skip I remember when they first figured out how to do that in cars I was like God they nailed it because before if you were driving in your car and you hit a bump your fucking music would ruin we didn't fuck the song it was basically your driving around at a record player but they did have a record player for a car even before that they had record players for cars in like the 50s well record like a 78 really I know yeah yeah see if you can find that we've talked about this before record players in cars it was really old I want to see what they didn't know what to do there was some for being quarantined just basically were quarantined yeah that's what they're doing what kind of life was that living in the 20s Romero all the CDs you have there all the stuff that you'd have up the black case and be full remember those things you have those towers that's way pricey for a player though that works a Philips record player for your car but but what year did they invent it oh look at that guy's car look at that lower look at that right there look at that black with my picture that gets get a fucking holy fuck that's Muhammad Ali holy fuck holy shit he had a record player in his car he's got stacks of records there too the other thing is we don't know if that's photoshopped I know who that's that's what's real weird but here's where real weird in the future you're gonna be able to do like a regular person it's gonna be able to do whatever they want what do you mean with it with with CGI with photo good we'll do whatever the attending like we don't know if like if you got a one of those of Daniel Craig or John Lennon John Lennon's driving around with a record player and yeah his Cadillac I don't know if that's real today today I don't know but in the future getting people to watch a video well you won't know if the video have you seen they've been a you guys could be on that easily say on so many chicks do me chicks like people have like taken my face yeah and put on their body especially when ridiculous like workout selfies at a clerk working out little sweaty I feel pumped people put them on chicks faces well have you seen like the deep fakes they do it with porno well they have like huge celebrities huh looks pretty fucking real man it looks pretty real but here's the thing man CGI is gonna replace all that they're gonna be able to do that with computer programs where you don't need to just put it on an existing video you can do the whole thing artificially the whole thing they'll probably it'll be like Squarespace like Squarespace has templates for websites in the website they're gonna have templates for porn like what do you want to do you want to be a tennis instructor and it's gonna be a dude and then it's gonna be he's gonna just go in there and you're gonna have whatever girl you want you want to you want to fuck meg Ryan okay it's gonna be Meg Ryan that's nuts yeah it's gonna who want probably get rid of the actor cuz they'll be able to put that in movies whoever you want yeah you want a 1990 Salma Hayek yeah so you you get to hear her voice you get to see her face like there's gonna be crazy lawsuits where people are trying to stop people from using their face and their artificial body in porn and the arguments are going to be that it's art you're gonna you can't stop freedom of expression you've got people name and likeness yeah but it's not if it's a painting of someone here's the thing right if I take you and I paint you you can't sell it this is what I hear you yes I think so I think if someone paints me and they sell I don't have any say in that that I'm a public figure they're painting mean they're selling it now what if they paint me and it's so realistic then it looks exactly like me and I got a dick in my mouth and they're selling it you can't don't they're gonna do anything so let's keep going let's keep going what if instead of paint they do a digital photograph so they make a photograph with a computer of me it looks just like me doing something I've never done before robbing a bank like running out of there with a bag of cash and a pistol in my hand thing that never existed it's not a pre-existing photograph where they just superimposed my face it's a completely new image how is that not a piece of art I think it is so why wouldn't it be like especially it's gonna be disturbing for female celebrities what what if it's you in a in a KKK Alfa could be you in anything it could be you with a giant vagina giving birth Bill Clinton that was a real painting that was a painting in Jeff know how crazy this epstein story is and Jeffrey Epstein's house in New York City which was 70 million dollars worth 70 million someone gave him what he gave it to him okay whatever I have friends I get it he's got a painting of Bill Clinton in a dress pointing at him that's Hillary Clinton's dress well whoever's dress it is it's Bill Clinton but it might have been Monica Lewinsky dress is it the same one that Hillary won it could be so weird but that was in his living room it's so weird so in his living room he had a painting of Bill Clinton dressed up like a woman I think he had that George Bush one - have you seen that it's almost like they held stuff over these guys to the point where they could humiliate they're mocking them so if that guy came you like if bill came over to his house he would see that he would see like you're my bitch fuck you're my bitch I don't care if you the former president you're my bitch I still don't think he'd show you the videos I still don't think he committed suicide of course you know because he didn't yeah first of all and that's not what do you think Jamie I'm not like a big conspiracy get Michael badan that fucking guy from that HBO autopsy Topsy series yeah he talks about it like in depth he's like no these are injuries consistent with someone who's been choked the way it's also the position of the cut it's all lower like when you you hang yourself it goes up like that this is down there so much choking this motherfucker off hey I think Harvey Weinstein's the next to go is too much shit yeah we talked about this yesterday right denied it with Michael Shermer who did I talk about this with with Lex was it Michael what'd he say I don't know Mom I've heard that argument before but I think that he's got more to lose than he does to gain cuz if he says something like yeah all those Hollywood starlets they all suck my dick and that's how they got famous it sort of reinforces he was a monster that he was a monster but also shows they were playing the game they were playing the game but that games illegal and so the whole reason why he's in jail for the rest of his life is because that games legal but he's already in there so if he goes hey I'm not on this monster Jimmy like this celebrity she did this with me for years who this Jeffery Epstein's Hollywood pipeline ran straight to Harvey Weinstein well I would make up a bunch of stories about aliens now that Harvey's in the pokey probably for the rest of his life if I ran some of them dubious websites all day shit I would start writing the most ridiculous stories I am related to someone who a proposition by Harvey Weinstein said he could make her a star yeah sounds like your cousin was a dumbass no it was in Ohio she had no idea do your research girl was there no Google back in this fucking it might have been actually Shane time she could have been fucking Wonder Woman you waiting back in the day Wonder Woman he made people famous Whitney Cummings talks about it she has a really funny way of putting it she like well guy I always told the truth he did he really did it for him like if he told me she sucked my dick I'm gonna put you in this movie they were in the movie we're in the movie and that was his reputation like wow crazy but then again how does a guy like him ever fuck at ten bipedally movies i put them in movies and you imagine how stunned he must have been like with imagine you're banging like some of the most famous hottest women in the world and you're you're this monster look you look terrible you look terrible you look like an experiment right he was so vile doesn't he have Corona pretty sure they gave spell had a fucking hilarious take on that he goes very few dudes we look at him ago oh yeah he rapes that belly room comedy special that he did it was Walker God it's so crazy he's so foul looking but if a guy like him like grew up in that Hollywood system that's probably he's probably you know like a really extreme version of how they all did it okay yeah he's not the first one know that cat did the casting couch is an expression for a reason correct it was real it's a huge porno channel to this day I mean but in but we know that that happened right it's yeah it's gross uh-huh 100% I'm not I'm not endorsing it I'm just saying we know it of it as a historical reality you know just like we know barbarians used to be real we know as a historical reality the casting couch was a real thing Gotti's file he's got everything he's got pock marks he's fat he's balding nothing is gonna roast look and he doesn't look compassionate it doesn't look friendly it's all those things Billy in a small dick but it's also it's like there's just like fucking vortex of things that are happening everything's all happening together and this guy figured out that there's a system and if you get people attention to make up families and you can make a lot of money if you make good choices and you're smart around how you do it and you control your addiction just enough to keep making movies whoa he's with a bunch of young Starlights he just looks like yeah complete shit just monster what do you do if you're one of those gals I want to be in the movie I could be a girlfriend oh dude shut didn't you have a bit about it yeah well I had a bit about my son I said differently but if I was if I was a man like it was me and it was my daughter you know like every man in this room like every person's room and that guy propositioned my daughter and offered her money in exchange or offered her sex her giving him sex to be count will change for a movie I'd be like no I'd want to kick his ass I want to fuck him on to kill him I forgot the bet but what breaking news liking some fighters I don't like this suspense yo see 249 has been cancelled all UFC events postponed indefinitely due to kovat 19 Dana White says he's ready to promote the event but things were taken out of his control much much more to come the government stepped in on it you ain't doing shit that's interesting that's interesting well that saves me a lot of fuckin thinking fuck damn I was 75% ready to go you were gonna do it the only thing that worried me is that if I contracted something and then I came in contact with other people so what I was gonna do is do it if I definitely could get tested and then I would have to know the results before I come back it's fuckin even then you don't know the testing was a little dicey like it some people saying there's a new type of test that they're working on what is that they don't have it officially done yet I guess but when I was reading stuff about the NBA it said that they have a potential like instant test right like maybe a diabetic type test we can prick finger get a little blood and they can get something within five to ten minutes I believe that also said it was hypothetical and like if they can get that done or get it mass-produced or whatever it is yeah and it works and it's accurate then they will proceed but I'm so disappointed dude there's an article in the Atlantic about tracking you with cellphones and tracking you in comparison to trusted people that have tested negative like that that that could be the way that we could release people from quarantine and this is good we're gonna go full Eddie Bravo what's up my best dude because if you have to have something you have to have your phone on you to travel like apparently they have to do and I think it's in China right oh they have their phone to travel and they have a health app on their phone but sort of like they have to keep their health app up-to-date there's one on every iPhone already yeah but I think this is a different kind of it's not you know it's a different kind of thing that like you have to have like you have to been certified that you tested clean for co vid and then it's on your phone digital certificate or so right so yeah yeah something like that I'm fine with that and that to you can't be because then they can restrict your travel just based on whether if you're sick though but yeah but but here's the thing we've always just accepted that people can be sick and we prefer freedom over a hundred percent safety we've always accepted they're not doing that now child we're not doing that now but my point is we've always accepted that and if we decide to keep going further down that rabbit hole where we make someone carry a device where you can track their location you have to have a travel it's scary it gets weird man it gets weird you have to have a phone and I have to be able to see what you've been up to what have you been partying all night and you go to the airport they're like I think you have cancer like no no no I just had coke high blood pressure go back to see my family please Denny's yeah I just I'm trying to go home I want to go home sleeping for three days yeah and they're like you're sick we need to quarantine you but this that's a poor example just for humor but there's a slippery road if you tell people they have to have a phone everywhere they go right now you don't you could have a driver's license and/or a passport and you can get on a plane and you're fine you don't have to have a phone you don't have to have a phone right now and I'm not saying you shouldn't have a phone but I'm saying if someone's gonna tell you that you have to have a phone everywhere you go things are going to get slippery but what what are they gonna be able to track you 100% but what if it's just like like the way you scan your boarding pass well if you scan to make sure you're healthy but that's the problem is this kind of that they don't track you look but think about all Google has done and it's not a knock on Google but all Google has done with basically just the information that they give to companies on what your activities are right there's a reason the reason why when you're talking about things and these Google ads pop up why is that why when you look up something you find those ads in everything what's cuz they're trying to tell you things right they're trying to figure out their modern what you're looking at yeah yeah trying to figure out what makes you tick why wouldn't they do that with this - why wouldn't they do that with this - well I wouldn't like if they if you could track people if you could track who's gonna pay for all that software and all that stuff like well we'll just put a few ads up would you rather be quarantined imagine would you rather be quarantine but imagine if you could track people if they could go everywhere and while while they're doing their like you know everything they do you know they went to this grocery store you know they went to this house you check it you gave our app on them that they can't leave behind that checks their health it's dicey it's dicey it's there should never be a group that has more power over an individual rather than another individual it's not like like the thing about having a massive group that can tell one person that they can or can't do something is it can be abused if everyone is even it can never be abused if we all follow the same rules on the same laws then okay we all agree we all have the same amount of control and power over each other's lives but as soon as you have more control than the person who you're monitoring then things can get weird it's just natural people are weird they control people they like controlling people they like abusing power a lot of people that have power abuse power so if you give the power of constant surveillance in exchange for the freedom to be able to go everywhere you want and the relieving of quarantine we just want to know you're healthy no big deal you're like okay yeah well let you out if you let us model her to you that's what's going on it's not that they thought this through and this was their end goal I don't think so I don't think it's a fucking conspiracy that's what I know I think people take advantage of things that happen right that's more likely what's more likely as a crazy thing happens and people automatically take advantage when they find an opportunity especially the more predatory amongst us so it's not like we're we're just looking out for human nature it's human nature to you like when you look at the stuff that Edward Snowden found out about the NSA like of course they would if they could they're going he's gonna do it they're gonna find a way it's human nature it's just how we are man dude I want to know who shut down UFC 249 cuz we know how adamant Damien is supposed to happen April 18th has been cancelled Dana White confirmed oh wow he was asked to stand down by top Disney ESPN executives and he is doing so damn thinking the power at Disney hey Dana let's shut it down well I think they made probably a risk assessment and then they made a calculation of what the negative aspects of going against government regulations terms of like state government would be I probably can't do this they're saying it's not worth it imagine being the president the UFC fuck all that imagine having all these fights that you have to make and having all this pressure on you and you're also like a famous guy like Dana's imagine being that guy fuck that job Dana bleep president the UFC is second only to president I solitary fuckin dollars in the bank account that's nice but you get used to that you get used to the hun percent up you do you do he's compensated well for it he's compensated well making all the fights he's making the main fights the main events but the most important thing is he's like a psychotic driving force for the most exciting organization in the world and I don't think the organisation gets where it is without data white I think you have to have a crazy person to the wheel I think you have to have Bulldog have a guy fuck he's a real man he doesn't give a fuck oh shit you know he'll insult people go back with you he's nuts and then Disney went yeah you're wild boy Disney went very cool your Island yeah hope you didn't put money down because we're shutting all that down they're like what what are we doing here well this is it and then they're probably just the only thing that's up and running like this this is up and running they're ready to go right now and I think I wish they would've let him go cuz everyone have been just fuckin fine yes 750 million dollars as long as the right precautions are in place I agree it would've been fine but the thing is it's like you got a measure good this if this was like just in any other disease where we understood it better I would be way more confident we understand numbers though we do but we don't understand Michael yo okay Michael you almost died yeah yeah and you know what Michael yos doing right now he's fine right but he almost died but he did it but he was in the hospital for a week yeah but he's fine okay okay now he's fine I don't want people who were less like robust then Michael yo to die so we got to figure out like what the fuck this virus is how does it get treated what's the most effective way when can we went and then then then it makes sense that we're a little bit more loose with our regulation 100% now when now Michael yo decent shape he's in decent shape compared to a UFC fighter he's fucking Adele you know I'm saying like he's not in shape compared to Tony fer he works out a lot he really does again comparison right yeah he's also not that old no and he's you know college football player strong the loose term yes I understand what you see did he threw the ball he was involved at the very least day do you have funny is it when people get busted with like a fake story of like some sort of athletic past oh dude is the weirdest thing Brian had this friend I know that's why I brought it up oh my god he like I fought Chicago in the beach and I've trained with Cheick Kongo I know Chet Congo I asked check comes I'm never fun on the beach I told Brian it dude I'm telling you that guy's full of shit Brian I'm telling we can track all this yeah dude I had a guy who made me talk to his friend cuz his friend knocked out Chuck Liddell and one of the early ufc's and this guy's insisting that he he knocked out Chuck Liddell and one of the early ufc's and he insists that I know and he's like my friend needs to talk to you it's like your guy was like oh he was a bouncer a nightclub and he made me talk to his friend and I'm like what are you talking about I go I go he's had one loss which is Jeremy Horn he got submitted by Jeremy Horn this is at the time I'm lucky you didn't knock him out no one checked I can check right now mine didn't happen never happen it didn't happen that wasn't a real thing the best was Brian was defendants friend egos Duty wrestling at ASU I go oh well my coach wrestled at issue he was on how old is Julius he's like 40-something oh my coach oh do you be in the same year nah I'll see him tomorrow let me ask him he goes there her that guy then Brian goes dude Brennan's coach was that ASU when he said you were there he goes dude I didn't say I was on the team I'd go in and volunteer what do you want programs don't let people volunteer to work out with the with the wrestling team yeah we got a farmer once you come in and do backflips could he be in the gymnastics my man what does that mean I volunteered who volunteers finally I get Brian to admit it bro people are crazy he'll make stuff up it's too easy to track these days 8090 to this guy and he had this dude take him to the woods where he's gonna fuck he's gonna fight in the kumite fuck yeah and the guy has a fucking big ol sack with him like a big old bag that you would carry with you like a big one like a 3-foot back solid bag and it goes yeah he goes I'll be back in two days you know and hopefully I'll win this thing and he goes into the woods guy drops him off and he goes into the woods and so then comes back his friend comes to get him they agree upon this time two days later his friend comes back and he's holding a trophy he doesn't have the bag anymore he was in the bag and this guy this guy came out of the woods holding this trophy saying that he won s in this kumite in the guys like that's the same size as the bounty yeah and you have the baggie with a fucking do P so this dude basically just went camping and decided that would be the thing is gonna tell everybody find some Yogi's karate tournament in the forest dude you got appreciate the hustle it's such a funny story what do you guys have to fight in a karate thing I got these motherfuckers it got crazy in the first fight but the next eight fights raw me hey it's for trophy its no-rules kumite forest anything you could do like that in the forest it's Morris give you an island that's what I've been cool about this UFC thing if it really did go to fuck Island not anymore bro give it a couple of weeks yeah I'm a they'll be back up and running well the good news is it's pure our response to this cuz it happened in the moment the island might still be in play because all the other leagues are still figuring out that like remote situation to figure out in soccer baseball basketball so they might well if you could control an island if it's a small island if you could control the whole island test everybody why not how much money is the UFC and be spending on these private how much money are they gonna be making with the reality show about moving the UFC to the island because I'm watching that shit fuck tiger king i watching Dana whites with his crazy screaming and running around trying to figure out it we're gonna put on these fucking fights trying to figure out how to get a fight to an island and coming up with an idea of an island in international waters and who owns the island that's what that's one episode him on the phone call which yes mr. Trump died I understand mr. Trump Disney calling him up yelling at him he's a wild man we told you have to throw those 47 fights I think they're kind of relax a little I think people are gonna hopefully realize that the worst is behind us I think maybe I'm a hope and I'm hoping they just obviously I'm hoping the current treatment is the one that works but if that's not the one that works maybe they find something just as good I heard zinc people oh that was the other thing why are people saying tonic water why are people saying is one of the weird things about home remedies and ruthless pandemics but people were saying quinine in tonic water and zinc together or a good combination that someone was saying that it's somehow or another mimics what that that malaria truck does Tana quad was looking up tonic water wikipedia says tonic water is a carbonated drink in which quinine is dissolved originally used as a prophylactic against malaria tonic water whoa usually now has a significantly lower quinine content as consumed for its distinctive bitter flavor so now it's just a taste oh okay so originally see that's what happens home remedies but but if you can get quinine forget about tonic water if you get actually quinine mimics that malarial drug again this is probably when they first made it back when coke had Coke in it this is how those people died drinking pool cleaner look it's the same way now the same letters fucking Eddie probably prescription only it says quinine is a medication for malaria tree oh I don't but I don't think you could just get that look there is a certain amount of quinine from a natural source and tonic water look what is the quinine from why do they have it in there imagine that was the drink they drank it in places the mosquitos were bad quinine powder is so bitter that British officials stationed in early to censure 19th century India had to mix it with soda and sugar so they could drink it well that's probably how they made that drink to begin with that's deep they made it drink with some nasty stuff that kills malaria do you know that sickle cell and sickle cell anemia is closely related to people that have survived malaria really yeah apparently it's like the genetic Tiffany Haddish was actually the first person tell me this the genetic the reason why sickle cell came about was because of an ability to fight off malaria somehow I know they're connected and that what's up no but that and then I looked it up and it's like it's really interesting so I it occurs in people who are descendants of people who were in places where malaria existed so it has something to do with like this resistance to malaria have you had Tiffany on here no and she was supposed to be on but you got sick there is also it says at the bottom of this lover though prescribed but it says it's often recommended to relieve leg cramps why leg cramps yeah leg cramps are no different than arm cramps are they it says it but the FDA cautions consumers against using off-label quinine drugs to treat leg cramps but making it a certain amount of it that can be mixed way what kind of a bitch either you need to take a drug for a leg cramp that is about have some water come on drink something with electrolytes case yourself some liquid IV maybe this is like supercharged electrolytes I don't know yeah who knows man I hope it works if it doesn't work I hope vitamin C sauna that's what I'm doing a lot of vitamin C a lot of my gonna be so bad I bet you do it's three hours and 27 robberies 27 oh damn look it's 3:30 almost done I think we got a lot accomplished how about the fact that it happens why we're on the podcast that was pretty crazy wouldn't cover too much of it listen man I was hesitant my thoughts no you were I was like hmm I really want to go like it was leaning towards going that I'm like I don't want to hear it from people that don't think it's a good idea I'm not interested in putting myself at risk but my real concern was how do I know if I can tracked it and then I bring it back how am I gonna know and I had to be honest with myself and like I really wouldn't know so the only way I would be able to do it is to do it and then be in quarantine until I get tested that ain't worth it oh my god Jesus Christ why I want to find out man I want to find out how many people have it I would I wish they would do one thing that I wish they would offer is like a worldwide antibody test let's find out what the real numbers are and maybe they're already doing this now I'm just a moron but a worldwide there's even more right yeah what's weird to me is the NBA got tested so fast that I mean antibodies I want to find out like how many people went through it it'd be nice to have have a test of the people that survived it like let's test you how many people survived it amazing they have those numbers yeah they do be nice to have that but it be also nice didn't I hate to say this because I don't want to test everybody but if we tested everybody everybody it was real simple we tested everybody and then we find out again this is a power thing you don't want people having the power to fucking just force you to take a test and that's what ultimately they would have to do if we're gonna test everybody you'd have to make it like the government would have to make it mandatory but imagine if they tested everybody like dude we got like 99% people have had it and they didn't even know and they're fine we don't know what if like 99% the planet had and a few of them got it really bad and people died from other people just maintained and didn't even skip a beat there'd be no quarantine weird you know like the chicken pox like almost everybody gets the chicken pox eventually right sure cuz that sure you can get it again for the chicken pox I thought you could only get a one well then think you have a vaccine for my chicken pox when a kid gets it don't want it like there's no like they want to get their kid near it yeah but that was before they had vaccines I think see if I mean I'm really sure they have a vaccine for the chicken pox and that was the idea behind it that's why people would want their kids we were there about chicken pox on it yeah when I was a kid I had it but you can't get it twice you can't get it twice right once you have it you're good I have like a little hole in my face my scab verus yeah I think Jamie you're talking about back before then they used to yeah I mean yeah you people would bring their kids over someone had chickenpox you bring your kid over around that kid you know that's the other thing about diseases it's like think about the flu how many times have you had the flu but your friend didn't and there were you around them how many times have like someone in your house if your wife have the flu and you don't have it or you do and she doesn't get it like what is the difference between someone who gets it and someone who doesn't it's not just contact it's also like how well your body fights off that you know your Manges yeah and that's something I think it's gonna help all of us to concentrate on now you know I thought really really really really hope that that's what people get out of this this is the fucking kick in the ass you needed to get your life in order for your health get your fucking immune system in order get that workout program and bitch do something do something do something do something skip rope just skip rope do you think you're a bad motherfucker skip some rope for 10 minutes every day you'd be you you'd be shocked at how hard it is to skip rope for 10 minutes it's so good for you so good for you so simple good for footwork someone was talking about that at some football player well I forget what the story was but he was talking to this other football players kid or this other guy's kid who wanted to play football and he's like do you skip rope he's like no I just well why don't you skip rope that was the first thing that he said to him I was like if I don't I don't know four receivers and quarterback two or quarterback uses for football period and that's great well I think it's great for like there's a reason why people do it for striking - there's when you're forced to bounce up and down on your ball your feet like that you get a way better sense of what your body's capable to move when I was fighting to do rounds inside the cage I'd do four or five minute rounds with a minute off of jump rope and I'd go in the ring and bounce back and forth dude jump ropes this shit I love jump rope they just think about how you're doing like these little explosions over and over and over again oh and you've developed these legs that can explode all the time for footwork you're always on yes yes and then you get that on it that thick dick jump rope that fucking rattlesnake jump that shit works your shoulders but it's just such an underrated exercise there's so many Oh simple - I know that's one of the cool things what there's this some positives to this quarantine for some folks and one of those is you have the time to look at stuff more and that's one thing that maybe was like to sit in there and people like I never thought about that for fitness yeah but you're willing to go to take a SoulCycle class on the other side of town you were but you could just watch a YouTube video and jump rope and get a way harder workout learn way more colors and it's hard you want to go anywhere you do watch watch a movie watch your favorite movie watch the Godfather people I should go in my garage every morning right that peloton I got a fucking bike now because the quarantine what are you saying part of the fun of those classes Joe is not just being buyers cycling hoes Brett I don't want you to piss your pants thanks dude let's wrap this up t fat Cade calm the fighter and the kid podcast the King and the sting podcast below the pen by Jesus Christ food truck Theresa how many
