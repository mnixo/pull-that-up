the Joe Rogan experience and this extreme lack of empathy the the lack of empathy towards anyone who doesn't share your position this is very strange it's um it's very it's piss-poor thinking and it's everywhere and and everyone wants to feel like not being a part of one of the tribes is it extremely lonely position and you get called all the bad names because people want you to be a part of their tribe and people don't want to be called bad names and they want to feel like they're in a name group like motional II I totally get that yeah it sucks being homeless well it's just politically homeless yes it's just when you got a president that's so polarizing and you have an opposition to him that's so there's so much momentum in opposing him and I think this is a giant wedge in between these two sides and then you have that hat and that hat if that kid wasn't wearing that hat I guarantee really 20% less hate it would be oh yeah it would be people would still get mad at him because he was still like I've seen people say when a native elder walks up to you and he's banging his drums get the fuck out of the way I saw that like come on you can't expect that you'd what you can't just beat your drum first of all he got right in the kid's face like inches from the kids face pretty amazing the restraint this kid had to just smile and the idea that you're gonna judge this kid millions and millions and millions of people are going over this right now that kid woke up that morning he had no fucking idea he was a kid in a cult okay he's in a Catholic cult school and he's going to some weird thing some March for Life where people trying to kill babies we got to stop him from killing babies right he goes there and there's these black Israelites calling them the faggots and there's these all these people calling them names and and then all of a sudden this guy's beating a drum in front of his face and we're supposed to we're supposed to dock this kid now cuz he smirked that's that's a crazy an impossible lack of empathy it's impossible to defend like unless you hate boys unless you hate all boys because boys are dumb like ten-year-old boys are almost universally dumb they all they all grow up to be men some of those men will be your best friend some of those men will be amazing some of those men would be so happy to see when you see him you give him a big hug okay that's me me I was a stupid fucking 16 year old and I'm a man now and I try to be as nice as I can to everybody I go way out of my way to be a kind person that could be that kid to like what you're doing is not good for anybody it's not it's not good for society to take this trend and run with it and this is well this is that what people do now we're coming home from a Christmas Extravaganza which I did with my buddies every year right before Christmas we get a big garden pile in and we go Christmas shopping for our families and what have you coming up I'm loaded I supposedly threw a burrito from like Taco Bell or something and hit the guard so there's four three or four of my buddies we get to my house we pig out on shitty Taco Bell food you know until everybody passes out and the next thing I know the cops lights are are banging on the door get out here I'm I come to the door gonna lie you know after you've been drinking you do a bunch of my food you're fucking gone and so long story short they said well you're gonna be arrested for assault if you look at that and say you're sorry to this guy salt what a burrito correct right and by the and so if you charge a man with a salt because he throws a burrito at you you should you should turn in your card but it we watch the tape it was not like throwing it at him it's not like I've barely with a baseball right here I like chunked it to him to eat but he didn't see it coming and so I like slapped even fell down so they they cuffed me they take me down to the guardhouse yeah they put me the back are cuff a cop no these are real it's a real cop yeah he filed a report oh and so this is how stupid it gets shame I then I'm so freakin loaded right and I get there and the burritos still on the ground like it's evidence or some shit and they're telling me I gotta apologize to this guy and all I can focus on is there's a perfectly good fucking burrito runner I'm gonna eat this burrito so sit down and literally start eating the burrito oh god you're like please just tell you're sorry so you go back home okay okay so I tell him I'm sorry I'm still eating the burrito and they just left me there like a mile from my house at the guard shack a man named mr. John my wife and I own barbershop some people don't know he owned these things called the shave washing room shops we have one in State Farm arena that when the Atlanta Hawks play we have a flagship store on Edgewood Avenue Edgewood Avenue was once an Auburn Avenue once the centers of black Atlanta in terms of Commerce and retailing money Atlanta life insurance company with their you guys Google some of this stuff is big-time shit you know this isn't the old narrative of we've never had nothing because that's not the truth Atlanta was a very rich city for african-americans still is on this street used to be owned by african-americans the storefronts in there their children after these people died off sold the buildings off and sold them for cheap and I know this because a man named mr. John who runs a grocery store there stopped me one day he said you know Michael after we've gone in this neighborhood it's been gentrified and everything's different they're gonna come along and say that white people stole this from us and he said that's not true he say the children of the people that were here left and they never came back because they didn't think what they parents bill was good enough oh man that killed me because that's not just black people that's Americans period we have gotten to a point where we are unappreciative we are entitled and we don't think what happened before us was good enough so we don't treasure it we don't honor it we don't reinvest in it that could be a farm in Milledgeville that could be a house in Adamsville but we have to do a better job of appreciating ourselves appreciating our community and appreciating our greater community and you have to re-enter you have to reenter phi day you have to be a part of whatever gentrification happens to make sure that your stake is still there and that what you care about from a morals and civil perspective it represented there I've known Bobby Lee for 20-plus years yeah he's never put out a comedy special that's insane yeah Bobby Lee almost got me killed at a strip club in San Diego first time I met them I already believe it be continued we were in our 20s and and I met Bobby Lee down there at the La Jolla Comedy Store and then we went out after the show this is probably 90 late 90 somewhere right and we went out afterwards went out to the strip club and there was a smexy and gentleman with the tattoo on his face in the 90s which is rare and he had long straight black hair Wow and he had a look in his eyes like he's killed people yeah I'm a good I'm a good at sniffing out danger I'm like that's real danger and Bobby was hitting on his girls trying to get a lap dance from his girlfriend God did I mean in Bobby's defense it's at a strip club but this girl was apparently his girlfriend out of strip club and Bob and the guys stood up you know and he stood up and he said something to Bobby and Bobby comes over he's like fuck that guy I looked at the guy looked at Bobby

lucky enough to come across like well after those days and we they wrote they wrote a script to fuck with him they gave him the wrong script with like extra lines with a monologue that took up like the whole page so that he would have to remember it no no he said to read it and everyone's out like like they tell everybody like don't worry about that part where he thinks he's a bird and so
