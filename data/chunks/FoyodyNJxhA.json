and we're live no what's up I'm not then thanks for doing this appreciate it yeah thanks for having me I like how you dressed very casual look like yeah about comfort these things like part like monk like a lot of monk like to what you got this shaved head and the wooden beads and the whole deal yeah I mean I kind of decided that like I ever since cutting my hair that uh I don't know I'm just gonna do away with like not being like not being comfortable in any area so heels you kind of have to pay me to do that really yeah I don't know it's just uh I'm not a big fan of heels that can't run away you know make sense like girls were in tight skirts where your legs are constricted right yeah or tight dresses and go down to your knees especially yeah those things are that's like a thing where girls can like barely walk you have the heels your your toes are down it's like the opposite of being strong is it you're very vulnerable right very vulnerable yeah like I don't know if it's just because of like the way I grew up but I was always like looking over my shoulder like any time I was walking down the wrong alley I was always uh you know ready to scope out the area and you know just run and be able to run I think everybody's like that though right I mean especially girls you should be yeah I mean just mean particularly just cuz the only girl that looked like myself I was the smallest all the time or youngest or like the only white girl on my block so it was always like I stood out and so yeah I like to I like to be safe that's smart yeah or be able to like you know throw it kick in these pants yeah those like sweatpants or something when you got on these are called harem pants harem pants yes you get up there with that oh they're crazy they're like they got cool designs on them what are those designs no it's one coffee and I got um they came off this website called harem pants calm or something like that and what are the wooden beads boat so this is um is a guy I got it from a friend Cassie Rob who is also a fighter she's my teammate back at home and she she gave it to me leading up to the fight with Johanna and uh just for some strength and courage so I think this is supposed to like give you like some type of confidence or whatever mmm yeah it's just like an energy bead I don't know if it really like I mean I guess it works but I believe it works it works exactly yeah that's kind of how I always feel that comes with SIBO effect right yeah I gotta tell you that your victory speech after you beat you wanna was my all-time favorite because it wasn't even just about you or about the fight it wasn't about anything it was just you expressing yourself Pat what are you doing over there you're right checking out this earth okay and I just think that um it was an awesome yeah victory speech it was really amazing it was you were you know you were just spilling your heart out and it was in your moment to shine and in your moment to shine you you didn't make it about you I think I fight better that way you know when I'm you know it's always about me like throughout the training camp like everybody like my coaches and teammates they're always you know helping me and it just it gets to be a bit much sometimes you know and I want to want to help other people it fills my spiritual cup more you know your spiritual cup yeah I think that you know I've you know if your hands close to to give you know you can't be open to receive kind of thing and I think that the more that I can give to people the more that I can get myself you know and I think that um you know just like plants and animals away you know if you look at nature everything is a symbiotic relationship I think that humans could be the same way that's an interesting way of looking at things if you you always looked at things like that no I shouldn't say not always but I always was a person that you know wanted to be outside wanted to be in nature I grew up in a like urban jungle in Milwaukee and just concrete everywhere you know no place to go outside except for you know just playing in the alleys and stuff but uh my my lineage is from Lithuania where they're like very in tune with nature and their pagans and like slash Christian and so they really you know just just my whole family you know they come from living off the land and stuff like that and so that's always been something I wanted to do I'll just put in this situation you know just to you know try and do martial arts and trying to like you know I guess control my emotions and stuff just living in this you know chaotic environment that I grew up in and nature is where I felt the most peace at so that's always something that I connected with and then the more that I kind of focus on nature and animals are stuff like that I noticed that you know there's a I don't know I try to live my life the same way well it's just interesting leading up to that fight to the you are kind of like the antidote to a lot of the things that people getting annoyed at in MMA all the trash talking and all the negativity and all the like fighting at press conferences and you just shut all that  down with you wanna what needs to be balanced you know it's like I mean I like entertainment you know I'm I you know I should talk sometimes too you know but I there just has to be a balance you know it has to be honest too like if you really feel this way about somebody like if you're really upset with this person yeah I say how you feel but like don't just go out of your way just to be entertaining because you think it's gonna be funny or something or you think it's just gonna be like it's not genuine you know right right but it was just the way you handled yourself like cuz her whole thing is talking the whole thing is scaring people and bougie woman coming to get you yeah you know all that stuff and you were just dead faced and I think yeah  her head up I really do you ever see that video like the not that one the one you just showed me earlier was like is this do like standing in front of an elephant and he was like calm you know yeah that guy got lucky really really want to trample them you know we just watched a elephant that's coming through is like yeah yeah right right but it's just I think it's a good analogy to draw from like ioannis energy she was very like chaotic and very in my face and very threatening intimidating yeah and like yeah don't go out of your way to stand in front of an elephant's running at you like that don't put yourself in that position but I I had to be there that's my job you know so so when you're in those situations where you like you don't know what to do you know you just say calm yeah well you didn't just stay calm you stayed eerily calm and you were like reciting the Lord's Prayer when I asked you that I was like whoa I was like what are you saying over there and you're like I'm reciting the Lord's Prayer like the whole training I was just crazy but like that week in particular like I was convinced that this might be my last fight this might be my last day on earth like I I was so just like ready for anything at that point you know why were you thinking that might be your last fight I don't know some crazy I think I started to think that almost like every fight is it's crazy yeah in the world especially the all of the all of the the stressors that came along with this fight in particular especially all of those like and then we have but we've had a in that fight we had we had a few like kind of I don't want to say magical moments but say for instance we bring Mishka with us everywhere we go dog yeah our flight was delayed three or four hours and when we landed we landed like a few hours after that truck drove through the park and killed all the people in New York which was right by our hotel which if we would have been there on time we would have feel signed the posters and then been outside at a park walking Misha so I mean just little things like like that like we would have been outside maybe at that spot and had been witness to that thing or something that would affect Amina and the antiva March yeah and there is just all this stuff about you know like people are gonna be protesting and stuff like that and they even like the day of the fight and I just get a lot of anxiety all that stuff I get anxiety over like big crowds of people and it's like you know crazy you know and it's yeah I just I wasn't even just thinking about the fight when you wanna it was more than that you know it was like what if what all her energy represented to me like on my past like just negative people then you know you know wanna want to strike fear into your heart you know and I wasn't gonna let that happen even though I was scared but you know I just I wasn't gonna stop doing I was doing just because of that but you were a like eerily focused like one time she stuck her fist in your face and touched your face you didn't even move yeah cuz I know what you needed a reaction from me you know it's just like it's just like with anybody you know you don't give energy to something negative you don't feed the fire you know yeah that's gotta be a mindfuck for her though right right I'm used to people reacting to her and head-butting bet you know go ahead with her trying to show her and you just stay calm yeah because I mean you know it's it's uh either you really I mean it's either one or two things either you really dislike me enough to like you know put your hands on me outside of the competition or a fight you know or it's a character or you're just doing this for show right you know it's either one of the two and I just don't think she's really a bad person I just think that you know she's put in this position and maybe she you know that's what she felt like she had to do well I wrote something about the volcon O's Damir Daniel Cormier fight the other day that what OHS demeanor was trying to do and what Cormier was trying to do it's like they're trying to sow seeds of doubt that you're trying to there's a real issue with someone that's about to fight where you're about to compete and it's this crazy nerve-racking thing and the unknown is always there you don't know what's gonna happen so someone can convince you I'm gonna you up you let goddamn it you gonna me up yeah we start thinking it if you may if it's in your head and that one of the things that Daniel said in that fight was that there there's levels to this thing like you think you're gonna come in me up this is crazy this he's not you do not have experiences yet right and this is something that I you know I have a lot of respect for you want to still you know and I think it's great that I was put in this position to face her because I had to get better in order like I had to get up to that level you know to face her and I had to do a lot of research and work on my you know mental stability I mean she kept saying I was mentally unstable even those you know phone calls and stuff like the conference calls beforehand and I was like everyone she's saying you were mentally unstable what was there I don't know because Rose is mentally unstable yeah oh my dad is she was correct like in what way I mean well I don't know to me I can't speak for myself but like it's like everyone getting ready for a fight it's right it's um there are some people who can be excited about the fight the entire time and they don't give a about anything and they just they just love it and then there's also the ones who who get ready for a fight and while getting ready for the fight it's nerve-racking and especially with all the boogey woman and all that you're mentally unstable and then in the history with her dad and her is she growing up and just all of those things coming to a head this was exactly what Rose wanted to be the scariest possible situation for her to be in New York with the end with the aunt Eve of March that happened in front of the hotel the morning of we bit we almost didn't make it to the fight that much had what was going on this was the anti-donald trump march yeah and it sounded way bigger than it would was you know that I just you know like those when we had a walk right we had a walk to the arena know those year before yeah it happened in the morning of the fight right through the front of the hotel which which that that's fine but Rose had seen some weeks in advance someone somewhere post that aunt Eva was gonna they were gonna strike on November 4th nothing like seriously I was like we were getting ready like we had done our morning shake out you know it's the morning shake out so like the day of the fight we always like - I was like - like first thing we do when we get up is just shake it out like because you owe your nerves and stuff like oh you're like nervous energy is inside of you the day of the fight and you just want to you don't want to go to the arena the first time breaking a sweat or getting that heavy breathing you know because we're God before going to the arena yeah so what kind of workout to do just like like network or actually we we blow it out heart like you just get it out you know like like you know when you first start running or something or you do a workout and you're just like breathing heavy like you get your first like heavy wind out yeah that's like you just blow right through it so when there's no if you do just a pads like intense you know just whatever I'm actually it is like you go off of a feel you know whenever you're feeling like some days when I fought tisha I was like kind of sick and in time like on antibiotics cuz I got the red tide or something slightly like and I barely slept and like so I didn't our shake out was not very long like it was like okay I got to save my energy to get to the arena so we barely even did one but like for this one shake oh it was pretty normal you know it we just hit pads hip pads for about seven minutes and then she shadowbox real hard real hard for like five minutes and then maybe I might do a little bit of grappling or something like that but and then you know go take a nap like you know get a shower you know kind of visualize and just like lay down not even take a nap but just like close your eyes what you always eat the same thing on the day of a fight I barely even eat on a fight day like I the way I cut weight is I'll do like a the day before I'll do I mean I don't really have to cut that much weight so some but like I'll do like a juice fast I go for one day I'll just drink fluids and then the next day I'll sit in a hot shower and then just sweat it out cuz I don't like - I don't like to dehydrate myself too much like I'd rather have fluids and no food then then lots of food in my stomach no fluids right and she's talking about sweating out to power ya know like 5 pounds less yeah bigger now this fight was I think I was like 125 130 I can't remember I think like the week of the fight I was like 127 and like by the time wait cut started I was like 125 isch so you're cutting 120 she was what she was she Rose walks around lately lately because of this just the growth in size lately she's been walking around 125 127 but every every fight you know like the day before way and she's yeah we know like 120 yeah yeah talking about going to saunas my god man what are we gonna do to get this one off is like so you you don't have a particular type of food that you like to eat the day of kind of food like carbohydrate-rich it depends on where I'm at so like you know cuz every place has different food and like some places it's like nasty food but in New York there's this like little smoothie shop across the street there's just like most delicious smoothie that is really good so I had that like every day of the week and that was I think the day of the fight I had like a little bit of that but I don't know when he's the when Marnie Morgan was his coach she's always used to say like you know you have enough like food and energy in you to sustain you for the fight a it's more just like mentally like if you want to eat something right but so I so ever since he ever said that I was like yeah I never I never wanted to eat during fight day cuz I'm just like so nerves yeah you can't you can't digest it you have to be like relax you're kind of diet do you fall normally I try and make everything homemade as possible so that's like kind of my thing you know I'm never like I've never anti anything I don't like to be like I mean except for lots of sugar and obviously like things that are like obviously bad for you I like to yeah I like to make everything from scratch as much as possible and the more yeah the more like the more process that something takes in order to make it from scratch I think the less you should eat it you know like if like something like bread you know if you do it from scratch like make your own starter culture and like you that takes like a week by itself and you have to add more flour and water to it like over time it saves another two weeks so like you shouldn't be eatin bread every day you know so it takes a lot of work but like say you know if you have like a garden you got tomatoes which you know we grew the last camp you know you could just eat those real easy cuz you just pick it and eat it so you make your own bread - I tried what it says is alright but that's like my goal you know it's like to try and make everything from scratch and that's interesting that's our own kombucha oh yeah by the way this is pretty good like normally I don't I don't like I would use this brand to like make my own gt's yeah I like to do like the starters go beer whatever blue usually I don't like them just like bite it but this one's pretty good yeah gt's is my favorite then you have to have a driver's license to purchase that you have to be over 21 really yeah because it's got more than one half of one percent alcohol by volume so it's so sticky it's impossible to get drunk off of it I mean it's just got a very marginal moment because of the fermentation there's a marginal amount of natural alcohol in it yeah so you have but that's the good ones the other there's other ones you can buy in any store those are yeah they don't even have like the yeah Scobie and I like I like making it myself though because I think it tastes a lot better like I'll use green Teenz at a Black team I like add ginger and stuff like that to it that's cool I did that for a while I just get tired of it you know big bowls laying around yeah yeah but it's fun it's fun to do but I was doing that in the 90s yeah wait way back oh yeah yeah yeah I got one from Andy Dick Andy Dick gay me like he was making his house and he gave me something I was like this is actually pretty good yeah yeah I know so so yeah like the I always I mean I try not to be too scientifical and stuff but you know whatever like whatever feel good like whatever makes you feel good I think it's what you should eat I don't I don't like sweets or anything like that I don't really I grew up you know my mom was Lithuanian like my parents were actually Lithuanian refugees that came I'm first-generation American and we grew up like eating sauerkraut and you know just real Eastern European type stuff you know so I never really I never really liked candy or anything like that so I've always just been it's been a lot like a lifestyle for me and never like a thing that I'm on this diet that I have to do and you know what I mean mm-hmm now how did you get involved in martial arts um I said they put a put my me and my brother and Taekwondo like from a young age and then from there you know it was just such a positive thing for me just cuz like it kept us out of trouble yeah you know taught me how to defend myself gave me confidence things like that and then we also like watch light Dragon Ball Z growing up so we were like you know badasses or whatever and we thought we could power up a stuff so it was a fun thing for like as kids and then we kind of it kind of just evolved into more of like a you know real life application and you know peepees to make fun of us like you know for doing that but we also also used to get in like little fights on like in our neighborhoods and stuff and you know my love for martial arts grew from that and then I just wanted to try every martial art you know it's like you know the like like flavors of ice cream you know you just want to try all of it so so I tried um karate after that then that's where I got introduced to Jiu Jitsu for the first time like real basic you know positional things and then you know weapons and stuff stick fighting yeah I did stick fighting for a while that was pretty fun yeah with like you get like the head cage on you just like whack each other and then pankration and then after that once I got into high school I was doing a lot of sports and stuff like cross-country basketball track everything like I just try to be as active as possible try and stay busy cuz wrestling yeah I did a little like one season of wrestling I was a senior and then you know I came to I did kickboxing and I meant petia groups's gym in Milwaukee and then that's kind of where you know I saw guys like him at the apes' all those dudes like Juno's profession so I was like I mean I could do it as a profession too you know Wow and how old were you at the time hmm so I first walked into Duke gym I think I was like four tene and then I left because I had like other obligations and like you know stopped training for a while but I was you know still doing other sports and stuff and I came back you know when I was like 17 so you were really thinking at that time like maybe this would be something you could do for a career um you know not for sure but like definitely like I saw I was always gonna be involved in martial arts no matter what right so like as a hobby you just have another thing that you were thinking of doing before that so like when you were thinking about your future yeah I mean I I knew that I had to do something for money so like I tried a semester of college and realized it's like this is just like high school but I'm paying for it like this is stupid so I stopped going I really liked English and so I thought maybe I could go instead really like I said I try to push me to take computers and I was like this is stupid like I'm good if I just really doesn't excite me at all and so like that tough little if she wasn't doing more shorts right now she'd be should I not be touching this I don't know okay problem over there motion I'm hanging this out man I think Rose would have been farming farm yeah so like my yeah that's always been like my thing is like you know and they asked us why we won't be when I grow up is I always said I wouldn't be a farmer you know since I was a kindergartner just because you like the idea of growing things out of the ground and like you were saying before making your own food from scratch and yeah a tomato from your garden and she grew taste so much better than from the store now when you two started hanging out and Pat had already been accomplished kickboxer it was an MMA fighter and did that sort of embolden you to the idea fighting do you like professionally yeah mm-hmm and then I that's when I saw you know Gina Carano and and cyborg finding at the same like that big fight that they had and then that's kind of what inspired me to like I was like oh I can take this to the next level Wow Gina Carano things that got a lot of people in the MMA right mm-hmm yeah she was the first a lot of people don't even know a lot of these kids today that you know know about Ronda Rousey and they got introduced into the sport gina carano was the original Ronda Rousey mm-hmm she was the one back in the day yeah I like to rely you know she definitely she broke some barriers you know and then obviously Ronda you know came after her and took it to like even quadruple that so that's it's awesome what does it feel like to be the champ now because that's a crazy that's a crazy thing it's a crazy thing that happened right was insane and if people thought you were gonna win they probably thought you'd win by submission or maybe by decision but when you cracked her in the first round and dropped her and put her away and then DC starts screaming thug rows one of my favorite times commentating with DC too because he just was overcome with emotion just couldn't help it yeah I don't know man it's like somebody asked me like what's different since you've been champ and I'm like really I'm just sitting here trying to figure out what's different you know like obviously you're sitting here talking to you like that's cool but I want to talk to you before now that this thing happened right right so yeah I mean things are different you know like I definitely noticed more more people recognizing me and we have a very unique look to with your shaved head yeah and you guys are gonna fight again in April uh-huh back in New York yeah yeah girls come to Brooklyn what when you when the fight was over what did you what did you take some time off like how did you did it did it even sink in like her yeah yeah we had to get out of there we had to go home like like oh that's like you know the truck accident and like the protests and all this you know paranoia that I had I had to hide away I'm a hermit so like I like to like to be but we lose we went straight to the airport 2:30 2:30 in the morning our flight was until 9:00 a.m. a marathon right yeah the next day yeah we heard there's gonna be a marathon but also Rose did what she did and as soon as it happened we all went oh oh everybody be cool just keep smiling I mean obviously I knew that was gonna happen like I actually actually envisioned me knocking her out with like a uppercut in the third round cuz I thought she's gonna be like overly aggressive at their certain point she would get frustrated that didn't happen because it you know she thought I was throwing a jab but yeah why do you think that I mean when you went into that fight she was such an overwhelming favorite she was thought of as being one of the pound-for-pound top fighters in any way class and why did you think you were gonna knock her out because everybody tries to take her down everybody's so desperate for the takedown that it's like her striking I mean this from what I see is I mean I sit across from Valentina Shevchenko and like we go like back and forth like it's not a thing to me like I got Pat Barry Pat a Seabury in my corner I got Trevor Whitman in my corner and I've done Taekwondo striking like my whole life like it's not something that I've never seen before you know and just that Dutch style like cape boxing like it's great it's hard it's very intimidating to sent across room but you can you know it's very rhythmic on the beat like it's not I don't know it's it's just something that it looks scary but it's not to be scared of you know that's interesting the way you're putting it because most people thought of her as being like this very solid her fundamentals are rock-solid she's incredibly taxing yeah vicious jab ya know and but you just saw that the rhythm was predictable I mean we knew everything she was gonna do before she did it just we've been watching it for a long time you know like and she is the D like I mean she's the most dominant female like these girls could not hang with her you know and she's still the best out there you know Johannes been on the radar since she be Carla like we knew that that was the fight as soon as she'd be calling and it was just a matter of how are we gonna get there like what route are we gonna take to get there and so when the fight came around a big a big this whole this entire training camp was mental it wasn't physical the whole training camp every day was mental mentality mind mental mental strength is mental mental mental the entire training camp and one of the keys to the fight was knowing what she's going to do before she does it I mean not just in the fight but in the interviews in the press conference backstage like we we we knew everything that was gonna happen and it all happened exactly the way we know it was going to this was this was an excellent dissection of a person of an athlete now what is the feeling like having gone through that having accomplished it having literally blown it out of the water right you smashed in the first round crazy moment yeah now you got to do it again I know what's the thought process um you know just you can't make the the Mona Lisa twice you know like so it can't be the same approach you know it has to be something different it has to be but you know at the same time and if any broke don't fix it either so like it's got to be a combination of like you know we're going to keep doing what we're doing but you know keep getting better obviously all the time we don't we don't prepare for one in particular person it's always we're roses on the road to getting her black belt and that's what that's what the mission is I mean of course we do get into particulars based on who it is but that's only for a very short period of time the whole goal is just to make Rose a black belt in every and grappling wrestling striking interviews everything just just become a black belt become a master of all of it and that's been the goals like even another like he was saying the mentality of this last training camp it wasn't just like you know okay I'm gonna I'm in a journal which I do you know journal that we're all like you know like we talked about just doing like a float tank or something like that like those little mental exercises are great but also like woo working on creates it with us I was about to say I just I'm just doing the number of ice baths you took oh yeah I did yeah was the worst every day but like every day to a point where it actually became challenging for me to get the water call it sounds like this is ridiculous how she can get in and with an under now it's gotten to a point now it's been under 25 seconds like the you know when you first get is like right like it's under twenty second hundred twenty seconds is she's just stone-faced it's just amazing and the last one that I did like it's hurting so bad I was like crying like I never had I started crying like because it hurts a bit but anyway like yeah so that and then I find a lot of benefit from that yeah yeah I do like I I mean the yeah reduction of inflammation mm-hmm yeah and they're just like mentally and emotionally - right you know cause it's like why is this so scary but it hurts you know yeah but it's good I mean if you can get in the cold ice bath and nobody st. across from using to scare you cold but also and I wasn't trying to say it's the whole time but I've been also getting back into piano because I you know used to play piano as a kid and I got away from that ever since like moving from state to state and not having an actual piano just a keyboard it's like super trying to play on a keyboard but I finally got a piano in my house and so like that's another thing that I started incorporating into my you know training just like training my mind and just to be more creative and just having like a outlet - that's interesting so you feel like that benefits you just just being creative on a piano and yeah my music I think there's a lot of parallels between music and fighting oh yeah you think so - Pat I don't know well yeah he's I was I was classically trained in piano and jazz in high school and I was a my mom's a pianist and so like it kind of runs in the family and so we have been you know doing that as long as I've been doing martial arts and it's just a good balance you know just like gardening or anything like that is to you know fighting and hurting people it's weird I think it almost my like almost helped with her body mechanics in a way to be able to control an individual finger at different times and hit one beat on left hand and a different totally different something on the right hand and and to be able to do all that went over and over and over and over again no matter how many times you play the same song you just keep playing any love playing it over and over again I think that that that that put that gives rose like a cat-like balance in a way that's interesting have you seen no I'm sure you have seen a lot of those things that people are doing now where a light will go up on a board you have to touch the line like lemon chanko does a lot of that stuff yeah there's there's these things that are supposed to like be training your neurocognitive function your ability to react quickly to things right but there's probably some parallels in that right I would think so I mean like it like we said before it's like if you believe in and it works you know yeah whatever makes you feel good like ever makes you happy to no idea for this second we've been seeing the the lights and the touch this and that and I think for this next fight coming up a big roses next evolution in her in her game I think is going to be kind of like a sniper like accuracy so we have an idea of having rose punching tennis balls out of the air hmm you tried that hat yeah I haven't tried that yeah yeah yeah don't like that you don't like that hat why I don't know what's it it's for accuracy low mishchenko loves it he's like pretty cool dude yeah oh no he's a man at it but in my opinion I think staring at this I do think mm bang it's awesome fluid you just got that tennis ball in front of him he's being fluid yeah yeah you see him practicing with it yeah that's cool is a mug accuracy like I said that's that's somewhat of an idea that we'd like we have an idea for this next training camp where we're gonna be launching tennis balls I rose and having her punch balls out of midair but not but not not hitting the ball but standing there and throwing jabs as the ball drops right in front of punchin bone like throwing but throwing real punches versus your own idea that you came up with yeah I had a dream it was weird man it was a just saw it and and if we throw multiple balls at you in different ways and she can like throw a real jab and hit a ball boom then then she'll be able to I think her reflexes for hitting someone right in the tooth you know while there moving is going to be a more elevated and this is like just you know this is like I said where we always add new stuff you know it's like it's never we don't ever go away from hitting a freaking bag you know or doing Network you know like you got to do things you do road work yeah I love running I love running I you know I did cross country and track in high school and I was really good at but I think I was trying to run for the wrong reasons like I was trying to just get a scholarship and get out of the house and just go away you know like so I was like I felt like it was more of a job than it was like just for fun and now I run for fun and it's great you know it's just like a I don't know I think there's there's a book called like Born to Run minutes it's great I think minimalist shoes yeah I have some tennis toe shoes yeah do you run with those and like uh my brother like he takes it to a whole nother level of me like does barefoot completely yeah I'm like he's crazy but I try it a little bit but um yeah what's your uh there's anything no sidewalk yeah Wow yeah now who organizes your training camp these Trevor do it or do you guys all do it together yeah we're all we're all like a team that's the key to our little circle is like always having team meetings everybody being on the same page we're not going from one gym to the other to like you know where this coach don't know really what I'm doing or what I just did with this other coach like we're all really good friends and we all it's just it's just four of us right Trevor Tony Rose me yeah now we have teammates but the core circle is just four people right the people that are in charge of how the yam goes like fight handling is what we like to call it cuz it's like I mean you don't see Floyd Mayweather going to a boxing like class along his Valentina Shevchenko been in Denver now she's not she went back to Texas but she was it last year in January wasn't like almost all of 2017 that is a phenomenal training partner to have yeah that was perfect timing though one of the best things she's so technical yeah she's so good that check right hook that she throws is shown when she fought Holly with it she is shot Holly down with that check hook and she's got really good jujitsu like it's oh yeah it's yeah she's never signed and never stops yeah well she submitted Juliana penny I was like oh everybody's scared of her striking mm-hmm and her physical strength too is also very impressive too yeah like she muscles people angry lady like she's tough I'm a big fan and so um you know when I heard that you were training with her I was like oh that is that's that you want to sharpen the sword yeah iron sharpens iron yeah and I think - I think like a lot of girls aren't used to training with other girls you know we're used to train with other guys so it's like I think it's essential you know for us to get together every one so I don't have to be all the time you know but uh because when a girl gets like if I get you like another girl with something or she gets me with some I get so much more angry at it then like say if like you know somebody like powers another dude like gets me with some you know right yeah yeah so when you do in your camp say how many weeks out do you say or I can't begins now like say you have this at April 7th fight yeah how many weeks out will you we just say it's time to go to war I like I like to close everything off like five weeks out or like four or five weeks out like that's like where we hit it hard you know we're also depends on the scenario and who it is and where we are everything is a day-by-day feel like there's no you eat this one fight week and this is the Shane job that we're gonna do it's gonna be five runs it's all the circumstances like so the last training camp because we did like three training camps with Valentina Shevchenko back to back for her like do things that really aren't like what I've you know Rose was a great training partner yeah like like I was not the way that I would try and face her you know yeah certain opponents yeah so like just going through all of that and all those challenges going into this last fight we kind of just pulled it back like it was very not intense at all actually it was a lot more focus on like you sentimental part and like doing a lot of you know visualization and like self-awareness kind of exercises Valentina's going to 25 now right mm-hmm yeah I think should be fighting in February third so yeah and she's been she's been in Texas I think training down there so yeah and this all all on feeling we she did with Valentina was off camp so that was three training camps back to back to back she had a fight that Valentina came back and it was just more nice up in the way the way that Valentina is capable of doing what she's doing because she trains like I mean everybody knows good trainings like an animal everybody does ten to one yeah you have to 10 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and hobble sits there and roses necessarily emulating someone Powell Rose go get her go attack attacking and if and if and if she's not acting right go get Pat he'll get her like an attack like this it's just not something girl this tough man she was one of the biggest blessings for this training cap to come around yeah so so five weeks out is when you really get crazy now haven't already face you wanna and haven't defeated her so soundly in the first fight is I want to ever say that there's a possibility you could underestimate her because obviously she's a very dangerous and threatening woman but how do you keep it fresh like how do you how do you approach this with the same sort of intensity and anxiety that you had in the first fight that ramped up like your performance I mean that was a big part of how turned on you were and how tuned in you were yeah I've had I almost get like more pressure and anxiety off of like rematches I mean I have all my other past experiences to draw from so you know like when I rematch tisha there was a lot of lessons learned there and I have to kind of apply those same lessons to going forward or like other opponents where it could be there's many like a list of reasons to underestimate this person like I have to remember that anything can happen any moment and any way it can be dangerous and then at the end of the day you know whatever's meant to be is meant to be you know like I remember one time like in the middle of training camp I had like you know I like my little yogi T's where they like say like a little you know saying on it and it was something like if it belongs to you it'll come to you or something like that and so it was just like kind of that's how I feel about the belt it's like you know don't go chasing the belt you know just is the belts meant to be yours it's meant to be yours and do everything that you can to keep it and do everything that you can to just be the best version of you but you know don't put that pressure on yourself that I have to be the champion or I have to do this you know cuz y'all got to do anything though the whole quest has been to see if like it just the mentality has been let's see if I'm better than this next person someone out there is better than me someone eventually is going maybe you know me someone out there is better we just need to find out who it is and it might be the next person even if it's someone who we previously fought it might be her so we have to be as the the most ready possible because we don't know who that individual is and also like focusing on keeping the mentality of like being curious rather than having a need to know that you're the best like just being curious if you're the best I think that's a healthy way to approach it rather than needing to know like I am better than you it's like I don't know cuz we're all the same world you know human beings you know like at the end of the day like if it's meant to be it's meant to be but you went into that fight wholly confident that you were better than her yeah no I mean I definitely feel like I'm the better martial artists you know I'm better than the better fighter too and it's just there yeah I have a lot of going for me but I just have to remember these things that you know like truce yeah yeah yeah stay focused keep stay hungry now when it comes to strength and conditioning how do you how do you how do you parse that out like how do you what how much time do you spend doing that versus how much do you spend on skill work it's almost like almost all skill work I mean I shouldn't say all but it's like the strain the conditioning isn't something that we like is is on the first on the priority list it's kind of just like if we want to change it up or do something different like I started doing um sorry we just got our bikes it's been fun to do but it's I feel like strange the conditioning should kind of just be I don't know I I'm not I don't really believe in all these like like strain the conditioned culture i think whatever you believe in is what you know works for you and that it works right but for me that's something that i don't really i feel like a hamster in a wheel if i'm going into like some guy telling me to do these exercises and do this station and go to this thing for this amount of time like I just I want to be free like I want to be you know running outside I want to do something that makes me happy and like or for example like when we went to Indonesia and we we built airships for like entire month and like we didn't manual labor like what is an Earthship it's a it's a self-sustaining how's everything I'm a curious person Energon is a self-sustaining house that is built off of Lake recycle materials and there's a there's a documentary on it called garbage warriors and this dude Michael Reynolds he's in New Mexico and he he fought against legislation like in there in a community to make a Earthship community and in New Mexico yeah and so that he fought I can't remember how long it was but like like 40 years just something crazy like went to the court like we need to have this because you know and they just wouldn't let him you know so they eventually got it I think built the entire community and it's cool you can go there and like check it out in Taos New Mexico it's it's awesome and you can like rent summon stations check it out off-grid living it looks like Star Wars like it's ridiculous house is built into the ground no check out New Mexico know when you're going there's a hot spring that we go to well Taos on you know what we got to go there and interview Rick Strassman that's where he lives yeah he lives and I saw hippies that place is dope are you sure that's the house that house looks  bad-ass the thing is they're not just there's not just built anywhere like they they they do some type of coordinate so the house faces a certain like direction and the Sun comes through and keeps the like monitors a 70 degrees is like like the best possible yeah yep it's cool it's like you can have aquaponics inside and they like have banana trees growing in the middle of New Mexico you know and you can like fish in your living room like it's like that that's crazy yeah fish in your living room I mean you can have like you're like aquaponics you know where your fish are and you know your plants and the fish it fertilizes the plants I've seen a lot of built into the ground so like they're they're really resistant to move built one of these for like 30 days and we ended up like a whole YouTube like little video on it and stuff and just you crazy my diary's I have like YouTube channel I haven't done thug Diaries Doug Rose how did you get that name because I had to well so you know my ice cold stare hey Sarah Nonya wanna dance I've developed that long ago you know cuz I was never a witty person I never had like a good comeback for anything so I just had to beat people that like scare off like just real serious so that's like kind of where it came from and my neighbor I had some Jamaican neighbors that her name is Erica Gibbs and she always used to be like that stuck rose right there yeah telling you that was one of my fondest memories when DC was screaming that out yeah that was a pretty genuine moment 100 percent of people gave him a hard time about that I was like - don't ever change that that is one of the things that makes you amazing the fact that he's common doing commentary and it's like we're on a couch together yeah watch the fighting hole he's like right it was genuine happiness you know he was enjoying that moment this animated and it was just it was so stunning and shocking and that was his real honest reaction to right that was I like DC but yeah so that's that's why I feel like strained the conditioning I think that was the best like shoveling stuff like picking up heavy buckets and tires and things like that like it made me feel like I was actually doing something rather than just like a hamster on a wheel just like okay I'm working out and I'm getting a better shape but I I feel like I could be actually doing something productive here and getting muscles too so to answer the question we don't really do the strengthen condition that we do is and like wouldn't know it was not weightlifting and we feel like it but you know you know like how do you know when to do it like say if you're in a camp like say like when you know when you want to lift weights or something I mean it like for this last training camp I barely lifted away I don't think I'd you know we hardly ever do like walk around all day with a 40 pound weight vest on shadowboxing shuttle bus is the best workout you could possibly do cuz like I think people don't practically people practice hitting pads all the time but if you don't ever practice missing a punch you will get tired like if you throw three punches and miss right you and you never practice it you'll be surprised at how tired you are yeah it's kind of incredible how tired you get missing things it doesn't make sense to people and if you watch people shadowbox even professionals they suck it is like you know they just don't do it with no emotion no like visualizing like somebody in front of you like if you ever watched like my old jiu-jitsu coach back in Minnesota Greg Nelson ever watched him shadow box he's like he's like fighting people and killing people I use yeah I always got a great video on shadow boxing as Joseph Volta Leaney glory champion he's got a whole series of things up on this YouTube he's got some great instructional of YouTube videos but one of the things and he went talked about is that you should think of that as like you're fighting you shouldn't visualize like fighting and you're going through scenarios in your head you know you're checking kicks and countermove hands and and delivering techniques that's where a lot of people they think they they forget about the the imagination part of shadowboxing people like they leave that out they think okay standing there throw some punches throw some kicks stretch my tricep twice and then two more punches and move my head once and that's it they're not actually visualizing someone in front of you throwing punches and kicks at you and fighting back and they're not visualizing someone reacting to the punches that you're throwing yeah and firing back and moving around and when it comes to shadow boxing out that's that's that's what we really are Stern the conditioning shadowbot forty pound weight vest on walk around all day you see don't even do anything when you stay home all day with the weight vest on you do that yeah yeah dog bike riding with the weight weight vest is nice and it was that the gravity thing that they gotta do yeah well that's just part of like that's just like such a reoccurring theme and the Dragon Ball Z series is like just gravity training and like because once you take your weight vest off you just feel lighter you can breathe a lot easier no you can get a costume breathing with the weight vest is just sitting on your shoulders all day and moving around with this thing and it's just strengthens you and when you take it off take it off do you like you carry like backpacks or stuff when you go hunting and stuff yeah yeah have a pack that I wear that has a bolt on it for Olympic plates mm-hmm it's called an Atlas weak trainer but a company called outdoorsman's and they make it specifically so that people could train for hunting scenarios where you you know you have these heavy packs on so you could put 90 pounds on your back with these plates and it clamps down just like a regular barbell has a yeah hole locking mechanism on right but it's a real good backpack where like sits on your hips and connects and thank you say boy yeah it's perfectly like tuned into your you know padded right for your shoulders and everything yeah I mean I'm not like okay I'm not trying to be like against strange conditioning but it's just whatever makes you happy like I don't feel happy doing trying to get this to me like I want to do yeah have fun with it to like it but I like manual labor you know I like digging holes I like getting dirty I like being outside kind of think so but I used to powerlift like before I got to Colorado you know so that was a great thing for me at the time and I think it's just phases you know you just do different things you always go change it up and like uh there's this where we watching that one weightlifting documentary where he's like if you can't do a deadlift you know there's no point in living and it's like yes I mean deadlifts are the you know and squats and just like the basic you know like powerlifting positions or like movements but overall I just like to like one training can't when I fought page I literally first trained the condition or for a conditioning exercise I would chase my dog for like five five-minute rounds because she's the fastest thing I record chaser so hard crank catcher hilarious that's a good way to do it me rock used to chase chickens right remember I run with my dog all the time it's dogs are in shape and we have videos like that's getting ready for a fight what's she doing she's chasing the dog what else it should be a thing you know like training camp it should be hard work right but it should also be fun right you know like what what the hell am i doing if I'm not having a good time doing what I love to do like just for money like no I want to make sure I'm enjoying myself during these training camps and making sure that if I didn't have this fight would I still be doing this kind of thing I've always heard that someone that is asked like how do I get in shape I said well if you take martial arts the beautiful thing about it is you're getting in shape but you're having fun yeah like you're enjoying it and then you don't even realize how hard the work is because you're having fun and you're like getting a skill yes you're getting a skill it's like dinking it's like a Jitsu and this is me saying yeah jiu-jitsu is better than lifting weights in my opinion haha because man just heavy weight would give me it's slow so it's so much static whole right maybe I'm doing it wrong but it's tough right it's home I mean in what I feel like is if when you get out of it because it's a fun activity because it's interesting and it's not just 20 not like doing I can hit a set of hundred curls right now we can I can i light weights G Jiu Jitsu has been that's been just phenomenal man just like the strength that you can get from that if you're strong there then you're strong a lot other places and when it comes to rose conditioning like Rose we just we practice functional functional things like punching harder mm-hmm kicking harder right grabbing the dummy in guilty knee and squeezing it front 10-second holdin me great great Greg Nelson would walk around with a screen mistake mm-hmm on his on me he would just sit there and come more of the stick oh we're gonna get against his forearm and just come more this stick over and over we just to practice that technique we wondered why is this going on but then if he grabs your arm is it's pretty hard to stop well she the reason why my camera got so good cuz like we was literally like shrimp up and down I'm at shadowing like shadow boxing shadow grappling like Kimora's Greg's an underappreciated guy who really is underappreciated guy in the world of martial art it's very very knowledgeable guy a very nice guy too very knowledgeable and there's that's that's one of the guys that that for sure is one of the guys who you can ask a question about any type of technique or anything and not only can he give you the answer but he can give you the history behind it and he sits up this dude is a martial artist like yeah out of this world and he like it was it was it was it was a big deal bumping into him and then taking everything that we've like that she's learned from him and then coming to Denver where where we met Tony bacilli the three of our graphing coach and then he took everything that all of the the technical things that Rose learned and took that to Swagger to put the flavor in it man just took it Tony fingers like yeah it's just a good combination because yeah like wearing else is very like like martial artists like very strict and Tony's very like you know very creative and just does different movements and things that you haven't seen before you well I'd like you both to speak to that because it's very important to me to how the coaches that you get the martial arts instructors that you get the people that you run into they're so critical it's it's so important and they should be praised like if you see a guy like Matt Hume it could create a Mighty Mouse I mean those those people they're so rare it's like they're so valuable and you got to get that connection with that color you know like that's important to you you got fine the right fit find the compatibility and um so I think that's why you see some people bouncing around because obviously they don't really but with this place or you don't vibe with the community or the town that you're in you know me I want to live in this city and so you try out Denver for a little bit or maybe maybe Milwaukee's your spot you know it's like there's so many different alternatives and there's so many different styles that people have like for some people you know American Top Team would be the spot for some people you know maybe they should try Montreal and go up to see for us a hobby you know it's yeah just--we're it's we're so fortunate now I think that there's so many places to choose from where you can you can go to John crutch down in Arizona you know you go to the lab you can go to you know Duke Rufus and Milwaukee you can go there's so many places now it's it's amazing yeah and to find your flavor like there's there's some places where you go there's some gyms that you go to in the the training at the gym consists of who shows up to practice that day yeah and it's like right everybody we're working on single legs and just go and just fine you get better based on who showed up like all your teammates that showed up and then there's there's the coaches where they're very one-on-one like the Matt Hume created Demetrius Johnson like Trevor Whitman is is is good enough to take an individual and make them an individual versus all right everyone in the room we're all gonna throw this one jab and that's it like right he's very very specific and can make he can he can find wood you're good at and and help you become an individual like I say in the gym yeah and it may be his style is perfectly matched for you and but it might not be perfectly matched for somebody else and it's it's such an interesting relationship between trainers and fighters and and what really bums me out is how sometimes fighters forget they just forget what got them there they forget I think it's all about them and it's such a selfish sport in a lot of ways because it's really only you in there yeah I mean they like I mean they've been in so many training camps like literally Pat has a meniscus surgery that he needs to get fixed you know and it's like they go they beat up their bodies just as much as we do to to train with us and I especially you know in my situation where it is like fight handling and it is like very one-on-one kind of a deal where it's not like I have hundreds of training partners and I go to this you know like ATT for example they have like hundreds of people there and you know like I just have these guys so yeah so it's good to appreciate your coaches it really is you know really is it's um it's uh it's such an unusual relationship the relationship between a fighter and a coach it's uh yeah I mean like once I once I finally you know once I finally went through kind of just my different learning lessons like after I fought Carroll and I didn't have him in my corner and like after like I realized that that was you know the missing link and we it's just something that I realized you know if I can't do it with these guys I don't want to do it no more you know because it's just it's all about being happy it's all about what makes you happy I mean you ever notice how like kids never get tired or like they can just run around in circles for forever and it's because they're having fun doing it and so that's the that's where the training is based is like whatever makes you happy now when you look at your future and you say I'm the champ now mm-hmm do you have a road map that you have like I want to retire in ten years I want to get this I want to accomplish these things do you have anything like that or just mine yeah like I like to have a plan and then if things change and you know that's fine you know you have to be able to adapt I plan on not fighting longer than five years from now you know how old you know 25 so 30 that's a wrap yeah I don't want to fight in my thirties I mean I could you know by the time that comes around like like time fly it's like I could be three years on be like hey folks it's also you have the potential to be a  huge star yeah I mean I don't want to freak you out but you're straight you're a very unique person and you're this very strange time in in history where it's almost freak you out but I think the sport needs someone like you yeah I really think your unique perspective I think it can help a lot of people to recognize that there's a there's a broad spectrum of people yeah there that are doing this and that you're genuine the your genuine behavior and thought process and and the how in-depth your thought process is I think it's very it's very important right now I think it is important especially for women to you know because uh you have a tendency to be pretty catty and bitchy towards each other and I think that um if I can show an example to other women to be more loving to each other and not just you know woman to one but to each other man and or woman it's just it's I think it's important it also the way you shave your head you weren't but you're still beautiful I mean that's a support and you're also a beautiful person like your personality and I think that that's that's so that's so needed right now thank you always like like in time there's always dark times and light times is dark times we've been in the world in general for the last few years has been kind of things have been kind of whack people are wearing more sunglasses at night the fighters are getting more ridiculous as just yeah and and I feel like as if not that we've hit a seriously low point but things have gotten pretty whack and I I have the feeling that after that performance I got through what she did and what she said that that was like a spark of the beginning of things coming coming back coming back up like just things being a little bit more not so like not so  ready it looks like I said everybody's got their sunglasses on everybody's showing up with a leather jacket with no shirt on under it everybody everybody's like talking crazy and just being ridiculous man well Conor kind of changed the game no no everybody's gonna be wearing these pants I mean it's it's it seemed to me I mean this is uh just my take on it I feel like the UFC missed out with Amanda Nunez they when they were marketing Ronda Rousey for that fight first of all I was looking at I was like this is all Ronda Rousey and she is facing in my opinion the worst possible matchup Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt who hits like a truck and a real tested warrior they didn't promote it they made they promoted the Ronda Rousey thing the Ronda Rousey come back and her walking around her mansion frowning like she's coming back like she's coming back to fight a killer yeah and why not promote the killer like this woman is Merkin people like what she did to me should take look what she's doing to people she's blasting people into orbit mm-hmm and then she wins and here you have this opportunity of the very first a woman who is a mixed martial arts UFC champion first first one ever hey this is no there's no big no big push but that also could mean from what we from what we've just discovered over the last three month that could also be Amanda though like we left New York that night and no one talked nothing it was different for two months bro we went home and we looked out the window for two months trying to figure out who's walking down I mean we we we we shut it down they wanted rose to instantly on a victory tour across New York they want us to stay in New York like after that whole week in New York day after the fight they say we want you to stay in New York you on a victory tour and I had I was like no way absolutely not we have to go with leave word not only do we have to leave we're leaving right did you think that there was some benefit in doing a victory tour of doing a bunch of different television show no I feel like I might have like I don't know what I would have even said like with interviews at that time because it's just like still processing I haven't been a good time but I think that's one of the things that people would like to see you try to process it yeah we're gonna see Rose do this I think in that circumstance it's critical who you talk to yes you could be talking to some normal morning show dummy and they don't give a about the sport and they're gonna ask you stupid questions you're only on for five minutes and like with the camera looking back in hindsight I wish I could have like took it in a little bit more but it was kind of like okay next fight like you know I mean it's just like everything is just like okay let's get out of here like happen we all we all stood up we shook hands we said everybody everybody be cool we just gotta get the we got to get home I should say I like that too though yeah I like that approach too so in our entire relationship like pet has had to learn this over time that like if I get the instinct to crows got a really need to bust out like I you have to listen to me like now's the time to go happen like in multiple occurrences where roses intuition has been spot-on a you know we got to get the out of here right now and we're like re cool so it like there's no question now there's no questioning anymore if Rose said right now we out we drive we call it everybody knows a countdown Rose say let's bounce ten nine we're getting launched show the last time she did this wait we gotta get the out of here we were leaving there was the one of the first times we had going out to a nightclub in three years when like eventually Valentino like won her fight in Denver so we're like are you going out tonight I want to do it you want to really gonna do it and we went out to a little it's fun and we danced in four years we haven't done done any time I doesn't we danced it was great and everybody had a great time and then we're all of a sudden out of nowhere 12:31 Roe says you know we got it let's get the out of here and it's insane just instant is the instant change of the feeling around one o'clock or somebody say look we gotta get the out of here and with and within a minute we had eight people will grab if you come with us let's go let's go you know you're from the gym how you getting home coming with us like to get in the van and we walked through the club down the stairs past this really big guy that was by the front door arguing with the security guy right peso excuse me sir right past him and as soon as we got past him he started shooting everybody you just started shooting everybody why it's been it's been instances like this was there where the gun was going on and then not only that but we got in the van and everybody don't move the dude they he walked to the car that was parked right in front of us like we were parked like this chick we're in the van this chick runs up to the door she's scrambling trying to get in his guys casually walking we don't know what's going on he's just casually walking around we just see this guy he opens up the door pulls a gun out she's bow shoots her he was having an argument with the doorman I think because they weren't letting him in or something like that so he just started shooting pow pow pow pow and then he walked to his car and when he got his guy was it huh huh put the gun up again and hit him or two douche and then got in the car and they just casually drove off yeah I like I will call it like instantly like I just think you have very good intuition yeah I just seen stuff like that you know like I will I just can feel the energy of a room like change like you know when I was a kid and we was just playing basketball and and it's like it's weird how nobody else will pick up on it like except for myself you know in those situations like I was playing basketball with my friends and then like down the street I thought I heard something in a distance that like you know just people talking but it or some like people making noises but I didn't you know there's there's always noise we're in the middle of the city you know but for some reason my attention was brought to this noise like it something's wrong so I look and I'm like and I think I see some people wrestling over there or something and you know my friends like oh no that's broke they're probably cool with you timeout and I was like I'm gonna go over there and check it out and so I go you know run across the street a couple blocks down and then like also and I see a guy have a knife he stabs him you know and then he falls down and he like turns towards me and I'm like oh  you know so and then I realize that my my little like dude that I that I would like help raise like as a kid because he was like young as as well as myself his name is Matthew and then I saw him follow me over here and so I thought I was the only one so I was like oh hey Matthew go home you know like so we had to run and then he ended up just driving off or whatever I don't know if they found the guy or whatever but Rosa said like we're on a highway driving on a road trip she said get off right here like it's quick you don't ready Oh gonna start getting off at a car flips over did you just it's spooky I don't question it I don't question anymore and then just like you know just like the whole thing with the with the truck driving accident like that type of stuff like it just seems like I don't know like and that's why I always believed in the fact that if you're delayed or you're late for something it's for a reason you know and so that's why I was like the week of the fight I was like in nervous because it's like we're gonna get there late and you know it's gonna be you know things are starting to go wrong already and then once we landed I kind of like put put the pieces together like oh yeah that's that's why everything happens for a reason so do you you always feel like you're kind of tuned in to something that other people aren't tuned into um it depends on where I'm at my life like sometimes if I'm if I'm living the right way if I'm healthy if I'm like you know in shape or if I'm you know spiritually right yeah like tuned in that way that you're not troubled like if I'm surrounding myself I'm making the wrong choices and I'm surrounding myself around like you know it's just evil and stuff like if I'm or just just like the wrong people you're Trump yeah then I won't have fun dude you're confused and yeah then it's hard to make clear decisions or like yeah or to have good intuition yeah yeah so if you're free of any regret or remorse of your own actions yeah more clearly you can discern what's going on in your environment right and that's why I say like very very very super observant I mean just coming up with the and it's almost like a I would say just from the stories that I've heard of the growing up in the past because of those experiences she got it really like a really good really good at scoping out of room you know I mean like really like nothing can like it's really hard to sneak up on Rose when she sees you coming from two days ago like it's really it's it's it's a she's very observant I said let's say that and in a way because of because of growing up it's it's a skill that had to be developed you know you snuck up on me once it'll never happen again even like it's kids like you know people that I used to like hang out with on the in my neighborhood we would like help each other out like we would teach each other like yeah I don't go down that place or don't hang out over there because somebody got shot over there or like you know like if the same car like circles around this block too many times like go inside you know think how hard is it to watch each other fight when he was pretty hard for me but then when I was actually there when he had a kickboxing fight and I was actually able to be in his corner I felt a lot better but being away at home that was difficult for me and also because she knew internally I wasn't ready yeah yeah well I guess that's not that that's also the big part of it like I could have been more ready for the majority of the fights that Rose was around for what was wrong with me yeah not mad just fighting for the wrong reasons and just not not necessarily going about it in the healthiest way I mean I had a prescription pill problem you whiskey was delicious I mean just just living living living not that not the healthiest life and not the best life like like I said I was doing I was doing it for the wrong reasons like there was a when Rose and I met I said you are you are good enough to be a world champion enough to be the best in the world and this is something that you really want to do I'll make sure you never have to have a job all you have to do is train if this is something that you really want to do I'll make sure you never have to work a day in your life all you have to do is train and be a fighter and that's it so as soon as that started I I kind of I caught myself getting into fights asking how much does this one pay 25 and 25 all right cool I can do some math on if I win it is another lose all right cool just get into the fight you lost I don't give a  how much like I I find myself get uncontrollably getting into that scenario now the cake box and message she was that I was ready for that like I actually was was past all that the shitty decision-making that I was making and and was actually prepped for that woman but there were other times where whether it be conscious or not subconsciously there was somewhere inside of I would guess the mind where we both knew that I wasn't I hadn't done I'm supposed to do ten but no one's looking so I only did eight and I just didn't say anything you me like that that type of thing do you have regret no no no no never and the reason why is because if I go back and change anything I won't be sitting here telling you right now you know like every decision that I've made every life experience that I've had dad passing away when I was a kid having to do all these different like all of the decisions that I've made and all of the trials and tribulations that I've been through have been exactly why I'm sitting here right now with a beautiful woman right next to me who happens to be a world champion talking to Joe Rogan like and you know I've learned a lot of lessons from his mistakes you know like and his his successes as well you know just watching him yeah go through all that it's it's helped me a lot ya know it's almost like I've been able to experiment with having a UFC career but not actually having to like do it you know like living vicariously through him and then now I can know it I could do it if it's like doing it all over again when did you decide to stop Pat I still not you still not know No I'm never going to this is this doesn't have to be a belief that everybody believes in but I believe that if you're a fighter you don't really retire you never really retire until people just stop giving you fights I'm never gonna want to stop I'm always going to want to fight always always always the last time you fought man you know what was it in glory now this was like like no legacy I think afforded the more Demario dinners it was maybe my last fight last came boxing match I think um I think that was it like two years ago but like it like I still want to fight now I have a have a lateral meniscus tear that I would like to get I need for this for just my own happiness and for roses training campaign to get with like take care of that because that puts a lot of hindrance on training after all these years as soon as then he starts feeling weird I automatically just take it easy and just don't with it too much but that's not a tear that can be fixed with stem cells or is it something that has to be done with a scope I think it needs a scope we are just finding out about stem cells the question I was gonna ask you how do you feel about that like I would you know I need you know what you told me before um but I'm a big believer in that yeah yeah I'm sure he does some pretty miraculous  if you use it correctly and get a good doctor yeah so I'm looking for dr. Davidson from the UFC yes yeah talk to him about it he's well he's so I talked to her I called him kind of in a we have he left we 11 weeks out from the fight mm-hmm I would like to call myself one of roses main training partners and it would be cool if I can get this need taken care of either this week or next week at the latest so I can have the few weeks off of recovery and still have seven weeks left to attack Rose every day you know I mean like in order for us to do that but do I want to fight again yeah snaps I'm always gonna want to fight I gotta fight over yes I know I know hell no but will I fight again no idea though you know it has to be like the right thing you know like it has to be I think it was going to be like on a Sunday at the county fair or something like that he's a guy who's been around a long time but I got off of that now as I said no thank you but I mean I'm still I'm still getting the the calls every once in a while for not as much say no thank you because it was a bad offer no no no no well I don't know not not not good timing and this is an MMA fighter a kickboxing fight man I think it was gonna be a kickboxing match with the MMA gloves on I think hmm I don't know but I also had another fight with Erik Prindle was supposed to be November 18th that that was a kickboxing match with the MMA gloves on I think that one got postponed which was completely great like Rose is the I'm not gonna I'm not getting in the way of that like roses rolling right now I am come I'm I'm embracing the the role of a coach and team leader now not being the athlete anymore and I get it I do I'm 38 now whatever the is going on with with me which things are a lot better now I'm healthy and everything is great but Rose is where it's at like that's where my attention my time and attention has been since we met like since we met and it's still gonna be that way like roses roses I'm gonna I I said when we met I was gonna make it a point you will be do you have what it takes to be the best I'm gonna make sure of it you know like that that that's the role that I like that's the role that I like now it's a lot more comfortable now oven big pizza every night like I love it like it is it's it's more comfortable now for me to do that now at the exact same time it drives me crazy that I'm not fighting you just gotta have a good purpose but how what you're doing you know that's just like the bottom line you know whatever you want to do you can do anything that you want to do it what's your reasoning right and for me at this point is to change the world like kind of reasoning is to change the world yeah really yeah also this isn't like my this is the my best skill and my bet like the thing that I can do the best and I think it reaches a lot of big audience and making it my message across yeah and you know like you were saying like just setting a better example trying to change the way people think or at least is offering a different perspective you don't got to think like me you know I'm this is an active idea yeah in your head like while you're training while you're doing media you're thinking I have a chance to change the world I want to build a urban farm in my community and I want to make it available for like other people that because the way that I grew up I wish there was like an urban farm where I could learn how to grow my own food and I could get my own food that was not from the grocery store you know and so I want to provide that for other people and you know fighting is the best the quickest way I can do that I think you know yeah for example I started getting into like some crypto currencies and stuff and there's this thing called evergreen coin that's just like you know one of the alt coins whoever no no it's still pretty small whatever but it's it's a salt like it's a sustainable cryptocurrency that doesn't doesn't use as much electricity and it kind of goes into every kind of philosophy that I agree upon you know it falls in line with my beliefs in it there's just a lot of aspects about it that I really like and so that's something that like you get you can it's good for charities so like if you hold some evergreen coin like you can get some stock in it from I sound kind of stupid trying to recite all this information but yeah like you just you can generate money with it and then you can donate it to charity and it works that way so these are just a bunch of different things that you would like to let people know about and help people understand yeah and I'm formulating these ideas you know obviously like cuz I mean fighting takes up like all your time you know but I like to think about these things and I think it just you know over time it's just kind of kind of fall into place you know just doing things like you know the Indonesian Earthship trip and like just doing different stuff that I can build skills for later and you're gonna do more of this on your YouTube channel yeah I'm trying to I'm trying to I've been trying to say now as a Jap it seems like a great idea yeah yeah I've been trying to put together the next episode I have a whole bunch of footage but um so like sorry guys it seems like something we want to get involved like some sort of a production company or something I mean it sounds like a no-brainer to me yeah I've got a camera guy Austin Aragon who you know he does a great job and it's just been it's just been kind of a roller coaster you know all this traveling or just you know trying to know weird things together together we don't want to shut it down and put it on pause after the Michelle fight yeah after Michelle Waterson fight however long was as soon as that was over with we knew you honor was next and we everything stopped social media kind of just off of like that for a little while and not off of it completely but just trying to like minimize it and because I knew that well I think it you know I don't know it's it's the the most addictive drug you know like just being on your phone and you just fill your head up with just like a whole bunch of information that like when you're focused on just this one person and like to defeat this person this one mission it's hard to you know like you only have so much room in your head for that kind of stuff and also because we knew you wanna was checking your Instagram every day would drive her crazy to not post anything I'd be seen anywhere like it's it's it's she even said in an interview she's like she don't want to do social media so I was like wait I mean she couldn't see you she had no idea what you looked like she didn't seem trained and she's doing any other defense it probably she had pay-per-view porn she had a great reasoning to do it but part of the strategy going into this fight was to go CEO on her that was that was a big that was a factor that was a big part of this game plan was to ghost her no matter what she says no matter what she does and we knew that it was gonna come in level she's gonna say this then she's gonna say this then she's gonna say this then she's gonna talk about your dog like it's just gonna it's gonna get bigger and bigger and bigger and she might even we even knew she's gonna touch you she's gonna push you she's gonna touch you when she does don't move don't react give it enough and give her nothing and it worked now she knows though believe in you know like I mean I'm going to put a hex on her he's gonna she's gonna she's coming mega buggies coming I love it you know I don't hate on her for doing she's doing you know it's just it's kind of like silly you know to me but without her and without my contrasting personality that fight wouldn't have been nearly as exciting as it was you know so like we need I need her and that's why thing I like to get people to understand like other fighters like you need your opponent just as much as you need your training partners and your teammates and your coaches you know like it's your dancing partner like it's the show you know and it's also but it's real too you know yeah it's also what gets you up yeah it gets you fired up I mean the to fight a woman that's that dangerous yeah yeah no yo yo hey yo so she told the ROS some crazy like okay so I'm all week was going on we missed the car accident we missed the end like the aunt Eva thing happened right in front of us we got down to the locker room and they gave Rose the wrong gloves and didn't want to give her the right gloves like they gave the wrong gloves what do you mean by the wrong gloves I need like a bantamweight side glow and it gave me a strong specifically before yeah yeah mm-hmm she's got broken fingers this was going on we also got to the arena late well I usually get to the arena and you have three hours right but you were just gonna say something you stopped yourself you said she was she said something to Rose yeah yeah so we get to only we got we got we got to the arena late they give the wrong gloves they played the wrong walk out music like some walk out music I have no idea there's something terrible well so originally what was a sweet freedom yeah I switched it to that and all week long I was like because I want to something uplifting so I'm happy you know and and that was something that we've been jamming out to for like a few weeks or whatever and the whole week I've been telling Pam like I can't wait till they play my walkout song [Laughter] what was the song he actually came out to do you know I have no it was like some oasis no someone make a decision that they up don't know I try it I think somebody might told me that there's a mistake here man right I mean it's just such a contrast thing like style of music I go anyone know how you can make that mistake like it to be the best part it was the best part of the week because by the time that happened it was like ah it it she said you wanna you wanna before the fight came like they you doin the you sided drug testing roses walking back through the hallway with her official and she crossed paths with you Anna and all by herself and you wanna do it oh yeah she like in a different tone of voice to like the weirdest like she doesn't seem like herself first time I mean I'm sure she's getting in fight mode or whatever and she's like breaking in her gloves and she's like and that gave her like the whoa you know and she gave me what's up and then she was like um it's like she asked me something like did you buy the ticket her I was like like do you believe them or do you believe in them or something like that do you believe him did you buy the ticket yeah and then she walked off into st. and I was just like oh even in the no way and you know and the way is like all kinds of mind came back to the locker room now we're ready all week we've been deflecting we've been deflecting now Rose is a very emotional person intemperate like she's we got to keep rolling keep rolling straight because she comes in with the wrong look on her face oh something's wrong she goes off and does the drug test and comes back and when she sat down she sits down and says we have to have a meeting now that's cold we have to have a meeting is code for shut it down everybody get the out we were bouncing we have to have a meeting is like kind of another way of saying start to count down with Lee okay we have to have a meeting and when she said that the way she said it I write everything came over me like oh  what happened and then when she said would you honor said in the back what do you want to told the do you believe him did you buy the ticket and then left without any explanation yo when when Rose said that to me my  head exploded it and the only thing I could say was oh I don't want to have to think about this all night time world Muay Thai champion and she just knows how to with people we deflected everything we deflected the knuckles in the mouth in the crazy that she was saying to everything and if she came and said that when and where we got like to like this was like she maybe she delayed our plane good three four minutes for three or four minutes Trevor Tony Rose and I all sat in the locker room just like silent because because because that was the little that was the little thing that could have  everything up because I know I was thinking like what does that mean what does that mean did you bother to she says do you believe him but she had to know his horseshit right you know what she was doing like if you ran into someone at the 7-eleven and they said crazy asshole she said it with a calm voice and there's no action no accent no accent just just said it real calmer like to the point where there's there's even a chance and I think this one there's even a chance you wanna know maybe she knits I don't know man I just like roses be spooky sometimes man like so there's a chance that like just with the way the whole week went that maybe that was let's say God or a higher being or something like that maybe that was the last test do you  believe him did you buy the ticket and then just walked off was that was a test of whether or not alright are we gonna get all the way down to right here and you're gonna be here now this is after the fact system by the way like in a moment something inside of me I was like I don't know what she time up but just give her the thumbs that like yeah my guy believed in them we were in the locker room and really Rose had to get up to go and do something over there when she got over there I turned the Trevor and Tony say hey y'all we and some oh just trying to with your head actually works got about three minutes we would someone's on great amazing this like that works a little mindfuck yeah what I mean cause it's my believing yeah she's a wizard yeah hey well she came back and said this I said this started thinking like what did I do now you think it all about you don't think it all about doing that back to her I mean you just her up in the first round so what do you say that I think I did like I did her up in the head though you definitely did she's got this thousand-yard stare she's and I was like what were you saying you're like I was saying the Lord's Prayer I was like oh Jesus Christ right it was like the devil and a priest I was like to to you together was like she was like saying she was the boogeyman's what my favorite staredown this is to build up what you handled it was very interesting because most people handled it they'd get in her face - you bitch in the room now she willing Claudia and her would get together and I think that emotional like the conflict and all the extra energy that's involved in that like if Fox with people's heads right that's what she's looking for I think over you Ana's career she came in as the silent killer who was destroying everybody and then she found out that if I start talking to someone they get  in the head before the fight even happens and then it worked and it worked and it worked so I got to the point where she's that that that almost that that that one weapon right there almost replaced some of the ferociousness and in her fighting maybe yeah like like knowing that and that was also why the game plan was was to go seoeon and no matter what happens like we know that she needs a reaction she's looking for something no pictures no videos no social media no interviews no nothing and when she says something don't even look at it just like she doesn't exist just ghost it goes to the entire times we know for a fact that even before we were signed up to fight she was thinking about me you know week she knew I was on the radar of coure a long time yeah yeah yeah I mean there's a handful of contenders in the strawweight division and you are at the top of the heap and especially after you beat Michelle right yeah yeah that's how we knew it so no social media no nothing we just we so now feels better you know like not having to do all that yeah but I mean on you to try to do that no they they they they did but we so honestly said not this time that they just understood mmm we very honestly said the way that's not that's not gonna work out for us we need to we need to prepare for this fight and we need to be all the way ready now this of course there's some interviews that need to be done but the other like the other little things like how come you're not posting about I mean not retweeting this pictures like nope it'll be hilarious if you did a bunch of that had nothing to do with the fight like almost like you know you were fighting it's found a cool Indian restaurant I love this movie it's hilarious I mean cuz really like I think you should like show other sides of you other than just like I get kind of just bored just pulsing another group picture another like oh this is what I'm eating today or you know they're this is my workout today I don't know I mean some of the workouts is definitely to be watched like we got some cool footage hiding away but you post that stuff after the fight or do you think that any of the stuff that you post like on workout footage training footage especially like working on technique do you think that in any way that helps people read you I don't know cuz it's totally different standing across from me in the rain you know what I mean like I could train I mean I trained with teachers Torres you know like and we fought each other we've lived in the same house together like for multiple weeks you know and I'll still fight her again you know what I mean so it's like it's not it's you can't I mean there's things you could pick up yeah but I'm gonna change it up on you I always got another ace in my pocket you know yeah I like to I don't I don't I keep everything to myself you know like what a give you know sure and train training it's it's so it's so it's so it's so barely different but but it is still different how you can train together all day and night but when the bell rings for a fight it's totally different yes you ever hear you ever hear stories of Clay Guida in the gym and at practice you can't we've been hearing for years that Clay Guida just gets thrown around at the gym all day and night but when he gets in the rink and fight like a monster like we've like there they can they can train together all day and night but when it comes fight time it's just it's just confident in my ability that I'm really good at what I do you know and it's just it makes it more fun to share it with people only you know but I don't give all my secrets away making up new ones you know but listen Rose I'm happy you're out there cuz you're a lot of fun thank you I really enjoy calling you fights and I really did enjoy that whole the whole week all the the press conferences and your behavior and I think too day like I said after your fight that post-fight speeches month one of my all-time favorites yeah thank you it was awesome it was very genuine you know and I think you guys have an awesome relationship it's very cool so I can see you guys and how much he cares about you and the way you guys work together it's it's awesome yeah yeah hopefully we can uh maybe not make the Mona Lisa again but you know make the Pope Cosmo we call him we call Dana White and told him after the when they were asking for the next fight they're trying to get us on the contract we told them that she won the belt so we were gonna start a family and she won the belt so we're gonna start a family man come back in a few years let me say they didn't like that at all it would be puppies like nah man just kid April seventh pay-per-view I'm gonna be there and I can't wait Thank You Cadbury thank you bro thank you yeah [Music] [Music]
