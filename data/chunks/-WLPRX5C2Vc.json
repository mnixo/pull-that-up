boom and we're live back from Hawaii right before it fucking blows up and sinks into the ocean just in time whoo we barely made it when we were flying above the Big Island as we were flying above what's the matter okay as we were flying above the Big Island a six point nine earthquake blew up yeah that's not good now shane dorian fucking lives there we looked out the window and saw the island like explode and sink dad that was I was sad by at least I mean we had a good hunt people were surfing though yeah they caught those waves and worried about a tsunami no it's not gonna sink but it's gonna get bigger that's what it is I mean the whole thing's a fucking volcano people are shocked wait the volcano's volcano yeah yeah you live on a goddamn volcano oh great I wish you would have been out to fly over it though yeah I was looking at the like the map of what the way we fly we fly so we can't see it the entire way yeah which is bullshit yeah plus it was cloudy which is also bullshit that would have been cool I even asked a guy like which way do we go yeah that would be fucking awesome if we flew over that thing yeah yeah fuck living on a volcano though man good place to visit though is beautiful Oh stunning yeah yeah right and where we were we were on lanai and lanai it's an interesting place 3,000 people 20,000 deer right and and so you do the math you think hey this is gonna be gravy there is way more deer than people but god it's tough it's tough hunting yeah hunting for sure well this is one of the best examples of if you want to make an argument for hunting like this in certain situations this is probably the best example you must control the population of these animals they don't have any predators and they evolved around Tigers they come from India so these access deer they were a gift from Hong Kong to King Kamehameha v I saw your history lesson yeah in 1860 I was getting in all into it today I want to make my post about as awesome so they what was the number that they shoot how many did they shoot a week just to just to feed people and control the population dead fifteen hundred but not a week was it no I think it was thirty a day okay yeah they were saying they shoot 30 a day right because they have to go at night yep with and what's night night-vision scopes and shoot doze yeah just to take him out just to take him out that's so many deer when we were there at night we got first of all we got I got super lucky thanks to you you you let me take that deer when white when we landed we went to scout we got out of the car we went and looked around and within five minutes we saw a buck feeding in a doable spot yes my creeped in it was total it was it just gives you a distorted perception of your chances of success though yeah because for the next five days I got nothing until the last day but in 15 minutes I got the first deer but when you get there you realize how switched on these things oh yeah like there's there's nothing like these things now it's you know I've hunted in Africa and antelope there are pretty quick also just like that just because of lions and hyenas and yeah just super jumping twitchy but and these deer are very similar real quick when we were leaving that night when you and me and Adam we're in the truck more leaving and we turned the lights on in the truck and you could see hundreds of deer in front of us yeah who's the craziest like it was like a crowd being let out of a concert or something yeah basketball yeah yeah basketball games over because it is just there coming out of the trees yeah Oh crossing the road into the open field where we'd been hunting and it's just hundreds you can't imagine if you haven't been there you can't imagine if you if you moved there or if you just went there for a few days you'd kind of get it you'd be like okay what do you do about these things mm-hmm well you can't give them birth control I mean they eat grass so like how are you gonna stop them from breeding you're not so what you gonna do you're gonna introduce Tigers to Lanai that would be cool that may be the only way to do it hunters yeah and it's gonna start eating people just hunting and it's it's such a destination for just getting good deer meat you and I was thinking about it too that stretch were those hundreds of deer across the highway you know that I mean it's as straight as can be you can see I mean great visibility but the speed limits 35 I think it's because deer are always jumped out in front of cars there oh yeah for sure people would be dying so it's it seems like why is it 35 this is like you should be 70 but so many deer I think it's also because they're like where you going yeah slow down there's no hurry what a hurry man yeah relax I mean 3,000 people in the island maybe that yeah that's part of it too that Island so relaxed and the people are so friendly that's an awesome awesome place yeah it was I'm any time I go on a hunt I mean I'm thankful for the experience and and for seeing animals but also meeting the people you know Alec Bob the butcher yeah there's just like these people that are ingrained in your in your memory and you know that's it that's such a special part of the trip also yeah the experience is very very unusual because there's really not a place like that that I know of anywhere on the planet that's just a small island with a small population of people and a massive population of the most delicious animals in the world mm-hmm and even though there's so many of them good fucking luck getting one yeah we had like our friend Ben O'Brien he went home empty-handed yeah he was so one of us in a group of very experienced hunters mm-hmm I mean other than me everybody in that group is super super experienced yeah you know and still it's no cakewalk these things are switched on and now dodge arrows like during the matrix I mean it's crazy it's there's no gimmies no I mean it's you can do everything right you can you can think in your head while I travel all the way here I'm I'm here to hunt I need to take me home it doesn't matter those deer there's no gimmies they're trying to stay alive and they know what's up they get hunted I don't know if it's everyday because when they're when their antlers fall off you know the Bucks probably are hunted but because they're killing doe is at night they're hunted most days out of the year yeah so they are as wired as it can be I mean because they're they're used to being pursued yeah it's different than say like white-tailed deer like white-tailed deer seemed to kind of know when hunting season comes around yeah like when they're velvet drops off and they rub their velvet off and then the the females start coming into season that's when they get fucking sketchy and nervous because they know that guns are gonna be going off yeah arrows are gonna be flying their way right but you catch them during the summer they're just kind of chilling yeah these things are never chillin or in the winter after season right they're just they're more focused on food yeah I'm putting on some weight to make it through the winter so other than hunting season they are more chill but these things I don't think they ever get a day off they don't get a day off and they can't give him a day off because if they just if everybody said hey man let's just need these animals alone man if they did they would all die either of starvation or they would like they had to eradicate the goat population on the island because people brought goats there and the goats literally had decimated the vegetation to the point where the island started going into a drought I don't understand this but somehow or another if you eat all of the vegetation the the rain stops falling in certain areas or there's a lack of participation or condensation doesn't gather because there's no no leaves to catch capture it or one of the ladies who lives there was explaining it to me why they had to kill all the goats no I said she was like trees were dying everything was dying and they're in the process right now of in Maui they have this gigantic area that they are trying to eradicate deer from and they want to fence it in to let the forest regrow because the forest doesn't have a chance to regrow with again same animal access deer because they just eat all the little baby trees yeah as the little trees are coming up they just chew those fuckers up and that's what they shoot sand they want the new browse yeah yeah new growth yeah well it's uh I mean as far as our trip goes and that was another thing I wanted to mention too is that you said the group of people Ben was one of them but we had just an awesome group of hunters there are all are friends family and some of the best bow hunters in the world and it was man it was a good time hearing the stories from everybody was yeah then John Dudley made an amazing meal cooked up some meat one night and it sounds good as his cooking access dear is so delicious it's incredible yeah it goes with my theory that the fastest things are the most delicious cuz they're trying to get away because they know they taste good yeah maybe mmm hey might be something to that how good is salmon don't give me the fuck out of here I don't like fish you don't like fish at all I like halibut I like white whitefish hmm interesting yeah yeah Shane Shane Dorian big wave surfer / awesome bow hunter yeah Remy Warren our buddy Adam green tree Sam Sohal Ben O'Brien yeah I don't know wills last name will from Yeti yeah I don't know either I don't know yeah nice okay yeah great guy but I mean what a fucking crew yeah so awesome it was great it was and just I so much respect for guys like those guys who are at the top of their game you know I mean bow hunting I don't think people realize how hard it is No so when I see these guys go out and they're successful with basically a sharp stick you know it's on especially on an animal like that so a lot of these people it's new country like Adam hadn't been there I hadn't I'd never been there when you see guys go out there and do that on a new hunt a new country for new animals it's uh it's impressive well that we really did like look at that that's the goddamn a-team taking me and Kimmy out of the mix and we'll let's be honest here though dude I mean but what I'm saying is like you and Dudley and Adam and Remmy I mean fucking straight assassins and Shane I mean a man and he lives out there but people don't know it cuz Shane is world-renowned as a big wave surfer but he's an awesome bow hunter I mean he's really excellent and does it all the time out there spot and stalk crawling around the bushes yeah I crawled I mean you were there the last day when I my last deer I crawled a quarter of a mile yeah to get to these fuckers yeah they were up on the hill I was watching you guys from an elevated spot up on top of the hill and I was like when you guys were up walking from a mile I could see you easy you know I mean binoculars no problem and then all of a sudden you're gone and so I sit Alec attack so I'm like why are you guys hiding from me because I was like a really glass really glass then that'd be like there's a head okay there's hay okay now I see you guys but it was ya crawling for a long time um let me think how long I would say an hour Oh mom we crawled for an hour an hour yeah to get a quarter mile and it that is a lot of work yeah you know you got a bow so you had a bow in your head I didn't have anything but you're moving that bow with each yeah whatever you crawling step and in it's basically doing a plank for an hour yeah I was I was winded by the time we got to where the deer were and now it's like take a deep breath take a deep breath so we got within 55 yards and I'm like we're good right here this is a good spot we're behind a bush but it like my shoulders were sore it was like I was doing push-ups yeah cuz like you're you're crawling like a cat so you're doing you're trying to be super quiet see if you saw us do it people that are listening you're crawling but you're not just kind of crawling along now you're crawling as quietly as you can yeah and give me a deep respect for camouflage too like I was wearing a camouflage facemask and a hat and I had a camouflage backpack by the final day I had gloves on I was fucking fully camo we I took the shoes off we were crawling a lot of it was in wool socks just so you could be even more quiet yeah yeah there's there's no you can't take too great of measures on being more stealthy or quiet on these animals yeah and immediately I put up the post and I saw one negative comment I'm like I'm and I'm reading this shit one of the things that happened while I was there was my phone fucked up I dropped my phone on the first day and when I dropped my phone in the first day it just went haywire wouldn't work more and so I had to get a new phone so I ordered a new phone and had it shipped to the island and when I was doing that I didn't use anything I didn't use any apps I didn't check my email I didn't check Twitter and I felt better I felt better he went cold turkey I went cold turkey for three days yeah and while I was out there going cold turkey I was like I feel better like this is better like checking all that stuff all the time like do I need to know about the Mueller probe 24/7 do I know I need to I don't what about stormy Daniels do I need to know what the latest stormy Daniels lawsuit is if I was a super billionaire character I'd give stormy Daniels money and go please stop no but everybody I don't I don't want any hear it what are you mad you want money you want money I'm not even saying that he's not guilty that she's you know she's in the wrong I don't think she is but what are you looking for let's can we get this out of the news I don't need to hear this anymore he fucked you I get it yeah well a lot of people fucked a lot of people since that time you know it's irritating what you pay $135,000 like okay so you're gonna just keep it on the DL right we're good 135 yeah get the money now she's talking what kind of deal is that I don't think she has that money anymore I think she spent it oh she needs more money she needs more money yeah and I think she realizes this is an opportunity for you know I don't know how to look at it because of one hand I'm like well I think we should hold the president up to higher standards and you you shouldn't be able to just lie all the time and be the president because how could we trust you if it comes to something serious like war with China or something crazier invading Iran let's just go off the charts and craziness yeah I gotta be able to trust you with everything if I can't trust you that you you don't want to tell everybody that you banged a porn star yeah wouldn't be great if you just had a press conference and ladies and gentlemen who cares yeah who cares yeah I I just good I enjoy sex I'm a heterosexual man in Melania yeah before he was elected or whatever it was it's like I shouldn't have fucked this porn star but I couldn't help myself I'm a pig yeah but I'm doing a good job as a president the economy is up yeah unemployment's down thank you good night support the troops all right hey but what here's the other thing so you say you can't trust him because if you lie about this stuff yeah but okay so you say another president how do you know they're not lying they are lying yeah so I mean I think they've all lied I think look one of the things that you know I had a conversation with a friend of mine about a Hillary Clinton and he's he's a big Hillary Clinton supporter to the point where it's like he like Jamie with the Cavaliers hat on he might as well have a Hillary Clinton hat on he's like a Hillary I'm sure they do I'm with her this guy is a him and his wife are both like super Hillary supporters and I'm like it doesn't bother you at all that she deleted 30,000 emails it doesn't bother you at all right like they told her there's a probe we need to see all your emails just deleted them all that doesn't bother you like that doesn't seem like maybe she's a liar and then when you hear commis account of what happened versus her account of what happened she's clearly not being honest that doesn't bother you and he's like well I think in comparison she doesn't alive as much I'm like what are you talking about like these are lies it doesn't matter in comparison right so my point is I think anybody who gets that level of that business yeah is slimy in one way or another everyone slimy maybe but we would like you to not be yeah it'd be great we'd like everybody did not be yeah he I don't know I think the only way to get to the bottom of it is get him on the podcast I would love to get him on the podcast I'd love to get him drunk yes so does that that's oh that's what I was one so you know most people have podcasts that aren't the most the Joe Rogan but that's almost true right now most people do have podcasts no I know okay I love you so most people that do they'd be like they got this get this dream guest list you know the wish list these are like I'd love to have these people I'm not thinking about you it's like it seems like and I don't know I'm not you but like the court need to Walter the people you're interested in are more important to you than say like the the eilat the like the president United States I mean yeah so what how do you do you have a wish list of guests I don't have a wish list no no no we were talking about this on the plane ride I don't I like talking to my friends yeah I like talking to you yeah I like talking to interesting people like the sleep expert I had on the other day Matthew Walker I don't like him or Pete sleeps three hours a night so I didn't like that so I'm gonna ignore him but you said that that guy you Monday we have Michael Chandler I'm looking for that like I like talking to interesting people yeah they don't have to be famous to me at all right also my favorite podcasts are people that aren't famous at all yeah just like people that are interesting I mean that's obviously a pretty blanket state right but I like people that are doing things that are unique people that are that are like masters at a craft and people that are working hard people that inspire me I like to be inspired you know I like I like talking to people who are curious and who've studied things you know whether it's Sean Carroll or Neil deGrasse Tyson or so people that understand things that I don't understand so I could pick their brain and ask some questions about stuff that to me is interesting but Trump haven't sitting down with Trump Adobe to me like a lot like sitting down with my friend Alex Jones like it's be like okay I would be like okay if you talk to him for three hours yeah what kind of crazy stuff would come out it'd be awesome I really think that if he wasn't president I would like him I would really I would like him I would say I would think he's a character if I didn't have business to do with him where I was worried about like you know getting screwed over and some sort of a deal or something like that yeah I would like him I think he's a wild man he's a character yeah he's a fucking seven year old dude with crazy fucking hair he wears a red bat baseball hat everywhere that says make America great again on that's awesome you can't even wear that hat in the bars could you imagine that he is so divisive like he's so that people are so conflicted one side of the other against him that if you wear that hat they will kick you out of places yeah what world do we live in yeah well you can't wear something that says make America great again yeah how could that be considered anything but positive house I don't write in but he's people hate him so much what and that's so that's to me even a great accomplishment from what he's done is like he's got so much hate and he still look at all the positives that happen well most people don't think any positives that happen because if most people in my most people know I think there has been well I think most people live in an echo chamber yeah and if you're like my friend who's a giant Hillary Clinton supporter that all you hear is trying the devil yeah and you know he was like completely convinced that it was going down and Trump's gonna be kicked out of office in the first 60 days and he's like trust me it's not gonna last a year I'm like it's not gonna last a year yeah a year later he's crying he's fucking pulling his hair out it's going crazy yeah you know like murder Keith Olbermann ya know he retired that show he's led yeah I don't need to do this anymore it's just a matter of days there's fuckin six months ago yeah I think when did he when did he quit the resistance I don't know it was it wasn't soon enough I think he just had to fucking take a break I think he was losing his marbles well note that but they're so interested in the negative narrative that they're not they won't even promote anything positive so it's like when he was saying all the Rocket Man stuff is like Oh Trump's gonna cause a nuclear war okay now he's talking and now they're in negotiations with North Korea in South North and South are are talking and he's like Trump had nothing to do with it it's like well how could he almost our nuclear war and then have nothing to do with what's going on it's like it can't be both right well I guess it probably could if they would like listen let's not start a nuclear world how about what you and I talked yeah like North and South Korea giggles let's get together and figure this out that's crazy asshole on the other side of the Canadian side of the world rather okay so he's he deserves credit for that some some have respect he's very he's a very interesting guy in the fact that his methods are so outrageous in outside the norm and I don't think these world leaders know what the fuck to do yeah when he gets calling him Rocket Man yeah I know you know and then fighting my buttons bigger than yours what yeah he says crazy shit he says crazy shit and but that's what he's always done yeah that so it's he's consistent we just expect him to do something different because he's the president right you know yeah now you're working we were talking about this on the plane too that you're working with what is your your position in the administration because you actually have a wildlife conservation position yeah in the government right you have a fucking think that was gonna happen no how long now I didn't how did this even come up oh god I don't know I'm on the International Wildlife Conservation Council whoa yeah I that's legit it's a hell of AI got a business not on business card but if I did you get a belt buckle for that I should I thinking about the belt buckle so I bet I was like I was like you say you said you wanted a belt buckle and I'm like oh maybe I'll give him my belt buckle that I wore on the hunt but then I'm thinking so I so I gave you the belt buckle but then I'm like shit maybe he wants a new belt but alone in the box with this sweet custom box no no no I didn't want to be disrespectful and try to say here's a huge belt you know the will use one has blood on it yeah it does perfect yeah yeah okay I just want to fit I want to make sure you're good with that because I wasn't I just want I want you to want or get what you want basically so international Conservation Council so I I don't know how it started cuz I'm like man there are some powerful people on there Safari Club International people super successful businesspeople and in a political campaign type contributors and then you know we go to this meeting there's 16 of us on that dress like this and just like this cowboy boots for sure just like this dude this and everybody else were Sousou dies and I'm like do they give you grief for dressing like that but not to my face but maybe later fucking Oregon deal ability that's probably and so yeah I don't know I don't know why I'm on there I don't who contacted you second or the Interior Department so like you're in the middle of a run running up Mount Pisgah yeah no I got a call Washington DC so my fuck up swear to God this can't be good because it was after okay so Trump put out the tweet and he said something like he doesn't see how hunting for elephants is conservation or or helps wildlife it's a it's a horror show doesn't you know elephants or any other animal something like that and I was like what in the hell is that what are we talking about no elephants talk about elephants that's fine whatever but he said or any other animal yeah so I took that tweet I posted it and addressed it and I don't know if he saw it I don't really know but soon after that I got a call for this thing and so because I was you know I know just from mountain in Africa and how it works and the hunting is necessary over there if the animals are going to survive if if that's a complicated story yeah a complicated situation but people people don't want to hear that now and so here's an example of in Tanzania there was a the largest hunting concession and I'm trying to think how big it was I I can't put the number on how big it was but they'd been in business for 40 years so a hunting concession is is they have you know hunters from usually America go over there they pay for that for the access to the land and they pay for the right to hunt these animals so this place had been in business for 40 years they went out of business because of this import ban Obama put an import ban on the ivory of elephants coming back as trophies but also banned Isis yeah the lion thing was right after Cecil the lion and it was done as a political measure right so he put a ban on you can go over there and hunt him still because you know we're from America we can't say what's legal in Africa but he can say what he did was say we could hunt him whatever because I can't control that but you can't bring him home so nobody's gonna go and spin and 75,000 kill an elephant or 50,000 to kill a lion if they can't bring it home right so that basically shut down hunting and this outfit in Tanzania that business business for 40 years they closed they went out of business about I think it's about two months ago now and what happens is when they don't have a the concession they can't pay for that land it is given back to the people and for us here they'll be like oh that's great you gave the land back to the people no it's not good to give the land back to the people there because that people can't do anything don't have any money they don't just like so what happens is the poachers as soon as the hunting concession moves out poachers move in and kill every animal the only reason the animals that were being protected in that hunting concession was because there was hunting in there these this outfit would spin I think in the last three years they spent over two million dollars on anti-poaching efforts so two million dollars to protect basically their investment which is those animals that were in there yeah they'd kill a couple because because elephants were hunted and they ran the haunts and probably Lions but by and large they're protecting the majority of the herd well give me give me those numbers again because you were giving me the numbers on elephants legally and illegally killed right so so and I asked this back at our first international Wildlife Conservation Council meeting and this you know PETA was there and all these animal rights activists I don't wanna say psychos that could be disrespectful but anyway these extremists were there and so it was kind of heated in some point some cases but I did ask this question how many elephants are killed legally in Africa each year and the number is about four hundred four hundred to kill legally in the entire continent yeah yeah area so big you can get America the United States of America you can also get all European countries you can fit a lot of shit in Africa Africa's huge huge place yeah and so there's some there's some areas where you're not gonna hunt elephants because there's not litter there's not enough of it or they don't live there but there's some areas where there's too many elephants it's just yeah that's what's confusing to people people here elephants are going extinct well yeah they are in some places yeah and then in other places the problem is with local farmers they have these plots of land and the elephants come in and eat everything and destroy their land and they can't do anything about it what are you gonna do this how the pigs an elephant how many thousands a pound ten thousand pounds or some shit I don't even know they're huge huge but they can't do a goddamn thing about air about elephants they the people that they're like the elephant is ruining my crop yeah that's what I need to eat yeah I'm gonna kill the elephants gonna lay there and rot yeah there's these these people are starving yeah and it's there's a food chain going on there and humans here where we are we're so far above the food chain that we're like sitting in a platform looking down watching it there they're embedded in it their ground level they'll in there it's it's the whole it's a whole analogy of you can't have first world people solving third world problems yeah that's you know and it's just we we people here have all the answers it's like you have everything you want you have at you live in excess yeah you're fat you have you throw food away what are you talking about you have no idea what it's like in Africa so they're 400 elephants are killed legally 30,000 are poached a year 30,000 and the reason that's happening is because the hunting had to move out the hunting closed down or hunting is what pays for the anti-poaching efforts but when hunting money isn't there the poachers were in rampant 30,000 elephants that's why they are devastated is such a not hunting it's such a hard thing for people to swallow because what is is from the point of view of someone who loves wildlife I think this is what people want what they want is the humans to leave the animals alone and the animals to live in this state of bliss where they exist perfectly and the balance of nature of predator and prey all plays out in a natural way without people going over there and shooting elephants then sticking their tusks on their wall yeah I mean we've all seen those pictures of these giant fat fucks holding a rifle standing over a lie and you're like this just looks wrong yeah it looks like American gluttony makes its way over to Africa and some guy shoots a line with a rifle now he's standing on its head and he's gonna put it on his wall and it's a fat fucking house somewhere that bothers people I get it I get it too I mean I'm not arguing that well but you got to fix Africa first yeah and you're not trying so this idea that if you just leave all those animals alone and stop hunting them everything's gonna be fine no they're gonna be wiped out you got to people have to look at it pragmatically first and then idealistically because pragmatically you have to understand that these animals 20 years ago were on the verge of extinction so many different antelopes so many different what we'd call game animals animals that people eat we're on the verge of extinction until they started instituting these big hunting concessions and having people come in from Europe and America and hunting in Africa then the community started to prosper because if someone's paying you know I don't know how much is it to shoot like a nilgai or something like that oh maybe fifteen hundred so think of how many of those things get shot and some of that money goes to the ranch some of that money goes to the professional hunting guys anti-poaching conservation efforts and then you have unprecedented numbers there's more of those animals today than there have been in decades yeah and it's all because people put value on them yeah it's all about the animals have to have value and people say no well if the animal has value being alive it's like okay what does to you cause to you if you don't live over there if you're not pouring your choice not starving to death a picture of an of a lion is amazing okay and that animal is beautiful there's a value in it being alive but you got to understand those people need to eat they need to work so if they're not worth working for the hunting concession if the hunting concession goes out of business like the largest one in Tanzania did after 40 years what are they gonna do they can't go get a job at the mill you know what I mean there's no there's nothing there's not industry over there so what happens is as they some of those people and I don't know for a fact but I would I'm gonna make an educated guess that they would go from working as anti poaching officers or or helping keep the animals alive as part of the anti poaching program straight to poaching yeah well that that's happened back and forth both ways right yeah former poachers became anti poaching officers when the opportunity brought itself and they were great ones because they knew how how it worked and they knew where the weaknesses were and that saved animals but it's just like it's it's sad because that you know that last two months without that hunting concession there without the anti poaching program in place I guarantee it's been a slaughter the animals that were being protected are now just being slaughtered by poachers and again the difference between looking at things pragmatically and looking at things idealistically idealistically we would like all those people in Africa to have plenty of food and plenty of opportunity for employment and plenty of things to do with their life but they don't yeah you know and the the situation that had emerged with these hunting concessions is superior to the situation that's in place now yeah and it's also superior for the animals themselves including the Lions in Zimbabwe they had to kill look this up Jamie see if he could because they had to call I think it was something along the lines of 200 lions recently because they had decimated the undulate population because they weren't kept in check alright because the angela plateau the way these the balance of nature works out is you have to have a balance between predator and prey yeah the only way to keep the balance of predator is humans that's it do anything exist unless they keep yeah Zimbabwe wildlife reserve will call 200 lines to control a population explosion claiming hunters have been scared off by the outcry over Cecil the lion yeah the whole thing is so weird because what people just jump on it you know that you watch The Lion King Oh Simba no don't kill Simba and Oh Cecil he's got a name and all this craziness it got to such a weird point where there was this discussion about Cecil's brother that Cecil's brother Gary Jericho look oh my god they killed Jericho and then people were relieved because they found out it was a different lion and it wasn't Cecil's brother Jericho and it's like they're watching a goddamn reality show it's like Keeping Up with the Kardashians now in Africa what do you give a shit what the fucking name of the African lion is yeah you're crazy yeah it's not Jericho oh it's it's it's Michael the lion so it's okay yeah that's crazy still a fucking lion but this shows you this first world view of this wildlife situation that is not ideal by any stretch of the imagination I think part of it like with that the whole cecil lion thing it gave people a purpose as I I have something to stand for I have a purpose now and that's where I know people are struggling out there finding what's my purpose yeah my doing you know and they're spinning their wheels they don't I don't know what they do but that gave them something to fight for yeah and it wasn't right it didn't help anything it hurt those two hundred Lions could have been fifty thousand dollars each to a hunter ten million dollars it went to Zimbabwe stayed there or or at least employed people but no they were killed and there's no game you know it still sucks all across the board it sucks the whole situation sucks these weird - operations where they let Lions loose and then they let them out of the cage and then people show up that day and the Lions don't know what the fuck's going on and they shoot this line and then stand-up that sucks - yeah I don't like that the whole thing is weird it's it's not look wildlife in Africa and the high fence wildlife is not ideal by any stretch of the imagination and these animals that were going extinct and now aren't because people were hunting them it's fucking strange that's a strange balance yeah like that the only reason they exist is so people can come over there and shoot them like we do I don't I don't want that I mean I would like them to just exist well the thing yeah but people aren't gonna contribute that money just to pay for the anti poaching just to go take a picture it's like it's not gonna happen if you go to the Missouri Breaks or something like that and you go hunting mule deer like those that's what I like I like animals that exist because they that they're there this is their spot this is where they are like if you go to the Missouri Breaks and you go up into those those hills and look for four mule deer those fuckers have been there for thousands of years I mean they've found skulls of deer of white-tailed deer in Florida that are 2 million years old right they're the exact same animal 2 million years ago so for millions of years longer than there have been human beings those things have been in that form running around North America and wherever the fuck they can that's what I like I like that too but don't forget that hunting has played a part in keeping those numbers healthy deer and out there's more deer there's no big-game animal north big-game animals in North America now than there were a hundred years ago and that's through hunting and conservation that is true but it's also because 150 years ago people went fucking ham yeah wiped out most of them right it was well real bad one about weimar hunting before refrigeration exactly yeah but we've learned from that we learn ok this is how this is how we need to do it this is how hunting fits in this equation and that's where you know we talked about the International Wildlife Conservation Council that's given me a way in to talk about a bunch of other things too so one of those and we talk about animals in North America is ryan zenki who is the Secretary of Interior he created this new I guess it's a bill I'm not like this political expert I'm a bow hunter right I wear a flannel shirt and baseball hat but he did create this I'm gonna call it a bill but that protects the the winter that we call them wildlife corridor so it's where the animals can go from the summer summer range to the winter range where there's not going to be development there so he created that because that's how those animals like in Montana make it through the winter right if if they're up in the summer they make it through getting in fall and then all of a sudden winter hits they have to have a way down into the low country to where they can their winter migration to where they can survive the snow and where they can make down and there's good feed down there if there's gas rigs or mineral mineral extraction efforts going on that impede that then they might get hung up there and get stuck in the snow and die so he realizes that he realized the need for that he created this this new program that's gonna make sure that there's no development in there it keeps those corridors open and that's that's why our numbers do so well is because there's people like that with the vision on keeping our animals healthy well this is another thing that we talked about on the flight I think is important to bring up when when there was this talk about the state monument or the National Monument Utah and Patagonia put that thing on their page the president stole your land yeah explain what actually happened because it's not what everybody thinks it is and and Rinella said it best if you say the president stole your land you're not being accurate with your words that's not what happened it was Patagonia did an awesome marketing job I mean in that those efforts by saying the president soldier land from what I've heard resulted in a 15 percent increase in business for them so it worked great but what the truth is is a lot of people felt like Obama when he before he left office did an overreach on the National Monument protection and so there's protecting a National Monument and then which is a certain area he protected he wanted it encompass two million acres in that National Monument designation which seems excessive what Zinke says the Secretary of Interior he went in there and he said that's an excessive that's an overreach I want to scale it back to what it was before Obama did that now why is it excessive though this is what gets confusing to people people think that protecting land is never excessive right what he wants to do is make sure people have access and what and it's like okay so what's the difference between the way the way it is under Obama and the way it is under Zinke it'll be Zinke scaled it back to what it was before which that would be a still National Forest still federal land but you'd be able to and I'm not sure if it was wilderness or how the access would be what about what Zinke would say is that like I would be able to go into the land all the time about two million acres because I might be considered by some to be elite you know I can walk for 20 miles not everybody in the United States can walk 20 miles to get somewhere so they want to put road systems there's Road systems already systems already but wants to maintain the roads so but if it was a National Monument right then no road systems like what is the difference that I think the road systems would be gated off and it'd be walking walk you know foot track traffic only instead of access through the roads now why did Obama make it 2 million acres I don't know and close off the roads I'm not sure so it's still federal land so it's not like the government sold the land off now and no mining permits have been issued there's no plans to drill or anything like that no when I when I looked that up because I was unsure about and I talked with Zinke about it just because it's you know I'm learning all this as we go also and I was concerned when when I read the president's told your land I'm like what's this about and so what it is is what he what Zinke wants to do is he wants to just make sure people of not all abilities because it's not like we want roads on every mountain but have access to to national forests so people that can drive in four by fours you know those little off-road on existing roads yeah on existing roads and it's just like national forests now natural force now has roads right right designated wilderness areas because then I talked about that too I'm like whoa okay I understand I understand access I said that's great I want people to be able to enjoy the great outdoors also but I also grew up hunting the ego cap wilderness which is Oregon's largest wilderness area three hundred fifty six thousand acres of no roads and I don't want Rosen there I don't want access in the middle of the heart of that wilderness because it's some of the most pristine beautiful country in the lower 48 I like it like that so we still need to be able to protect those areas but this wasn't in this one this is bears ears and and Utah this wasn't changing anything opening up anything or this big nefarious plan of of mining and stripping everything yeah but his work right right they they were but all I did it went back to what it was before and at that time when I research that there had been no mining permits that from what I understand is there is no mineral there's not in there some minerals in there but not enough to warrant going in there and setting up a full mineral extraction mine so the building reason that they change the distinction is to allow people to have more access to that wilderness through roads that already has a windy wilderness it'd be National Forest okay federal lands yeah so why the uproar then why is everybody so confused is it a lack of communication is it a lack of understanding about what the difference in the distinctions of the two things are it's just creating you know a negative narrative it's saying it's something changed you know Obama had it this way Zinke scaled it back that right there is like why what's going on not really doing the research about he's not he's just putting it back to what it was because he thought that it was a overreach by Obama so it's just you know these these outfits they're in business you know if everything's going good there's really no reason for people to get fired up and contribute money you know some of these some of these it's political in some respects business is political that's very cynical though I see what you're saying but I think that really what's going on is people are very concerned and they see any movement or concern by businesses yeah but even the businesses like Patagonia's businesses about the outdoors as their whole business yeah so they see anything that's a change and the Trump administration especially in the beginning when it came in people were really worried about them in terms of environmental concerns because they had opened up offshore drilling they did a lot of things that people were really freaked out about they had opened up what was the area jaimé in Alaska where they were going to open up drilling that was near salmon runs that people were very very concerned about they were concerned about the idea of money above nature yeah like and then I was me too right and who's making that money you're not making money now I'm not making any of that money so someone else is gonna make money off of what's supposed to be our land and our public land which you and I could maybe go even though you don't like salmon we could go salmon fishing in this land well it could get fucked up by someone else making billions of dollars in oil or natural gas or whatever the right we do if they contaminate that I don't want that no I don't know you don't want that either in the know from Patagonia you don't want that either so when they see something like this come up their red flags go up they want to get people outraged they want to get people activated because they think that there might be a chance that if you protest enough you can stop something like this happening before it does right because if you do look at like what happened in Alaska with that big oil spill in the 80s or what happened with the BP oil spill in the Gulf Coast like that shit's devastating yeah once something like that does happen someone else is profiting making fucking billions of dollars while our our planet that we all share is getting fucked up you're not making a nickel off of it I'm not making a nickel off of it they're making billions of dollars and they're fucking up the land and by the government by Trump or anybody else whoever's opening it up giving them access to drill right do all this thing you open up the possibility of ruining something that's amazing well so there's always going to be a balance though there's you can't just say okay nobody can drive past this point forever you know what I mean there's always so but you're saying that about the eagle cap wilderness you don't want the right drive but there's got to be areas there's got to be areas we have to protect wilderness areas but for example where we've elk hunted in Colorado right big bowls awesome elk hunting there's natural gas wells all over right it's great elk hunting yeah they've got so they're not yeah they're not fucking it up so I'm yeah I don't want things wiped out in a huge mineral extraction mine right where there's used to be beautiful whatever I don't want that beautiful rivers that are polluted right now but you can't just say we're not doing anything anywhere mm-hmm it doesn't work so there can be a balance just like that where we've hunted in Colorado there can be a balance but the real concern that the average person has me included is that someone is going to profit and by doing that we're where it's not gonna benefit you or anybody we know it's gonna fuck it up for everybody else yeah that's the real concern oh for sure I know that's why I've tried to you know that's what I've wanted to be involved like yeah I'm on that council which has nothing to do with public lands in North America but it's given me a way to get in there and try to learn more that's all I'm trying to do you also were involved with when jason Chaffetz had that proposal in Utah to sell off chunks of public land you were one of the people that sat down with him and got his take on it and ultimately because the outcry from people who loved the outdoors hunters and fishermen that was stopped yeah very interesting yeah and Jason he took a lot of shit but he seems like a very reasonable guy I think so too it's um you know he's out of politics now was he doing it he's on Fox News oh he's a correspondent yeah yeah he's so he's completely he's a congressman out of Utah yeah and I went back to DC and talked to talk to him that was HR 622 and that was they wanted to sell just what they determined disposable public land and I'm like okay wait a second who says what's disposable because what's disposable to you might not be to me maybe it's a great hunting area so I didn't really like there wasn't really a way to determine what was disposable right that's what caught my attention and other not just mine but even people like Steve Rinella yeah and a lot of people in a loop and in the know and I got advice from let's see Randy nuber Steve Rinella Joel Webster at the theater Roosevelt constant conservation conservation program all those guys are really experts in the field backcountry hunters and anglers talk to them I did those people were super active right getting people to complain and protest this and so that one I did get a chance to go back there and I did a podcast with Chaffetz and yeah he pulled it it was gone never happened but yes that's I mean we just need to be educated on it and I just don't like the the I don't know without that education jumping jumping in on the bandwagon saying yeah the president stole my land is that even true well you know I always defer to Rinella when it comes to things like this because he's so well-versed it in so and he said that you're not being accurate with your words I have to look into a deeper but I don't really understand it totally until I was talking to you and you were explaining to me the distinction between how it was before Obama was in office Obama changed and then bringing it back to how it was before so it's still federal land yeah no one sold it off no it's not it's just giving people more access to roads but amazing how when something like that happens this is gigantic outcry yeah and everybody freaks out yeah it's uh it's confusing it can be confusing because I'll read two different things and I'll be like yeah what is that that's going I don't know yeah so that's where I you know people say oh well Zinke he was lying to your face I'm like I don't know maybe but on video yet doubt it I I don't he doesn't seem like that guy he he seems like he's a straight shit you know I asked him about he was getting beat up because the national parks Advisory Board wouldn't he wouldn't meet with them that's what it was and so he got said you know Ziqi doesn't care about national parks and he won't meet with the Advisory Board and and so I asked him about that because that was in the news and that was just like man he maybe he doesn't care about public land you know I mean I didn't know what was going on so I wanted to ask him about that I'm like well they resigned in protest because you wouldn't meet with him what was that and he goes well yeah you're right I wouldn't meet with him he goes here's how it went I came in a Secretary of Interior and in charge of I don't know how many different councils just like the International one I'm on and this Park Advisory Board that what we're talking about and there's I think 200 and some that he's he really I think he over I don't even Dov employs billions of dollars and all he asked was for these advisory boards he wanted a report written up that said what have you done in the last two years what are you working on now and what's your goals for the next two years once you provide me with that report then I'll get up to speed on me with you they never did it so he did me with them now is it that said the story was he he wouldn't meet with them and they resigned in protest but the other half of the story was he asked him to do something so he could get up to speed and and be educated on what's going on and he never supplied it well if they are the typical government employees and what is the typical government pooi incompetent lazy I'm a government what do people think of incompetent lazy yeah you know entitled bureaucrats yeah and they've got this job and like I said he's asking them to provide not not just tell them what they've done but tell them what they're going to do and provide like a framework for the future that make that's a lot of work yeah when someone's a lazy fuck yeah half-assing your job yeah showing up and I'm not saying they are yeah I don't know I don't know also they might have resented him for whatever their preconceived notions of who he is coming into this job and they were I don't know if all 12 of them I think there's 12 but but I think they were all Democrat oh those son of a bitches so I mean obviously he's a Republican he's unpaid volunteers also unpaid unpaid volunteers yeah and that's why I'm an unpaid volunteer on that council it's like you don't do this for money you do it to make a difference yeah but if they're gonna be a volunteer even if they're unpaid volunteer and if he asks you to have a plan you should probably have a plan yeah otherwise why are you doing it yes I guarantee you there's someone out there that would have a plan yeah and look especially when it comes to something that's important as national parks in public land things that are like really dear and important people yeah this this is something that you you know you want to have whoever these volunteers are if you're gonna appoint them you want to have the best ones for the job right so asking someone to write a plan up and that's if that's the only reason see it's tough because we don't have their take on it right well I read what they wrote and what not they just said that he wouldn't meet with them and whatever so he wouldn't reap meet with them until they did what he asked they didn't say that he told me that but that's what he said right yeah well that makes sense yeah I mean I'm kind of in his camp that's if we're looking at it 100% accurately yeah no and he told me face-to-face that's what happens so I mean you know you can say well I don't believe anybody I don't believe I don't believe what you just told me I don't believe it at some point you have to be like man seemed like he was telling me the truth and I believe it and that's that makes sense yeah it does make sense that they would not want to do that mm-hmm you know yeah what have you been working on well I'll check my email and going for homework sometimes I look at pine cones yeah so I mean to me he seems like hard-working pretty demanding but he cares I mean he's in there trying to so the Secretary of Interior before the zenki I had no I'm like why don't you know what that is you know so that's what that's what kind of involvement that person had in Hunter in the lives of hunting people like me or fishermen and so when I didn't know who it wasn't come to find out her name was Sally Jewell who was Obama's appointee before Trump appointed Zinke so I like the fact that zing keys at shot show he's had me out there I'm on this council is at least I have a seat at the table to say and I don't know I might get kicked off this council I might never get invited back because I'll ask him so what's going on with this but right now I have a seat at the table so whatever it's it's I I consider that a win at least I can try to find out and learn yeah it's it's it's an interesting thing because everything that I've heard about him that have read in the media unless I'm reading like a hunting website or something like that yeah everything I've heard is like that it's a horror show that he's bringing on all these trophy hunters and there was an article ik waiting you with being a trophy hunter and that this counsel that he's put together is just as disgusting sort of justification for trophy hunting and they're only putting it together so that wealthy people can bring back their elephants that they shoot in Africa yeah yeah I've read that too I mean for me and I'm not I've never killed an elephant I've never killed a lion in every person so even the people on the council that have they do care about animals they care they're volunteers just like on the parks advisory board and they're they want to make a positive difference you know I know every person on that I don't know every person personally but I know they care about the people of Africa and that's why they understand how it works they've been there they've seen it the guys who I've hunted with they're personally awesome people hard-working people I'm the one guy on my last trip there to Tanzania his daughter was in college and he'd been a professional hunter over there for over 20 or 30 years and she was going to college now getting their degree I mean let's explain what a professional hunter over there is not what we think about it over here what we think of over here a professional hunter be a guy who hunts oh that's right he's essentially a guide a guide yeah they call him PHS or professional hunters so I mean because of hunting he's able to send his his daughter to college and I mean and now that's gone yeah I mean I'm not saying every person a lot of a lot of them yeah and they're it's not getting any better because right now so that policy Trump said well we're gonna review it on a case-by-case basis so he didn't say he didn't say okay it's legal now everybody can hunt and and go and bring their trophies back he said we'll review each one on a case by case basis so that still doesn't make it that good for a hunter because they say well I'm not gonna book a hunt if I don't know for a fact I can bring my trophy back yeah so it's not really that much better well what you just saying that freaks people out like trophy like you saying trophy it's an animal it's an animal's life and you're gonna bring it back yeah it's something like that that does that distinction is one of the things that triggers people well trophy so I mean I see heads on your wall right here yeah that's a trophy but also you ate the meat of that elk oh yeah so I mean it's not like you can't be both the trophy and huh for me that I understand that but most people are not blink bringing back lying me no they're not right but it's also not mutually exclusive to be a trophy hunter and eat the meat or on the elephants those none of that meat is going to waste on an elephant that's true that's air ones don't understand their elephants are actually they actually taste good there was a document originally just yeah I haven't had elephant I mean I had I've had crocodile and I haven't had lion over there but I that meat is I mean the villagers that live there man it's they need it yeah there was a documentary on CNN recently called trophy and I remember there's a scene in there where the hunter shot an elephant and it wasn't a big one and the people were making fun of him for shooting it they're like he's this small they wanted a big elephant with lots of meat you know okay so he he got his quote trophy they wanted more meat so it's like you can have both and that that's I'll say trophy hunting because guys aren't going over there for the meat I get it I mean that's not why you go to Africa you're going for the trophy but also that that meat isn't going to waste yeah the meat is going to the villagers it's not like they're gonna let it rot and these people I've seen it I've seen videos of it it's crazy they show up with baskets on their head filled with elephant meat and they're carrying around like 150 pounds of meat on their head yeah I mean it's really nuts when you watch these people just run in and get chunks of this elephant and they need it it's it's really important protein for them yeah the solution is very very complicated Africa is such an enormous place and the poverty is so intense and the options are so limited yeah for these people there is this is not like a simple like ban the trophy hunting and the animals will live peacefully in the forest - tweet tweet bird bird that's not with Abraham dies yeah it's not just that everything over there is really complicated and I always tell people to watch the Loess through documentary he did a thing on this hunting thing in Africa he was over there for long time and when he was over there you got a sense because he's Lois through is a really fascinating British documentary guy yeah and you know he he asked fantastic questions and he's he's really polite and he like kind of pesters them over and over and over again until he gets to the heart of the matter but at the end of the documentary you realize like this is complex this is not as simple as hey these mean people want to go over there and kill animals and treat them as objects the whole place is kind of it's very very confused yeah like it's a it's a mess there's a there's a video right now Jamie could probably find it but so there's I think there's three hunters and they're over there I can't remember if they're they have bows and arrows or Spears but what they do this lion kills an animal for them to get meat they run in there and chase off the line and chase off the lion and steal the meat I seen them cut cut the leg off the Kimber was a wildebeest I can't remember what it was cut the leg off of it and get out of there before the Lions because Lions if you run out of lion sometimes they'll be like whoa that's weird and they'll back off and then before they figured out they'll be like wait a second I can kill you then no but in that in that hesitation time they try to cut off that leg and get out of there so you know when you're here in America making decisions for people like that it's like I got a problem with that yeah yeah you well you said makes a lot of sense that it's a first-world perspective on a third-world problem where people are literally starving to death yeah they're trying to figure out how to get any loot or survive they need protein that protein is like gold back there yeah it's some yeah this is it this is the video and this is on Discovery Channel we can't show it but people are running in it's on human planet if you don't watch it I think it's on Netflix err okay couple places yeah it's pretty intense so lion the lion is basically covered with blood it's crazy I mean they the Lions just don't know what to do they see these people walking at them with looks like weapons and they just take a chance and bolt what a fucking chance that is yeah yeah so those are bows and arrows it looks like these things I know staring at them yeah and they're super intense what's that video it's a title Jamie stealing we're not stealing meat from wine yeah check it out so I mean until I I'm obviously not everybody's can go do this but you need to watch this just to get an idea of how rough it is it's just you know the the measures I'll take to get some protein yeah I mean that whole Cecil the lion thing just created this uproar if you steal to kill and nobody is hurt that's when you can relax Jesus Christ yeah there we go happy he goes with the hind quarter slung over the shoulders yeah and his family and so to me you know hunters in are vilified by a large majority of the population here whereas we've said before 90s ninety-six percent of America eats meat and hunters are the ones out there getting to themselves and like I remember that last buck I killed inland I took care I was like meticulous on taking care of that meat and as I I gutted the animal as I took the bladder out I can't help what happened but like a drop of urine dropped on a tiny little piece of the back ham and I was just like what I was not happy and because that meat is to me it's everything it's everything for the hunt and I was so disappointed in myself but I mean obviously the meats still good but that I I want to be perfect when I'm when I'm taking care of it meanwhile there's people that eat ninety six percent of people eat meat and we throw away what's been it what's been figured forty percent of our food goes in the trash food waste is in say in this country and I think Anthony Bourdain just did a documentary on it right I don't think it's out yet but he did a documentary on food waste so I'm worried about one little tiny piece of meat on an animal I killed and people who throw away 40% of what they buy into the garbage they're judging me yeah well there's a lot of that out there man it's it's real easy to be negative you know that's one thing like like I said about put up my post about lanai I just the saw like a couple negative comments I'm like I'm I'm reading this stuff like go have at it folks wait just walk away how did you how did you know what they said if you didn't read them because I put it up and I saw it immediately afterwards so you read it I read like a half a second of it but my point is that people will be negative yeah cuz it's easy to do because they're douchebags well they don't even look they're not even thinking it through that's like you're fucking just like killing animals people like to just make a statement or get a reaction or push up but yeah our fuck with you yeah they want they want a reaction that's all it is so you can do one of two things you could ignore it you can interact with them and argue with it back and forth you could block the comments yeah all those things are kind of fucked yeah just sucks it's I've got I've been pretty frustrated I've whatever I'm not gonna say I don't read them because obviously I read them but I get frustrated man it's just hunting people just don't understand hunting because even hunters will say I'll say I don't enjoy the kill and I don't enjoy the kill I enjoy getting me that I can feed my family myself you don't enjoy the kill in that it's a flick yeah this is awesome but it is like huh it's a relief it feels good that your hard work paid off it feels good that all the ethical consideration that you put into making a perfect shot is all worked out and the amount of work that's involved in making you know a 70 yard shot seventy yards is a long fucking way to hit an animal perfectly yeah and then have it die in seconds right and then to get that meat there's an enjoyment that comes out of there's a good feeling but it's not like shooting a three-pointer at the buzzer knowing the championships and everybody jump it up in the air it's not it's not fun people say well hunting is killing it's fun it's like no it's not fun is that for me it's not fun at all I I killed two bucks made two perfect shots they went not far or down in seconds and that was a huge relief to me that's not that's why I do what I do every single day and like I said I posted on to be merciful and I don't enjoy when I'm not as perfect as I want to be and I I killed a bull last year in Colorado I was with Johnny Hamilton which you know Johnny and he was back cow calling here this boat comes up the hill he stops at 15 yards and I hit him perfect right behind the shoulder it perfect he ran down stopped at 30 hesitated again I already had another arrow on boom hit him right beside the first first hole and I'm like that bull I was so convinced he was down and I was just like oh man that felt good got to in him perfect through the lungs he's going to be done in seconds he wasn't done in seconds and I have no I don't know what happened it whether it was testosterone because he's coming off the hill he's bugle and he was super fired up so I don't know what was going on but it ended up it wasn't as quick and kill as what I have in my mind what I prepare for what I'm happy accepting and that in Johnny knows I wasn't happy I was just like I was so disappointed live for um I don't know maybe maybe 20 minutes 20 minutes something like that wow that's crazy yeah yeah as I possible I don't know I have no idea so tough that's incredible now I would it really bothered me it it it it upset me I wasn't I was disappointed with myself I was disowned you could have done better right I didn't I don't know I don't think if you made a perfect shot I felt like it was perfect but you know if it's perfect the animals dead in in ten seconds right so I don't know but when I watched it I've killed a lot of bulls I've went through the process a lot I would take those two shots on any animal any time and feel 100% confident he was gonna go 50 yards that was something that I was reasonable and turned about when we filmed that Under Armour hunt in Utah yeah because I was like man this is going to be on video this is you know it's a yeah big animal you know it's it's a it's a big deal I want to make sure that this thing that it's a perfect hit yeah you know and so the feeling of relief that I got when I saw that it was a perfect pass through and that the arrow he was bleeding and put both sides yeah exact spot I wanted to hit yeah and to watch him wobble way like on very unsteady legs walked to about 20 30 yards and then tipped over yeah that's an amazing feeling of relief but it doesn't feel good it doesn't feel good I like no it's not fun now there's a feeling of like accomplishment but also of remorse yeah and they're tied in together yeah it's uh and for the animal like with a bow with a perfect shot you know on these bucks that I killed they didn't know I was there so it was just I know they didn't feel it wasn't like there's a rifle report and bone shattering and they're dying from trauma they're dying from hemorrhage like you're Bowl that in Utah that took off his legs were wobbly because of blood pressure he had a blood pressure loss because of hemorrhage that's not painful you know and so that's that was a perfect scenario that's what we prepare for yeah and that's that's our goal and when it doesn't work like that that bothers me and so when people chime in on your page or or on my page and these uneducated comments trying to trying to tell me how I feel or why I do what I do man that does not make me happy no but I understand it's the ability to comment on things is a very strange thing because the ability to talk to people is very different it's very difficult to have an audience to sit in front of someone that you know pick a person of famous but Morgan Freeman to sit down across run why pick Morgan Freeman it's very hard trauma it's very hard to be in front of him yeah to be able to sit down and talk to someone and to look them in the eyes you would choose your words properly and you would have a conversation but if you just like what's on your face bro like you just what's all those black spots on your face you dumb fuck you just put that on Twitter right and it's easy it's easy and that's so it's a human being communicating with another human being and saying something insulting and it's so incredibly easy to do yes - it's too easy yeah so we don't really understand what we're doing with that and when it comes to hunting there's something about the fact that 90 I think it's 97 percent actually eat meat somewhere in the range and maybe three percent do it themselves three percent like right what do you think it is nationwide if you had a pic nationwide like how many people nationwide kill their own food is it even 5% okay well there's I know because I looked this up because I was curious I how many people I'm reaching on Instagram so there's 13 million licensed hunters 13 million 13 million how many is in there 300 and some how many people are in America I think it's 320 is it 320 somewhere in the range 320 million yeah so what is that under 5% yeah yeah it's not a lot it's a very small amount and how many of them are only eating that how many of them are spending so much time hunting that they can live off of the meat that they kill themselves only now it's once maybe 1% that's why even I saw people like we had a picture of your freezer back here full filled with meat and they're like you know saying you couldn't eat that I thought you you know you're just killing what you need to eat but so that's just somebody principle those people don't what the fuck they're talking about I do eat it I eat all of it and I'll go through that whole freezer in a few months right and I get into a lot of my friend that was the key is that I was gonna say is every guest that comes you ask if they want game meat and they take out that fucking mooch he comes over here constantly second I need more steak yeah well I've seen a lot of my friend have you seen his body he's Nietzsche actor Spock yeah right right yes he's a beast so I I thought he ate steaks like all day every day if you ask him he'll say he does I eat elk yeah quads yeah all everything top to bottom but I mean I've give me to wait a lot of my friends well love it's it's like it's fucking hard to get out meat where you gonna get it well I see a lot of people send me messages that they want to know what this whole elk meat thing is about so they they want to be involved they want to know where can i buy elk because they don't hunt or they want to start hunting but uh yeah one that's what we talked about when we loaded up my deer in your freezer you know to freeze it is that you know hunters our providers it's that's a big it feels good to be able to give pame their food to me it's it's everything yeah it's either to feed my family or to give my friends or not my extended family meat that I've harvested that is that's everything to me that's as good as it gets yeah I had Michael hunter in the podcast recently he's the chef that runs that restaurant antal antler in Toronto and they're getting protested by vegans gave them a bunch of meat and he cooked it and put it up on Instagram yeah and he was like this is so awesome so and it made me feel so good to like look at these delicious meals that this guy prepared who's a professional chef yeah with meat from an animal that I killed I give away a lot of that mean but I eat it every day do you I eat almost every day I eat some sort of game meat yeah if I'm home that's what I eat yeah well no we ate a we ate a bunch in Lanaya no yeah as what are those sticks call oh the wood Bob the butcher makes he cast his jacks yeah he makes like like pepperoni yeah like a pepperoni out of axis deer that's sensational sensational he's a really good butcher - look what he's done with all the cuts and labeled them all and he gives you an envelope that has all of the recipes of how you should cook each individual cut yeah it's awesome man yeah it makes me feel like I never saw any of this when I was a kid I grew up in the city I never I used to fish to eat fish that I caught but I never was involved in hunting at all Intel's in my 40s so when I you know I see comments from people that probably grew up the way I grew up yeah they don't get it they never they're never involved there but yeah they're eating meat and it's just it's because no one's holding them and accountable for what they're saying and because it's easy to say oh you got a little dick you want to kill an animal cut a little sad down it's so common so down though imagine if that's what it meant like if you have a little if you have a little dick you just want to go out and kill there's be a lot of death out there there's a lot of little dicks maybe we should show them just to prove prove earlier along hey let's look at that bear attack the cellphone or a toy bastard we forgot to do that well that was one of the weird things that we were talking about how warning graphic content man mauled by bear while taking a selfie with it go full screaming this please God this stupid fuck so this bear apparently was injured and this dumbass in India decided he was gonna go and take a selfie with it well he's hitting it oh you stupid fuck oh no it's got the guy that's why oh it does yeah they're hitting it because it's got the guy he's already fucking this guy up so that's a bear in India yeah damn bears oh look at it oh Jesus Christ that's not good no that's he's almost free look there guys got shitty Jiu Jitsu what he's gonna do Oh see look at that right there are you free bro you're free oh oh it's tearing his hand apart that it's okay you gotta shout this off at dogs dogs look mark bark bark bark oh man that's yeah it's a shit way to go folks God that looks terrible yeah why is no one have a fucking gun does no one have a knife does no one have a baseball bat you can go and clump that fucking thing on the head nobody's doing anything yeah they're like it's over we've lost him Wow yeah is that the bear or that's the bear is that what it says I don't know why they would show it afterwards yeah just is what Abreu looks like yeah that's just some stupid video of a bear in a zoo yeah bad bad to take pictures of bears it's a real common thing in Yellowstone there real issue with that or people get real close to Baris take selfies with them I've done that before well I think it's different yeah you've done it why while bear hunting yeah but you've only done it with black bears yeah like you've never turned your back on a grizzly but in black bear it still still not same I can say it's smart at all it's definitely not yeah but it's a you know you can read bears bears have personality or attitude just like dogs yeah and so it's a if there's an aggressive bear coming in probably not gonna turn my back and yeah I have one dog that I will let my kids do that Mike my Mastiff my kids could ride that dog they'd do anything that dog is a loving dog he loves everybody yeah you know and then I have another dog that's a Shiba Inu bulldog I don't let anybody fuck with him yeah he's the littlest dog - he's an asshole Oh like if you like try to get him to get up and get out of the house in the morning he'll growl at you like listen motherfucker come on I'll go outside yeah it's not what are you growling bitch wait come on man fag you for 14 years get up go out he's just old and yeah it's he's in pain a lot it's um it's really hard for him to get up but the point is the other dog I'm sure he's old too but he just sees less sweetheart he's got no aggression in him towards people he's just like sweet sweet dog that's just personalities bears are just like that yeah there's some bears that are cunts yeah there's actually there's a petition out there about Banton or I don't know something about me but it says I took a selfie of a bear then killed it which is false the bear took a selfie of I did not kill because it wasn't old enough yeah so just to dispel any rumors well those petitions are fascinating you know I mean people don't want you to kill bears here's the thing people don't they won't don't want animals to die they don't want you to kill animals how do you feel about animals killing animals because if you don't want animals to die one of the best ways to stop that is to kill bears yeah but if you kill bears they get more angry at you for killing bears mountain lions and lions than anything else maybe elephants which don't kill anything total herbivores they kill people elephants do occasionally yeah mostly when people do something stupid like fuck with them something will go out of their way to kill people I think they do yeah I doubt it I change I think they kill people of people just where they they want to go I'm like hey asshole that's killin time how about you get away from the elephant but you know the problem with that is like if you growing crops like we're saying yeah elephant starts eating your crops like get out of here and Elvis oh excuse me yeah stomp yeah yeah that's a wrap kid elephants couldn't be aggressive they can but they're also fucked with constantly and you know there's just something to me I like elephants yeah I think they know everything looks awesome they're cool I'm glad they're real I know they're smart I know they have like tight bonds in their community and you don't have to kill one of those to eat it I mean it's like there's plenty of other animals to eat is just but if all starving to death and I was living in a place that only had elephants for sure I'd kill an elephant yeah I mean if that was all I had to eat our friend Brian Stevens said it tasted delicious he said he ate one in Africa did he and he said it was a is that like one of the most delicious steaks he's ever had in his life and I was like what like how is that possible endangered elephants and tigers kill a human one human today in India as growing population squeezes habitats yeah but this is a crazy situation man India's fucking so overpopulated it is a very very small place what is he doing I'm trying to get over that fence that's tearing apart that car like I was any human deaths since 2014 Wow they kill people a thousand human deaths in four years whilst Tigers have killed 92 people in the same period elephants kill way more whoa that's nuts at the end of that bear selfie thing it said two other people were killed in that state in India and they're both trying to take selfies with elephants dip shits one was a kid there's too many people in India I mean India is grossly overpopulated India I think is smaller than the United States right isn't it like what size is India I don't know I think it's smaller than the contiguous United States but it has a billion people in it yeah slightly more than one-third the size Oh more than one-third sighs okay a billion is a lot yeah that's a lot of fucking people yeah say it triple what we have in the third the size yeah no a third larger oh that's right it says it's slightly more than one third the size of the USS third our size yeah I thought you were seeing a third largest what I thought I was saying too but I just know I reread it and it makes sense okay a third of us but has three times of people that's half the size of Russia oh my god yeah Jesus Christ yeah humanity day is killed that's crazy how do you fix that place you know yeah that's best part of I don't know there's Africa is some places in Africa also they I know that because malaria medicine is good people aren't dying from AIDS there's a lot of people that's how big is India compared the USA look at this India fits right in there my favorite is how big is Africa go - how big is Africa because Africa is hilarious like that USA India China yeah Eastern Europe Germany France Spain Italy Switzerland Netherlands Belgium Portugal and Japan and Great Britain all fit inside of Africa fuck that's big yeah it's big area fuck yeah that is crazy Africa's amazing though man that's crazy when you look at that on a map yeah me like like wow yeah the Congo is as wide as America's just the Congo mmm the true size of Africa man so when out and someone says like elephants are endangered in Africa in some spots some spot some spots they're overrun it's just like yeah Grizzlies are endangered in LA they're really endangered in LA unless you go to these certain bars in Santa Monica Boulevard oh there's four days no I you know I didn't know that was a gay reference tell recently well you've been hanging out with not gay people I guess you don't hang about you just you gotta miss read o read on these you don't have to hang out hang out with them you don't actually go there like I need to know guys bouquet won't take your pants down first sheesh oh yeah hey speaking of I don't know what we're speaking of but how we need to talk about Kanye just so Jamie's got crazy Kanye conspiracy theories slash theories well first so first of all he's like he came out for Trump recently sort of he wore a make America great hat on but he also called Trump a bald thief well instantly - he did yeah yeah well yeah he called him a bald crook or a balding Kanye is a lunatic yeah so I could care less what he says Amy loves Jamie sleeps with a picture of Kanye it's a it's a pendant with a picture with his picture in it James a big fan of two things nuclear weapons and Trump loves nuclear bombs and he loves physics class yeah here's here's here's what I like I well Kanye is a lunatic but I do like Candace Owens who is also new on the scene in my Fox News world you love that I love you love conservatives well and Candace is just like she I would walked in from work the other day and I was like started listening users on course I'm watching I'm like who the hell's this you say Fox News is on of course because Fox News just Blair and propaganda through your house all the time you ever switch it up like have like CNN on the back now Fox News on in the living room I watch it I do watch CNN Alex Jones says 200 1:30 p.m. to watch him for Wars exclusive on Kenya skandhas and Kanye now exclusive I don't it didn't happen area like alive what is he gonna say featuring canvas and Kanye so I love them in together but is he talking about them but everyone thought they were gonna be on this show together for a worse exclusive I probably called them Kanye's Alex Jones I could care less that Kanye says I like what Candice says well Jamie thinks that all this wackiness with Candice Owens and Kanye is really Kanye just getting people hyped up about the release of his new album which will be out in a few ads yeah so he's getting people fired up you think that's what's happening Jamie yeah there's a internet conspiracy it's been like not proven because it can't be proven yet but uh there's a long Twitter thread in a few like reports now blogs or magazines if you will that sort of leads like an Andy Kaufman esque type performance art piece that he's doing there maybe bring up a conversation about some of these topics he's actually talking about or maybe we'll find out when this album comes out if Kanye is doing performance art then what's the point here's a here's a problem there's a certain amount of him that is undeniably insane then you've seen that like that thing that Jimmy Kimmel mocked where he had that little kid he used to do little kids saying things that Kanye said and like he would have well really yeah like he would have little kids say that Kim oh by the way hate him I hate a nice guy no you met it be like I'm I don't know what I would he's like he cries about hunting what did he cry about lions sea salt yeah I don't know why maybe some education he sometimes guys upstairs region they just get real watery yeah that cry when people do really well that I felt like a bitch sometimes I cried when Conor McGregor was talking about the support he gets from Ireland I had a whole back to tears did you being honest I was being honest no interviewing them he started talking about the love I get from these people from Ireland like God that must be amazing bad actually hmm yeah no I get that I get that that's different than Jimmy though crying like drumming up stupid stuff for Cecil the lion yeah the lion thing is weird the lion thing is weird you know there was a great article that was in the New York Times in Zimbabwe we don't cry Lions right happened right after that yeah this guy was talking about his family members that were killed by lions yeah we have a very idealistic view of what a lion is and I'm a big fan of lions I'd love that they're real I love that they exist I love the SC videos of them one of my favorite documentaries of all time is a documentary called relentless enemies and is about these this one pack of lions that got a river changed its path and they got stranded on an island and this one pack of I of lions grew enormous because all they have to hunt is water buffalo so instead of this variety of different game animals all they have to hunt is huge 2,000 pound animals so they grew jacked like Hulk size lines where the female lions are as big as a regular male really it's all fucking amazing protein see if you can find some images from it the way they look is just jacked they're so muscular they're fucking huge like female lions 600 perrolli fucking amazing but the documentary is incredible because these water buffalo are so big and so hard to take out okay they need like oh it's kpop okay yeah so they need like six or seven of them just jump oh yeah and buffalo and rag them to the ground both things are solid muscle - yeah yeah they're they're giant but because of and it's I believe this is over the period I think it's a short amount of time it is yes a short amount of time that these lions have lived on this one island okay they did it a whole documentary about it because all this on this island are hyenas cape buffalo and lions and a few birds and stewardesses so there's nothing else from the knee they don't want to eat hyenas yeah I just want a hyena steak tastes like awful when I wait it tastes like awful this is great man hey you look at a pig look how could that taste good yeah I guess I don't know wild pig is fucking delicious and they look disgusting in Africa they say hyenas are witches witches does seem argument laughing yeah yeah and then that was a that was a whole thing is like and alpha female has a dick remember that yeah it's not cool no it's big so jimmy kimmel also made the small penis reference about hunters what is this Okavango Delta lions from Planet Earth - yeah you can't really tell in that picture see um Google enormous lions relentless enemies as close as I could get yeah I know there's video on it you can get well yes I said some planet or two or everyone does enemies talking I can't show that right right right but this is planet Earth - but the the documentary is just relent just Google relentless enemies documentary wait so this is this area where the the lions are stranded and this one in particular it's not a very large spot but in this one place yeah there it is it's really fucking awesome now see if you get some good images or how big these things are you can't really tell they just watching sex bang go to the second one not that one but go back to the that page they go to the second one relentless enemies lions in Buffalo this is the one so this is so this is the the actual documentary and there's also a pride of lines that are regular size on this island - which is really confusing to biologists like one with the fuck you can't really tell here yeah but see how Jack these females are yeah it's tough to tell here but here they're trying to take out this cape buffalo look at this this is crazy yeah they're all piling on it yeah the females are much much larger than a regular female it's pretty brutal amen evolution it's fascinating show watching things struggle to survive yeah hard out there for a pimp death is never pretty no but being the thing is people would have a really hard time if a person was doing any of the things that Lions - yeah I mean you would think that would be awful but do you have a hard time with lions doing the things that Lions do say no because that's natural yeah okay well do you realize the only reason why people even exist is because people did when lines do yeah the difference is humans have compassion so I mean animals there's no they don't have time for compassion out there you know I mean it's a it's non-existent there what's up I put up this video on my Instagram this zebra had just zebra foal had just been dropped it was just barely standing wobbly legs this lion big male lion walks up to it kills it like it been alive minutes yeah I saw that video that's life that bum yeah but not as much as the one where you had was in a moose calf or an elk calf calf the bear was eating alive and screaming out and its mother is just a few feet away trying to figure out what to do and that grizzly just tearing it apart that sucked but meanwhile that's what they do if you don't control the populations of Grizzlies that happens all the time and then even today right now with just the populations as they exist right now in places like Alberta they estimate that 50% of all moose elk and deer calves are killed or fawns yeah or killed by bears they just there's tearing apart yeah half of them and that's that's what happened up in British Columbia because they did that they did a vote in Vancouver essentially to vote on whether grizzly hunting should be allowed of course people in the city you know just like here don't think there are hardly any Grizzlies left so they said no and so the the new I can't remember what the political party is called but the one in control now said grizzly hunting is no longer socially acceptable yeah and so they can't hunt him and you'll see what's gonna happen with the with the other animals well they're gonna have to hunt him but they're gonna hire people to hunt them what happens in those situations is what happens in California when it comes to mountain lions and they still get hunted but they get hunted yeah a very hush-hush way we hire assassins to go after these lines and kill dogs and cats and you know it's get shit out of joggers and that's what they're gonna have to do to bears the problem with that hunt vote was the way it was explained gritty Bowman did a podcast about it and what they were explaining was that it was a very small percentage of people that even voted on this yeah I mean it was like it's just a few thousand people voted yeah and most people were unaware of the consequences at home that there needs to be a balance of these bears and these animals otherwise the animals are gonna get decimated and the Bears get encroach on human populations and then on top of that these bears like that the there's been this whole business of guiding and outfitting for these bears and the biologists are not talking to the people that are actually in the woods on the ground about that the population numbers if you talk to people like my friend Mike Hawk Ridge right who lives up there he'll tell you there's a lot of bears mm-hmm there's a large population of grizzly bears and it's very difficult to determine what the actual population is if they're not listening to the people that are on the ground every day yeah ya know you gotta you gotta listen to people that are in boots on the ground and when you have a vote on something like this no one's taken into consideration these things like you're just going bears oh by would you kill a bear they're amazing yeah you know I love their I love bears the anthropomorphize a ssin of animals is one of the more dangerous things that people have done with civilization where we've decided that animals are like us they're our friends they have they wear baseball hats and fucking ties god it's just weird yeah it's it's so and we do it from the time kids are little you know you give them a teddy bear and then you know you tell them oh you don't kill real bears do you like real bears are gonna kill you do you understand what a bear is yeah like bear is that thing with that guy in India that's it there it's a monster and it's an awesome monster I'm glad they're real yeah me too but their meat is delicious it is that's the other thing it's like people think that somehow or another you can't eat bears like people get mad at you for killing a bear yeah but they won't get mad at you for killing a pig because pigs are ugly like a wild pig like wild pigs or one of those one animals we're vegans and animal rights activists don't have an answer to right you know they really don't like seeing people shooting amount of Helicon they don't like seeing people hunting them but if you looked at the actual numbers I would love to sit down have someone from PETA or any animal rights activist group sit down with someone who really understands the wild pig infestation problem the the invasive species that doesn't have a natural predator that breeds three to four times a year and can have as many as six to eight piglets in its litter and they're just just fucking like there's no tomorrow yeah and they're having tons of them and they're just destroying billions of dollars in crops every year what do you do about that what are you gonna do tell me what to do animal right people tell they don't think about it because this is not a balanced nuanced objective approach they haven't looked at this whole thing what they've decided is that killing sentient beings is bad speciesism is bad you know that one species is and I do yours a species I'm a speciesist God everybody is when it comes to bugs now in fact everybody is at Subway hey you want some bacon on that yeah it's real some bacon on there but if you don't but that's if you eat it subway bro everybody don't eat it everybody isn't needed subway vegans don't need subway vegans at what 3% yeah what is it the number of vegans what's the percentage 3% weather yeah what's the percentage of vegans that are cunts not almost 700 ah I said 100 but not not Wesley town no I know a lot of cool vegan yeah me too Ian Edwards all right Ian Edwards is one of my best friends yeah it's a big he's a vegan so there's two yeah I know I know a lot of cool vegans but there's a lot of vegans that are just super self-righteous like yes the ones there on that team they're super self-righteous yeah and ask him how much time they have in the woods yeah nah man how much time you have around bears how much time you have yeah got a lot of time in the woods form that opinion do you really understand yeah come across a bear tearing apart a cub or killing a calf elk yeah you know I mean constantly I don't even when I put that up I don't even like to watch it I'm a hunter I've killed a lot of animals I don't like to watch it but we have to show it yeah how do you think they feel about animals killing animals do you think they feel it's okay because it's natural I don't what they think I wonder if it's just a convenient thing that they just look past la la la not listening yeah I think that's probably mostly what it is yeah because if they really did want to like what is more beautiful well that's subjective well more it's what's more beautiful a deer or a bear I don't know but I do know that one doesn't eat the other deers don't eat bears you know so if you like if you yeah if you felt like they were both equally beautiful you'd want to protect the deer from the bear mm-hmm man I don't know I know as a hunter I people always ask me what do you enjoy hunting them out it's whatever I'm hunting I mean I'm I I respect and I'm drawn to all that I like being close to all the animals so it's a it's I don't really I can't have a hard time rating room personally well for me I just like the ones that are delicious and they're all pretty delicious they also that that we hunt yeah a variety of it I just like the fact too that I'm not getting meat from some fucking factory farm yeah the people that are getting meat from the store and from Burger King and they're still shitting on hunters and saying you got a little dick like you're being silly buddy and silly now I know but I'm getting so we've talked about this every single time but the number of people reaching out is growing exponentially daily on who wants to be a hunter who wants to provide for themselves and their family and really sees the draw to that and that is it's the natural way it's it's a everyday concern people have in the real good concern for getting food that hasn't been tainted with antibiotics and hormones yeah getting natural food there's no more natural organic food than an animal that is literally living in the wild until you take it out like they don't even know you're there until that arrow hits of the most perfect life up until that time generally and it's uh it's it's a way it's meant to be really it's you know humans have hunted up until very recently that's for for most of our existence would you like to take Kanye hunting if you took hi I'll take anybody hunting would you take Kanye what would you take them would be better hunting my taken bear just bear is good because you know it's like when we but your first bow hunt was bear just because it's it's pretty controlled there's a lot of bear you can go on some of these hunts and if you went on an access to your hunt for your first hunt you'd quit that's tough yes to it so with bear I think it's a good first hunt and then I can I like you know to explain why we're bear hunting the bear were looking for we're looking for the big old male here's how you identify it I like being right there so if if I took Kanye hunt hunting it would be bear hunting hmm um do you think he would be able to do it I don't know him I mean he's he seems crazy but I don't know it was Kanye out there bear hunting just bought like 300 acres in Wyoming so maybe he did he and Kanye bought 300 acres in Wyoming he's probably gonna build a sneaker Factory out there that's a good-looking country right there that's gorgeous yeah why did he buy 300 acres in Wyoming that's where he's filming are finishing his album right now I think you fill a recorded part of it or we go album again but I mean hey it's all I'm telling it's all to work for Kanye know Jimmy's Jamie's got a side job yeah I mean he's also apparently building I get an interview he talks about I think he's building some houses there's something out there that Wow come to imagine Kim Kardashian wandering around Wyoming oh that's when people are gonna really want to get rid of the bear population because Wyoming's got some fucking Grizzlies and Majid the big grizzly bears take out the Kardashians well I think you know I think people like me that's terrible that would hey thank you thank you my goofy stupid like that scoop but he's in Wyoming think about the album sales go crazy yeah so yeah if you like covered her would be fat in fun horror movie center out there in the woods I think people like Kanye and I don't know about camera but man archery is a discipline people need so I mean they're not some discipline I think archery can be it can be powerful you know I had sent you that quote I think yesterday about there's like a there's things you do in your life where there's before you did them and after you did them and there's a definitive line right there I think archery can be a line like that where everything was before and now everything after and it's that powerful well I think difficult things are important for people to do you know I mean I think challenges are extremely important if you don't have a challenge you know like the human mind you know we were talking about idle time being the devil's playground yeah right if the human mind needs challenges you need something that's stimulating and intriguing to you and bow hunting is insanely difficult archery forget about bow hunting you just want to eat vegetables all day archery is insanely difficult it's and it's something that requires concentration on all these different levels like mental concentration you have to focus on your posture and your form and make sure that everything's right yeah timing the release of this shot is right all that stuff requires so much of your focus and so much thought that it cleans your mind yeah it cleans your mind of all these other things all the bullshit and life stress goes away when that arrow flies through the air hits that bullseye like it feels amazing that's that's one I had a lot of respect for Ryan Zink you and I went back there to DC because I took him a bow back there and there's a huge group of people standing around he's shooting an arrow at a small target in a gymnasium and you know I mean you're puts you're putting yourself out there cuz there's no guarantee you're gonna be very good with the bow well he doesn't have experience with it right no no not especially not with that bow I think he shot one at the Western hunting Expo but I saw him shooting in the air like that the arrow was lined up like you're shooting you know down schools I instead of with a sight that's how they used to do it right like a lot like I saw some old pictures of Ted Nugent he used to shoot a compound bow to release with without a release Oh without well I don't know if he used a release but I know that he didn't have a sight right and he was like looking down the the shaft of the arrow yeah like a guy would do with a recurve bow yeah look well that's not that's that's that's in a good position maybe that that one right there so that that's a little more that's a little more yeah well that's it that's a compliment at sorry curve I think isn't it it's hard to tell because you only looking at the top of the riser but what isn't a recurve work um you know I can't tell can tell but it says uh yeah Ted Nugent is an irresponsible idiot well he's also got the boat canted sideways - yeah yeah that's sort of how you do that yeah see right there well that's uh he he's got no sight on his bow sight yeah yeah looking down the arrow say that's how he used to hunt yeah he used to shoot with the tiny little stabilizer no sight and shoot instinctive yeah and they switched it up a few years back and started shooting with sorry sights but yeah you know but so anyway so Zinke was there put himself out there and yeah if you like hit the floor and it ricocheted off the crowd I mean yeah somebody in the eye right and so i SPECT that you know you take you're taking a chance and I just think that that stuff like that is good for people so you know Kanye included man if you want to shoot a few arrows and kill a bear I'll go he doesn't have time for that man he's revolutionising fashion he I should wear dresses men are gonna wear dresses so because of Kanye that's what Jamie was telling serious yeah and the Connie's gonna start wearing dresses and then other people gonna join in yeah sound flip-flops and the bottom look like mountain boots slide so what is this all true the dresses dress part if you want to have your finger on the pulse of watch it going on today with the kids you gotta talk to young Jamie Vernon yeah that's amazing he's he's my go-to liaison for what the fuck these kids are up to yeah I'm a fifty year old man I'm the fuck's happening it's hard to pay attention to it's hard to pay attention to everything that's for sure yeah I go to young Jamie yeah that's busy I can't I can't keep up with everything well and plus you're off social media now well I'm not off it I post that twice to death about getting the flip phone instead no no I have discipline I'm not like Ari Shaffir you heard me Ari he's got no fucking discipline is that right yeah I mean he talks about it look if he gets his phone in his hand like he's like I can't he goes I'll be late for everything I'll be like 20 minutes late I just I just gotta sit down I can't get off he goes I'm powerless like wow that's crazy I don't get that that's not good but I do know that not thinking about that stuff for three days made me feel better your is like a cleanse yeah I think ultimately there's a there's a tremendous amount of pressure in being in the public eye whether you're in the public eye on social media or public eye doing a podcast or anything like that so for me doing nothing but bow hunting for six days like was a it was a very difficult release yeah in that difficult in a difficult task not difficult like I needed to go back to it quickly difficult in that like bow hunting is hard to do so in doing that thing concentrating on that thing only I wasn't thinking at all about like yeah Twitter or you weren't distracted by stupid sure the news no what I liked that last day it was a I loved let's see so I killed a buck earlier in the day you guys had been on some stocks you came drove down loaded the buck up took it to Bob the butcher and then we're so is I think later in the morning normally when it'd be like okay let's you know go get something to eat we'll regroup and come back in the afternoon but you're like no I want to keep hunting you know you were just so tunnel vision focused on hunting and it was so I was like I was so excited so we were out there and it was getting hot by this time and we were just finding deer passing deer putting together these stocks and it was just like it was seriously one of I found stupid I say the best day of my life but I mean that's a perfect day for me it was fun it was it was you guys went down on that stock you and Alec and I found that that bedded buck by himself the wide buck and it was just like man what a great day it was an awesome day and that's how I would have done it if my family was narrowed I've just been doing it all day yeah I wanted to come back I just brought some snacks and water and stayed out yeah yeah I was one I'm there to do you know it's yes and it's you know like I said it's it's like a cleanse yeah something about the difficulty of it especially when I was doing it by myself there was a time for wire where I was stalking on this buck by myself without Alec without anybody and like this is like it's such a singular focus yeah you're thinking about one thing I'm just checking the wind checking your range trying to close it on I'm putting bushes in between you and him so we can see you have creeped in trying to and and this there's something about that that's so it's so primal it just resonates with your DNA there's something about it where like you get if you get one of those animals and then as you're eating it you're gonna remember that moment forever you're gonna remember yeah so it's a it's not just like getting something from a restaurant or from the grocery store it's getting something you're eating some got a connection you have a massive connection to it yeah and that's I videoed a little bit on that deer I killed that day and I put it on my Instagram story just little clips about where I was where the buck was kind of the strategy taking off my boots and all that and so many people send messages saying that that was fascinating you know I'm like man until up how long does this Instagram store idea no but I saved it on the highlights oh that one you saved Joe's is listed under it says access stock oh that's badass yeah so it's it's people can check it out and it's just like I was reading the comments and see and reading the messages and people saying how fascinating it was and how educational and I'm like on one hand I'm like that's awesome on another hand I'm a you feel bad for them because that's just I've done that so many times and it is it's it's powerful and as it feels like the way it should be but I feel bad for people who haven't experienced that so I feel good for you now that you're in that in that but people sending you messages I'm like I would love to almost be able to share that with them somehow or or I mean that's as good as I can do right now that's one of the hardest things for people's to get in it to get started yeah yeah cuz it's like the learning curve that's what I was gonna ask you is uh you've been bo honey now what was that first boho we went on what year was that two thousand thirteen or fourteen fourteen so four years something like that yeah yeah so four years and it's uh I don't know it's what what what's changed from that first year to this year for you I mean experience for sure yeah having more hunts under my belt understanding how little I really know it's like one of those things there's a there's a great expression I think from Dennis McKenna that once the the bonfire of understanding grows the surface area of ignorance is railed right is that the bigger the bonfire the more you realize like the more you understand the more you realize how much there is to learn right that's one of the things about hunting with each experience especially something like lanai which is so it's so difficult it's like the most difficult I mean at least what I've experienced in my short amount of time doing it the most difficult kind of hunting spot and stalking things that are just fucking wired yeah super pressured the stock is the most difficult the I mean if you if you have to backpack in the mountains yeah that's a different kind the stock of these and getting a bow range of making the shot yeah that's yeah it's almost as hard as it gets on the animals that I've hunted there's some antelope in Africa they're just as quick but backpack hunting is probably the heart rate yeah I mean there's a that's a whole different challenge and a whole different knowledge base that you'd have to delve into but as far as stalking and getting those killed with the bow these axes deer you're right also like I would imagine that backpack hunting in the mountains is also more mentally taxing because you can't just go back to the cabin you can't just go back to the lodge you're out there in a tent and you're 20 miles in and if you break your ankle you're gonna die yeah yeah you're gonna have to tape that thing up and crawl out of there it's a little better now because people have way more access than when I started when I there's this you'd have to get to the top of the mountain to even get barely cell phone service if that was even possible but now you know there's a lot of like phones yeah yeah yeah a lot of people have access at which which is nice yes still it's it's uh it's intimidating for a lot of people yeah the barrier for entry is very high yeah it's very hard to get started and I'm just really lucky that I got started because of a podcast that I got to meet Rinella and got into hunting and then got to meet you and then got into archery and bow hunting and all that stuff and but it's for someone on the outside that's looking in it's extremely difficult no but here's what you do you go to a archery Pro Shop most people have those I know there's one down here in San Diego performance archery I met Scott Eastwood at one in Riverside and I think it's called Riverside archery back home it's the bow rack but there's these pro shops that that's what they do every day so the key with any hunt to any archery hunting you're going to do shooting that bow and shooting it consistently getting those reps in and that's where you know you you can't control the experience you get you know it that kind of comes slowly but like what you've taken control of is the repetition and the discipline was shooting an arrow and doing it accurately so once you control that part of it the hunting experience is going to come the stock experience the learning the animals that's going to come but at least when you get that opportunity to be able to make the shot so for what I four new people who are interested get to an archery Pro Shop get set up with the good bow learn how to shoot correctly and do it a lot and then you branch out and set up the hunts it's just so difficult to execute a shot and animal yeah it weighed way different people don't have any idea how much anxiety and how much adrenaline is pumping through your system when you're drawn back on an animal yeah me the consequences are so grave everything is so high-stakes it's just it's and you only get this one shot like here it is especially say if you're on a backcountry hunt you go 20 miles in there's there's a hundred ninety inch mule deer just stand-in there hey feeding you get this one shot yes is your one shot even you haven't seen a deer in six days I can finally see a deer and you draw back and your arms are shaking and you just try and trying to go through your shot process without flinching and fucking panicking and just slamming that trigger like it's fucking door to monsters on the other side of it people want a shortcut and I was the same way I'd been on hunts like that I've been on Nate Simmons filming on a hunt where I was in the ego cap wilderness and I don't I'm trying to or I'm trying to think if yeah we didn't see God I want to say we didn't see an elk for something like six days I killed a buck on day seven I think and a bull on day eight but there was a long time in there where is like what are we doing yeah so it's really easy when you finally do get that opportunity to want to shortcut from seeing it to holding the antlers in your hands and being successful right and that's where people rush it they get back and they just want to get that arrow on its way anxiety because the sooner an arrow can be going towards that animal to feel like the closer they are to holding that animal to making a good shot but man you still have to go if you you can't skip a step anxiety's a crazy thing man yeah it's a crazy thing it's like that adrenaline and that the the feeling of discomfort this is like this like uncertainty feeling yeah it's just very hard for people to handle but that's with the case of anything where you have to perform anything where it's difficult to do where you just like oh my god is it happening it's happening right now yeah the rain is so it's wired with all these different chemicals that are excreted when that when that moments happening when when there's a this final event this is it here it is oh my god ready action that's where I think all the reps you've put in paid off because on that first buck so it was 15 minutes into the hunt it was even Alec who's been doing that for 30 years has never had a hunt that played out that quickly that perfectly but I think he told me I'm always I'm always trying to get into the to the heads of other hunters and and just want to know what the thought process is but I think you told me that when you're in BO range of that buck right out of the gate on early in the hunt didn't you take a few deep breaths and relax did you say that you know yeah and that's a lot of people their tents their tents because there's so much going on they never relaxed and that shot is just not going to be accurate yeah but when you can relax and then just like in your backyard you come you focus you're just as calm as you've done a thousand times and you can pick that spot level that bubble and slowly squeeze that trigger that's when it works yeah that's super hard to do well it was it was happening so fast that before we knew it we kicked our shoes off and we were walking you know just with socks on yeah just creeping through the grass and we got to 45 yards he's like do you want to get closer I'm like this is perfect stop right here yeah there got it yeah and I just went you just took a couple of deep ones yeah and it was feeding and then I'm like okay I know what to do yes did it and when when they'll walk when I heard the impact of the arrows like holy shit there it is yeah yeah that was a perfect execution yeah it's a weird feeling man when it's like did that really happen did that really happen then we're standing over the and then I sent you a picture of it I said boom yeah and that was I say perfect execution not of killing the animal of the shot there's a perfect execution of the shot I'm not saying we're executing animals that's what people don't understand it's hard to do it's not there's so much physical action involved in pulling a bow back and being in perfect position and making sure you're not torquing the bow and leveling the bubble on the site and and pulling with the back muscles and making sure everything's in line and there's no flinching or extra movement and you're concentrating on the exact spot you want that arrow to hit as the thing's releasing all under extreme anxiety and pressure and this thing is that moving is it gonna keep walking what's gonna happen and there's so much about but the feeling when it's over the relief and then knowing that I'm gonna have this organic meat yeah there's the most delicious meat in the world and I'm gonna be cooking and I can't wait to cook it yeah and I haven't cooked any of it but I can't wait I'm gonna cook some tonight yeah well I mean I think it's a it's a powerful experience for almost anybody and it's one I know not everybody can hunt under really listen so this is it's probably ever gonna hunt but those that do will understand you know and it's not always gonna be comfortable it's not always killing animals not people aren't gonna have warm and fuzzy feelings about seeing an animal dead but they are gonna there's something about taking responsibility for the meat that you're eating and that's going to be I don't know if relief is a right word but it's a it's just a connection that I think they're gonna it's gonna make more sense well one thing that confuses people with you is when they find out that you run ultra marathons and you're working out all the time like why is he doing all that stuff like why do that to be my very best when I'm in the mountains when I'm hunting people who I've seen people go what mmm like wait a minute wait wait you work out every day you run twice a day you run ultra marathons but to test yourself so that when you're hunting you could be at your very best yeah yeah that's right I don't think people understand how much it means to me I feel like I owe it to the animal to be at my best I I feel like if the animal suffers longer than then I believe it should that's I don't like dealing with that I don't like the so I feel like out there's a weight of that on my shoulder shoulders where I need to be out my best as a hunter and to do that I put in work I prepare every day and I just want to know that I'm gonna be merciful when it comes time to kill the animal you're also gonna be in shape enough to get to position to get to the animal and have your heart rate drop down announce that stay calm yeah this is why you do so much cardio yeah yep and you know on this hunt I felt all that worked out exactly how it was supposed to quit very quick clean deaths and then you know like in the buck that I killed just a couple days ago that second buck I was able to you know there's something about putting a dead animal on your shoulders I'm packing it out that uh you know it's just part of the process it just feels right yeah but for a lot of people that seem so crazy like we mean you run a marathon a day mm-hm so you could be in shape to go hunting yeah can't you just go hunting you can a lot of people do I'm not I'm not here I'm not here to judge anybody or to tell somebody that they need to do what I do or they're doing it wrong I'm saying that's what people that you know hunting is such a personal journey you know when people say maybe hunting is fun for some people maybe for some people it is fun to kill an animal I don't know for for me it's not and people said oh you could admit it it's fun I'm like it's not fun it's a I know what it means to me what it means to me is I need to be at my very best to be a my very best I need to run a marathon a day I need to work harder than I've ever worked so I'm at the top of my game on the hunt I don't care what you think about that or I don't care about your mindset I'm not talking about you I'm talking about me and that's people have a hard time with that well they have a hard time believing first of all you run a marathon a day even you saying that I'm like imagine if I didn't know this guy I feel like he's full of shit yeah and it's not a fucking me monitor marathon you're supposed to take six months off and do nothing that's true they say yeah it's true you know it's a man you know and it's not all at what time it's what I do is I get up in the morning I'll get six miles done fasted cardio and people then people also like to to say why they don't do it is because well I spend time with my family it's like shut the fuck up I spent time with my family too so anyway I get up while they're still sleep they're sleeping what am I supposed to do just go lay in bed by him wait come on I want to spend time with you yeah yeah up kids yeah so I go before anybody's up the second time I run is at lunch and I got to get out of the office I got a regular nine-to-five job drives me insane because I'm meant to be in the mountains but hey I got a job it's the best job I've ever had I'm I want to do a good job for the company I work for been there 21 years but to be a my best there I need a break at lunch so I say they said what hey do you want to be superintendent of the water department I'm like yeah I'll be superintendent but I'm gonna run every day at lunch and if they would have said no I can't do that I'm like well I'm not gonna be superintendent then but they said okay yeah you can do that I'm like alright I'll come in early I'll stay late we'll make it work so that's my second one I can't spend time with my family at lunch they're not gonna come to my work and sit in a lunch room with me so I go running and how far do you run at lunch at lunch I'll try to get if I if I'm trying to get a marathon done a day I don't go to the mountain I just go flat and I get at least 13 done at lunch so combined 919 yep before you even get home so then the last run of the day on my way home from work I'll go to the mound and I'll get that last seven or eight done you know and that's three three runs a day and that'll be a marathon a day that's a lot of fucking running no it's not well it's not for you because it's fine I don't feel I feel a hundred percent healthy I don't feel banged up I don't feel anything that's the question I always get well how do you people say well how do you recover and how do you where do you have so much muscle at first of all I weigh 170 pounds I'm not I don't have like muscle everywhere so I'm not big but I also eat meat all the time every day you know you talked about the Lions and wherever with the river and they were eating just buffalo and they were jacked you got to have protein so if you can run a marathon a day if you're eating salad you're gonna weigh 140 it's okay if you run a marathon a day and you're eating steak three times a day you're gonna retain some muscle so that's what I do I know what my body needs for calories and I know when I'm at my best it's when I have excess calories to burn so that's what I do I make sure I'm eating non-stop but you're also lifting weights I do how do you have the time to do all this I'm like listening to this schedule I'm like this is ridiculous and then you shoot your bow yeah and then you hang out with your family yeah what and so campaigns the family the family time is about from let's see how I get home at about 6:30 till about and then people everybody will be going to bed at 10:00 so that's Fox News time well in the evenings that's really what you want to get cause he's got damn these liberals we watch The Voice so no American Luke's on the America not our on American Idol Luke Bryan's on there so watch that a little bit sometimes my daughter so I stopped me and my daughter do she loves the voice and uh and such fun it's fun to get into that so that's what I do and I can if I'm just doing the close reps like during the work week it's generally just out of my house just you know 20 yards shooting my bow and that's and it's just and then when I lift on Monday Wednesday Friday I lift right after work and I'll go an outlaw strength and you know sometimes to make the trainer dude hammer it out I'll stake it home at the same time so on those days I'm not gonna get a marathon done a day on those three days do you feel like shit on those days because you didn't get your marathon then no cuz lifting is hard lifting is hard but I in the back I'll be honest I'm not normal I get it but in the back of my mind I'm thinking I kind of suck a little bit because I didn't get a marathon down that is so crazy yeah that that's what are you thinking like when you run an ultra and to say if you run a hundred miles or more when what what kind of demons are going through your head when you're out there running um I don't I don't know if it's I don't know what it is it's uh like the Moab 240 you ran 238 miles in three days mm-hmm what were you thinking while you're at day two and a half what I'm thinking is I'm I'm honoring myself by getting the absolute most out of my I don't think I've I've reached my limit I think I'd I think if you're not getting the most out of your body you're not you're not taking advantage of your life now you're not honoring your life so to me I need to find what my limit is I can't halfway it I can't halfway because I feel like then I'm not man that's not I don't know I I can't live with myself if I if I don't feel like I've I'm given I have given everything that I have the weird thing about running is like as you run more your capacity to run more increases mm-hmm so you realize like oh like the body has more capability than you think because you just have to get it accustomed to this amount of work and then you just do it all the time and then it gets used to it and then it grows it expands and then your threshold and what your expectations are they increase - yeah so in the beginning you were saying that when you first started running like running a 5k it's like holy shit this is harder a 10k is brutal you would never think like man can I do a marathon right now you're fucking doing a marathon every day yeah and this is the same person it's not like you know you I've always first time I started running I ran a fucking ultra marathon you know it's not now no no and that's I mean that's everything that's everybody and everything you work up to it yeah and so that it's no different from me I just feel like I'm finally getting to my potential mmm and I wasted a lot of years not living up to my potential so I when I do the running videos and I'm smiling I'm in a good mood that's genuine because I'm like this is my potential yeah I can't be happy sitting at home watching t I'm gonna do it because I love my family I'm gonna hang out and do that but I can't be I don't feel like that's my potential this this is the thing that I think is very important for people like you and I think a lot of people it's that in achieving goals and in pushing hard there's a release of anxiety that I think overwhelms a lot of people for most of their life most of I know a lot of people that are overwhelmed by anxiety and most of those people that I know that are overwhelmed by anxiety don't push themselves mm-hmm I think there's a connection there yeah I think that physically pushing yourself to your limit all the time whether it's lifting weights or jujitsu or running or whatever you do that's strenuous I think it's a requirement for the human body that we think of as an option I don't think it's an option I don't think so especially not for mental health I think I think it's really critical I think I think really hard exercise is one and I don't care what you do whether you're swimming or whatever you like whatever you enjoy mountain biking but I think really hard exercise is one of the most important requirements for like a happy healthy life I really do I think you know man I could say that maybe I try to justify what I do to try to put logic to it and maybe even what you're saying is is is a little bit of justification I don't know so I don't know if what I do is right or what we should be doing I don't know I just know how I feel when I do it but that doesn't mean I don't have regrets sometimes like even with my kids now that they're older and uh you know I really struggled wondering if the message I'd been sending to my family about averages a failure if you're not giving your best you're not honoring your life basically and then I'm like maybe that's okay for some people maybe not everybody needs to run a marathon a day and and they're fine and they're happy it's like Who am I to say what makes somebody else happy just like I get mad when somebody tells me how I should feel mm-hmm I can't say why they need and so then I was like here's my kids my boys who are great young men strong have all the potential in the world have I some have I said being just a regular guy who has a job when comes home there's something wrong with that and I'm like god did I screw up and it's just like that's really been bother because my son quit a good job as a deputy my oldest and he joined the army because he says he has more to offer this world that's hard is it hard because well it's hard first of all because your son is joining the military and you're like wow my son could go to combat and I could lose him yeah but is it also hard because you feel like your high expectations for yourself might have set a bar for him that maybe doesn't line up with his initial expectations you've made him think that whatever might have made him happy before is not good enough right and then that's what I thought and I you know I was like it was uh it was hard to deal with when he was leaving and I'm like God what did I do right and uh so you know I told him you know I'm sorry if I ever made you feel that that being a regular average person there was something wrong with that and he said you know the example that I've set growing up was that to work hard and achieve you know big goals and and that's and that's what he wants to do and so he he said you know he said that was for him and then my my younger son who's in his third year of college now he I had the same talk with him and I just said I'm you know I'm sorry if if I've done something to make it feel like you know being being average was a failure and he said that he wants to graduate he wants to join the service and maybe try to go to Special Force two for the same reason and so I don't know I don't know they don't act they act completely fine with it and they'd let you know they loved working hard and have big goals to achieve and that part feels good but sometimes I wonder if you know I don't know I just second-guess myself I guess yeah it's hard high expectations and you put on kids it's it's very difficult like you want to say I just want them to be happy yeah I just want them to live their lives on their path and they're right like every kid has their own personality and you know your three kids are all uniquely different in their own way and who's to say I mean who's to say I think all you can do is live by example and and support them and let them make the choices that they decide to make yeah problem is the choices that they've made are you know very stressful and very dangerous yeah you know I mean it might turn out - they might turn out like Tim Kennedy or someone like Andy stuff and be an awesome human being but it's for you as a parent this is this incredibly stressful pressure filled situation where you have to reevaluate how you raise them yeah and and what I always what I told them growing up always was I don't care if you're the best at whatever you're doing but because because not everybody can be the best but I said just give your best just be your best and so that's where ice if they're coasting or whatever I'm like I think you got some more you got some more in you and that's all everyone remember the thing is about people that Coast about stuff if they have like a thought of doing better and they just don't put in the effort they feel like shit yeah you know you they feel like shit for you telling them that but they feel like shit for shit for not doing well yeah yeah especially if they have ambition if the unrealized potential is a very fucking horrible feeling mm-hmm unrealized potential and unrealized expectations are just it's like this feeling that you haven't done enough will keep you up at night yeah it will fuck with your head and that's I just know how I felt not giving all I got and I don't want I didn't want my kids to feel like that so I just like make you're giving your best be your best that's it and but then I then I was like what have I done yeah so it's you know I can only speak for myself you know when I when Tanner was born I was young I don't you know being a parent it's like I feel like I'm better now than I was when I was 24 years old and you know hopefully I'm pretty maybe more I'm different with my daughter she's also a girl so it is just that's different but man it's like there's no blueprint on how to be the perfect parent and now I'm like I hope I did okay yeah there's no blueprint I mean what's the blueprint be be honest give them the best version of your thoughts on life that you can give them spend time with them when you can yeah then what is the what is the blueprint I mean just try to help them figure out their path in life and it's also hard to because you've got a full-time job I mean how much time do you dedicate to them you know how much time can you have yeah I mean it would be be great if I'd be like I'm not gonna work anymore I'm just gonna hang out with the kids all day I mean it's not realistic yeah they can't do it and then also to be the example I felt like I would needed to set for the kids so they'd believe they could achieve whatever they wanted to I had to put in work myself I can't say you can be amazing while I'm half asking stuff when you say that you didn't reach your full potential until like later in life like when do you feel like that was I haven't know but I mean like you realize that you're like really pushing to reach your full potential now I still don't think I have about you're pushing towards it yeah I'm doing more and so I'm when did that change god I don't know maybe maybe when I did my first hundred so this 2009 I felt what what's a curt real sacrifice was and I don't know I you know hard hunts when Roy and I would do super hard hunts I'd felt like I was given all I got backpack hunts yeah in the backcountry yeah 2008 I mean I always did I did heart hunts by myself an ego cap but there's not really a great chance of dying in the ego cap you know it's uh you could but you know that I felt like I was always given all I had on when the hunts that required the most of me and then at that same time so that was 2007-2008 then at the same time I was also ramping up what I did with running and pushing my body 100 miles and things like that because you realized that you needed more endurance I just realized that once I had I had I've been doing what I've been telling my kids not to do I've been coasting you know it still was more than a lot of people are doing but to me it felt like I wasn't living up to my full potential so I'm like you know I want to do more and then that led to Moab and when I meet people and see people that are doing amazing things it's just it shows me what's possible and so that's why I know I can have more to offer that's a fascinating thing that you know you take these steps towards this journey and then you realize as you're making these steps that your capacity for work is increasing so you have to push yourself further to test your body and then you know a marathon seems out of reach but then the marathon becomes a normal thing and then a 50-miler and then 100 miler then 205 mile you know 238 mile or and now you were talking the other day with I guess Candace was considering a 500 mile er yeah yeah she asked and I know that shit's ridiculous I don't know Courtney and I said both said we'd do it and it would just be amazing it would be you know a needle Walt yeah yeah and so that's I mean that's what people that do those type of races live for the next big challenge and you know when you haven't when you can cross the finish line like I did Moab and Courtney did she you know domination had a great race in that race but she you know when you can finish a finish line and you're smiling you're like uh uh a little more look got some more left so so that's why you know the sound of something epic like five hundred non-stop is is so incredible that sounds so insane that you'd run 238 miles would be basically halfway done yeah that's stupid I know but listen when we were a hundred miles in yeah 100 miles is a long way and I told my brother was with me Taylor I go you know it's a different thought when you're not even halfway you've just done a hundred right a hundred is hurts yeah but you're not halfway so it's the same thing it's it's really not that maybe it's just some change of mindset how many days you think you need to run 500 well I need a year can I do that yeah come over here I need ten hours sleep at night I was listening to Matthew Walker dr. Matthew Walker say ten hours oh my god yeah Courtney told me she slept one minute yeah yeah I had I had a one no she she slept 20-some minutes - oh she laid down for 20 minutes and she couldn't sleep yeah and then the one time that she slept she slept for one minute I did that exact Taylor was there and I did the exact same thing for one minute because he was watching the watch and I fell asleep there's a picture and I woke up I was like how long was I sleep he goes a minute oh my Colette's ago and for whatever reason that minute it does something I don't know what does it do but she had I don't have no idea said she woke up and she was angry that they let her sleep so long whoever was right she thought it was longer yeah and he was like no you only stop for a minute yeah oh shit well let's go yeah that's that's one thing I learned in that first 200 I did Richard won that race and that was a mistake I made is I was asking how how long he'd been sleeping that was what you said he'd said quote but you said he'd go fucking Richard because he is like and he said that he says I was a greatest day of my life when Joe rook rogue and said fuck Richard Kessler but uh but he was sleeping short durations like 15 minutes I didn't realize that your body will reset that quick you thought you needed like an hour yeah yeah yeah make sense yeah yeah and plus you know I'm sitting here it's not like it's I'm god it's really hard to be good at ultra marathoner and also be able to want to pack an elk right you know I'm a muscle way what I weigh is not gonna so I kind of throwing myself in the category of Richard and in a Courtney that's like can't my I can't do it at what I do right so I'm trying to be be the best of both worlds and it's just you're gonna give up and both in without being built like Zach bitter who's like one 440s you ran he's one of Randy he was on the podcast last week and he ran us record of a hundred miles in 11 hours and 40 minutes averaging seven minutes and 41 702 no what is it yeah 11 hours and 40 minutes so I think he ran yeah seven minute crazy seconds per mile which is fucking madness that's a mean so fast and he's so impressive and he's a meteor oh it's me oh he's like basically on a carnivore diet he it's like steak constantly he's on a very high fat diet yeah high fat high state high steak and protein diet yeah well it's so yeah I mean to be that to be the optimal endurance athlete ultra endurance athlete in the mounds you need to be lighter yeah I mean I'm just way too much yeah so but to be able to pack out an animal you need to have some weight on yeah I'm doing it to be the best at bow hunting I'm not doing it to be the best runner and I'm not saying I could be I don't have the talent though I'm pretty tough but I mean they're super tough and super talented what is a talent for running what's the talent let right foot left foot right foot it's not you know Sam it's not like there's a talent there you know there's uh its endurance its endurance right yeah I don't know if that's a talent but it's there having great endurance is a thing mm-hmm it's certainly a thing yeah and and managing the body to get the most out of that endurance most most of it is is in Courtney said this too she didn't realize how far she could push in the pain she was in so her first hundred she quit first hundred mile or she dropped out of because she was in pain now is it right and she's like I can't do this and then she quit and she's like wait a second I quit for no reason I quit just because I was in pain so then after that she realized pain is just part of the deal and has it quit since and in a way so she just didn't realize that the pain quotient of those races yeah it's it doesn't feel good just awful doesn't feel good doesn't mean you stop right you're yeah so and that's that's the keys most people can't push that push through that amount of pain it hurts you know it's the worst pain I've ever felt but what hurts the most it depends it's like I've run and my foot starts hurt and I'm like oh my god this is it I probably broke my foot maybe stress fractures and all of a sudden my other knee hurts I'm like oh my okay my my ligament is got tight because I got dehydrated it's rubbing on my bone it's like oh wait no this other right hip hurt it's just like everything hurts different things your feet get beat up you get blisters you're getting dried out so things are just things are different in your body like I got a bone on top of my foot that rubs and if I get dried out that stuff's not sliding well enough so that rubs and it swells up more so it's just like all sorts of things happen yeah people want everything to feel good it comfortable and it does you shouldn't push too hard miles just be comfortable you should just be comfortable yeah so that's the biggest thing as people and you know there's this guy - that's that's been following me I love I love the guy and he's like so he sees it pictures he follows along he's like well I want to do a hundred mile and cuz it sounds amazing right right and signed up to do a hundred when my brother just just did recently it's called badger mountain and uh hadn't done it before I think he came in round Pisgah did about four summits was about sixteen miles or whatever and went out and he's gonna do a hundred mile or after that and started throwing up but like mile thirty threw up like thirteen times and couldn't walk it was dehydrated throwing up and it was a hardest thing to do but he had to drop and that so there's you're getting your body to a place where you can run that far and then so that's part he hasn't been there yet and I think part of that was he wasn't taking in salt there's a lot of a lot of things that go on with pushing your body that hard but he got 50 miles done for for me I thought that was a great success because just people just because they want to run a hundred doesn't mess necessarily mean you're going to there's a lot of things that have to go into preparation and the tactics and and fueling and everything else learning just like Courtney did learning just like he did he got fifty in and now he signed up for Bigfoot so he's gonna do two hundred and five miles he's so he's going from dropping out at fifty to two hundred five miles yep and I think he can do it it's a sickness you guys are all sick in the head guys are all getting sick together I think he can do it but and that's just as part of the process of learning you what what you're capable of right and it's not it doesn't happen like that when you say take salt in like what do you what are you doing they're called s caps so it's just salt pills I thought salt gives you a high blood pressure and it's bad for you yes you're right but when you're sweaty non-stop it doesn't give you a high blood pressure folks that's not bad for you okay so it's a fucking bad study from like the 1970s that people recite salts in a central mineral so when you're when you're doing and how much you take it in take I take salt every hour and how much saw a couple pill a couple of capsules of s caps so it's a couple caps like like if you don't you won't make it really now Wow no so it's just your body just gets to dehydrate and yeah to efficient and what is the water in the salt like how does it what is it what is what's happening when you've taken salt I don't know but you know everybody does it yeah yeah I'm not sure exactly but all I know is like I remember the first time I did western states her only done it once but it was a hundred-mile or in 2010 and I got to mile 55 I think and I was dragging ass she come out of the canyons a super hot in there is you know 90s or 100's in the canyons so he come pop out onto mile 55 and I was hurtin Ana and Shaun Meisner who's been a very good ultra runner for a long time he's like if you takin salt I'm like no I haven't so he gave me some salt right then and it made it took a little while but made the biggest difference that just salt so you had never taken salt before I hadn't I didn't take it that first 55 miles oh wow so then you you just got to get in that community and understand what they do and how they survive and how they feel how many people are doing that like say if you do Bigfoot how many people are entering their race when I did it which was 2 years goes I think 70-some now I think she's over over a hundred in all these races Wow it's a yeah what Candice bird always says is to hunt 200 is the new 100 or one set what what used to be a hundred was out like a long way right it now is 200 200 is the new 100 when did this change ones that shift over huh that like maybe 2016 or I did Bigfoot maybe right in there that's really recent yeah so this whole sport is kind of evolving right into hundreds the to hundreds are and it's evolving based on how far people can that are willing to push themselves are continuing to go past the boundaries yeah so when this 500 does take place when do they think that's gonna happen she hopes to do it next year you gotta quit your job quit your job nothing all day now I love sneaker sponsor yeah I got weijin I'm like I want it under another one I'm gonna be your agent I can go from here okay do it yeah yeah you can't sell yourself I'm gonna sell you know I've uh yeah I'm terrible I'm definitely terrible at business yeah well you can't be good at everything yeah that's a fact it's not possible I the number one thing I hate more than anything is when business screws up my passions so when right I hate the business of hunting it sounds weird because I'm probably sitting here because of the business of hunting but I can't stand it I know what you're saying the business of like the industry involved in hunting gear and goods and all that stuff yeah yeah I love hunting I love the connection with the animals I love doing what I do and I know I have value like I get it I mean I have value because I put my name on stuff and they sell it I hate it hmm that's probably good at it I don't know yeah I think does this two are correlated you know I'm fucking terrible at the business part of comedy mm-hmm you know I mean I just I just want to do it I don't I don't like thinking about the money part yeah I don't that's why I have managers and agents right they take care of everything so that I can just be free and if you're not you I you know you only have certain amount of resources and if you put all your resources into the business side how are you gonna have the concentration to do all the other things you're doing right practice shooting and running dogs time to fuck with your head - you got it I mean this is one of the things that I was thinking of when my phone didn't work for four days or three days whatever it was was that how much time I'm wasting how much energy I'm wasting yeah like you can only interact so much with other people's thoughts and ideas and information and you you have a lot of things already in your head that you're going over and thinking about and managing and the more shit you stuff in there it doesn't make you better at doing those original it dilutes it yes and it also diluted my peace of mind like I think you know did you'd only have certain amount of resources in your life and you have to choose what's important to you and what's not yeah you know and I think it's really easy to get distracted it's real easy to flood your brain with nonsense I think so yeah I'm not I'm not I'm good at a few things so I try to focus on those yeah I'm not in the business part yeah you can take that over for me yeah I'll take it over for you I'm not even good at it but I'm good I'm good at what I'm good at is I know people that I like and what I like about them and what's interesting about them yeah and I like promoting people it's one of the things that I've gotten out of this podcast that is there's a lot of things that have gotten out of this podcast that are really like unexpected and peripheral but one of them is the ability to make my friends famous yeah like this podcast has made Joey Diaz famous and Ari Shaffir famous and Duncan Trussell famous all these people that I think are amazing I got a chance to let other people know about them yeah and that's not the only reason why they became famous they became famous too they're talented but it gave them this unusual platform right and I thought that means a lot to me to help people like that's something that's very very rewarding to me and it's almost all along the same lines of being able to provide as a hunter and provide food like to be a node provide to let people know you got to see this guys guys awesome or even things people that I even I don't even know people like their documentary I see a documentary it's fucking amazing I want to tell people about it I like promoting things okay tell and that without any expectation of something coming back to me in return I like I just liked like people say like oh you know you're doing ads for products on your Instagram never have yeah everything that I've ever put up on Instagram unless it's my own stuff unless it's like my fanny packs or something I sell anything that I've ever put on like people accused me of like working for Vibrams for my finger shoes Makhno like them right I like them I don't want anything from them yeah you know this is I wear them all time this is why I think they're good I think they build your feet up I know my feet are stronger because I run with these things yeah fucking chill like no that's not what I'm doing and it's like that's the one thing of having financial independence that's yeah it's really rewarding is that I don't have to think like that ya know like I've been offered a to do ads on Instagram I'm like I can't because unless I said molest was something are super believed in yeah then I might I might consider doing it but I could never do it with some nonsense like coca-cola or something like that because that's Kinichi what's that again et what skin et I see the girls do it what a skin et that's a thing on Instagram young kids know he's got what's that called again what do you know what's going on he's a little liaison no no no he's a did Duncan say it wherever he kept saying it wouldn't you know it's like popular oh what's the term I I was we talked about at dinner yeah I don't remember doubles Duncan just kept going on about Lil B I know it would be the base game he's also saying like cuz Gucci it's like the kids knew and Mike there's a word zeitgeist yes yes so that's Jamie yeah Jamie's I'm not a zeitgeist B I know about this floating Jamie is online all day and he's just ever since the Eddie Bravo podcast has been blocking people yeah it's always a block and rampage that's that's like most so what is skinny T what is that it's like detox tea it's like a thing that people promote they post a picture I drink my tea every day and it's making detoxing yeah well wasn't nothing you were telling me that Gary Vee was saying that you know you can get a lot of money for your Instagram posts yes I saw like on a Good Morning America thing he did that if you have a hundred thousand followers I believe you can get up to about five thousand dollars per post that's crazy of a million a ramp ramps up way high 20 grand there there was this 40 grand a post yes yes my tune I'm gonna sell out now I'm offering my services to anything that sucks there's this girl and I can't remember who what she was in a movie camp she's sort of cute but kind of unique looking she was getting 65,000 an Instagram post and 20,000 a story post what yeah she said she bought a house for doing wait a minute I need to sell out we do what do i what do I sell out to who do I sell out to anybody everyone Vibrams how much money you got you know I've been promoting for free the only thing I would ever promote is ID it's like the same thing I feel about the stuff that I promote for free yeah it would have to be something that I like believed in yeah but after you like like Hoyt if Hoyt came to me and said we I'm wearing a Hoyt hat you are if you would you put him on our balls and like fuck yeah I shoot him every day they're awesome yeah they they actually put your picture up being you beautiful yeah put it up well no I mean you joke around well you weren't joking about you like helping your friends but I don't know how long the powerful Joe Rogan how long is a powerful Joe Rogan been around this saying yeah you know but but the point is is like now that this is powerful because if I put up hey where'd you hear about or where'd you start following me from or where'd you hear about what I do I don't 80% is Joe Rogan show Joe Rogan experience and so it's been a saint for a long time but it is powerful you know what's really crazy Burt Christ was at the airport and this lady said she was in her 60s walked up she goes powerful Bert Kreischer and he was like what the fuck yeah he texted me he goes dude that was crazy yeah he's like this is like an older lady yeah he said powerful Bert Kreischer all right and he was like whoa he goes that's when it hit me yeah what the fuck I'm reaching like middle-aged ladies yeah it's fast middle-aged ladies if she lives to be 120 yeah hell of a lady no cuz we're middle-aged yeah we're middle-aged if everything goes perfect yeah but with science today I think we're probably not even I think we're probably one-third aged yeah I think it's a hundred percent easy today that someone's gonna live to be 150 I don't think there's any question whatsoever yeah what stem cell treatments and all this other crazy 150 yep yeah I believe that I believe people that are alive today because I think technology and medical science is increasing its viability and its potential so fast and there's so many people working on things all the time that if you do everything right right now I think we're gonna see people that are alive today they're gonna hit 150 I think the people that are born like five years from now ten years so now they're probably hit 200 whew before we go before we go Chicago UFC oh it's gonna be a good one Kolby Covington don't snap me don't slap me well I'm talking shit why is he gonna slap you so I was telling them that John Jones might slap him oh I like Kobe I like what he's doing he's talking a lot of shit I'm just saying be careful who you talk shit to talking shit to John Jones well the baddest motherfuckers everywhere well you you know he's making a lot of money he's being smart Oh Cole reason why Kobe is fighting for the title the reason why Kobe's gonna fight huh fail dos Anjos for the internet interim title is not just because he's beaten good guys cuz he has a beat Demian Maia but it's more importantly that he's got he's gonna put asses in the seats well that's part of the fight business part of the fight business now you got a cell I mean yeah especially now tree and post Conor McGregor write and post Conor McGregor the fucking game has changed yeah red panties night baby everything is different it is and it's just like I see people hate on it on Colby for you know did he deserve the shot at all I know is he wins one fight he's holding the belt yeah I mean if you look at one more fight now he's beaten pull up his record you see his record if you look at who he's beaten in comparison to somebody like there's some people that have been calling him out that can't get a fight with him Mike Amaro whose man wants to fight him and that guy's a beast yeah and then there's some other guys that are really talented but haven't beaten like any high level guys yet okay so he lost to Worley Alvez yeah and then look at the guys he's beaten Bryan Barbarina is a good guy dong-hyun Kim is a tough guy stun gun Kim and Demian Maia that is not really I mean I'm just gonna be honest this is not a resume of someone who you would normally see fighting for the title right now I think he's fighting for the title based not just on his beat beating Demian Maia who's a really tough guy mm-hmm but I think on the fact that he's a controversial very popular character yeah he talks so much shit yeah and because he's talked so much shit about Brazilians and he dominated my Brazil yes I mean it was it was a domination he dominated him and it's a what I thought was a big victory but that was the only big victory over a titled a former title challenger yeah who's like a top level guy who was also 40 years old all right I mean Demian Maia is his best days are behind him just yeah as I say this as a huge Demian Maia fan yeah well I you know I look at it is you can't take too much away from Colby because I think of a lot of great fighter say so if you say Nate Diaz who's been an icon for years one of my favorite of all time he's never fought for a title hmm right ya know so if Colby got there however he got there he wins one more fight he's holding that belt I think about fighters who have come up and maybe they've been you know quieter maybe they haven't sold their fights maybe like as well as Colby has and said they've been grinding it out beating good guys maybe because they've taken that slow road maybe somebody gets lucky in one of these fights and and catches him on the chin and then they're two rungs back and then they got to grind all the way back up that's a lot of damage they're taking where Colby didn't have to I mean he played the game the right way for today and it's paying off yeah it was one loss yeah I mean I think he's 11 and one now but you know but other people would say well look at guys like Anderson Silva didn't talk any shit just fuck people up yeah you and became one of the greatest of all time because of that yeah it's true you know you could you could look at it like do you want to get that shot at the title or do you want to be the greatest that's ever done it like how what is the difference I would rather get the title and then show him the greatest right right they're not mutually exclusive now right no no so I mean if he wins then he'll probably get it a fight with Woodley right oh he will definitely get a fight with Woodley if he wins 100% right so so what if what if that happens and what if Woodley showed a video today I don't even know understand how the fuck he did this but tyron woodley has a video up on instagram with him and Tiki Golson and he's hitting the pads he just had fucking shoulder surgery yeah I mean he had shoulder surgery like watch this I mean he had fucking shoulder surgery like four months ago and he's firing up the pads I don't even know how he did this with shoulder that one that right yes he looks like a freaking beast he is a fucking beast oh he's a legit beast Colby says he's a nerd oh he's talked shit about a prank um he said he would break him but look you God he looks amazing he puts people to sleep it's just insane that that shoulder was operated on amazing I want to say like four months ago yeah I don't even understand it Bethenny makes that's impressive like four months after shoulder surgery is supposed to be like doing like the little pink weights a cheese mousse yeah in Pilates class what are you doing this I don't I don't get it I mean but tyrants very smart and he's very smart with his rehabilitation yeah he's doing PRP and everyone can stem cells everything you can to rejuvenate all that tissue but that's just that's insanely impressive unless unless uh that is an old video that he's fucking banked he's like these bitches I know what I'm gonna do leave him scared yeah I had Wonder Boys furious Wonder Boys furious that Colby's getting that shot yeah it's Wonder Boys like are you fucking kidding me the how am I not fighting for the interim title you know I just he just yeah yeah I'm he just beat Jorge Masvidal you know yeah those two really close fights with Woodley you know I hate me he's he's beaten you know a fucking who's who yeah well it's I get I cuz Colby has worked out with me you know he's from we're from the same town back there and so people like I can't believe you support whatever like Colby Cohen he's a blah blah blah and it's just like he's just doing his job I don't want to be selling like I his game but that's not how he is and real life no he's a great guy he's like his him and his dad came and lifted with us they were their nicest people ever so it's just like it's a smart one guy's smart Werft yeah it worked he did get hit in the head with a boomerang for it though hey you take take a little you know take your stick take your lumps yeah it happens it doesn't happen all I know is he wins one more fight and he's got the UFC belt yeah how amazing is that the interim bail hey it's a belt it is a belt I don't care what it kind of a belt it's a belt Tyron Woodley calls it the booboo belt whatever because he's got an injury and that's the only reason why it's still super shiny it's very shiny it's still gonna be around his waist yep yeah he wins true so I mean it'll be in his fuckin his trophy cabinet exactly fucking belt yeah so I think oh god I'm so pumped it's gonna be yeah have some fun that's gonna be a that card pull up that June UFC card that is a killer card there's some real good fights on that card is that the card with Derrick Lewis and Francis and gah no oh god I don't think so is it I want to say it is I don't think I want to say it is know what's ones that is that Vegas Whitaker Romero oh Jesus make that a little bigger daddy could see what it reverses Romero Romero's body he's a freak of freaks bro the Freak Rafi Overeem vs. Curtis blades CM Punk ooh CM Punk vs. Michael Jackson both guys Hollies fighting both guys are 0 & 1 we early homes fighting Megan Anderson Oh Megan Anderson is a fucking killer bro Megan Anderson this is gonna be our first fight in the UFC she's a legit beast and a challenge at 145 legit is fuck yeah mursaat Beck dick vs. Ricardo Lamas that's fucking awesome whoo we got Orlovsky we got legislation we two versus Bobby green whoo Rashad Evans yeah yeah there's some good fights real good fight oh yeah oh it's gonna be the greatest bet Avitus versus Pettis god damn yeah this is very good yeah very good I really hope not all these fall through like normal well we have only a month and then it'll be Holley Fighting's Romero Robert Whittaker yell over Mero is a fucking banging fight for Chicago yeah damn dos Anjos versus covington no that's the fight that's the fight because dos Anjos at 170 has been a fucking monster is he's one of those guys that was cutting so much weight to make 155 he just couldn't take it anymore yeah I mean it was just beating his body up and then he moves up to 170 and he looks like a fucking killer again he looks like a world beater at 170 and he's been trying to fight Woodley and he just beat the shit out of Robbie Lawler
