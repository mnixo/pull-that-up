a bra you eyes my brother good to see you as always thanks for jumping in this short notice for the folks who don't know I was supposed to have Kevin Lee on today but Kevin and I we fucked up it was partially my fuckup partially his fuckup he'll be on on Wednesday yeah AG but I was in the neighborhood getting pumped my friend getting solids you've been lifting the weights how steady are you left and now I try to get three days a week but shit gets crazy sometimes and I could only get 2 to diff I stopped for just a couple weeks I start at 51 you start getting so weak even on trt everything starts slipping we don't need to be sore is fuck I've been rolling with little people the last few months like what kind of little people o hobbits hahaha I wish shit them up do you think so yeah I think hobbits would be extraordinarily strong but hairy feet you're probably a lot of like some kind of no man I bet their feet are fucking so strong can never foot love it have you seen the size of their heels they have giant heels but I bet their ligaments and shit are different because they're all bare this is weird about the hobbits right there barefoot they got furry ass feet they have giant feet because you know obviously they had to wear those those feet over the shoes but even in the books didn't it didn't it did they said they had big hairy look at those books yeah I'll hold the shit out of it easy toehold right maybe maybe my thinking is if their feet are that hairy they go out Jesus Christ what happened that lady don't do this to me Jamie this is a podcast that a person that's someone's got it was a gout inflammation oh man that's real did you think that was a hobbit picture oh my god Google image got you again isn't that elephant algorithm that's the Russians they're trying to fuck with this show know that is bunions first of all that's a painful thing that happens to your big toe some of its genetic and some of it is putting your toes into pointed shoes for like long periods of time like people who have to go to work like lady's particular they wear like uncomfortable shoes smashed her toes up like that your toes aren't supposed to be like that I've seen this thing on Instagram where they could fix that yeah rubber bands yes well that's real well they have yoga toes there's some shit that you used you can you shove your feet in between these like styrofoam things and stretches them out apparently that's supposed to be good for them Vibram shoes is good like those I've run in those big ensued or something they did get soo propaganda a bunch of pussies really yeah bunch you know I used to learn them - yeah look man they're they're harder to run in no bullshit feel good though I like I like them but once that grip the ground all that shit came out that they were like a frog know what it is I think they had made improper claims if I'm not correct I'm if I'm not correct if I'm correct if my information is correct I think they made improper claims I think that was what the the word was the word was that they had said some shit and that people gotten injured like they said it would keep you from getting injured it's all based on this idea that you're supposed to run barefoot yeah they said Mexican air fuck yeah and then I was like fuck you we got shows but those guys up in the mountains that they're talking about in that book Born to Run I feel like they have some of them made their own shoes with like tires like they cut tires and made their own shoes and they're running like a hundred miles up there something crazy like that like they have insane endurance and they live up in that mountain and they just run around oh speaking of Mexicans one of the main reasons you're here I want to talk to you it's because you're my favorite Mexican and now we have a Mexican American heavyweight champion of the motherfucking world that's crazy how crazy sad that's insane I can't even love Mexico yeah Jesus Christ I didn't know Mexico had a heavyweight boxer oh my god the shit yeah shit he's what America needs right now with all this border wall crisis shit a heavyweight champion that's Mexican yeah come on son and one that's fucking good and one that has a big belly and he knocks out a dude who looks like he's chiseled out of granite I mean no one has ever had a better body than Anthony Joshua you've only had a different body no one's had a better body he's like what is he like six seven or some shit and I Sam my god dude Anthony Josh was the one of the best-built heavyweight boxers evolved endings of the JIT he was a champ and all that Olympic gold medalist the champ knocked out Vladimir Klitschko I mean he's a fucking monster from the UK from the UK okay yeah he was the champ and he was supposed to fight big baby Miller and big baby Miller tested positive for the Mexican supplements ironically enough boom that's Anthony Joshua I mean come on Sanya how tall is he because he's gigantic I've had a 12 pound because Andi Ruiz looked short in that fight success shit yeah but Ruiz is like 6 - he just looked tiny when he's standing next to Joshua Josh was a giant of a man and just fucking jacked what does it say is wait-listed us - 49 to 40 online I wonder if that was for the last fight because I'm sure with a giant dude like that it varies back and forth but um so I was out to dinner and I get a text from Brendan chop Brendan Schaub hit with the spoiler alert he said fuck Joshua got knocked out and I was like no and I go what happened and he goes he got fucked up in the seventh round I am Mexican and he goes I'm sick I go you're sick I go I'm happy as fuck I like I couldn't wait to come home and watch it I love when crazy shit happens this was my favorite thing in fights look at that guy look here no disrespect champ but him jokes about it himself I'm trying to get him in here - Oh that'd be crazy at his body I mean it looks like a regular dude what if he got shredded how much would he weigh why would he wait get shredded no but if he did it might be a middle way right I would feed him on the sneak tip I'd wake him up in the middle of the night with some great Mexican food that dude needs to stay exactly how he is see look he's got muscles under there like look at his stomach he's just got some body fat on them but here's one thing if you do have great cardio one thing that body fat can do is it can protect you somewhat it's like wearing eight sweaters I've joked around about this before and people think I'm bullshitting and I kind of am a little bit because I know most of the impact gets in there but if you were gonna fight a guy and right before you fought him he puts on a vest made out of fat and meat and stitches it up and it sticks out like fucking 10 extra inches you'd be like hey what is all this what are you doing you can't put that on and then if you hit them to the body and you barely reacts you'd be like fuck I can't believe this guy's cheating with this fat vest anything about that shit yeah good cardio and you got some fat around your gut that shit might protect you look at Daniel Cormier yep phaidor look at phaidor you're dealing with these giant dudes giant dudes who can fuck you up with one shot there might actually be an advantage to having a gut and that's not bullshit at all mmm it's not ideal in the lower weight class looking back guts you brought back packs cuts I'm thinking of growing my own chicks only dated dudes with guts that could be the new thing did you see that that gif on Brendon shops page of DJ Khaled is that how you say his name who's a big fellow himself climbing out of a golf cart with a shirt open let me show you that I don't want to read the caption see my problem was sharing this is I want to know who the fuck made this cuz it's really funny I wish I knew the dude to give him credit you know oh it says it there the creator of the the gift can I see it yeah yeah put it up on their forum Jim hold on James James get oh he might be a problem copyright issue somebody might've stole it from somebody else you got to talk in the microphone people yes yes nice fucking someone okay look at this all the big men all the big men headed to brunch with their shirt open today after the interviewees would he's bringing back guts dude that would be a man dude he's super friendly like really nice guy thanked his mom so he told his mom after the fight you know we don't have to suffer anymore we this has changed our lives you know it's beautiful it's prettier than last I mean I was I was crazy into boxing before I saw UFC 2 once I saw UFC 2 I kind of just boxing but I was way into boxing had stacks of Ring Magazine all over my house wouldn't throw them away I was way into it and all we had as Mexicans in the heavyweight division was Alex Garcia mmm yeah he was he broke the top 10 yeah he was up there for a little bit but he just you know that's that's the closest we ever got unless there's been someone else since then this was like 1990 I haven't followed boxing at all well that's why I was big for mexican-americans when Cain Velasquez was the UFC heavyweight champ that was the first ever Mexican heavyweight champ in combat sports Yeah right am I correct yeah it's weird though in MMA people aren't racists in MMA really as much as boxing they're really raised like boxing I'm always going for the Mexican I don't fuck I don't give a fuck you know yeah we talked about this but and I don't care what nationality you are in MMA or I go for the I want well like like if someone's fighting Melvin Manhoef I don't necessarily want Melvin Manhoef to win but I definitely want to see Melvin Manhoef go Melvin Manhoef on somebody you know what I'm saying yeah yeah for sure oh yeah you know watching your eyes watching guys they that are known for their knockout power and I like watching those guys too even if they're fighting in jiu-jitsu guy right I want them to win that was why who was it was it uh ah kion no it wasn't was it Akiyama no it was who was was it Yoshida who beat Melvin Manhoef an arm Barden I think it was yours wasn't Akiyama I think it was Akiyama hmm I think Akiyama I think sexy ama fought him with a Gyan hmm I don't remember who fought Melvin Manhoef in Pride see if it was a Melvin man who versus Akiyama I'm wondering Kay I yeah sexy Yama you could say sexy Yama who killed him sexy ami was it she Avella Michael she developed and he I don't know who named him sexy Yama oh no he wasn't doing he wasn't doing pride right he was in Japan but I don't know if it was dreaming oh no no no yeah well he does one now oh and he was doing he was doing all the shit on access TV you know he was doing a lot of shows of Pat Miletich he's doing a lot of different things but he also does a lot of Muay Thai to Yoshihiro Akiyama you gotten with some heroes hero got about that one oh wow that was the k1 emotion right I think so yeah wow it's crazy how much this sport has changed and just in the time you and I have been watching it yeah Jenna from when you and I met in the 90s when we're doing jujitsu and you were a purple belt yeah I didn't miss shit back then I was on top of every goddamn MMA fight now I'm just like I'm lost there's so many promotions though no it's impossible so many UFC's and it's so it's hard to keep track and I don't have time to keep track everything's streaming I love like what is it oh yes band app like how do i watch this once you get it on though once you figure it out you want you get it it works and once you get in it works it so every street is on ESPN yeah so you can get every your phone and I saw a shill for the company now and I'm not but I'm saying like for me like when I watch fights it's pretty fucking easy once you get it hooked up the problem is people that don't have their TV hooked up to the Internet which is quite a few fucking people then you got to watch it on a laptop that's not ID or your phone that's not ideal I'll do it though but that's the good thing about it is I've done that like I've been out and I couldn't go to see a fight I couldn't watch it balls at home but I have like an hour so where I could sneak away and watch like if one main event yeah and I get to watch it on my phone I'll teach at all day I'll take that all day yeah what about like what's that functioned mirror is that what it is oh yeah yeah where you shoot it up to the TV yeah from your phone that's dope you could do that oh yeah yeah if you have Apple TV if you have Apple TV or if you have Amazon what is that fire stick is that what it is Jamie remember yeah chromecast also chromecast and there's probably a few other ones you could probably do that with too but they have like a USB slot I think you just stick this thing in the USB slot and it a lot is that am I saying that yeah but you don't even need depending on what your bought your TV right built into it now a lot of the chrome things which is interesting right it's like what if a new company comes along and they want to built into that that system how do they you know because when you get your TV does your TV have like the option to get Netflix mine does yeah it's like oh you don't need an Apple TV it's like one of the OP no no no no no on my TV I have a guy set up yeah have an old TV dude it's like I got it like in 2006 or something damn so you got an upgrade yeah yeah hey there's still a flat TVs I don't know like didn't you need it I'm gonna go old school and I'm gonna start riding a bike and getting around the TV when I'm fucked up Davies with a dark in the corner big boxes big old box yeah but stuff on it put stuff on totally it's a shelf dude the first time I got a TV I got like it was a big-ass TV like my first TV that I bought when I first got on television it was like thirty inches or something like that so like look at the size of his fucking TV was giant like from here in here I was like that big and I remember sitting the stupid hunting inch I remember sitting the stupid thing on the floor and I had it had to be so far away from the wall because it was all this extra shit behind it there was like tubes and stuff and bazookas there was like you knows wires and everything and this big box and fans and stuff remember bulbs there was dude B bulbs and they'd have to change the bulbs and it make your TV brighter remember that yeah yeah I don't really know the mechanics behind the TV I just turn them on and then it would break down you kind of there's no cheap nowadays to TVs are crazy cheese crazy we were just talking about that out there how much like a TV that 10 years ago would cost and now it's like the same TVs like a couple hundred bucks yeah 10 years ago was like 10,000 15,000 like hmm I remember when I first moved out I had a little you know everyone starts with their little black and white little boxes you know to me and you put a clothes hanger in for the antenna and the first TV I got was a 19-inch color TV she was like 300 bucks I saved forever for it but man that was my pride and joy mmm yeah man no imagine living in the days before TV when they first invented it it was all radio it was really theater and movie theater existed first right I'm not running that right yeah how much after the movie theater did the television get a message like well here was the TV I think the 50s that's when it came in the TV came in the 50s yeah problems that's not that long ago think about how much dominates people's time yeah the first TV started appearing in homes in the late 20s early 30s oh shit yeah I think color is one that was like the 50s or so no late 20s hold on how many TVs had homes in the 50s only nine percent of American households had TVs in the 50s mmm one that enrich folks Wow imagine just being alive back then when those things started happening and being some some dude who thinks way way ahead and looks at this in those whoa where is this gonna go people in 50 years are gonna look back at this time and go shit remember when people used to actually open their eyes you know we're gonna be like it's some kind of matrix yeah for sure time man would people lived real life come on outside yeah life stupid fucking dummies we're so lucky we could live anywhere you know when VR gets so good that you actually can just live any life you want you know it's inevitable yeah I mean they're they're getting closer and closer to it if you look at what we would have seen if we were personal living in 1920 when they turned on that first TV I mean what was that like those people are probably in awe they probably thought oh now now they can't lie to us on the radio now we got the truth in our living rooms now we got finally we got the truth we get to see what's really going on in the world please burn the 1920s you know what they thought yeah just give me something to look at yeah when you love to go back and talk to someone from the 20s their name fuck you guys do know how boring was like that what are they wrong hopscotch and shit like that in jumprope no after a while that's that just seems like so much fun yeah reading books and shit remember that horses know when people read books I rarely read I get almost 90% of my reading I get done and with audiobooks 90% yeah that's that's way easier yeah it's great to do while running to it like it does two things at the same time it gives me some shit to think about that kind of like propels me while I'm running don't think that I would you worry about getting jacked what do you mean getting cat by a cat oh do you worry about that man yeah definitely I've been hiking more than ever lately and sometimes we're on some trails or I have a rock ready to go I carry a knife it's a good move a carry knife when I run it's a good one yeah it's not likely it's not likely people go my god you're paranoid two people were killed by mountain lions last year and the kid got bit by a mountain lion just a couple days ago Jamie I'm getting over a cold folks from fi sounds naughty but if two people got killed by werewolves would you go out when the moon is full you would like fuck that if two people on the Seattle got killed by werewolves when there's a full moon you're gonna lock your fucking doors am I in Seattle when I go out Seattle where am I in Seattle well the guy who's the werewolf could have gone on a plane went to San Francisco it's totally possible Yeah right or just walk but if you knew there was a real werewolf that was on the full moon was possibly gonna kill somebody sometimes he didn't sometimes the full moon comes and goes and nobody dies cuz everybody's smart they all stay indoors yeah yeah for sure yeah you would stay out but you know the odds would be astronomical just like like jaws like you know if you get dropped in the middle of the ocean you know the who this guy it'll take this guy has a fucking mountain line and that's all what is that that's not a mountain lion that's like a that's a domestic cat then about cat that looks like a mad girl looks like a no that's a domestic cat see those ears it's like a really wild domestic cat what is it called see shit see it's it hisses Adam the guy might be a dick the guy doing that fucking what that cat might be a dick he's trying to get it to hiss I guess they have a good relationship it looks like this where with us - they look like bears holy shit that is a what kind of animals not links isn't the video doesn't say what it is I saw em crazy I saw links in real life once it's crazy looking like a big these big giant fluffy feet I saw him up in Alberta hey weird crazy feet like almost like they're wearing shoes very strange-looking cat like a big ol furry cat in the woods in Canada it's so strange man you look at you like what the fuck are you you ever see it Lynx yes now I'm not too sure what the difference between the Lynx and a cougar that's what I saw I saw I'm one of those motherfuckers I was like what is that no fear bro they're super hairy because they're cats that lit that's what it's like that won't the long legs right there Jamie that's like exactly what I saw and it was in the snow - or it was not in the snow right it was it was in the the forest floor like green - when they the feet are designed so that they can move quickly over snow they almost act as snowshoes like soda wolves like wolves have big-ass feet and they spread out that's what it looked like we were driving down the road and we saw that guy on the side of the road and we're like why is that what the fuck it's so weird to see one in real life if you see it at the zoo you wouldn't even look at it you'd pass by that age if you like what the fuck is another looking Tigers at wack-ass little cat and the crazy polar bears but if you see it in the woods man it's like the greatest thing you've ever seen in your life look at it look at it like a porcupine if I see a porcupine and I'm driving I'll stop my car look at that whoa what do they still do they really shoot no no they don't shoot us you know they don't shoot them no no no no do porcupine they don't shoot them they don't shoot them that's a myth they just have Barb's so if you buy them you get stuck up how crazy is that everyone thought that growing out like yeah in the 80s it's like they shot you with thorns kids fucking five probably tell their dad you shot him at me dad ran a cartoon or something yeah yeah that's possible too right like everybody thinks coyotes are stupid yeah like jaws you know jaws pretty much scared 95% of the population out of the ocean oh yeah out of the ocean well Jack you heard about that guy that just got jacked great right yeah yeah well they don't know what kind of shark got him but got bitten Maui I think Maui that's a lot of tiger sharks right yeah yeah surfer a surfer um no I think it was a guy standing at resort just women mmm died dead is far behind his body they got him I mean they brought him back to the beach but he had horrific wounds he died just happened yeah it just happened yeah man sharks are no joke it's a terrifying animal and again if there was a fucking werewolf running around the woods exactly like and a werewolf just kill the guy last week would you go to the woods yeah I'd be just like jaws they had it on the news no no let go but the thing is that sharks are sharks 24 hours a day seven days a week they don't only on full moons become sharks but what about what about guys that say that that's totally blown out of proportion they're like they swim with sharks they get in there in the ocean with sharks alright alright I think the great white is the only one that the divers those crazy divers don't get in the water with right but I think there was a lady that swam with a great white yeah there's pictures we were looking at her Instagram page once young Jaime to remember that lady yeah is it a trick like she's knows things she knows if it's pregnant you could go swim with it or something you know my god those videos of babies playing with king cobras and then you you find out that they defang them right so they can't hurt you at all they take away their venom sack too or if they have a thing I'm gonna made that up well yeah then I'm sack is that a real thing so nut sack but it's a shark tag Brunswick the shark it's a 8 foot 9 inch white shark that's been just recently spotted today or today I guess in oceans outside of Ocean City Maryland oh yeah yeah this is the way it's Twitter account works there like it speaks in the first person what what if it kills somebody I'm sorry he was tasty I think it's still gonna keep up the Twitter account if we know that shark killed somebody look if it gets hungry enough all these assholes are overfishing the oceans you over fish the fuck out of those oceans financially those sharks they're gonna turn on each other you know that's what's happening with snakes in the Everglades do you know about that mm-hmm - do you know about the Everglades nope anacondas and pythons and shit mostly pythons because dudes have as pets in and they let them go Eddie they're finding them now there's 17 18 feet long anacondas are Python Python 's shit they're eating alligators they did a study they do that oh yeah yeah they're photos of it and this video this video you can watch him eat an alligator in Florida in Florida god yeah they're giant and they're they're infested so they did like a biological survey of the Everglades and they were down like 99% in some animals like deer 99% marsh hair like like 98% 95% raccoons that kind of shit Canarsie there are they anything are they killing people - oh they well they for sure some fucking rednecks have disappeared and they just don't guarantee a guarantee I guarantee that go if you wanted to get rid of somebody man take him to Python country are they population of these snakes how much he can do have you ever seen the Everglade easy to set up traps do you kidding show jit show and probably services with that kind of shit well there's too many of them fifty thousand of what snakes yeah there's over a dozen Python yeah yeah how did they count they have rough estimates based on corn quadrants so like what they'll do is they'll take like and it's not it's not 100% accurate unless they tagged all of them in which the case they're assholes it should just kill them but if cuz they're an invasive species for people don't know they're not from Florida at all so they're just devastating the ecosystem and they're turning on alligators they're eating alligators now because they basically run out of everything else to eat it's it's a crazy fucking animal so what they would do is they would take I would guess like a chunk of the Everglades you know like 100 square yards like that and they'd measure the amount and then they would do another one they would they would do it like several places and then take an average and then calculate all the square footage and that's why they be pro or con you would think like hundreds of people would have been killed already no because I don't think that many people first of all go in there and I don't think they want to eat people I think they probably don't know what the fuck a person is whether they see a rabbit or some other shit that probably looks like food people are wearing clothes I'm just guessing I know they do jack people though overseas there's been horrible videos of guys getting cut out of giant snakes and everything that yeah yeah I've seen that that's crazy yeah some poor villager yeah woman missing they find the snake and they go we found her like I know they do this motherfucker bounty hunter kills gargantuan Burmese python gets 375 bucks and earns our undying gratitude little sizing dude so these things in Florida what like Everglades wherever the ever goes on Miami the Everglades is a giant ass Gulf side middle like the both sides kind of depending it's like a big swamp plan show Eddie an overhead view of the Everglades because the Everglades are fucking bananas one thing that they found that was interesting yeah that shit yeah so that all that stuff is dense dense swamp that's just monster soup the tip of the dick of Florida is monster soup that's what that is you got some leaves you got some basil fucking snakes you got some grass you got some shit growing out of the ground and you got fucking alligators and snakes in a aliens vs. predator battle to the death Howard Howard Joey described Everglades listen cocksucker these fucking dirty white people with this thinking oh you want a fucking snake what are you you're oh I'm a Wiccan get the fuck the guy kicks his fucking kid out of the house the kid can't feed the snake next thing you know monster soup I mean it really is down to these two super predators battling it out to the death and right now I mean I don't see any pictures of the alligators eating the pythons do we have video of alligators in pythons they're eating each other okay so I guess it's good at least everybody's eating everybody Jesus please get a hold dear in its body is this Florida same article Jesus Christ man they can swallow a whole deer that is so nuts they're not even as wide as us imagine not being as wide as a person and you could swallow a whole deer says it foul it had a 35-pound white-tailed fawn in it it was eating 111 percent o 11.1% don't know 111 percent it was a 31 pound snake eating at 35 pound deer oh my god oh my god yeah they don't give a fuck I didn't read that part oh my god that is so ridiculous yeah they can eat their whole body where would you ever see that you've seen that we've showed that video of the Frog or it was a frog rat oh that ate the mouse sure the mouse is bigger than him bro he just fucking eats it he just I didn't know that toads did that I had no idea this video there's like the little white mouse is in this cage just like looking around with this frog and this frog just like slowly comes close to him slowly comes closer and then swap just half his body and you see this mouse trying to kick and get the fuck out of there and the Frog just like slowly just chokes him down I don't know I hate insects that's what I thought too if they figured it out see if people believe in evolution right I believe in evolution if people believe in evolution why do we think it stops with us why don't we think these goddamn frogs gonna take over maybe like one of the first the first signs of it was this Pepe the Frog controversy on the Internet maybe it's shots fired things to come these frogs gonna start eating meat and the Trump frog maybe these frogs are eating meat that's what's going on smarter Pepe the Frog was that around before Channel what is this Jaime oh I've seen this rock as a snake it's about the snakes yeah attacking a cat whoa oh the cat comes over thus why the fucking snake cats are ruthless bro cats are ruthless it's just a compilation of frog shit well there's one that's like super specific that I found on hand to stuff that were look at this one here's one it's oh they're only showing part of it it's just it's a bunch of shit like look how he gets that whole Mouse in his mouth damn this isn't even the same one so there must be multiple videos of I guess that's a toad is that a frog or toad I honestly do not know the difference in that one but I think frogs are like green frogs live in water right and toads hang out in the the grass right I think they when I was in Costa Rica the first night I was I was in I went with a bunch of friends and they had this mansion dude right there in the jump and and the first night I doused my hole but I knew the bugs were gonna come out so I was when we got them like oh my god I'm gonna get attacked by bugs so I I went to the neighborhood storm but all their off and just use it like moose all over my body and we sat we were sitting as the Sun set we were at the pool there was like 10 of us at the pool and as the Sun was setting all these frogs just appeared out of nowhere it was scary and the guy that lived there said trust me don't be scared they're gonna be your friends like what do you mean goes trust me we're gonna need them and go for the bugs he goes yes so on the Sun went down were were we're at a pool in this Jay Z type mansion at a pool in the middle of the jungle and there's all these frogs everywhere and then the bug started coming you never saw the same bug twice and it was like Braveheart dude they were all these frogs you just see them attacking these bugs it was it was uh like a war it was crazy in the bugs lost the bugs lost hogs Jack dude like like like those white walkers do they fuck the mob do wow that's an amazing entertaining it was very entertaining we were just sitting there going holy shit get those bugs fuck those bugs up why doesn't someone make a documentary about that it's crazy the war the daily war in the jungle when the bugs come out fucking frogs eat all bugs and frogs what a weird place to choose to put a mansion when I get you want to be able to scream no I get one thing I learned one thing I learned about that trip is there's the people that like that shit are the the people that will like they'll see a tarantula and pick it up and go and try to scare you with it and then the fucking eat it or whatever like you have to be one of those people like you know people like me who are scared of bugs I I'm not a jungle guy I'm a snow guy I wanted I just went to Lake Tahoe we went to Squaw Valley that's my shit snow too cold for any bugs the jungle if I never go to another jungle ever I wouldn't give a shit I had a horrible time that the last time I was in a dying cow and had a similar story about when he was trying to be a buged scientist what's that called fuck just trying to be entomology and entomologist and he was hanging out in the in the jungle with these people and they had to put turpentine on the posts of the like the platform with the tents at all for the ants yeah cuz the ants would be marching through the jungles he didn't hear them walking you could hear them yeah you could hear the ants there's so many of you get here that's why if you have a choose between cold or unbearable heat I always just cold yeah the thing about cold is it's like you can get warm you know when you're hot you can't really get cool it's hard you can get cool in your house but you could start a fire in your house and you just wear warm clothes outside and you just live smart yeah it's like the challenges of that's interesting when you look at like population in the world because in this country it's not the world but in this country all the places work it's really cold population that's limited like it's only gonna get so big but when things like sweet real nice like special like la ooh people just pile in but I guess New York's the argument against that cuz New York's Phoenix that's opposites like super hot their melts everybody yeah but people like to party down there party if you like to party you go to Phoenix no matter where I live I live in Phoenix open carry state the fucking Sheriff Arpaio makes everybody wear pink underwear and pink jumpsuit shit crazy I think if you look at where people live I think generally speaking white people like cold and and darkest people like the heat it seems that way because if you look at the North Pole with genomically if you look at the North Pole looking down on it all the surrounding countries they're all white right but you know why right because they want to be next to them they want to be close to the North Pole is that why the one we could san is first stop hey there's there's that it's supposedly a magical place the North Pole well it's because they don't get any vitamin D up there because it's hot as fuck where they're from and sunny where they're from originally and then as people migrated and got these northern climates their skin became paler and paler like like a solar panel for vitamin D that's where you get it you get it from the Sun so because they don't get much vitamin D because there's no fucking Sun out it's cold as shit it's cloudy in England and Ireland and all these goes away or really really white it's fucking cloudy all the time at its coldest fuck so you're not getting that vitamin D plus your whole body's covered and fucking minks and animal skins and shit that's why they're all white they're all from the same thing that's what's weird about it but there's also some some growing evidence that there was a whole gang of different kinds of people they're finding these new Russian people called Denisovans they found bones of them so they think there was like maybe a bunch of other versions of human beings that we just lost in time and then you're gonna probably find it as people like get further and further into DNA testing to find more and more different versions of people and people there's supposedly a lost Empire in Russia called tar do we ever heard about that no yeah it's it's supposedly a race from all history for different reasons I don't really know that much about it but it keeps popping up on YouTube if I was a denial I would make a joke about the name of it thar dia yeah make a joke what would you say I'd say something terrible like what Tarr dia I can't think of anything wonder why I didn't make it okay um that guy Graham Hancock who wrote that book did you ever listen that podcast I did with him recently not the recent one dude he was talking about the Amazon and that hidden civilizations were at one point in time in the Amazon then European settlers or European explorers rather came there and gave him smallpox and it burned through the entire fucking population just like it burned through the Native Americans same deal and just wiped out these huge cities people just abandon these huge cities and he was saying that at one point in time they think as much as 20 million people or living in the Amazon well then they had these really big established cities so now they're using this stuff called lidar it's like light like laser that they shoot from a fucking plane and they make maps of the giant cities the fine berries dude it's crazy it's amazing to watch because the first European explorers when they went to the Amazon according to Graham Hancock in his book which is called America before the first European explorers when they came to the Amazon they were like oh my god this is incredible these they have these massive cities and sophisticated culture and they wrote back about it then when people came back hundreds of years later everything was gone it was all just engulfed by the jungle because all the people died off after the fucking European explorers came so the European explorers came they spread their diseases they came in how many boats over how much time they wrote things about it and everybody fucking died they died like just like a haunted curse like they brought a curse to a place and then the jungle overcame the city and grew through the pillars of the floor and just took over and now they're finding it through all this new sophisticated technology where they get scanned through the trees and just get images of what the ground looks like and then they take this image of the ground you could see these grids see buildings it's amazingly relations that they could survive in the jungle with all that fungus and bacteria viruses ooh logs and all that shit but smallpox takes him out smallpox jacked them they weren't ready for it they didn't have was probably not know all possibly probably a gang of diseases that the I mean smallpox for sure killed a lot of people during that time period so they assumed it was smallpox and smallpox most likely was one of the diseases but I bet they gave him a bunch of other diseases too these fucking people had no immune system for any of the shit the Europeans were running over there just and I bet the same thing would happen if someone from there went to Europe but they have some weird parasites and weird shit that if they could somehow I mean I guess you'd imagine like people that live in the jungle must be exposed to certain parasites are certain certain diseases or germs that they don't get in Europe either for sure transferring them back and forth like that probably wouldn't know like if they went and visited like a giant ship full of Amazonians went to visit Europe they probably giving them some strange disease yeah like dude can you imagine and wonder if those guys brought anything back I wonder if they got anything from the Amazon people brought it back vaginal parasites believe you went there man imagine the kind of sexual diseases they had in the Amazon but they were immune to that Europeans were like just dying how the fuck and a coral growing on their dicks there's no deodorant they probably didn't use soap and you probably got used to it you know they say people are used to smells you get that's why people that live in those towns where they have a factory and everything smells like chicken shit or something those people get used to it or when you drive when you're on the 405 and you pass by that Budweiser plant it smells like has that weird like almost fried yeah what is there's fried food yeah what is that and you drive into San Pedro and it smells like the sewer you know when you're on the 710 or the 110 is there's certain places there's certain places where you you like in New Jersey when I was a kid I remember there was areas that grow by that had factories and you could see the fucking smoke coming out of the factory they were just spewing it and you it would stink the whole fucking city would stink and if you lived there that you just had to accept that you know if you lived there there's no fix in that that's just what the town smelled like that was your reality it's crazy what do you think of um 5g and all that scared that's terrifying all that shit yeah because there's how much long-term testing have they done zero or negative numbers Daniel off they're putting a much do is that would when when when I'm driving around with my family my wife is obsessed with recognizing plates she's always calling at Florida Oregon she's her and my son they got a little game they play there always a kind of plates I'm always looking at cell phone towers and satellite dishes yeah all satellite dishes point to the southeast for some reason or other and that's what I always check they don't point to the north in Southern California that's just DirecTV satellite that's all satellites but every it's pointing to the cell consumer consumer sell every satellite dish that I've seen I am obsessed with their ever they're always point they never point to the north they're always pointing south east all of them the great majority of satellite dishes that you see are probably like DirecTV or I've notice all of them all of them but you go up it's it's crazy I don't know why I don't know why but also those cellphone towers I was on this website called um smart meters murder dot-com smart meters murder I was trying to remember it smart meters murder calm dude you want to get your fucking head blown off go to that website and read the documents that they're pulling from different agencies dude scary what you're talking real scary ah but we is kicking in strong you know what you're gonna have to go check that shit hard but it's like on 5g but back from back from their documents from government agencies right from 2001 July 2001 it's like this whole I don't know how big like 400 page plan for the world it's a plan for the world are talking about who wrote this plan the way you're holding that yeah why you do it it is quite hilarious it's the perfect like if someone was talking about a conspiracy theory and they had a blunt and they're just like in the full bore conspiracy yeah while they're holding the joint it's so scary dude that I don't let's change the subject you know if you want to look into it go to smart meters smart meters murder calm but it's scary I have read I want to talk about it I have read things where people are questioning that like whether or not 5g is going to be healthy but I haven't seen anything that verifies it is or it isn't I haven't seen anything that says I need to look into it but but just in the what I'm worried all told is that I really think that Wi-Fi signals all the various signals that surround us all the time I think they have an effect on us and I don't know what that effect is I don't know if it's negative or positive I don't know if it and it dulls the senses it's entirely possible that it does something to dull the senses because it occupies an area I mean if we have the capability of recognizing the fact that there the theory signals around us all the time cellular signors signals radio signals satellite signals we're surrounded constantly by signals are we absolutely sure that our body doesn't have the capacity to recognize those signals even though we don't have like a really clear method of taking those signals in and then translating them into visuals or into audio but because we can't like take that Sirius satellite signal and then and then have like a player in our head because of that we assume that we're not taking it in in some way that's what these that's what this report let me just amazed about but it's about a this is why I say this is why says because when I feel the the least foggy is when I'm in the woods when I'm in the mountains when there's no cellphone service there's no radio service there's no Wi-Fi there ain't shit that's where house satellites don't work when someone's in the woods but no no satellites do work you could actually not in the would show no no in the bush you get a dish you put on the roof of your car you could watch tea that's a new thing that Steve Rinella don't lawns work on satellites no phones work on cell towers put the GPS works on satellites okay so your phone still works as a GPS unit when you're in the woods even if you don't in every signal so so you can find your way out with a map if your phone was on you know there's people that say the GSP the GPS geez the GPS is also run by the towers - they don't need to go into space that you could triangulate your position from towers alone but you probably could try to triangulate your position from towers but you couldn't broadcast a such a gigantic area like you can with satellites you can see satellites the people that think that satellites aren't real they need to talk to someone who make satellites they were there you can see them with telescopes they're up there we have the ability to tune in to the very specific spot in the sky with a direct tv and you'll pick up the signal that's how you get the signal you tuned to spot in the sky with the satellite is and you pick up the signal they're real people have a problem with fucking everything that's ever existed everything everything's fake everything's fake people think most of it is how many people think that we're living in a simulation really really fuckin smart people thank you that's okay that isn't crazy do that that's the craziest thing about all conspiracy theories like people that are not on that side there's a conspiracy theories aside and then there's the people wait on the other side those motherfuckers are totally into man we live in a computer that is hilarious that's not logical that's illogical well the the the reason why they think does cuz someday there's going to be a program may be true it may be true maybe we do live in a computer right but dude there's no evidence no there's no evidence in these conspiracy theories of if you look into each one individually damn maybe it's true maybe it's not but there's actual evidence is it enough evidence to prove it one way or another who knows but don't talk shit on when it's on the same like government conspiracy it's dude I've never heard I've never heard anybody like that's easy to categorize people like that no say people believe they don't know that no no okay for sure I haven't done any service surveys this is all based on the people that I come in contact with did I got oh I would say people you know 80% of my students that are not conspiracy theorists they don't even think about it they're just like regular people they don't they don't they don't concern themselves with run and you know what I mean they think it's amusing that I'm into it but they're not into it you know what I mean but those same people when you turn say dude you you know Elon Musk says that we might live in a computer and everyone's like it may be true but dude there's zero evidence of that that we live in a fucking computer what was the evidence what did someone someone propose some sort of theory that proves that life is a hologram well it wasn't a hologram that life is a simulation someone crucem out I'd like to see that I tried reading this book the holographic universe but I didn't get into it maybe I should read I'm not saying it's not true I'm just saying there's just no I know it might not be the same fucking people that you're talking about that do or don't believe but people definitely get rigid that's cool to believe that you could talk to people like you you know Elon Musk said it it's wrong it's like a cool thing yeah you know wait on the line you could be way and just like yeah we might live in a computer man it's interesting that's that's fascinating to me I think the reason why they say that is because one day we will and we all know it we all know it we all know that one day you could be in something that's as ridiculous as what you're experiencing right now and it could be a simulation yes yes but they believe happened yeah well really not they might not necessarily believe it but they're entertaining you that's what the theory is yeah we might be in a computer simulation yeah you might be living in a computer simulation yeah maybe or maybe I'm not saying we don't I'm just saying dude there's no evidence of that right but the keywords might so to just explore an idea like are we living in a simulation it doesn't mean you can't see nothing wrong with that yeah that's what I'm talking about that's like a conspiracy that should be one of the you should look it's logical to lump that in with all those like 9/11 conspiracy like 9/11 for instance there's lots of evidences it was an inside job but that's a crazy conspiracy to most people but there if you look into it their scientific Esaias supports that it was an inside job the science despite stir no but disputed no no for sure but there's evidence right I'm not saying but what whether it's true or not I'm just saying I don't want to go into a nine-one-one inside job using that I'm just using that as an example like as a that's a crazy conspiracy theory but there's a lot of evidence whether it's true or not who knows you know what I mean I think it was an inside job but a lot of people don't and whatever but there's zero evidence of us living in a computer Strangler we're not talking about the same people it might not be the same people that believe one or the other they're dumping them together no no no no no I'm there are different they're different people I know but the people that don't want to believe that and don't want to look at the evidence I'm saying aren't necessarily the same exact people as the people to believe when iteration you're right I have there's no poll on it I haven't taken a poll 291 you just went you wanted to talk about it so you got us into it that's that's yeah we don't talk about 9/11 I was just using that example I know what you're saying you know people believe weird shit they definitely like like the people that really want to believe in Bigfoot or the people that really want to believe in UFOs like UFOs are coming back right now everybody's talking ever bigger than stronger than ever that should tell you something Dave Foley's hooked Dave Foley from Newsradio remember Dan Cohen hooked we text each other almost exclusively about UFO evidence I was the biggest a New York Times a couple days ago oh wow what is that Navy pilots report unidentified flying objects here's the thing though we don't know what kind of shit the Chinese have figured out we don't know what kind of shit the Russians to figured out we assume that we know because but we did we didn't let them know about the stealth bomber or any of the crazy shit that they were building in area 51 we didn't let them know do you know me I was balls deep into the you know community did might at the first tattoo I got I got an alien on my left arm in any German garb I was always into fucking ancient Egypt the conspiracy side of the ancient Egypt there's the mainstream Egyptology I was going to the though oh look what Graham Hancock is saying and UFOs mmm there's so much proof in my head there was so much proof that the government was trying to cover up look the why are they covering it up why are they covering it up look at all these guys from pilots from the Air Force are saying they saw UFOs pilots from the Navy are saying they saw UFOs dudes from the Pentagon it's gotta be true that's a dude that's a dude that's a CIA pilot he's saying it so when you're when your balls deep and you really want to believe it you look at it that way like look there's all these government officials saying they saw UFOs and they got their own UFO story you know and then um you know you listen to Bill Cooper and he was former office of naval intelligence officer and you know and and when you hear what he says he wrote that book behold the pale white horse he that guy said crazy shit he said there's a base on the moon not that guy that's your cock behold the pale white horse he said there's a base on the yes yes no he at first didn't mean at first no you're talking about no leader you're talking about that guy's crazy - right totally what does that guy say he says that um there's millions of people on each planet and they're all every planet has millions of people is he the guy that owns skinwalker ranch I don't know but he was a part of his dad own Learjet right right I forget what that business seems like a super rich troll totally when he says what he says the crazy shit he says I'm with this guy's having a good time fucking with people yeah totally but Bill Cooper says that because his job was to prepare notes top secret notes classified shit it for meetings with high-level people in the military and he was based on what he was reading was like damn UFOs are real look I have proof so that at first he was like for sure UFOs are real for sure they're hiding that's what he was saying he was preaching that then he learned later they let him whistle blow he never got busted for whistle blown that they were they want him they wanted him to leak that UFO that's what his conclusion was he started to realize wait a minute they want me to leak this and then he he got to the point where he believes that all UFO abductions like oh like the he believes that um everything was a product of the government all UFO sightings abductions they're taking you in its he believes it's like the CIA doing that shit when he was that's what he was really about before he got murdered man they went up to his ranch and fuck him up if they wanted to really fuck with you this is what I think they would do they would first of all they would put acid on your shit they put ass on your doorknob or something like that because there was a dude who found something I forget what he found some old thing and as he was opening it up he he act just by touching it it was like some old thing it was dipped in acid and he went on an acid trip for like six hours so this would they do they dose you up they'd somehow or another dose you up whether touching a doorknob finally guy recent story it's a guy that was cleaning a board like this a sound board that's it what it was he touched that's what it was it's like uh telling us girlfriend saying I think I'm fucking high yes and they did ended up testing and it well that's exactly the story that's exactly the story so they could do that to you and then sneak up on you with some special effects where some fucking crazy mask and fucking flash you with lights and you're so crazy high you don't know what the fuck's going on they grab you and put you want to tell a desk and tell you you you've been abducted by aliens from another planet you don't think they fucked with people and did something like they do for the documentary abducted in plain sight no I have not which ones do it sort of that's exact it's about UFOs and well it's a bit sort of sort of this guy he was married had a couple kids he was tight with the family who had three daughters he was a predator so he targeted he targeted the twelve-year-old and what he did is he had said fuck with the mom fuck with the dad fucking the dad in sex with the dead sexual relations and some of the dead not fucked Adam did dad jerked him off oh they talked about this on the bus the guy just jerked him off the guy jerked him off he got he convinced the guy to jerk him off so he wanted blackmail on the parents right so that once he took the daughter they couldn't say that's the black now because he jerked them off and he fucked with the mother too and it was it was a secret so of course that guy doesn't want none of that she lets the guy take his kid he's gonna tea he has to take the daughter uh horseback riding so and they were like okay so he takes the daughter horseback riding and what he does is he starts telling her that there's all these alien abductions going on and we got to be careful for aliens she's 12 years old so he's setting her up so when he does he drugs her she wakes up she strapped to a table he's got a speaker with alien voices coming out and the alien and she wakes up she didn't know where she's at like oh my god and this this alien voice says that she is responsible for saving the earth she has to marry that dude she has to marry the dude in the alien voice you have to marry Bob and you have to have his but you can't tell nobody and drugs I don't know and then she passes out again and she wakes up and she's not strapped she's looking around the trailer and she sees the guy he's about he's pretending he's all fucked up and she's like waking him up and he's like it has fake blood on him or whatever and then he wakes up and then she tells him we've been abducted by aliens and I need to have your child oh he tricked her so from the age of 12 to 16 he owned her did the they ended up catching him with the girl like a week later FBI gets involved and the girl can't tell anybody or everyone dies so so she's obsessed now she's back with the family the guys in jail for like a day cuz you know what he does is he has his lawyers send letters to the mother and father saying to make him sign like that it was consensual what he threatened the blackmail so they signed it and let him out they signed and they let him out and then he goes dead like the next state over but that chick she's a good she's 12 13 14 and she's obsessed with him she has to save the world so that that's an example of and then it turns out it turns out that he I think the guy was CIA probably and he knew that he knew those techniques that's how they get people they fill them up say there's all these alien in the abductions get them all scared and then boom when they do it they believe it Jesus Christ yeah so that's just MKULTRA shit did she Caltrain I guarantee they did that to people who are like political enemies fuck you why wouldn't they do that it's easy huh it's easy it just seems like something they would do to just seems like it makes sense and then bill Cooper said that the mutilated terrible thing that people were saying oh you love those are taking them because they're you know they're the organs were taken out so surgically that we don't have the key that about what bill Cooper he was he got balls deep into that he started getting into breaking down what's really happening with UFOs he's going oh shit we're being played the government is pretending to cover it up there they want to push it they want people to believe in aliens so what do you think that the counter mutilations were you think there were tests and weapons on these cattle the bill Cooper said it was really simple all the cattle were found by military bases and what they do is they when they're constantly check checking radiation levels around bases constantly so what they do is if there's cows they'll routinely take a cow take out its rectum take out it like certain organs surgically and then they dump them just to scare people just let it'll kill two birds with one stone they really needed to get some radiation but it's always good it's always good to push UFOs it's always good to scare people with aliens I wonder if those those cattle abductions if they coincided with areas where there was like some sort of toxic dump you know there's some big ammunition dump or something like that like anything where some corner but do they have more of them around Nevada where they did all those nuclear tests I'm not sure but the gist of what bill Cooper said was found near military bases and he knows like once he looked into it it's like oh I know what they were doing they're checking radiation levels and they're scaring people at the same time mmm that makes sense because it was surgically removed right like people can do that like why would that eliminate the possibility that people could do it of course people could do it but you know people like the only aliens could do that and then they take it and then they move it to another place so that the blood is not in the spot where they find the animal that's all it is did I'm a crazy that's how they catch poachers you know do you know that how they catch poachers that way sometimes they find out where the gut pile is so I say if you you didn't really have a tag to shoot a deer and then you shot a deer in another place where you're not supposed to be but you have a tag at a different place you you just you because in some places where it's easier to get tags you just take the deer out of the forbidden place take a picture of it or some like that and then go back home but they busted people because they like Park Rangers recognize certain mountain peaks and there's no no you weren't there I know exactly where you were when you when you kill this deer you're in a different place and then they go to that different place and they cope they look at the fake the picture and they try to coordinate and then they find the gut pile and then they convict people of poaching mmm that's happened before hmm look at the photos yeah yeah so like so that's what bill Cooper that makes sense that they would do that they would do it because then when you if you think you took that animal and killed it and cut it and left this big bloody pot and then put it in a truck and then dragged it 10 miles away and dropped it off there people like this is crazy there's no blood at the scene of the crime all the Bloods missing it's been surgically removed but no one can do this this is impossible aliens literally no blood on the ground yeah because they put a day you fuck you fuck wit you think aliens came this far to fuck with cows imagine if we went all the way up to like Neptune that shoot Gophers fuck up your Gophers Jack them cut their dicks off throw them back that's funny man that's exactly what they thought aliens did and it's hilarious cattle mutilations are fucking hilarious in that regard yeah no it's gross too though that they did it so many times that it became a thing that people looked for and then they let all these people who believe in aliens anyway they let all these people just students they're trying to scare us they're trying to scare us with aliens for sure maybe that's what book Bigfoot's about maybe Bigfoot was about do let's let's create this mythical monster and have people afraid they don't want people to move in the woods the thing about this that's not good for the NWO right the new world art they want people to go into cities so they create these things doing it they should do it great another Bigfoot skill that's an easy way reason for believing a Bigfoot I've ever heard that's so funny Bigfoot's been around forever though dude they talked about it in the CIA's been around forever and they were in the Native American culture before that the Nazis like have a bet if you go to Germany they have these mythical creatures that they created to scare people out of the woods if they're not doing that damn they got to give me credit if they start doing it because that's a good Illuminati move right there right that's how crazy deep you have to be if you're a conspiracy theorist if you go so deep you think that the CIA was in the Native Americans before Columbus landed you a pearl you don't even understand it had a different name it was a civilization and they taught the European maybe the CIA of the Apache because you know they had to have some evil elites that lied to their people right maybe they wanted to keep their tribes together so they said there's like they created these monsters you can't go out there we're gonna protect you you got to stay here would that be a good move for us probably would happen right and they got these crazy stories of these monsters mmm you got to stay here CIA building empires 101 you create you scare them with aliens we got a threat from up here so we need to protect you and then we got threats down here to jaws maybe jaws is a CIA movie let's keep people out the ocean we got to keep them in cities it's all CIA everything yeah just work for good you know what the Native American community most I'm sure most of the people in CIA are really legitimately trying to stop communism it's just like a few cowboys yes Cowboys yeah and in anything any cops right when you hear about corrupt cops that doesn't mean all cops are corrupt but did you ever see that documentary on New York the 7/5 Mike Dowd he'd been a guest on Joey's podcast my podcast he was a corrupt cop and yeah deeply deeply deeply deeply corrupt that means my murdered people no no we got up to that according to him he's not gonna tell you murder people get caught for it we went to jail and I says he didn't I believe him just to clarify but you know dealt with drug dealers and you know it was driving around in a Corvette and shit like living like a baller and scared they were all selling drugs and they caught up and you know they put him in jail for a long time then they put out this fucking amazing documentary it's called the 75 its what does he talk about everything he tells the spells the pains about getting involved with all these drug dealers and you know rolling these people over taking their money and then going business with them that's crazy it is a crazy documentary you like you get anxiety even though you know the guy is still alive while they're telling the stories like Jesus Christ they were just doing blow and going crazy and just in robbing people just rate robbing people showing up at people's houses putting guns their heads robbed another drug money you know like it was nuts man like there was hits out on them it was crazy it's crazy it's a crazy documentary but this is like there's a guy who should know who the the the current guest is on sam Harris's podcast I'll look at that up in a second but he was talking about it you know they're talking about like absolute power and absolute power that's that old expression absolute power corrupts absolutely you know power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely and what they're talking about today and I was when I was walking the dog I was listening to this I was saying know what it does is it exposes you more than it corrupts you exposes corruption and like in they gave some examples about like Richard Nixon like that Richard Nixon when he was when he was young his professor told him not to be a lawyer because he has like really shitty ethics like it exposed him when he became president and that's when the power got to him and that that's an interesting that's an interesting subject like what does it like why does someone become out of control corrupt cop well it's a exposes 'im exposes something in them but in his case when he was saying was the whole department was corrupt when he got in there they were corrupt people were corrupt the day he got on the job people were telling him what to talk about what not to talk about and they beat some guy up or something like that and he's like this never has never happened you know like they have these little what do they call it what is that expression they have four four cops keeping their mouth shut what the fuck is that what there's an expression there's like a code called the CODIS it's like it almost has like snitches need stitches code of something I'm thinking of a Chuck Norris movie code of silence but when you got the power to just rob drug dealers and you're you know and young guy who's doing coke you know you're crazy he's a really nice guy though literally returns a police officer code of silence Cota South huh Chuck Norris movie it wasn't Chuck Norris movie right it's a good one those cop movies I love that shit when I was a kid the wall of silence and all that's coming up was I just got oh I think code of silence is the name of the Chuck Norris movie pretty sure but um yeah man I just like this corrupt cops most cops aren't corrupt I think that's the case with agents with fucking anybody you know that's just how it goes but I have a bunch of cop friends they're all kids made a mad dash you know it's that that's what I'll call it diarrhea - yep running into that can I know there's cops out there that you know are probably a couple of them out there fucking people up and maybe for sure for sure but the cops I know the cops that I come in contact with they've always been cool to me yes Larry's been cool to me well also too you know they're not pulling you over they're also in the martial arts you're a famous martial artist and a lot of times your training or learning from them or we're talking to them at UFC events they know lucida Big John McCarthy yeah it's like great guys I'm super Pro cop but I know that there's bad people in every fucking line of work it doesn't mean cops are bad doesn't cops it's a terrible fucking job the problem is when when someone does do something bad man it changes everybody's opinion about what cops are like there's two videos I saw last week of cops pulling people over with guns drawn pointed in the car one was a Mexican family a guy and his girl and one was a black family a guy and his girl it was the same thing the guys driving and the guy then the the cop has his gun out pointed at them and he's telling this black kid to shut off his car and he's like I'm not gonna do that he's like I'm not moving my hands he goes that you give me give you an excuse to shoot me I'm not moving my hands so his girls filming it and he's got his hands up and it's crazy watch man I don't know what happened before that I don't know what the context was I don't know I don't know I have no idea all I know is this guy's got a gun pointed out this guy and the guy's not threatening him he's not saying he's telling them to shut off the car and the guys scared to shut off the car because there are there are videos of a cop telling the guy pull over the guy let me see your license registration and he reaches back to get his wallet in the cop shoots him this video that you can see that but what about it's just people is my point but I gotta clear gotta know the whole story right you guys maybe maybe they ran its plate so they go oh shit we got a yep we got a hot one sometimes I'm sure they'll never know these other times I'm sure that's the case yeah but with this video that wasn't you know nobody provided that information in that video you just seen a guy pointing a gun at a guy and I don't think he has his you know he just has his hands up look it's all fucking we've talked about this 100 times it's a hard goddamn job you're pulling people over you never know who's gonna shoot you you want to go home to your wife and family and every fucking day you're pulling people over that align you every day you're dealing with people that are breaking the law and they're not happy to see you every day and you know I think that's where that absolute power corrupted comes in corrupt some fucking people you know there's some some dirty Birds out there I think in the future though ma'am you're gonna see less and less of that I think it was probably a hundred percent of the way things ran like many many years ago and now it's way less cuz it's there's way more transparency you know you know that cocaine Cowboys documentary you seen that Billy Corbin stuff yes you know how the class of the graduating class that police academy in Miami one year a hundred percent of them either were murdered or went to jail for corruption yeah a whole class yeah yeah that's crazy with that that's what happens when places go sideways you know when things go so nutty yeah it's crazy like the Scarface days yeah that's how crazy I am if someone if someone told me do you know the CIA Purdue Purdue's Scarface to distract from their drug running I would just need a youtube link you know to me well the CIA even if they didn't produce it if they really if there's some Cowboys in the CIA were selling drugs even if they didn't produce Scarface they certainly benefited from it and somewhat because it made it made drug smuggler for all the drug smugglers they were all cube is never all Mexican right but it made its Amazon problem there was some guys what was that guy what didn't didn't the berries he'll bring in over five billion tons or if I have hundred billion or five billion dollars or something like that a big billion yeah of drug money and yeah it wasn't that it was about good yeah it was about that right that's about it's about berry see yeah yeah what is that movie called the Tom Cruise American made American made that's a fucking excellent movie that's an excellent movie and for people who don't know how all that shit went down you watch that movie I don't know how historically accurate it was is it involved the CIA - yeah oh yeah oh yeah and they essentially talk about exactly a we just talked about it Cowboys in the CIA and how many people were making money on the sneak tips son bring it in that cocaine bring in that ya know if it had in the murders of the two kids though cuz that's really how they got busted they got busted because they were dropping off coke out of these planes and two kids sawed the drop off and they found the two kids near the coke and they fucking murdered them and then they put him on train tracks and said they got high and fell asleep on train tracks families did an autopsy and found knife wounds on the kid they knew something was up and then they investigated and slowly but surely the the pieces started to fall apart and then when Barry seal was murdered he had George Bush's phone number in his pocket when he was murdered is that in the movie - on it I don't know I don't know oh no that was in the movie but that's that's what happened on his way to testify I mean they weren't even hiding it they just let this guy get shot up on the way to testify he for sure brought in what I would call a fuck load of coke who Barry seal for sure glowed who is his boss II think it's good question it was an Arkansas right somebody probably got a taste you know at many different stages right what's the coke coming in are kameena I mean ours that was that real was that a movie Tom Cruise made a movie about me now Arkansas oh it's good movie I don't think it's hard for me to watch any movies unless it's an animated movie for my kid like going to a regular movie can't do it no it's hard can't do it I come at home well Google this was we're probably a lot that we just cover that needs to be Google the website about the accuracy of the movie oh good perfect that's what was gonna ask - who decides how accurate or not right right right and they let him go oh and certain certain times they caught him they let him go home people didn't want to let him go so like crazy documentary or crazy movie but what do they call that uh what what docudrama what is what is it when someone makes a movie about it's not really a docudrama though it's not it's a fucking movie it's like you know you never know how much is true well we're talking about that goddamn wrestling movie with Steve Carell with the Mark Hamill or Mark Schultz movie oh yeah the Gary Dave and Mark Schultz yeah yeah the Gary Goodridge thing well they they replaced him with some Russian dude in the movie that's a historical event when Gary Goodridge fought Mark Schultz that was a historical event Mark Schultz dominated one of the best guys in the sport easily just wrestled him to the ground with ease and we got a chance to see wow this is what happens when an Olympic gold medalist wrestles a regular martial artist but in the movie they decided to just change that for no reason like they could do that with anything so who the fuck involves the Bruce Lee movie with Jason Scott Lee man that was filled with a bunch of bullshit he's made shit up he had a famous fight where he learned Wing Chun doesn't really work on Americans yeah it was it was in a YMCA he was fighting for the right to teach foreigners kung fu because the elders that lived in San Francisco or Seattle I forget I think the San Francisco they didn't want him to teach foreigners and they said if you beat this if you beat our guy up then we'll let you teach foreigner so he had this fight it was in the YMCA but in the actual movie it's in a fucking dungeon dude this is a cave and the elders are sit nor the Rings it's like more the fucking rings that's right it's the craziest thing they didn't have to go that far but I guess it was just the why I'm said did he win the fight yes but he didn't agree in real life he had a he hurt his back doing squats or doing deadlifts it was really bad here it is so that's when he wrote his first book is when he was like an attraction is that what they call it when they your Backson some kind of spinal or some kind of brace but so but in the movie the dude kicked him in the back and broke his back oh yeah Turkey yeah yeah and then he's there's a famous appearance of his at the Long Beach Convention Center back in the 60s it was like a karate tournament and he did some demonstrations he did there's a video famous video of him doing the one-inch punch it's in front of it's like get the like an IBJJF tournament he's doing it demonstration and in the movie it was a real fight and he fights the same dude from the dungeon it's a rematch you guys think why would they do that and I need to his life was amazing in you know in reality are they doing something on him right now though isn't something happening right now some new Bruce Lee thing that I read that am I just hoping there's a movie coming out about a dude who's a famous actor in the late 60s and early 70s and in the movie he's he's a stuntman yeah he's a famous rich stuntman dude and in the movie there's a Bruce Lee part where he's in a Bruce Lee movie and also in a Quentin Tarantino movie called Once Upon a Time in Hollywood oh nice but it's not is it CGI Bruce Lee no is an actor it's an actor they should have went with the CGI Bruce oh yeah make a new Bruce Lee movie all CGI they can do that shit magic Illuminati doesn't want you to know how good they aren't that yet okay so if the Illuminati created Bruce Lee what would be the reason well they would if they did it they would let you know hey fuckface we already can make movies out of anybody anytime we want we could have someone talk like Bruce Lee look at that that looks like Bruce Lee did my girl looks very good what's that CGI doesn't move I'm right there I mean it's close enough is that the new Bruce Lee this is just a photo from the trailer so the only piece we can get oh you know what that CGI no okay no no it's not CG no no no for sure it's CGI that first that first clip down right there CG oh it's glasses Eddie's we're including its face his fuck it looks like a CGI video game I think they did something to his jaw a little bit looks like a CGI face no he hasn't that looks real but that's cuz you've seen him in a different angle watch back it up to where he's up at the side what if they're doing like that bacony to me hold on hold to me that looks everything you know stop is exhausting um could have though if they wanted to watch urgent fast and furious with Paul Walker right they recreated his face line well they need to do a Bruce Lee movie they can't have it fucked up at all it has to be super smooth it has to be it has to be really Bruce Lee asked totally and you know what you could do it like that movie man this was like 20 years ago the Final Fantasy movie where they did animation but they try to make it look real yeah old people they got that shit down they got old people down harder and make a young girl look real so that cutout is still a cartoon effect but older people shit look like real people yeah they can do it with textured skins right yeah do with Dragon and that was 20 years ago they could do movies that are full CGI that's really hard to tell well it's also because your brain doesn't have like a reference point for dragons they can make a dragon look real well it's like a juicy Game of Thrones so they have the wolves yeah the wolves are always just like the hair moves slow mo Zowie super slo-mo that is him that popped up here on this video yeah Michael mo that's the dude yeah so when you see him with the glasses and see him from the side he should uh that's interesting I I don't know if they could do the CGI yet for a whole movie and make him with Bruce Lee's face I could do it perfect wow that's crazy so they could have done that but then they get if everybody else in the movie isn't like Steve McQueen and all the other famous folks in the movie like are they using different people for them or that that would be fucked up imagine if in the future all they ever make is like Charles Bronson movies Steve McQueen movies Bruce Lee movies and they do it with regular actors and the regular actors get paid like scale these are giant ants and they do fake and do faking on them and they have new Bruce Lee movies and they have some dude I'd be a lot worse how rogue they added Princess Leia back oh she's not even alive anymore I didn't see the new one yeah so there you go maybe I did though they're doing it now she's in the moat more recent one that just came out and the one before that too I guess I think I saw the most was the most recent there's a lot of yeah I think I'm I think I'm one behind I think I missed I haven't seen the New Avengers I've managed to avoid all spoil about when they start doing like uh like they'll take Angelina leaves face and as long as y'all leave and put it on like you know Beyonce's body or something remember that song see how big old titties like Angelina Jolie that's all yeah that sounds a great song that was a big hit we got about that yeah Angelina Jolie got some big-ass titties that was a song that was the Hult it was like different people that had some big-ass titties that was the name of the song she's in that new Maleficent movie they did some crazy shit to her face man they turned her into some like dragon lady so yeah some wizard lady or witch yeah there's a lot of Satanism in movies man Meiko dark with the cop do you do you trip out I know I know we have different opinions on like what's up there you know what the sky in space but do you do you notice do you notice watching kids programming that they fucking bombard kids with space right sure dude hey they get hammered with it in every movie there's space there's aliens or space there's aliens well not every movies yeah it's crazy it's insane they blast them with it well there's a lot above us you look I see forever it's important for kids now total it's important period man I want to see Brian Cox's demonstration that he did they did like they do a show they did it in downtown LA and I was thinking I would love to get Eddie Bravo high and have him watch this like a fight companion this is CGI is this fake yeah why do you think it's fake how much do you think is fake that you see in space man you know Wernher von Braun was a Nazi right yes okay he was brought in from Operation Paperclip right right we had any Jacobson on did you listen that yeah yes she talked yeah in depth about I mean that's how we everyone agrees on that yeah everyone agrees that he directed all 6mu missions yup everyone agrees everyone agrees that him in Walt Disney we're best friends where they grow best friends yep they're best friends they worked on space together they were like you know jump into a lot of conclusion today in this day and age you don't think anybody's like when SpaceX shoots rockets off in the space or when you know Amazon has a rocket company now these guys are gonna be able to launch satellites and even have consumer flights I just need proof what about deception would you everywhere some like okay you know when you're moving on you know you're talking about that Foxcatcher movie you're like you've said it a couple times on your podcast we're like once you've said once you saw that they have to Gary Goodridge out you were like I can't trust this movie I can't put the whole movies I can't trust it it may be real it may not be real but I need some proof I got you that's exactly how I feel about no no that space the government the government so anything coming from the government agency whatever it's a government agency I look at it like Foxcatcher you've lied enough where I'm like I need some get refutable evidence otherwise why do I have to believe it yes so many real you get it but SpaceX is in the government no they're subsidized by the government no you're subsidized they do they got like four billion dollars so they tell them to fake space no one's trust in NASA no more so they're panning it over hey let's let's get let's do the side thing and everyone's all into space hmm that's nothing way to look at it I think it's winter you saw that you saw that that that Tesla launch saw that we're talking about when you claim to launch a did you see that footage the actual Teslin space yes yes I saw that and you have a dude you I've always known you as a dude had a strong vibrant vibrant bullshit meter you've always been that young you're gonna watch that evidence and go oh okay you can't just buy that dude you can't just buy that when they see ridiculous it's the very first thing the very first don't poison the water if you want me to get an honest the first thing Elon must said on his in his press conference the first thing he said is like well I think it's impossible and ridiculous and and if you can tell it's real because it looks so fake that's the opposite of logic that there's logic and reason and then there's the opposite of that no we can tell it's real because it looks so fake is the opposite of war that's just something he says cuz he's a fucking genius and he's taking a picture from so the reason why he said to the air no the reason he said that was because all day when they did that all day all over the internet was like fake fake fake statement this is so ridiculous let me see it Jamie let me see the video the wrong one that got edited so I'm trying to find the one that's from space and we just abandon the subject so I just you know what I just it may be real SpaceX may be real that exactly why they no see them shoot the Rockets off I mean literally when you look at them and tell me see a rocket anytime you see a rocket shoot you see it go up and then see you go down in the ocean no launch rockets they're launching rockets that's what it looks like because what you're seeing it go over the curve of the earth Eddie you're seeing it go over the ocean you've seen it go up and over and so as it gets further away that you can't see it anymore it looks going up the nasgo hair alone Wow it's not going parallel okay okay okay okay okay so the shrine so they are trying it is spinning yeah okay I I understand that that's what you believe but you got to understand what I believe what I believe because because that's what you see but if you have someone explain it to you will you still believe it physics planation no no explanation I need evidence need evidence and then when you see evidence when you see that Tesla that they launched and you see how fake it looks it looks so fake but just because something doesn't look real it doesn't mean it's fake but it doesn't mean it's real I need evidence that you haven't seen with your own eyes might be fake maybe I don't trust it's a lie you don't trust that yeah everybody's like a simulation you know right I had a friend who lied about everything everything about his life where he was from all the things he did he was a wrestling champion he was he had everything then I found out like two years into the relationship little by little that he lied about this and he lied about that then I find out that he lied about everything is one of those guys that lies about everything exactly so he may be telling the truth and even total Liars will tell the truth throughout the day a lot just to get through the day at that you have to tell the truth again but then you know at the drop of a hat they're gonna lie about their life in some crazy way whatever I understand your logic getting down here I understand your logic but you also have to assume that most of the people that are telling you the truth about this or that online that also don't have proof that also are talking about these things and they haven't shown you you haven't seen it you haven't been there just like you haven't been you know examining satellites these people they don't know if they're full of shit either they could be real they could they could be every page were why would you assume they were but the satellites are fake see what I'm saying what do you mean people that are making these YouTube videos that they're correct but the people that are putting up south go by I just go by science that's it scientific evidence like real science like water is always level right we know that water is always level in the conversation if you don't understand how gravity works over a giant fucking sphere no no if if we live on a ball that's 25,000 units and conference if we do then the water should be bending at least with this is so crazy you don't know water what that means I do know that if it's a ball the potion should be curving at a certain rate and they figured that out here's a power its perspective yeah but it's going around why is it going over the top and why is it shrinking everything you look at the end of the street at street lights do that street lights do that no Eddie did you do that on the hill not on the ocean no no but you're looking at those electrical posts or whatever column and they go down that's how street light you go right in the middle the street the very next a street light it appears to be shorter than that one and then the next one appears to be sure that's how you draw shit you but is it really that short no it's just your perspective you're actually looking at an optical illusion you're actually looking at it looks like they're getting shorter and descending it looks but are they no they're not ready they disappear they disappear over the horizon and then you could bring them back in but that's not true well you can you know you can see more up to the edge of the horizon but if the edge of the horizon it goes over the you over the edge so when you're talking about with the naked eye you're looking at a moan go in the ocean and you see it really telescopes what you're just getting small enough so you can't see it anymore exact if you use a telescope you can still see that for a little while yeah and then it goes over the fucking curve a more powerful so let's go now it brings it even closer but you know more power wise they've already had tests they've already done you could see England you could look at it you could see too much you could see Hawaii then why can't you see Hawaii if you could see the moon why can't you see there's a lot of atmospheric curves the fuck okay no if it curves okay that's what the sign can say Eddie the ones who make the GPS the ones who make the maps the ones who chart the fucking paths for airplanes and shipping routes all those people say it's round all people that do satellites all the people that are involved in aerospace all the people that are involved in anything where you have to calculate the fucking curve of the earth and the to get things to places all those people think it they're all wrong that's crazy that they haven't seen that picture if they don't they don't see that picture if they saw that picture they would get it at a hundred miles in the ocean 100 miles how much curvature should there be do you know I don't care it's about a thousand feet if they're not 6,000 feet of curvature so you should know you can see no you wouldn't be able to see a hundred miles away from the yellow shoes who Eddie you didn't go to school for this stuff these people I understand to you did I research this all the time no but you're hearing is that a hundred miles there should be six thousand feet of curvature do you don't even understand what that means I don't I understand what that means if we live on a ball that out of every hundred miles there should be six thousand feet of curvature there's there's a formula for it and but when you look there's Navy ships that can target other Navy ships with lasers a hundred miles away it would be impossible if there was a 6,000 foot curvature of water impossible they take pictures of their target pictures at 100 miles there's no curvature it's flat there should be six thousand feet some pictures with what Eddie this is something this is not your area of expertise this is one of the reasons why I get crazy about this kind of shit because you read something that someone's what I just said I bet you can again I didn't go to school for it so I don't know but I bet you understand do you stand if we live on a ball at a hundred feet there should be six thousand feet of curvature does that so everyone's wrong Eddie so all these fucking people does that make sense Australia they're doing it the wrong way all these people that go over the North Pole all that's all that snow goes into lights just there's no flights over the North Pole there's no flight maybe there's military planes to go over the North Pole maybe okay let's please just lone all over the world I've never gone over the North Pole I've flown everywhere they've been everywhere and there no one ever goes over the North Pole so it's a man they go over the North I don't know so obviously no no no it's if it's so painful this change the subject I'm trying to just a subject we could talk about Tony Ferguson what's this Saturday what about that that's great we got any questions what he's been working with him fuck yeah fuck yeah dude he's he's sharper stronger and in the best shape of his life it's the same Tony that you know you think like is it gonna be the same Tony after you know that you know he had he had some you know family stuff go on is that going to change him you know his opponents hope it changes him but he is he's the same Tony when it comes to fighting we don't get into personal stuff we just stick to fighting and the strategy he's sharper than ever it's I'm not you know you can't guarantee any wins but I will guarantee that he's gonna go in a hundred percent Tony it's a crazy matchup it's very good match that's like Russian Roulette right there dude they're gonna be throwing bombs at each other it's real good particularly now with Donald has been on a tear like the last four fights three four fights I mean he's just looked so good man ally ik went to fight for people who know how good Al is for Donald to handle al like that and drop him and you know and really put it to him like the way I'll put it I mean al said he beat the shit out of me that's what Al's exact quote was I was very complimentary and respectful after the fight yeah cowboy is no joke that guy's on fire he's not he doesn't fight like khabib he doesn't fight like Conor he fights like Tony so it's like similarly it's like Tony versus Tony you know what I mean yeah and it's shit do you both get on the ground they're very good on the ground we respect Cowboys fucking ground game a lot and you know we you know we do what we could to make sure you know nothing bad happens on the ground you know what I mean yeah but they both have everything both have great strike and they both have great submissions Tony's coming for war like he always does it's gonna be the same throwing down that's for sure did now went on let me ask you this because you know the answer to this when Tony had his knee fixed did he spar during that camp because someone said that he didn't do any spine it was like one of the rumors from someone who knew him I think he keeps his sparring you know Turner my striking right yes I'm never there for the striking oh I'm never it's separate we don't know I'm never I've never seen him I'm never there for the strike i'ma show us when there's grapple his the the amount of time that it took him and you know what in Big Bear he didn't we didn't bring anybody to spar like hardcore it was just like lights touching because the night letting me heal oh no that's a different fight I'm talking about the knee remember you having the mass of knee injury and then he had surgery and then what I heard knows you're right during the past fight oh yeah no spark no spark yeah that's crazy very light very light hmm well I guess you know when you already world class you could do that that mean he didn't want to fuck that I wanted to make sure nothing went wrong get to get to the flight it was that it was the right choice or sure and when he showed up against Pettis he looked like same ol Tony he did it was stunning dishes you're talking about a catastrophic knee injury and then in six months later yes fighting a world-class fighter and he's getting his legs checked yeah you know he got that knee checked he even worried at one point in time that he might be injured what makes Tony so good in my opinion just based on working with them is it seems that uh you know at the highest level high pressure fight people are aren't as they're more cautious they don't want to try to do anything stupid they're not just letting it swing and letting it go Tony isn't like that Tony is people want to get to the point where they just unleash and they don't give a fuck and there's a lot of fighters like that but Tony when he's in there it's like like Nick Diaz they're not afraid to throw anything you know what I mean he goes in there he'll throw two spinning elbows in a row right and he's just having fun it's like he's alive and he's having fun in there and he's and on the ground he's not gonna be hesitant to do something wild and crazy hmm that's just the way he is man and he thrives in the cage and there's zero hold back he's he's and he comes out guns a-blazing the whole time yeah they're both at the top of their game man that's for sure you know and Tony didn't miss a step when he got that knee injury which is very impressive even as striking was on point when he fought Pettis yeah and even got tested he got clipped I mean Pettis hurt him you know he knows how to survive man he's a very unusual fighter man very difficult to prepare for Sheila's always studying oh he's adding new weapons to his arsenal always adding something to his workout routine he's always adding shit he has the ability to focus more than anybody I know his ability to focus and you see that not only in you know the striking aspect of his game or the wrestling but you see it in the jiu-jitsu and that's where I see it is he has so much focus he doesn't I don't have to reteach him shit I will show him a very complicated transition of moves like you know in spiderweb doing the bollinger break there's like four moves you got to do pop you got a farm it's got to be so smooth there can't be any fuck-ups and I show him this and after like four or five reps he's got it down hmm and most people it take its take six months to get it down to understand it and he just can he just uh doesn't take him long to learn shit anything wrestling and striking anything new he's down but he doesn't forget it that's the most important thing he remembers all the shit and I'm you know it's who's working with him what striking a guy named Rashad used to I think he was like an Olympic hopeful back in the day boxer yeah most guys do that right it seems like there's not a lot of guys who just used one for all striking yeah he's got a bunch of people to train them he's got a couple different strength and conditioning coaches he's got a whole crew I think that's important and he's pausing to really into recovery like he spends a little serious time recovering he's got all these contraptions you know those things that you could there like leg sleeve i'ma text and and they inflate mm-hmm and he's on that all the time he's when it comes to rehab for any injury he's like like a professional NFL player you know and ice baths like you know at massages he doesn't fuck around man he's he's a hundred percent thinking about and doing something for the fight usually just non-stop you can go on for hours it's crazy yeah it's a fucking crazy matchup but it's only the third fight it means the third from the top you know there's two championship fights on top of that that's crazy the headliner right there come on man it's gonna be nuts people gonna go crazy for that it's great but saludo and Marlon more eyes have to fight for the bantamweight title that's a crazy fight too man so who don't more eyes that's the main event and then Valentina Shevchenko and Jessica I for the women's flyweight title mm-hmm so those are two world title fights I have to have those and at the top but that just shows you how fucking crazy the card is the card from top to bottom is just amazing yeah it's gonna be crazy fucking them Jimmy Jimmy Rivera and Pele Cho Yong tae it to of Aussie and blogged me Ivanoff you moving it while I was trying to read it don't do that bro that's rude fuck up that dude's name Tai Chi vos is an animal those are that's a great fucking fight that guy's crazy that's that guy that drinks out of his shoe you ever see him do that he does shoe ease He pours beer into shoes and other people's shoes he'll I tell someone to take the shoes off he pours beer into their shoes and then drinks it oh my god it's so disgusting yeah it's so foul yeah I don't get it but I get it I don't get it but I get it he likes to party he's like that dude in Talladega Nights what the fuck's his name the other good john c reilly yeah john c rise like lor the party party it likes to drink out of shoes fuck it he's an animal I guess like I mean if you want a really show you don't give a fuck that's a good way to go about doing it just grab a man's shoe and pour a beer into it and drink it his dirty sweaty feet have been funking around Matt have you died from that imagine if someone's foot fungus was so disgusting that even the alcohol didn't kill it and it germinated inside your gut where foot fungus is never gonna be like if if there's venereal diseases all right we all know there are because you dirty bitch like what what are you guys doing to each other you're both giving each other dirty fucking things with dirty things and like diseases are weird right people give each other disease this venereal diseases which are extra weird it's like oh you dirty people you gave each other's dirty dirty diseases but nature says we don't like this nature just lets these sneaky little parasites and viruses and bacteria getting your body what if there was an even more powerful one for people who sucked on feet what if it got in your gut nature's like this guy is just too much of a freak we got a column column for the herd it's like if there was foot sucking diseases you know before you make out with someone you got to tell them hey I just want you know I got a foot sucking disease so if you don't maybe we shouldn't do this what Jamie what are you making faces for because you can get staff from doing this of course you can science confirms Chuy's are really freaking dangerous especially if you're rich why is it that's clicky I try to get us with a clicky bait yeah you can get staph don't do it yeah science study to figure that out yeah because because the staff aurorus can cause toxins and these cox toxins are quite resistant to heat they they're quite resistant to the acidic environment when they can survive protein breaking enzymes out Jesus Christ if you drink from someone's shoe containing staff and it's toxins yes it can give you an acute gastrointestinal fuck all that since but alcohol is a disinfectant right well yes but there's always still a risk of infection especially if you have lower ABV alcohol by volume drinks as you'd expect higher ABV drinks like vodka do a much better job of arak eradicating bacteria so yeah beer which is what they drank which is a low alcohol beer or low alcohol beverage what a fucked up way to die done you got to do shots and those things shots are fine oh my god people are crazy but no one's happy with like taking it and leaving it where it is everybody wants to take it to the next level you know like everyone constantly like you want to one-up somebody I'm gonna drink out of underwear bro I'm these your underwear as a fucking filter no and dude you're gonna be doing DS they're just gonna be ripping each other's underwear off and using them over a filter put it over a glass and drink right through your underwear how did that cat coffee get found out that won't be long good idea cuz I'm an asshole decided to pick cat shit and fine beans in it it's a it's a cat like animal right it's called a civet yeah you got ya ever have that shit that Kopi Luwak coffee no it's very expensive Tate and I got it once when we're at a gig in Florida Tate yeah looks like a hundred-dollar cup of coffee or something stupid it's really ridiculous not that much maybe okay well remember when he was bodyguards new home yeah back in the day yeah that's the animal look at that thing so that thing eats the coffee beans it shits them out and then people pull it out of the poop it looks like a little things baby like the thing from Fantastic Four it looks like it's baby yeah they pull those beans out of the poop and then they they dry them off and make coffee out of cat shit and it tastes delicious because what it is is that that that's gold right there's gold coming out of that cat's ass hole look at that that is ridiculous you just see that online um taking a large look if that was a person you'd be in jail all right if you if you went and googled that person shitting on a log like that you'd be like you sick fuck long as it's an animal it's fine to look at their shit and even mine it they mind their shit for beans the idea is that the the digestive enzymes from the civets body break down the beans the coffee beans that's the idea and you liked it it's okay don't you wasn't better that's not bad out here for the guests it's not better the idea is that it's supposed to be smooth soon this cat shit coffee smoother I don't know man I don't necessarily think it really is smoother it's just different some weird shit I wonder if you could just eat the cat shit just like that without cleaning it off if you were really nasty ya natives probably just used to eat the cat shit directly probably did but I think you need energy you probably need to boil it that's why when you're making coffee in that boiling water probably kills all the bad stuff mmm you know they blow did Indians boil shit no I don't know who invented that shit and how long it's been around that shit literal literally who invented that coffee how long spin around spinner I'm looking at right now Wikipedia since like the 1800s mmm they noticed that these particular animals were eating specific cherries or whatever that they were leaving around and that they were going undigested so at some point I decided to clean it off and see how it tasted I guess that makes a fuckin risk I was listening my friend Ryan callaghan's podcast today it's a cow's Week in Review and he was talking about this animal that they this bird rather that people eat and they drowned this bird in brandy they take this a tiny bird each one of them that's like just a few ounces and they drowned them in brandy and then when you eat them you eat them whole you need everything the guts you eat the the tissue the skin that's that's that's where it is what is the name of it but how do i how do I pronounce it for de LAN Bunton Bordelon and so when you eat it you put a napkin over your head traditionally when they eat it and as they eat it Bourdain was the first one to tell me about this shit that oh no it was Duncan Duncan Trussell was the first person tell me about this shit and so they in love they soak the bird in Brant they drown it okay they drown it in brandy and then they cook it somehow or another but anyway go back to that picture where those guys are eating it where you could see the go back to the picture with the yeah see how they have those things over their head they put these napkins over their head to take in the aromas and to trap the aromas and they also do it to hide their face from God does the idea yeah kind of people are these I think it's most I think it's Europeans I think it's something that in in France it's popular it's a popular dish and it's it's endangered not endangered now but they're yeah it's ok ortolans could Francis cruelest food be back in the menu as French chefs lobby for Ortolan to be reintroduced onto menus we explain why cooking the rare and delicate songbird is so controversial so that's even grosser right it's a songbird like how they named it a songbird not it's not a little tiny dinosaur no no it's a songbird it just wants to sing for you yeah make the woods bright tweet tweet tweet no man it's a weird little tiny animal says why is it illegal to cook and kill an Ortolan the RSPB list their status as vulnerable and throughout the 1970s and 1980s numbers in France to clydra matically as poachers caught vast numbers to supply restaurants where the bird has long been considered a rare and expensive delicacy some restaurants would charge over 50 pounds for the dish what is that in the euros or pounds pound that's pounds yeah well II think that cost what's 50 pounds it's not like a hundred bucks and not quite but something like that France is League for the protection of birds claimed orgalawn numbers plunged 30% between 97 and 2007 as many as 1,500 poachers catching an estimated 30,000 live birds a year so they're just decimating these fucking things the method of capture and killing them is what's fucked up about it so the hunters catch the birds using traps in the fields they're kept in cages encouraging them to gorge on grain in order to double their size and it said the Roman emperors stabbed out their eyes in order to make the birds think it was night making them eat even more oh okay here it goes and then how are they killed this is where the squeamish look away what is the name this website so we give people that's a Telegraph autograph from The Telegraph what is the name of the article well we'll tell we'll say it at the end how were they killed says this is where the squeamish need to look away traditionally in France the fat and little birds are drowned in a vat of Armagnac I guess it's like a cognac or something what is it Armagnac yeah you're probably dead on okay managing to snuff out their lives and marinate them at the same time killing two birds with one glug as it were it says here in the article French chefs argue that it's not a bad way to die in quotes what the fuck but I suppose it might be less cruel than throwing a live lobster into a pot of boiling water anyway so that's how they drown them and then they cook them and then you eat the whole fucking thing bones and all on the bones puncture your mouth and shit and that's part of it like you taste your own blood as you're eating these fucking things yeah people are weird man you leave them alone for long enough don't get drunk and buy things reminds me of that Andrew Schultz bit that he put on YouTube which one the eating ass he goes if you eat ass you should not complain about other people's food none of that French my friend told me go they you know in Thailand the crickets he goes I eat ass because they're eating crickets cuz they have no food my refrigerator is full so true he's so good dude he's he's so good yeah that's my new favorite dude is awesome really really nice guy too dirty as hell yeah you meet him and when next time he's at the store you love him it's a real comic it's a real oh he's high level yeah you drive a Tony to Train Tony and we're listening to Andrew Schultz oh that's cool yeah I love that he's great and he also is one of the few that is doing the YouTube thing now we decided to release all the shit on YouTube yeah yeah thank God it's giving me some you know entertainment right well it's also very smart for him I mean he's getting millions of millions of views on YouTube he's blowing up yeah oh for sure yeah he's killing it yeah and you know to have it available anytime they say that kids watch 50% of Netflix on their phone fifth percent at least that was this I think that was the numbers they gave me um I think that was what they said about my special 50% across the board for what it take take your pick remove Netflix YouTube 50% to its 50% website 50% but that's the the switcheroo though is 50% watched on their phone that could be watching on the computer but how many of them watched on their TV like with YouTube it's probably pretty small percentage right it's which is because they that they're tracking this they splinter up between like an Xbox or ps4 smart TV or I watch YouTube on my TV yeah there are that shit yeah I do think that sometimes I mirror that and I also there's a YouTube one of the other apps it's built into the TV I bought so you can get Netflix right from your TV you don't have to have an Apple TV and YouTube right from you TV it's um it's interesting how big it is now it's so big YouTube's gigantic they got a bunch of movies on there now I was watching it on my TV and just like scrolling through to see what I could what it was gonna give me and as they were making their own ads yeah they were making their own movement but it's weird like it seems like you don't know where to search like what did you just go into the search bar and just search just type things not really my subscription I subscribe to certain people and I just go to this boom yeah yeah I know I do that too but I mean like if they make a movie like they were making movies so how do you find that movie right in your face they own that shit but if it's a movie that they make like I wonder how I would like to know the numbers like have they how many times have they done that cuz they made youtube originals right like they may they finance their own most of our shows like like the the one that I know has done the best is that Cobra Kai gets second a third season I think it's not weird though could they get into the production side of it like they're already a place where people produce things and then put them on YouTube and YouTube's like yeah we're gonna make our own shake yeah why not but then they become something different right cuz they're gonna they're gonna favor their own stuff above your stuff if you make a movie - yeah they haven't made like why bother I think they just wanna I mean I think that's what every company every company gets into this position where they have to constantly expand they got to constantly be kicking ass you know and no one wants to be stagnant they don't want the quarterly earnings to be the same a quarter that's that's a bad sign they want to be out there killing it right don't they think like that like every company thinks like that the NBA Finals is currently sponsored by YouTube TV that's on normal TV they're broadcasting watch TV on YouTube TV which is pretty counterintuitive I have it mmm yeah I have YouTube TV every now and then you need to watch something on a regular Channel mm-hmm I use it once every eight months barely pay like 50 bucks a month for it never use it well it's so much different though than the network because anybody can put their shit up that's where it gets so weird it's like this is all so new TV is our TV channels that you could watch through YouTube yeah check channel for general oh that's good I'm talking about those youtube originals okay they're YouTube's creating hands yeah those are different things but it's just what percentage of the views what percentage of the the eyeballs of America does YouTube have kidding hum okay let's just go the lone super giant what is the would the low number is how many people everyday don't watch YouTube I watched YouTube several times a day but what's the percentage of people if you had a guess that don't use youtube at all oh ten I would guess that maybe they probably have 90% of the people's eyeballs it's like the number it technically it's the number two search engine on the Internet as far as I've read do that hurts my bear thing and all that like it's it hurts my brain new stuff but think about how many fucking people must be watching youtube videos around the world it's just a company but it's like so then they're then they're they're they're a network sort of but you're you're allowed they just have terms and conditions so you're allowed to upload and then they have to monitor your shit make sure you're not put anything horrible up no Isis beheadings nothing crazy but anyway what numbers are you talking about how even look one of the funniest videos on yours onra videos on YouTube are you happen they're supposed to be instructionals on Japanese massage mm-hmm it's like supposed to be an instructional this is it's all about an instructional but it's not they take it as far as you can go for YouTube oh you can't go it becomes a porn almost no educationally but no but they do Oh give it allowed to show titties and then there's laid out the nipples no there's YouTube for naked chicks just just I go to YouTube naked chicks though like who's talked about this before he's my question imagine if they had porn if they got right to the part where the people bone like why to the part and then they just gave you like outlines like from then out all you see is like outlines a body's movie you don't see any real dick or any real vagina but you see outlines yeah butts and dicks and vagina feet up in the air and I bet that's all over YouTube I wonder if they could do that you don't gotta change a couple letters and you're on a real website that does that for real like huge is your porn exactly yeah yeah yeah but I'm saying on YouTube like what are the terms and conditions is there like could you get right to the point of people actually having sex and then just all sudden just becomes not even an animation just becomes outlines you see people kissing long as they don't outline dicks almost gonna have fake dicks and vaginas like height shots on you go tight shot to the chest back the shoulder how far in all all that is just outlines just a black screen with like white outlines of bodies on a bed it's the audio is audio illegal that's a good question yeah is that illegal okay what's the terms of conditions for you can do a lot of stuff with it I don't know what point a couple years ago they added a like age restriction right sort of things so you could probably do that but it'll get marked 18 and older only or some well here's the reason why I asked twitter has porn straight-up porn and I asked Jack Dorsey about it and he's like yeah we Twitter allows porn they allow porn Wow so you can be flipping through and someone's discussed cool porn on the biggest mean it's got to be if not the biggest social media platform on the planet or if it's top two right if it's not number one every I'm never on Twitter what is number once Facebook Facebook's number one are you still are you on Twitter WAIS put things up there like read feeds occasionally read someone's feed if they got they post interesting stuff I think snapchats but I I avoid it for them I just don't have the time and yeah I only have time for instance so snapchat is higher well either way it's closer either way it's GI and it's giant I mean it's enormous and they allow porn which is kind of crazy cuz like I know they're not as big as YouTube in terms of like total minutes watched of things and the thing is that most of what Twitter is is texts most of it you know so when they have porn it's not it's like a fraction of what the whole thing is whereas if YouTube had porn it would very quickly become most of YouTube like if YouTube just had porn people would blow a fucking gasket cuz kids are on youtube all the time did your son get on YouTube and look in those no somebody has all shown but he's not yeah he's like he's too young to get on the internet did they look at little kid stuff there's a lot of little kid content and that was one of the way he said people were getting kids to watch so they can make a DREV anew see those weird fucking videos they would find so like kids would be watching like wily coyote cartoons and they watch some Mickey Mouse type cartoons and then all of a sudden it would be like these cartoon superheroes that were babies and they were getting drunk and they would fall and cut their head open it was like what the fuck is this and there was like hundreds of them and if they had made it like with a formula just so that they could catch kids in these algorithms that recommend the next video and play the next video so it eventually get to their video because it would say you know like someone from frozen with spider-man I can have those names in the title Elsa Elsa from frozen and spider-man this like is a large something happened that we don't that we missed I've heard about this recently - that's why I was actually pulling it up this is a really large YouTube channel and there there's some sort of like inside joke going on - look at this spider-man ten million eight hundred and seventy thousand 172 views what the fuck there's so many views if listen if a television show on CBS got that they would be doing fucking backflips they'd be like look at all the views we got this is amazing you know this is spider-man and Elsa so weird it's not illegal to do that to use that with a title is that a trademark spider putting spider-man I find all of them they can't find all they try they I think they take some of them down it's an AI that does that I think so yeah just their spider-man spider-man but I think they're getting away with that because they were in a costume I think maybe you could get away with wearing a costume yeah I don't know where those laws change if it's been how many parodies Spider Man is like at this point public domain the name or something no way because then other people would be banging out spider-man movies you imagine that if someone didn't own spider-man if anybody can make their own spider-man movie if spider-man was just like an archetype hero but you know what maybe right hmm like there's some she's gonna put out a video like if you wanted to you know talk some shit on Burt Reynolds or have you could put Burt Reynolds and they can't any that's legal right just putting his people's names on the title right but but that's not what that is that's like they're making a video using copy written characters that someone created like Elsa from frozen in spider-man yeah for sure I feel like they probably got away with it because they were dressed up as them rather than like drawing them like if they had footage from the movie or animation they probably all have that shit copy written yeah but you could probably get away with if you have your own script and you make some stupid play with Elsa and spider-man you probably get away with that I don't know though man it's it's weird they're all like trying to figure out what you can and can't do you know what what what can you not and so these companies that are making these weird fuck and that that was a people one where there's people most of them that I saw before they they purged them more animated there are weird animations where I was always a baby and the baby did fall and cut their head it was fucked up like the same image would happen over and over again there was these websites that were analyzing it they're like what the fuck is this like why is this baby fall and cut his head and like all these different versions of this same sort of story with different characters it was just like a like a they had a pattern that they could stick it into so whatever the character was was Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck or they're always drinking and they've fallen hit they're fucking had this weird weird shit but they would get millions and millions and millions of views so someone was raking in the dough from advertising revenue from that I had a friend who dated a girl that ended up coming from a family of Satanists whoa yeah broke up with their it's a long story but it's it's a very interesting story that they have a direct line to Satan no they broke up they were together for a couple years and shit came out she's like multi-personality Satanist family father all that shit and then they broke he broke up with her naturally and but they kind of kept in contact and the last he heard she got a job programming children's TV at a large company there's a pretty good friend of mine he's he's not bullshitting mmm but that's scary bro did you see that preacher that got confronted by Inside Edition what is his name Copeland Kenneth Copeland bro it's hilarious I don't know how much we can show this because this will absolutely get us pulled this dude got confronted by Inside Edition they're doing these stories on these preachers that use the donations from their flock to buy private jets and live like a baller and so she asks um you know is it true that you said that you don't want to fly commercial because you don't wanna be stuck in a tube with demons and he first of all he got caught off guard and he kind of was chilled at first but then he got mad at her when she asked that same question again he said no and that didn't end don't you bring it up and don't you say I did that's what he says and he points out her and this pull it ahead a little bit because this is the full version of this pull it there's a that right before that right before that right before that like she asks him what is he an evangelist yeah yeah he was a big tech now we can't because we'll get pulled off of YouTube for sure but he gets really fucking mad at her she said and but didn't you say didn't you say that you can fly commercial because the tube is filled with demons do you think that people are demons like this lady has balls of steel cuz this guy's giving her the crazy eyes and he's saying all kinds of crazy shit there's some questions she also asked about like why did it why did you buy it and he's like could because he made it so cheap yeah that's like 980 dollars he made it so cheap it's like I couldn't say no that's what he says plain wasn't it was ty was the best yeah yeah made it so cheap okay that's it really seen it right there I had to buy it yeah he can't can't play it unfortunately but play it right after that no this is where she asks him again he's getting frustrated with her this is where she asked him again about demons now watch him get mad here hold up but you can't play it because if you get they fuckin hear they hear they'll yank as' do it Jamie doesn't matter man whoever owns this content don't play any of the audio so he gets mad at her and she's about to say it she's gonna go but I'm sorry but didn't you say but didn't you say right before it yep right there so watch this she goes didn't you say that they were demons no look at this don't you say that I did look at that look at that bro that's intense and then he tries to charm her st. risers charmer that to me is what I would imagine a demon would look like if you cornered it like be realistically tell me back up back up right there there's a little bit before that but little bit before please actually angry a little bit before that watch when he gets actually angry like if you thought the demons were real what would you think that they would behave like wow they would just pretend to be people and be all slippery what's happening here okay back up so we could see him do it though back up so we could see him do it so right here she asked him I'll watch this watch this no don't say that I did and then watch this [Music] smile just let it play stop fucking around watch this look at that face oh I'm your friend again I'm just an ass preacher his hand looks like that Hobbit foger looking at bro his nails are long as fuck just like Satan I would imagine Satan is not over manicure Eddie hey thoughts no no it's that dude caught a sweet loophole tax-exempt status that's what's really interesting about church's tax-exempt baby they're doing the government's work the government's like you doing such a good job keeping these people in line here you go free free no taxes bro you're good you're good like imagine the government looking at televangelist going well seems legit you definitely have the Lord's words in mind and definitely not making a ton of money in the loophole so yeah yeah for sure keep that tax exempt status seems good seems super solid imagine imagine that like somewhere someone must have had that conversation whether or not they should have tax-exempt status like at what point in time you know like how about the Catholic Church how many sex scandals how many pedophile scandals does it take before you lose tax-exempt status is there like a million how many cases how many cases do you need I get what point in time do you go hey maybe you guys should fuck it and least pay taxes you know maybe that's the deal that cut your child odd for the kids but you got to start paying taxes well they're not prosecuting because people aren't screaming for it what's really interesting is that if you look at some of the things that people are really rallying about today what you would call like social justice warriors people are rallying around so many different causes those those people that are rallying around all these causes supporting and Tifa doing this you know protecting this and going after that what they're not doing is going after that church how come they're not shouting from there if you really want justice if you really want to do good in the world when you want to stop the pedophiles when you want to stop that if you didn't you don't see that scary for people so big they got their own country the Vatican is basically a country they have their own passport it's dark it's dark when people look like that they feel like they're doing progress and then you know do you not stop in that you're not you know like your concern is what what's your concern the sculpture of the resurrection has seen that no it's supposedly it's supposed to be Jesus rising from the dead but it looks like zombie looks it looks like hell and see that yeah the sculpture of the resurrection yeah dis mm and then they got a serpent Cathedral where it looks like a serpent head it's crazy stuff you've been no but I've seen it on YouTube you've been an idiot it'll ya know you should go do it is insane it's so insane the Vatican is so insane it's absolutely worth the wait up you went into the Vatican yeah it's amazing the artwork is off the charts you can't believe it st. Peter's Basilica that's it right there who fucking me yeah that's supposed to be it's something about bro that looks represents Christianity in front of Marilyn Manson's house this is their beautiful people yeah make a great photos that would be an amazing gate right if you like the ultimate horror fiction writer like if Stephen King bought a house in the Hollywood Hills yeah that was his gate look up of this the resurrection feed there's a serpent Cathedral Vatican that's if that's crazy dude it's looks like a snake so there's a there's a thing in there called Saint Peter's Basilica man you know you've never seen anything yeah that's their life right there right so look at that looks like come on man that's crazy come on man that's crazy it has the eyes of a snake the head of a snake and the fangs that is very very you can see that resurrection thing right come on come on that's amazing that's amazing dude if you were dating a girls like Jesus right there dude I don't see Jesus anywhere if you were dating a girl and she's really into witchcraft you'd want to fuck her right right in-between baby I want to take you to the Vatican where sneak away I'm gonna bribe somebody that's scary imagine they just had a bed that you could borrow and what if what if the Pope is really the king of the world let him out there what's crazy what if he is though he might be you might be the most powerful man so let me ask you this what do you think about all this alien shit that's going on right now all this UFO shit what do you think that is you think that's a distraction the stuff that's going on right now sighs it just got d-class they're trying that's what it is the thighs the D class are you kidding that's gonna bury a lot of people go to jail so you think that's why the UFO stuff is out there they've it's always been about UFOs really since they do that like they have certain UFO cases that they say listen if anything gets weird we're just gonna let this motherfucker loose whoo and we're gonna tell people listen we've seen the aliens we've got a hold of them we've got to alert Congress we got to talk to people and then people start just forgetting about corruption forgetting about the BP oil spill forget about whatever the fuck is dude the aliens are coming you trust me yes they've been talking to the government you know what my argument against it has always been why would they talk to the government if you're from another fucking planet like wheat when we visit chimpanzees we don't say hey who's the number-one chimp we want to bring you bananas and sign a peace treaty with you we don't give a fuck who the leader is yeah you don't get special deals yeah you don't get special deals oh the top chimp made a deal to let us kidnap some baby chimps so we could bring them to the zoo you know who the fuck out of here if they're coming here from another planet they must be so much more sophisticated than we are they're not going to listen to us we're crazy they're doing it for several reasons in my opinion and and one look exactly like you said when there's four distractions and right now they're going heavy with it but you know Wernher von Braun the last four years of his life he had cancer and he had an assistant and you watch it on YouTube talk her name is dr. Carol Rosalyn and she said that he kept telling her over and over because they're preparing like on his deathbed they're preparing for a fake alien invasion oh that's what they did they're trying to scare us into a new world order and she talked about this huh no no she doesn't say why he goes he never told me why he just kept telling me they're all the stuff you hear about aliens and asteroids it's all fake first there's gonna be a environmental threat that they're gonna scare everybody with global warming is my opinion in my opinion then there's gonna be asteroid threats and then the final one and she says this and he kept saying this is the final one the last one they're gonna do is the fake alien invasion that's gonna that's why there's movies like Independence Day it gets everyone used to oh we're all gonna let's call China and Russia and we all band together and recall it's it's to get us prepared for a new one-world government that's what it's really all about the aliens and all that the Nazis were doing that to their own people they made in the when I was balls-deep in the UFO community we would you know they would they would show us that you know there's pictures of the German UFOs and in the UFO community we looked at that is evidence that they must have found crashed UFOs and then they're trying to reverse engineer that's what everybody in the UFO community thinks but when you look into it dude they were trying to scare their own people to look for the government they're just science fiction had flying saucers before flying saucers were something that the government or the German we you look at the time and on the tried to create so yeah I think they were trying to freak people out and make it seem like it was a lurch yes exactly so so World War two is over we didn't have Operation Paperclip look Operation Paperclip from 1945 1946 we bring in over all right the guys that ended up creating the CIA and NASA were from Operation Paperclip so right away short NASA so when you look at this if the Nazis we're trying to scare their own people with fake UFOs they must have came in and said dude you guys aren't on the UFO shit you got a scare your people so that's exactly when all the comic books were all these so the Germans were scaring their people with UFOs before the United States really yes this is the 30s that is listen if you're gonna be a master of propaganda like Hitler was right yes manipulation and propaganda that would be the movement who who wanted to control the world more than that guy that guy knew how to do it and it's an old idea it's an old idea the way everybody the old the ancient Roman emperors they all want their up for that one-world government they couldn't pull it off there was no way they could pull it off because the only way to make a new world order actually happen is you got to get the people to embrace it you can't force them into it so you got a mind fuck them to embrace a new world order you got to make them want it otherwise they're not going to stay in their own little truck exactly all the little rulers were gonna like did we deal with one-world government I'm out of a job fuck you so it's impossible but they knew they theorized if there was some kind of alien threat they don't remember Reagan talking about exactly one year in the UFO community you take that Reagan speech from the UN and from the CFR and you look at that as proof that there's aliens but now I look at that when you look at him and like at the CFR he goes wouldn't all our jobs be a little bit easier if there was some sort of threat some extraterrestrial threat he's Don says the rule he's well it's not exactly one I'm talking about a different one he did a many two different suit he was doing it all no that was a bunch of them yeah he was on a mission to get everyone and but but he's like making it sound like humanitarian like wooden wouldn't we'll all her differences just see her diminish if there was some sort of extraterrestrial threat that was getting everybody used to this shit we're gonna come the UN is all of my warning off they they can't do it but now we're approaching the tech we have the technology now with Holograms now we could do it it's always been for hundreds of years they knew that they knew that but they couldn't pull it off how you gonna pull it off how you're gonna do to know how to make that shit or making movies when you imagine what do you say I told you about this last week you said you didn't see it was talking about the military industrial compound oh let me hear that yeah was that free use outsourcing the president right is he talking about space force now you can reassure people you're not looking fo this is Fox News man you can't play this it's the news yeah it's Fox it's like a clip from a fox in the news it's the news though yeah but I think you get pulled for this you know me a plant I won't play it but if the news I always play them okay let me know what saying let me am saying this is my friend Steve Hilton show and don't kid yourself you do have a military industrial complex they do like war you know in Syria with the caliphate so I wipe out a hundred percent of the Caliphate that doesn't mean you're not gonna have these crazy people going around blowing up stores and blowing up things these are seriously ill people I don't want to say oh they're wiped you know Isis but I wiped out a hundred percent of the Caliphate I said I want to bring our troops back home the place went crazy they want to keep that you have people here in why she won't if they never want to leave I say you know what I'll do I'll leave a couple hundred soldiers behind but if it was up to them they'd bring thousands of soldiers in someday people will explain well this is a you do have you whoa yeah that's fucking heavy I'll stop right here now if that was from anyone in any normal person you would say that guy's out of his fucking mind that's a conspiracy there's no one who wants war but you hear that from the actual sitting president of the United States there was no reason to say that like why is he why does he ever reason say that it must be an excuse for why he didn't pull everyone out 100% and that's an that's have really overlooked insight and that's part of the problem is that so many people hate Trump that even when he says something like that that we should listen to because it's coming from the President of the United States while he's a sitting president and why he's talking about pulling people out of troop out of war and people still don't want to listen because it's on Fox News and because it's the president because people so many people hate the president they don't want to hear about this that should be something that's talked about the the D class is about to happen shit you think so well it is a d-class it's about to happen it's you know what does that mean you mean these the closet Iike the FISA applications at the class everything involved in how the Russian investigation started yeah that's the problem they were trying there's evidence and that this is coming with the FISA D class that Trump wasn't supposed to win there's text messages going back between two FBI agents right well what if he went and goes he went gonna where he's gonna Hillary's gonna crush him like a zillion to one and this but what if he does win and these are text message have been released up anybody could do that one I think is so bad folks were back from Pittsburgh we had to go I've been drinking a lot of water lately I'm trying to be super healthy me too man I thought Pellegrino was good enough I thought there's no way those bubbles are good for you you know what I mean okay let's find out what would happen to your body huh if all you drank was Perrier and Pellegrino and that's it no forget about the teeth the overall health of the body so much about the by it's about your teeth that's what that is no but forget about the teeth just water cancer you get but the carbonation is got it I'm doing something to use your teeth it's all its really doing I wonder what are your orders to or something so they can kiss your teeth because of the carbonation it's got to that's gotta be it's just water and carbonation so where's the carbonation is in nitrogen in the water like what's what is the carbonation its nitrogen yeah man I hope it's great for you I hope it passes higher acidity oh my god it's bad for you can't be good right and that's how I was drinkin for a while but I was happy with myself because you know I I feel like you do my time good my vice was coca-cola right so it got me off coke I don't give a fuck about coke I got off and I'll drink coke every now and then but I'm not I used to be like I want it like with the meal if I went out to a restaurant had to have a fucking coke don't but now Pellegrino's it's totally satisfies me I'm good I'm good with it but then I just got away with I just kept drinking just that any think it's better than coke but it's not as good as water I'm gonna go with that yeah got it way better than coke right coke is the worst but why is it so delicious dude some some food you just want a cold diet coke with like if I have a fucking cheeseburger I know I'm already not eating healthy yeah fucking diet coke while we playing games right you know that feeling is that was good enough for me it is giving up with you burger it's it's satisfying but if you're gonna have a burger and fries the best is culture coke you'll work it off in the gym my diet not diet like regular coke regular I don't like regular coke it's too syrupy it's just too hard for me it's just Jamie's cousin Jamie's Midwest Midwest they give it to their babies they put it in bottles and shit pop can bottle or was actually can cook than Chipotle in a bottle yeah but you like to stay at the styrofoam cone only Pauly's got a weird flavor coke that I really like that got me back into drinking a long time ago Chipotle has their own people say McDonald's coke is the best I did a highly disagree it's not all the same not Steph enough then when it's weird yet they have different flavors they send up the strings what differences it's original taste on the label at Chipotle which is weird which thank you you make a deal with coke and you don't know which flavor you're getting let me ask you this do you think Andy Ruiz being the heavyweight champion to bring Mexicans and the rest of America closer together I think so well if he starts fucking everybody up what if he fucks up everybody what if he becomes a man that would be amazing Viva make oh man crazy be kid interesting right like what Joe Louis was or what Muhammad Ali was during the civil rights movement how about that what's his record has he ever lost I think he's 31 and one one loss but it was a split decision to Joseph Parker who's a legit world-class fighter hmm I'm sorry one decision like 29 yeah he's young young guy and he's fucking good man like he's good people get confused because the way he looks that motherfucker throws hands and the way he punches is super fluid everything nasty combinations like way quicker than most heavyweights wait wait quicker really interesting man when you watch him fight like wow so the fights the fight is him versus that bronze bomber guy well I would imagine the fight is the rematch in England and fucking Wembley Arena or some shit in front of a million people that's probably have to be the rematch and if he fucks him up bug him which man I don't know what happened in that fight but fight Tyson Fury - right oh yeah for sure yeah he could fight Tyson Fury I mean Andy can fight Tyson Fury and he can fight Deontay Wilder but the big money I think is in the rematch that's probably the big money is and then that's the problem with that is man all of a sudden that heavyweight division looks good it's good oh it's great right now this is as good as the heavyweight divisions been in decades it's amazing right now but the most exciting is de'aunte because de'aunte flatlines people with one shot in this crazy way and he's just built like he's built like a giant Tommy Hearns almost like you know when he just he just got crazy power man his power makes me just put my hand on my head and go what the fuck you think Francis and Garnica box I know he could box like with the table at the top level no I mean I think he could with training but he's a little older too you know Francis is Helen how old is Francis I want to say he's 34 he started fairly late in life learning how to fight in period but he's so big and so powerful man what is he 32 32 that's young let's be young he's he in my opinion is the most dangerous one punch guy I've ever seen he if you make any mistake with that guy heavyweights just go flying across the room I think of Francis and Ghana versus Andy Ruiz would be big and Ruiz is a way better boxer so he's a way way way better boxer it's a big difference so any any says it 100 amateur fights people would see it just like people want to see Floyd Mayweather vs Conor McGregor yeah but it's kind of the same in the same way that you know you know Connor Gregor knocks people dead in the UFC and you know Floyd Mayweather's the greatest boxer of all time of all time I mean he's probably the most skillful defensive artist we've ever seen and you know Floyd can't hit a couple of times the thing about Francis and gana is I think even with big gloves you can't let him hit you like that if he gets it like if Floyd the way Floyd got hit with that uppercut by Conor kind of just kind of placed it there he popped him it was a good shot but Floyd didn't get wobbled he didn't get dropped if Francis hits somebody like that I don't give a fuck who you are if he hits you with that Alistair Overeem left hook that he hit Alistair with get the fuck out of here no one surviving that he just seems like the way he knocked out Kane we clipped him with that little short uppercut and Kane seemed like he didn't even know he hit yeah I think he hits stupid hard like crazy ridiculous off the charts hard I think when he hits people they're just like what in the hell the only guy who's been able to survive that shit is Steve Bay and of course Derek Lewis but they just didn't do much to each other in that fight everybody else he touches you with that shit and you just go flying he hits so goddamn hard that if he just went into boxing straight and said at UFC who the fuck knows man he could be the fucking heavyweight champion in the world like legitimately if you stop and think about how quickly Deontay Wilder went from boxing to earning a bronze medal in the Olympics it was a year and a half meanwhile there is exceptionally talented exceptionally powerful unbelievable one punch knockout power but so is Francis like if Francis has chosen to go that path one fucking nose man who knows if he learns how to wrestle well it really learns how to wrestle and really learns how to submit people you imagine like where everybody has to stand with him because you're scared of him on the ground yeah I mean he's at 265 pounds natural and shredded the way he is with unbelievable power that's just a super unusual case that guy could have any any combat sport if you went into kickboxing shit be fuckin everybody up she's hit so goddamn hard he hits people you just go in yards whoa it's hard to learn jujitsu once you're already famous that's a tongue there just draw the tongue yeah that's tough because the only way to learn jujitsu correctly is with a hundred percent sparring and you don't do that with your wrestling with wrestling but you can't go hundred cents barnwood wrestling because there's no you don't do that what you're striking yeah you don't do that with your striking not that much yeah yeah but it's policy once you become famous it's very hard to go 100% with just anybody you know what I mean it's there's a lot on the line yeah it's possible but it would have to be well engineered by a really good manager right like someone like a Dan Lambert and comes along and says this is how we're gonna do this we're gonna take this as a project and we're gonna bring in wrestlers and these guys are gonna specifically work with you on these very specific drills you're gonna help you get up and help you stay up and we're gonna we're gonna this is what our job is our job is now this we're going to turn you into the heavyweight champion the world but it would have to be like someone who had like a real specific group of guys that knew the goal and there was no Eagles involved so it wasn't you're not gonna bring in some guys gonna try to out wrestle them or hurt them or knock them out or do anything they they were there they're working for the goal but that's hard to do you know everybody has their own ideas you know that's one of the real problems that fighters have at a really high level is finding people that you could train with that are commensurate and skill level but they're not trying to take you out you know to aid each other like imagine imagine if mark Kerr got balls deep in the jujitsu and got oh man he would have been he would had a longer career that's for sure and you know if he got good on the back come on you see that with wrestlers every now and then like after six seven years you see it like oh my god they're taking the back now they're choking people out you saw that with John Fitch you know took a while he he was just cool with ground-and-pound just you're getting the takedown and then slowly start you started seeing him pass and and take backs and then he took sacks Anthony Smith choking out of customs yes of crazies up they did it with a broken hand yeah yeah man that was I was pretty crazy a fucking dude is the real deal yeah he's the real deal how did the John Jones fight go I don't remember John Jones just outclassed him he was ahead of him he knew what he's gonna do before decision yeah five rounds five rounds yeah okay dominant decision John just I mean he wobbled or knocked down he got hit I mean he definitely got hit he got he took some shots but he was fine at the end of it early in the fight though he sho he looked very smooth very fluid in the first round he looked very good very composed considering world title fight against John Jones I mean everything he did when he's moving he wasn't exploding he wasn't blowing away any nervous energy fought very technically very good technical stand up and just look John is just John John's on another level there's everybody else then there's John Jones it's another level he knows when you're tired too he you see him when he senses like any any time were you trying to catch a break he senses it and he starts ramping it up and moving towards you and kicking your legs so you see it smells blood he smells blood he's a fucking straight-up killer man he just knows there's a lot of aspects to his game that are very interesting but he just knows how to feel where a guy is he knows the distance in terms of like knowing how to feel where a guy is in terms of how far away the guy is from him because he's the best ever at utilizing his long reach but he also knows where the guy is psychologically you know he knows when guys are physically tired know who's he fighting next he's gonna fight Thiago Santos I don't know too much about how my god that guy throws brags more of a striker the register oh yeah a way more way more what he's got a giant hammer tattooed on his chest he knocks people in another dimension he's a beast man legit beast what is that um that's uh it's not August it's not August in LA I think that's the Anaheim card I think am I making that up it's great fuckin fight though great fight for as long as it lasts who knows you know that guy he can knock anybody out just swings wild but John should be a heavy favorite going into the fight John fights on the July card oh it is a July card oh my god that's right deep Bay and that's right that's where used and I'm steep and DC John Jones versus taco Santos see that anyone oh that was on steep in DC's design yes I don't know arrow and Paul Acosta is also rebooked for that that's Anaheim as well right Yoel Romero Paul Acosta best body ever fight that's they're fighting for the best body ever that's what they're doing but who's the king did he win some sort of asset yes well Yoel might never fight again he want twenty seven million dollars like I give up howdy cuz there was a supplement company that had tainted supplements legitimately they tested them independently and they found out this shit is it's tainted and makes people piss hot for steroid tests mm-hmm so he sued him the question is whether or not he's gonna be able to correct collect rather because you know when you sue someone they can go bankrupt like if they're a corporation that's why someone forms an LLC so if they've got some steroid tainted shit and an athlete Susan I wonder if they actually have to pay or if one that they could just disband the company cuz twenty-seven million is a lot of money you know who knows the company might not even be worth twenty seven million I don't know what the company is do you know what the company is what's the name of it gold gold star performance mmm that's a big name I've heard that name before have you heard that name before I think that's a big name and supplements you know a man's anything will blow him up it'll be worth it just Pam we're gonna make a hundred million because people are gonna jump on it you know what I mean like people don't write professionally oh shit we do it yeah that's true right give me the shit that Hector Lombard pissed out for yeah 100% that shit I got that shit son you're gonna get a thick old neck what's up Jamie they got what if this is the right company I just looked up when I tried to type in the revenue they're doing all right yeah how much they worth I don't know if this is the right company but the one I just found says they did I had a cash balance of ninety six point five million as of December 31st give up twenty seven million to the Cuban baby not be the actual same company but it's got this name at least I bet it's that company let's say it is that company come on give up that money I want to see Yoel Romero covering first gold chains and shit it's living like a pimp well I want to see y'all Romero in like some sort of crazy gazelle skin coat with like full six-pack just no minks right makes it be better like something something crazy just 27 million in the bank not giving a fuck 20 girls around yeah they'll start rapping and Cuban he's the freakiest athlete I've ever seen he moves so fast sometimes you like like what like he you know when he fought Chris Weidman I remember when he landed that flying knee I was like oh my god that guy could do that out of nowhere out of nowhere you can never sleep on him because he'll he like lulls you into this false sense of everything being okay he moves no you know he just moves slow moves slow he move away when you kick him almost like he's conserving energy and about me just jumps on you it's amazing to see a guy like him at 40 years of age be that fuckin explosive you know you're right at 40 with that lawsuit shit my life fight you might go maybe he wants a fuck up Paulo Costa and that's a wrap and after that fight but if he actually gets the money that's the problem see it's all bullshit until the money's in your bank account yeah because if they appeal and you know dragon in to appeals court which they probably will right take years to take yours yeah yeah then the meanwhile if they have that money they could just invest that money and just make itself back and then give them what they invested with that here here's your money didn't cross the shit I could do that - as long as it's long enough maybe they have like 500 million that 25 million the whole supplement world is a weird world it's very weird you know we had problems with the on it with alpha brain early we are alpha brain had other shit and then with different vitamins and they weren't supposed to be in there like what is this and that we had to change suppliers it's tricky man when you're making stuff and you're not there for every step of the way you hire companies to do it like how are they doing it how are they mixing it what's the the VAT like they clean that shit you know and then somewhere down the Rhine like Tim means he was another one number Tim means Tim the dirty bird it's a bad motherfucker he same thing pissed hot for some shit that was just some over-the-counter stuff they found it but they think of him like six months I think they gave you a long time too though didn't he make him like six months or something like that I think they gave him a long time it was like six months which apparently is worth twenty seven million twenty seven nice number two men six month suspension yeah whatever if he gets that 27 million he won't give a fuck about that six month suspension have you had twenty seven million clean in the bank that you don't have to pay taxes on is that how it works no you gotta pay taxes do you when you get a lawsuit that seems some of them are dedicated like why not it seems it seems ridiculous why would the government keep that why would the government get a piece of you getting your every I know but isn't that nuts they get up but that's funny like they've ruled that you got damaged so someone has to give you money to make up for all the money that you lost you lost 27 million dollars worth of Revenue we're gonna make it right ul so they give them that 27 million dollars and the government's like not so fast you might have lost 27 million but we didn't get our piece I bet you have to pay taxes if you didn't have to pay taxes on things imagine how few people would pay taxes you know it would be like if the IRS wasn't so fucking ruthless chasing people down it would be like those things we you bought 99 records for a dollar remember that when nobody ever paid for it the yeah yeah they would send you the cassette penny yeah it was like a penny and you get like you need to pick these they get to pick this oh REO Speedwagon who Billy Joel the stranger and you get to check off the list in the no one ever pays no one paid I don't know a single person that paid they try to chase me down maybe they didn't want the money they just wanted to spread the music maybe they did maybe was a scam maybe they had insured themselves against a certain amount of loss and certain amount of suckers paid because they did harass you a little bit they'd send you letters like hey man since you all those kiss echo sex yeah you having got back to us yeah remember that did you do that Janet Columbia House it was close yeah Club Columbia send you shit like a box but she ate it one like I don't want Holly notes was it Columbia House records Columbia Records house it was a club there were always a TV guides always an insert dude that's the first time I found out about well it's actually late night TV about sigh Dianetics I didn't know Dianetics with Scientology I thought it was like you know you gotta kick ass take on the world get away from your insecurities and your fear they drag you in a little bit first they drag you in with a volcano and smart they're showing the volcano and the commercial that's way better than then like those dudes you see it freeway overpasses that are screaming Jesus says Jesus there's like dude nobody from doing this you ain't bringing nobody to Jesus man but it's smart you don't tell them you want to get someone into Jesus you don't tell them it's about Jesus you know just war and it's self help the real way to get someone into Jesus is to lead by Jesus's example and be a really good Christian someone says well why are you such a nice person say because I'm a Christian and a real Christian is a really nice person the person be like damn I want to be a really nice person and say well once come to church with me on Sunday and they say you know you go to church with a really aunt that's how you dance how you do it you can't be Jesus on the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and the Brea but then when it corner you don't you say I did you got pretty eyes that's gonna be cut up like I seemed demonic to me man he creep me the fuck out that creeped me out man guys used to tell him people things like that seems to yeah the people point his finger at the long fingernail don't you see I did you'd make a great demon mm not imagine what it must be like to be a fly on the wall one of those billion-dollar preachers just they must be getting pussy they must be oh it has to be right of course has to be top-shelf they have it flying them in from Czechoslovakia and shit just got the crew that's keying in on a fucking Hill of cocaine it's crazy how yeah they got a bunch of actors and plants and all that shit but it's crazy how they get people to believe it and think they get put in trances and shit and you know some of them of are acting but some of them are like you know there's a certain percentage of people that are hypnotizable what is it you know a percent maybe it's the people that didn't get sucked into pro wrestling pro wrestling could have got him they would have believed that that was real they missed that and they got they got sucked into like the snake handlers do you think because when you go to that you know that those hypnotist shows the scam is that before the show like this considered the scam part he's before the show they go into the audience and they find people that are easily hypnotized right so they bring them out of things they do is they let you be aware that they might call upon you and so just to make sure that your story matches we would like to know what whatever happened to you is there something that's bothering you so that we know that when Cindy the magnificent when she calls out to you that your story matches up with a piece of paper this little weird tricks they deal with yeah they asked them to fill out these forms yeah talk about their childhood that's the psychic that's I kick shit for sure like listen people talk but I'm talking about what preachers do this hypnotist shows yeah they take like a couple maybe they take one problem and they hypnotize them then they wake them up when they make them do weird shit that they don't remember oh yeah dude I saw that before yeah I've seen it so that's real oh it's real so there are people percentage of the population who knows what it is maybe it's ten percent maybe it's 60 percent who knows but there are people that can be put under a spell on under a spell in it they could be in a trance yes or something while they're awake they're awake and they do something under without any control and they don't remember it and then they get snapped out of it yes oh that's real yes that's crates of varying degrees but in its real in live audiences which is particularly weird yeah Frank Santos the R rated hypnotist was a staple in Boston when I was coming up and I was an open mic Frank actually even ran a comedy club at one point in time and it's not his son is a hypnotist now Frank Santos he would do stitches comedy club me and Greg Fitzsimmons and Nick DiPaolo and all these guys we saw him do this and he would do it on a regular basis it happened every week he had one night a week wait and it wasn't just that Club and was one night away we get stitches but it was like one night a week at Nick's comedy stop and one night a week at giggles sorry but he would get a bunch of people out of the audience and he would have a bunch of volunteers who wants a volunteer to get the people on the stage and everybody was like you believe we're here and they would hypnotize me and hit Bhutan's been hypnotized him and do this thing you're getting sleepy gonna listen to me I'm gonna count to five and when I count to five you were gonna be doing push-ups and underneath you is gonna be Madonna and she's gonna be naked and he would do that and it would work on some people the people he was you're not under come on come with me and he would get rid of them but then some people would just be under and you'd be like this isn't real is this real but then you would see your friend go up there you would see someone you knew go up there and you would see people see their friends go up there and what they couldn't believe it and the person was really doing it and you could tell they were really doing it and they'd be so embarrassed they'd be so embarrassed when they found out they did this in front of these people they're like what yeah you came in your pants and like some guys would actually come in their pants they would come in their pants he would tell them I'm gonna count to three and I like number three you're gonna come in your pants one two three you gotta be like oh he'd seem get like super embarrassed these aren't good actors well you could see the embarrassment in their face they were bewildered they were so confused and like what happened how did this happen but it wasn't everybody the probably couldn't I wonder if there's a I would love to see a documentary on people getting hypnotized and like proving the trio and doing different well I got hypnotized I got hypnotized yeah yeah but I didn't get hypnotized to do anything I got him beat up by Vinny shoreman Sherman the mental coach did he make you do things you didn't remember oh no I just laid there I he gave it to me no I laid there and he talked to me while I was laying there and when he was talking to me I knew he was there and I knew I was there and I knew I was just chilling on this couch it wasn't like I was in a trance and I was going somewhere and I was very aware that it was happening but it was like he was put me he was put me in a suggestive state and he was talking to me about various things that I wanted to work on mostly organization and discipline stuff like discipline like getting things done and it would just want something that I'm always concentrating on and then when it was over it was just over I was awake through all of it but it was weird it was a weird state it was like as if like the regular world has like a crazy filter over it like Leestown that's a yes it's hard to guess I would probably say yes and it sounds like you were you weren't hypnotized like that kind of like those dudes that don't remember what no didn't know that but he doesn't do that though and I think other people can do that and I think they do that to some people but that's not what he's trying to do anybody his thought I think and I'm speaking for Vinny but I think that anybody can allow themselves to get into this suggestive state to get in this state of hypnosis but that's different than the kind of people that will think that they really are having sex with Madonna on stage yeah they could tell people that really do come in their pants that's great so those people locked in there's something locked in about them but it was a hundred percent real you think those people the cane are easily hypnotizable can be influenced but there could be hypnotized by something on a TV screen may even is possible yeah mate maybe why not I don't know what that element what is what's causing you to go under you know I'm saying like is it just the words what is saying it is it them looking here Frank Santos was an interesting guy he's a very short fellow and this is coming from a short guy and he had glasses and he's kind of like a big guy and he was heavy you know he's overweight and it just seemed real honest looming and sweet and kind and soft and just hello everybody how are you how are you you know and he just is just talking to you are you gonna get sleepy gonna get sleepy get asleep you sleepy and they were just not off maybe like whoa what the fuck he just knew how to do it and he would do it so calmly and confidently and he would do it every week and every week we would watch some people would work on some people wouldn't work on I wonder if anybody can do it anybody can put someone under trance if they were taught the right way and they maybe you got to do is learn something or is it some kind of special gift there's some I bet it's a skill I bet it's a skill but I bet it's just like having a good personality like some people you want to hear them talk all the time dude what if there's dudes like that the good they date and they're just looking for girls they hit yeah they're just looking for girls I could hypnotize so they go they gotta live when they take him home make him do all sorts of crazy shit I knew a guy who was a comic who also worked as an artist and he'd hypnotize people and I remember walking by him while he's talking this girl and she goes no I don't want to be hypnotized what are you saying her oh this is back in the dizzy - what if there was a hypnotist slash comedian that mastered hypnotizing people from the stage and you got him to laugh hysterically at everything so he's just like killing and crushing every night well I think comedy is a form of mass hypnosis it's funny you say that because I think that's what's happening when you're locked in like when you're locked in and everyone's locked into what you're doing in and you're killing there's these moments where it's like the audience sinks minds with you like hypnotism it's very similar because when you're killing there's this feeling that you get where you like it's an energy feeling it's not just you saying something and they think you're so funny so you feel so good it's like you're riding this wave and as long as you practice the material so much that you know where the beats are and as long as you're so engaged in the material that you really are thinking about it as you're saying it you're not bullshitting them you're not just saying the words because they know when you're just saying the words they want you to be fully engaged but there's these moments when you are fully engaged and they know you are and you you're riding this wave together because you know the material so much so that you could be fully engaged but not have to think about what comes next because you know it comes next but you're saying is if you've never said it before and you're thinking of it as if you've never thought it before you're thinking it of it as if you never said it before and they're locked in and it's like hypnosis it's very very similar as far as I know I mean I've never hypnotized anybody but I feel like when you're killing it's a state of mind is like your your your achievements yeah that's why I say that like specials are like at the very best eighty percent of what it's like to be there at the very best it's probably not even close I'm probably being super generous with what a special actually is in comparison to being there live like this sometimes I'll see a recording Emily I thought that was better I thought that was better when I saw it live because when I was live and I was watching the person I was in the room you know I'm soaking up the laughs in the room they're all the people in the room everybody took they took an uber to get there they got drinks there they're excited they're pumped up the guys kill and you're locked in you're in the room with these people you believe you just said that ah and you're all feeling it together at home you're getting a fraction of that yeah you know it's like hypnosis man there's an energy that's being shared you know I mean you've been doing a lot of stand-up now don't you feel like that like when it clicks like there's an energy that's it's being bounced back and forth between two people between you and the audience yeah yeah for sure I mean when it works you know I'm a blue belt in comedy you know what I mean you're like a choral belt red belt you know what I mean you know I'm pulling it off and it feels good even when you just pull it off and everyone's laughing it's great yeah it feels those moments that's why I'm doing it because it's so much fun it's just like what I do after jiu-jitsu I mean I hang out with my my students and we talk about the craziest shit for about 10-15 minutes and then I go home it happens almost every night we're talking about crazy shit and it's the same thing we're making each other laugh and when it works on stage it's that times a thousand just you know when people are laughing and everything's working it's great obviously when it's not working and they smell blood and you're not feeling what you're saying and kind of just going through the motions and that happens to me you know I'm still new in the game that sucks yeah that's horrible that's horrible but luckily the first year you know I was just trying to figure out what the fuck was I was gonna do trying to structure my sad I smoked I smoked weed before I went onstage I don't do that no more I go on stage just clear clear mind it and it's way better because it's easier to remember all all the material or not stone you know eventually I can you know go back to smoking weed like you before is that because I've gotten the structure down so well that I could just go up there and it's like you know yet when I teach and I do a seminar I got that shit down online well I really like to in sober October I really like not smoking before shows yeah it's fun it's fun to do it's different have a cocktail you know what I mean I couldn't even do that it's so brougt over everything sober I like you know having to drink and then you know maybe a cup of coffee my blood going up boom like before I teach I have some coffee you know I walk around that's one thing I just stretch out move around shadowbox yeah I get my body loose I just want to get the blood pumping I just want to feel looser physically it's hard to know like when though you know like what's when is it looser is it lose it right now and just kinda just I just saw have just a bunch of things that I do I just start throwing knees loosen up my arms you know stretch my back out stretch my legs out you know when it works though man when you're just like connected with the audience what I felt that the most so far was in Houston they almost a year ago and just for some reason man that crowd was very nice Saturday night yes I caught a wave they were all waiting to scream they could as soon as I walked onstage they were already laughing I didn't say anything they were just all ready to go yeah this was there with Priscilla's his fiancee and it was it was that was the best night so far I mean as far as connection and um man you know you're chasing that you always want that you know you always want that same high and then the next day in Austin man wasn't it was the opposite we talked about this last time you were here yeah you had a rough set on Sunday I'm going I'm good you know it's good for you can I throw a little Houston plug not this weekend but next Friday June 14th me and Sam Tripoli are doing ten for that comedy Friday in Plano Texas which is uh just outside of Dallas and then Saturday June 15 were back at the secret group in Houston that's where I had that was my favorite night so far so hopefully we could do the same thing again I'm keeping my fingers crossed but beautiful man that I'm really looking forward to going
