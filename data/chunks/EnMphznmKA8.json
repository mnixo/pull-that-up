the Joe Rogan experience and davidenko did you know we did our saw our set and then he played and he was on stage and he performed a song my mama wrote called storms never last so my mom's over on the side of the stage and you're talking me my mom we're watching it and he's singing it with his wife and stuff the next night I'm opening up for him and he goes on stage and he goes last night Jessi Colter was right in the front row when I sang this song with my wife and she was crying and like I'm sitting there going I was here and she was not crying she was dangerous because she was not on the front row right right my mom just killed her read this song storms Everlast easing and and that's his character that's who he is all I'm saying here with like I'm as forgiving about him lying to the audience because that is what he's doing at the moment it's his I could sit there and go you know what you're lying I'm gonna take you in the back we're gonna talk I'm gonna tell this audience tomorrow night he's a liar he's a piece of shit fuck him I'm not gonna do that because it's David alko is but you just did it on the show which is I'm not much larger audience I'm just saying I do you character but why would I do that to him because it's like you know and trashed it I just feel like look man the times that I met Alex the times I've been around him yeah man his gig is this and he got called out for a specific thing yes it involved the lives of children everything that I understand that I'm not I'm not at all sympathizing for the those family or for him versus those families but I'm just saying I just think that like at the moment everything is so hot with this and it's it's kind of exhausting and it's the Internet is the reason for it and in my opinion because I think that like all the years that have come along the mass amount of people that have migrated to social media the way that the integrated conversations happened the way that that stuff ends up on the news now like AOL chat rooms and fuck in 1998 that shit did not end up on CNN people were not listening to those things the the best closest you could get to fucking TV was to Catch a Predator when you were on that write at that time you know and I feel like at this point in time people need again not those families their lawsuit that's fine that's that's their thing but but I just feel like people need to lighten up a little bit in the sense of I just think that the social media thing is very hazardous and I think that people's faith in all of it it doesn't have to do with with fake news and it doesn't have to do with Russian BOTS and all this shit I just think that like Alex Jones is a casualty because he's always been what do you mean another really odd comic David Sedaris story is it he always told me when you're on the road don't read from your current book always read from the next book piece it's the way of road testing the stories and finding out which ones work and should go into the next book and in doing so he was telling this story about being in this this forensic laboratory isn't as an autopsy was taking place and this autopsy table was adjacent to this this huge indoor window that separated the autopsy suite from this lunch room and then the lunch room were the rest of the forensic staff there all eating their lunches they all had tuna sandwiches and and cans of coke and barbecued potato chips and they were watching through the window as this absolutely perfect twelve-year-old boy was being autopsy and just hours before this kid like two hours before this kid had been riding his bicycle he'd fallen over he'd hit his head on the curb and now two hours later he was dead and dead without almost a scratch on him just this perfect naked dead twelve-year-old boy on the autopsy table and as he the technicians eating their lunch watching it through a window the daywatch as the as the pathologist in sizes around the top of the kids face at the top of the forehead the hairline and then peels the face down like peeling an orange peels the entire face off of the skull of this little boy and leaves the face around the neck like a mask like a rubber mask and this exposes this liver coloured dark red musculature of the child's underlying face and this one guy watching it with a mouthful of tuna sandwich he points this out and he says see that that dere that's the color of red that I want to paint our rec room oh shit and when Sedaris told that story in front of 600 people it was dead silent and you could hear people weeping people were crying and they were hating David Sedaris in that moment and so I had to laugh I laughed really loud like a dog and it was amazing how they hatred in that auditorium swung from hating David who they did not want to hate to hating this jackass over here who was actually laughing and so I threw myself on the sword for David and that story never went in any book and like I said you can do that and philosophers like arguing and debating meaning of things for me it's however people are using the word that's the meaning okay I I concede that well we can get things why I don't call myself an atheist it's why you can look up the dictionary definition of atheist and it kind of applies to me but what is the definition of atheist in practice it is what leading atheist do and it's their conduct and it's their behavior that's what they say and it's it's it's their attitude mm-hmm that is what an atheist is today because they are the most visible exemplars of that word and most of their conduct I either don't agree with or simply don't engage in what don't you agree with I don't debate religious people and tell them they're idiots hmm I don't know it doesn't work whether or not it works that's just not it's not in me to do that I I don't purge myself of words that have religious foundations in them I once in my Facebook I had a friend going up in orbit to repair the Hubble telescope one of the astronauts and I said Godspeed mm-hmm and then I gave the astronauts name people wrote in in the thread said I thought you were an atheist how could you say Godspeed an atheist got angry with me and I said okay first of all this phrase is deeply historical in the space program when John Glenn was launched the headline was god speed John Glenn mmm and every mission where we sent human beings into space somewhere there's that reference in the NASA fans word mean I'll tell you I'll tell you what it means please do okay so oh by the way I'll get to that in just one minute I'm the atheist who are arguing that I was using God's speed as a phrase they all have used the phrase goodbye haven't they see you later goodbye what does that word come from it's from God be with you it's a contraction of those three words and why would you say this you would say this to someone leaving the city wall where it's dangerous okay back when you had city-states you're going to get your God be with you to bring protection for you between one city people always ask me to have pictures of my other dogs they're actually both passed away now I had to put them both down both people masters in the English the English bulldogs she Bellino mix they were there both 13 years old and Johnny couldn't walk anymore it was it was really rough the last few days of his life I would try to bring him in for dinner and when I would try to bring him in he literally couldn't make it there's a small yard with where he was at we're talking about like you know 15 yards he couldn't make it 15 yards to the house he would like take a couple steps in his body would shake and he'd take a couple of steps and he was just sleeping all day and he was also having a really hard time shitting and he would occasionally shit in the house like he couldn't hold his bowels and he couldn't go outside when he wanted to look you see him trying but his his body was so old for a mastiff 13 years old is crazy old like a lot of him died like eight or nine and he was 13 and he was a sweet sweet dog up into the end but he just he was you know he was suffering it was it was hard it's hard when you know them when they're a puppy and then 10 years later like you're kind of the same and they're not man they're gone you know it's like I think about that with Marshall because he's only a year and a half and he's so full of life and he's so fun he's so silly and playful and happy I'm like man there's gonna be a day where Marshalls this old old old dog and I'm gonna have to put him down too you know it was depressing and the other one Brutus the Shibui no English bulldog mix he was better than Johnny for a long time still I've known for the last two years that they didn't have much time left you know they were they were both struggling hard but Brutus took a real hard turn over the last few months where he wouldn't even come in like I'd try to get him to come in like come on buddy you want to eat I tried to put a little food in front of his face and he would try to stand up and his legs he'd be shaking and it's just so hard man it's so hard watching them fade away you know and then also watching them suffer you know a lot of the last the last days well you have to decide where you know me and my wife had to have conversations like look we have to do something like this like one day we're gonna come home it's gonna be a dead dog and it's not like they're having a good time like this is a this is a horrible suffering slow demise so did you have someone come to the house who did you take them yeah where's Ralph dude it's rough just ask yourself what problems do I have right now but genuinely like problems and the answer may not always be zero but it's usually surprisingly small when you think about like the immediate you know not the you know the base level of Maslow's hierarchy right you know like like if that's taken care of usually it's like oh I don't read you know there are things that are ongoing things to figure out but like things that you could define it's like a problem and then just kind of staying in that space yeah like you know like a control issue like what's a real issue well where there's like immediacy like you know and and when when there are real problems you know a lot of times you you handle it well like it instinctually the things like a lot of some people get calmed in like those intense situations but you know like they can handle like real problems it's the anticipation of problems and the anticipation of solutions that that's what drives you crazy it's a very good point yeah that's a very good point yeah a lot of times real problems they also sort of enlighten you to the fact that most of the time your problems are bullshit you know you break your leg you're oh this is yeah that's it immediately yeah and so just staying in the space of like you know all right I can you're in a control center you go you know [Applause]
