listen to music it's better you guys were all right how's that cheating I used to say that if you run if you ran running especially running hills is difficult right so you should do it with no music you should be like just zone out let's fucking do the work give it a couple times with music I'm like this is way better yeah I think you're supposed to say you're supposed to hear a little you know something to get you going yeah it's way better it's way better treadmill get on the treadmill just music go yeah you just gotta hear she's long as it's not too loud the thing about running in the mountains is like what if someone screaming for help and you know you're running by it's they're already in the mountains already this Laurel Canyon you know what if you just running up the canyon like to be a good person if they where they need help they need you to help them take an Instagram picture mmm probably in Laurel Canyon right I'm gonna get a good shot I know how many people hike just to get a good shot at the top it's good Instagram photo a lot you can get a lot of likes yeah that's what they go for it they go for the likes hey it's a it's some sort of commodity it seems to be right if you're if you're a girl with a with a nice body a bunch of likes seems to translate into hosting parties for some reason ooh yeah that's right yeah a certain amount yeah you go to a club and it's hosted tonight by well it's the minimalist approach right it's like not only is it not she doesn't display a talent but you also don't even hear or talk right you just see the pictures but just that enough is enough that people are gonna want to go see it takes less and less and less and less to be a celebrity these days that's a strange one though isn't it to be considered a celebrity yeah that's a what's one of the weirder ones the weirder ones is getting down to just being famous for photographs yeah it's they call them Instagram models yeah so there's an Instagram modeling agency but here's the thing am i hater for saying that because I like to look at them out there so yeah set I appreciate someone who's making something that I like to look at right there you go I'm not mad about weird that people would be like fuck these Instagram holes they're big ass isn't okay but don't you want to see those pictures I'd love to see the pictures and those are the guys they're not fucking medicine that you know we're all hypocrites that's just nature right it's the way of the world yeah land yeah that is right and instagrams just it's just such a fascinating thing that people can just show you little images their world hey this is me at the great news maker there look way more interesting than a real man really caught it you know make it look like they're really in vacationing all the time and they have these clothes and they go to the best parties and and I'll meet them and they live in Studio City good for roommates in the studio apartment yeah we all want everybody to think that we're doing better than we are right why is that what's that I don't know because if people think you're doing better then it makes you feel better cuz they treat you like you're doing they treat you like you're at the level that you're fixed fictitiously portraying right right so you know I mean so you get better treatment based on a life you don't really live bright so if you become instafamous like what do you get out of that you could keep you can make a living off that Yeah right see comics doing it all the time yeah there's a Kyle Dunnigan dude Karl Dunnigan blew up because of those little videos that he puts on is you ever see them no fuck you Kyle does face swaps with Kim Kardashian and Donald Trump you've never seen it no oh my god oh my god oh my god

mouth and use other people's faces for the first time like when has anybody ever been able to do that without some great giant studio behind you the fact that he could do on this shit on his phone impressive this is a new feature no no I know you can do it but I'm saying that now it opens up this whole new kind of comedy right that's a new kind of comedy I love it we I mean we know he's not

dangerous you gotta catch him after jujitsu Joey does oh wow all the time man really yeah he's lost a ton of weight to Joey's down I think I gotta say more than 50 pounds oh I kinda I want to know I want to know how much he's lost he's lost quite a bit of weight and he's going to jujitsu on a regular basis yeah he gets into it he's doing more time now - he's doing kickboxing classes Joey Diaz kickboxing Joey Diaz gets down and I didn't think it seemed like it was so shocking when Joey was just like everybody we know you know he used to be a lot bigger man but he's become much more disciplined you know he's really really discipline his nine women the woman no no help scare no I had a kid he had a kid a few years back and that like started the shift to do and then he's just been he's also just been more aware you know you get as you get older like you really do have to take care of your body or it's gonna fail and in my failure if you take care of it you know it's just like you're hedging your bets you least you're making it stronger true you know it's just you got a you got a watch all the all the warning signs you know obviously a lot of excess weight is a giant Leslie Economics it's like we just don't sleep there's a lot of drinking late nights and there's the travel or the stresses dude as you get older to that don't sleep and shit just does not fly your body's like fuck you man body's like I'm going to sleep you can do it what like pitch I'll give you a cold I will give you a cold and then you'll have to lie down you for five I'll give you a fucking three-day migraine it's a weird thing right that balance that you have to have like the moment someone figures out something that you could do where you don't ever need sleep we're gonna have a weird world just coming it's coming you think some kind of pill or something will come in probably right I mean if they have pills that make you make you go to sleep why wouldn't have pills they just figure out oh well this just counteracts all the biochemical responses that your brain creates would it need sleep this way your brain into thinking you're what you're actively you know in the meantime we've actually found through independent studies is that it improves your recovery you actually live better yeah but Chris Ryan just posted some shit yesterday that i retweeted about how they were doctors and scientists were encouraging women to breastfeed and they were gonna do it nationally but it got sideswiped by the formula industry is it to stir that shit that's I believe that 100% because there's always the the other side where we're gonna not make money if this thing gets through but that one right there that is terrible that's it it is that's your your your deciding to give babies less nutrition you're making a decision for profit profit over babies nutrition you're lying to moms it's like big tobacco's big tobacco's you know in banco isn't targeting babies i know and i know it's there's no like there's no supporting big tobacco these you know how many people have died from fucking cigarettes right imagine if that was from something else so many other products like diet coke we have diet coke just killing people left which it is still be a do you think it is of course i'm not sure about that I'm not sure it's not killing people like cigarettes but I think it's not good for you but as far as anyone who ever get like cigarette it out yeah nobody's doing commercials with the thing in the next day and I drink too much diet coke but but if you I guess if you drilled a no and all the chemicals in it and all the different things and all that caffeine if you drank them nothing but diet cokes all they're like 1528 didn't you see it was a VI K YouTube video where they put stuff in coca-cola left it for days and how it the coke dissolves it destroys it I put like a brick in a coca-cola and it just dissolves the brick the blockages crash yeah use that mountain do like it was novio fat juicy cheeseburger and a dr. pepper cold dr. pepper on ice oh my goodness it taste so good why is it the things that taste good or so every most things that are bad for you yeah most things that just that's the but that's like so many things and that's how they get you that's how to get you that's a life get Snickers is delicious yeah way too much sugar yeah how much will you indulge that part of your brain how much will you let that party brain ruin your life that's the thing you have to control that part of your brain self-discipline yeah yeah but goddamn man if you're fun with ice cream sundae I'm just looking at that thing but goddamn hardest thing in the world if it's in front of me eight times out of ten I just go fuck it I just do good most of the time we're talking food of bad stuff in jitter mostly but it looks good for you delicious food look if I'm if I'm holding strong on my diet and somebody pushes some lasagna in front of me and I'm like oh my god yeah I try to do no dairy until I try to do no dairy until I get off a plane in New York City and I'm like there's no way that not having a whole pizza right Fulton Street yeah do you count pizzas dairy cuz of the dough yeah all of cheese right yeah that's right the cheese yeah dairies are weird one of the people right yeah they say that you uh if you eat that raw cheese that your body has a much easier time digesting it raw cheese yeah man they have raw milk cheese the cheese it's made with raw milk as opposed to cheese it's made with homogenized and pasteurized milk I had this friend who was a surgeon from France really smart guy he was explaining this to me once and he had to smuggle cheese over from Europe to America they were terrified they were gonna get caught this guy's a cancer surgeon because the cheese it's Noble yeah because it's illegal to have because they want you to have the bad stuff here well they want it to be safe see there's no bad guy here it's kind of like a double bad guy because what you know but they're trying to do is prevent diseases they want milk to be able stay in the Shelf because like all of our surplus and all this stuff that we have in terms of like grain and food and so forth if we didn't have it and something went wrong it would be kind of sketchy and that's what happened somewhere around World War two that's why we created all this stuff in the first place right that's where things started getting like really weird in terms of stacking things up and surpluses and but milk can't stay raw on a shelf very long that you would lose so much money because things get transported and if it's milk it's got to be local it's got to be pretty fresh but damn if you can get it if you can get it from like a real good like Whole Foods Market or one of those sprouts sometimes has raw milk it tastes better well Whole Foods noun has stuff that's like just as normal as Ralph's yeah yeah it's like Whole Foods that the myth is has been you know exposed well it's the other places like Ralph's and Vaughn's they're becoming more like diverse with their food choices right they're trying to compute hopefully you're putting grass-fed meat in the fryer and stuff like that and organic vegetables yeah they're all because that's the other ones what is it else it's like weird granola and so you know I mean there was like a weird granola I like who's buying this shit weird quinoa section this is an empty section man I like tumbleweeds fried quinoa for the first time was good a couple months ago it's a very good grain I tried kale for first time but you've never had kale no I had dude trying to eat healthy I'll make you a kale shake you'll freak out you feel like you're on drugs really no man just gets you so fired up so much nutrients just getting jolted into your system we got to try this I use kale a giant thumb sized chunk of ginger four garlic cloves a pear and celery yes dude when you're drinking this stuff your whole body's going why in the fuck is all this because it's blended down you don't even have to chew it to absorb it right this is going right in there and getting broken down you feel great but then you better be close to bathroom I was about to say that yeah it's cleaning you out quickly like a fucking tsunami son it's coming at your butthole door it's it went it and then when it goes especially if you put oh that's the other thing I forgot to add you need either coconut oil or MCT oil medium chain triglyceride oil it's essentially an aspect of coconut oil that they extract okay it's just a really strong healthy oil a lot of people put it in coffee and stuff and different different things but it's a it's a good dietary aide but you have to put it in there because apparently as least as it's been explained to me the nutrients absorb in the body better if there's fat mixed in with them so that healthy MCT oil or coconut oil when you put all that stuff in there then it allows your body to process those nutrients better okay but dude you better be close like a sprinter it just tastes good the key is don't put too much MCT oil that's the key that seems to be the difference between making it to the bathroom and having a dreadful result and calling for help from ya Laurel Canyon you might have to call for help duuude healthy I try I try you know I had the vegan friends and I have the friends that you know like to cook and eat in the foodie so I'm trying to walk the fine line it's hard me on the road right it is very hard to eat healthy on the road I try to do I go to Whole Foods I'll try to get like some soup and you know some chips or whatever for the room but I at two at ten or more to the night it shows up at midnight you know ice to hang around and take pictures with the people and now it's one o'clock and I'm starving and there's nothing open then I can get a healthy you know meal from yeah I always bring protein bars everywhere and I bring almonds and protein bars those are two good things to bring actually start doing it yeah it's like it's an easy thing like if you just use it just try to get some nutrition just just to fill your stomach you're hungry just let me just so I'm not hungry anymore almonds are great because just a couple hello to almonds I can't don't listen but how'd you get almonds I don't know I'm allergic to almonds pecans I believe walnuts but not peanuts because peanuts is not a nut really peanut girls in ground the Hallman's pecans grow on trees so something like something weird there where whoa peanuts grow on the ground I did not know that yeah did you know that a peanut is not Jamie didn't know it either that's all crazy all my life I've never thought about a peanut tree like what the fuck's a peanut tree look like I've never thought about that one even though Jimmy Carter I remember was a peanut farmer in Georgia that was like a big thing oh that was his brother wasn't that his brother no he was a peanut farmer Oh Jimmy Carter was he was his family was what they were peanuts all day yeah but I never knew what a fucking peanut looked like like in the ground no idea I thought it was a tree yeah no but even I never even I'm like I could see an R if you said picture an orange tree I could see it picture a peanut tree what the fuck does that thing look like you know I've had way more peanuts that I've had oranges free full of squirrels yeah it would look like right you always pictured squirrels of peanuts say look that's what it looks like so they pull that out of the ground yeah whoa so that's it yeah it kind of grows like that on top of the ground right there yeah Wow it grows on top of the ground yeah I remember picking them with my grandmother back at South Carolina back in the day it really is a trip like some food some of these plants are incredibly nutritious to your body and some of these plants will kill the fuck out of you instantly and nature made people figure it out you get a figured out about trial-and-error island ever imagine what it was like Blowfish that guy I think the first guy yeah hey it's a fish can we eat fish bang go ahead yeah how about those assholes are still decided make sushi out of it if you if you cut it yeah inch to the left oh he's right you're dead like why why not just not eat it no no no like why not just get that one danger that probably doesn't make it taste better you got those chopsticks and you're bringing it up to your lips you know like did this guy this guy's getting old maybe his visions going bad his on same thing cuz he wants to keep his job I don't know this fucking guy and wait yeah like Blowfish sushi that's like the the wing suit of sushi you know those crazy people that jump like my friend Andy stump they jump off cliffs and shit wingsuits that's what that is for sushi eaters I thought it was it was a guy that went through a clue yeah I saw that and I'm like if he misses he's dead it's the dead death there's a lot of videos of those guys dying yeah there was a video of a guy hitting a bridge going like 100-plus miles an hour hit this bridge it was awful I mean fucking awful how yes yeah bungee jumping on you know Will Smith is bungee jumping did you see this video Will Smith he posted a video on his Instagram another guy that has a great Instagram posted a video about how fear I know amazing things are right on the other side of fear yeah so he's been doing this thing where he's just conquering all his fears and he has a group of guys that they're professional bungee jumpers they're bungee jumping on his birthday his 50th birthday out of a helicopter all over the Grand Canyon Jesus yeah this I gotta see that seems like a terrible idea we did a bunch of that kind of shit on fear factor man we did it in the last season in the last season we did a couple of them that really had me freaked out but one of them they hooked people up to these bungee cords and they were had them tied to like a post or something or a tree or something I forget what it was they were shackled this thing was a post and the person had to release them well I figure out which key goes into which lock and it was like a race to do it and as soon as you released um they shot through the air because there was a helicopter holding on to a bungee cord behind him Wow and then they were just dangling over this Canyon like bouncing up and down and I watched the first one like they did a test one and they watched and I was like yeah I mean they know what they're doing I guess they know what they're doing these guys are like professional stunt guys but I was like I would not want to be that person attached to that bungee cord who was the person that came up with these things like I would watch the show I didn't mind the dangerous stuff like that just the eating like every time I'm like how did you know you could eat that yeah they had a whole team you know that won't kill you they know they would do toxicology examinations on certain bugs that grind them up and find out what you know what what's bad for you what's not who's that guy a lot of those people ate food man that they should know how to eat like they would do with interns poor interns nice kids too hard for like well they would you know they were working on production or they're not interns they were I'm sorry they were pas production assistants and they would have to you know do like these really fucking difficult eating challenges if they did it they'd win a certain amount of money did get a certain amount of money I always give them whatever I had in my pocket to they won't leave anything other than a peanut butter and jelly sandwich oh this poor kids like the yeah I was just someone was ridiculous like there's some things you just can't eat you just can't chew it down enough right like you smell you'd be like yeah it's coming up yeah but that didn't scare me what scares me is like the bungee cords under the helicopters type shit that was like how do you know that that's gonna work out right every time I don't know I know takes a bungee cord over that like under full nuts and all that stuff no really yes to bull nuts are just just meat you just eat it that's one of the easiest ones bull nuts would be super easy people love those things they call them Rocky Mountain Oysters I've heard that I've seen it uh one of those cooking shows and they fry them hard look like they look like fried pork rinds and publicist yeah when was that we do with them like yeah it looks like pork rinds did he slice it and fry it up hard oh wow I hadn't seen that I'd seen sauteed and I'd see that were they breaded them they like breaded bulld nuts ready to them and fried them yeah it's apparently people love them there they are he's chopped those up rocky no it's like fried cauliflower yeah man's deuce that's cauliflower you eat it or they say it's calamari you eat it and then your friends like no I'm kidding it was bull nuts see really bothers you that it's bull nuts yeah kinda doesn't bother me at all I think in if you're gonna eat the whole animal you might as well use balls too just out of respect I mean you know the whole thing about castrating them is strange too and they only castrate them because they want them to be that's how you get a steer right like when they make steak right you get it out of a steer that means it doesn't breed like a bowl that they sniped right that's crazy it's kind of crazy say it's just how they say it for the bull sad life unfortunate so like did they they must do that with grass-fed beef - right probably yeah so what's the one they were late with this veal right they put the oh that's in the box yes oh oh yeah if that doesn't bother you what kind of person you what are you doing tip it the calf is that what they have in a box so he can't grow yeah they keep him in the dark and keeps through that keeps the meat tender or something now who's the person that came up with that one put in a dark box in four years and didn't the meat will be yeah well here's the thing that I found from eating wild meat specifically and I know that everybody can't eat wild meat and I'm very aware of that argument but that none of those animals are like that they're living they live in this buck wild nature life they're out there in the woods with predators and they're surviving right years in the mountains there's mountain lions out there and bears out there and these fucking things have figured out a way to get away from them and survive they're wired and alive and if you eat one of those it's just a different thing than eating these prisoners you know yeah we're eating prisoners that's the best thing that's that's bad too to be out in the wild living your life you're an elk Cora and then a metahuman walks into this forum that doesn't belong he's the outsider mmm and blows your fucking head off true unless you like to eat elk then it's awesome that's exactly what you were looking for you know I mean we could decide all day like whose land is whose land like it's their land this is where the elk live this is their home right they will walk right through your fucking living room and stomp your kid to death okay don't get it to us dude I don't think it elk was coming to our living room but if they wanted to like they're they're not respecting our our property because they love us and they're you know we don't we have a mutual agreement no like they'd they're not really dangerous but moose are moose will fuck you up I've never seen I've hear I've heard muesli gigantic on if you find a moose in your backyard get the fuck back in your house cuz the moose might fuck you really oh yeah especially if you come near mama it's a mama in her calves ya woof yep seen a little slap duff like a wedded life they're so big dude then I mean look real when you see them they're so big they're so big they're like 20 deer damn really where they move so like what North America Canada yeah like probably North's no moose in like this Carolina this moose in Colorado there's moose in Canada there's a lot of moose in certain parts of Canada eat them oh yeah yeah there's a moose in Alaska oh yeah moose is delicious but dude they're so big you can't believe how big they are when you see them you've eaten moose but yeah a moose before well yeah it's really good it's delicious you eat a lot of stuff yeah but it's I just don't know I like it it's better for you but the whole point was this whole veal thing like you know I don't want that right like that is not like that's not you don't have to eat that like why do you even want that tender like what are you doing does it hurt when you chew I don't get it man are you scared of chewing I just want good days any softer yeah in that weird like oh it's so tender we're so lazy we don't even want to work out when we eat well go children don't chew it you lazy ass off the bone just chew it you fuck none I'd rather keep this little baby cow hostage all hogtied dude is horrible it is horrible that's one of the more horrible things about farming right I guess they have free-range veal too which is basically just what is free-range free-range is still on a imprisoned and on a farm yeah free-range chickens like they they still they can always they see they don't wanna farm that's true but free-range chickens are the exception because freeway and chickens they don't get anywhere if you have a chicken house okay and you have a yard you don't ever have to fence the chickens in the only reason why you fence the chickens in is protecting them from other threats right they go right in their chicken house at night like we leave the door off chickens we leave the door open at the end of the day there's going there a little chicken coop and climb up there's their seats they know what do like that's that's their house they live there like I they have some weird relationship with me they know I bring food so when I come around they get excited and they follow me around but they know that where they live they're not prisoners like they want to be there you have free-range chickens yeah they're free-range in the sense that I let them out all the time but the thing about it is data they're not gonna go like to another state chickens do chickens hang around right and they're gonna be fed if they're wild animals they you know well no they've over a yard we get fed here we dis guy comes out and throws grain on the ground twice a day so we're gonna stay here well it's not even that when you let them out they go looking for bugs that's all they're doing they wander around the yard they fuck every bug up every bugs dead every Mouse dead anything oh they eat the fuck out of mice they chickens eat mice Jamie I think we need to play a off played clip for mr. Rock yeah dude these I I didn't know either until I got him they eat mice they chase mice down in a ferocious manner to the point where cats please there's a fantastic video of a cat playing with a mouse and a chicken comes over and shows them how the fuck it's done so here's one where they're gonna put a mouse and this chicken isn't gonna grab it from this dude that's not as impressive Jamie give me the one where the the give me the one with a cat the chicken steals the mouse from the cat it says the chicken eat mice do they eat people have as much as we we had a mouse get into the chicken coop once just to just randomly this is it watch this look at this chicken look at this cat cats thinking about getting the mouse the chickens like bitch give me that look at this did you fucking know how ferocious dude just consuming it see cats killed he was taking his time you try to get it from the chicken right no chickens are too crazy Wow okay yeah there's something everyday she can eat she can eat nice wild little fuckers so they they just go around my yard jack and everything that moves how many chickens you got thirteen Daniel I got a rooster I'm lost a bunch of them - coyote yeah yeah no rooster kennefa rooster that's that's asshole move you've done Tampa improv you see a chicken's all around eat walk yeah chickens 5:00 in the morning [Laughter] used to have a gardener that uh had he kept roosters like fighting roosters and I went over his house for something and he lived in this super Mexican neighborhood where like everything was in Spanish all the signs were in Spanish everything was like wow I mean it's like almost like visiting a super super Mexican nothing was in English everything was in Spanish but it was just super Mexican where everybody in his little area had boxes of chicken coops in the backyard just stacked fighting like fighting chickens dude I mean like five houses on this one block that's a cultural thing right fighting chickens so like people fight dogs and in there nice what the fuck it's like well disclaimer I don't fight dogs I don't even own the dog I get it we make a distinction between chickens and dogs because we eat chickens because we eat chickens and because you never really form a bond with a chicken like chickens are always they're never really there for you right you know like my dogs they're for me I come home I'm like my man he gets happy I go what are you doing how are you sir he gets gives me kisses I dog as a family member yeah chicken is a meal yeah any he listens to me he's he's he's he's patience and Frank is smart yeah it's Martin you can't train shit with a chicken right you could teach some where the food is that's it no you just make the noise and they know when they hear that yeah sooo Cystic whatever you say it is they have a box of dried worms we shake this box of dried mealworms and they soon as they hear that they come running they love those things it's a little like fish when you put your hand over uh-huh they think I'm a drunk yeah I think you drop some food on them yeah yeah you could train them that much but so we make a distinction so when someone's like forcing dogs to kill each other that's like forcing like a family member that I can't like making to my friends fight to the death like if you have a family member who can't read and you trick him into fighting to the death tell him you love him the most if he does it Hey Dude if you fight to the death I will love you the most but you have to win for me just he's just smart for like a plant smart for like you know like a but not smart for a person you know he's not quite but you can talk him into that just ask the question I don't want anybody to get upset and say I said anything about fighting dogs I know how sensitive some people are dude today you can't riff anymore you can't just talk off the top of your head right you know like sometimes you you say some shit where you just explore in it like why why come right come right chickens now gave a dog right and you might actually be only you might be the really the only reasonable wouldn't do that was to say it's fucked up with chickens too that's the reason why but people would always misinterpret it and go with the worst way is to say what's wrong with fighting dogs which is not maybe they're gonna hear what they want to hear but you were really saying why should you be able to fight why shouldn't we love chickens just how much that's because we eat them because they're delicious shit and they get the nod because they're delicious I went to an ashram once and this lady who was there she now we're having a conversation and I noticed that she had ant spray and I said what do you do with the ant spray she goes well it's unfortunate but we have to use it because the ants have been getting to the garbage I go what Wow I go you guys are murderers you guys are killing ants and she started laughing she thought it was kind of funny she's like yeah she cuz we draw the line that's one thing about Buddhists like a lot of Buddhists they don't take themselves too seriously to the point where they can't like crack had a little joke about that the hypocrisy of the fact they're using bug spray it in oshawa very good death spray you're killing all these organism we just but we decide that that's okay whereas like if she was in our backyards invaded by house cats she just went out shotgun right you can't do that you can't do that but you could spray the fuck out of his little bones you gotta kill him it's like when things are little we're like can't be bothered worrying about you need to little yeah who does she would think though they would yeah yeah yeah you would think they would figure out a better way to keep those ants out they're lazy they wanted to kill him Buddha so lazy well that we just learned it today well don't you think like do you don't you think there could have been a way to clean them up with water not kill them is that no you'd still kill some you'd still just sweep them out like your Buddha kills him outside but even then you're you're murdering dozens and dozens of ants if you just had a broom and you start hitting those you get an ant eater if you're a Buddhist because now circle of life type shit you get a chicken get a chicken chicken eats oh yeah then you get chicken shit all over your kitchen well you sweep that up that's not just anybody that's true maybe that's the move for for a Buddhist hmm we finding answers here we wonder if they try to make their chickens vegetarian here what does it say here if you have an infestation use your vacuum to quickly get rid of the invaders then immediately enter the vacuum bag in the outdoor compost pile or at some distance from your house do not use ant bait or poison like sprays like raid that continue to they continue in the toxic waste stream from their point of manufacturer to their ultimate destination in landfills via runoff or sewage well that's very conscious of them yeah so they're saying don't don't use bug spray just use a vacuum cleaner you're still gonna kill some guaranteed you suck in those little tiny things into a huge metal tube what could go wrong get a chicken man if you imagine if somebody like assumed that you would be okay and they use something of proportionate size to suck you off the earth my god they'll be fine they'll be fine you land on a pile of other people you get sucked up at the same time yeah imagine to each other your broken arms and my shoulders I think that's ridiculous what would you do if there wasn't a vacuum cleaner mr. Buddhist answer man huh well if there's no vacuum cleaner would you use a broom a vacuum cleaner is gonna fuck those ants a chicken chicken each dance yeah I think I like when you're doing I think that's a smart way of thinking anteater even further but I think ant eaters just like to get to a mound of dirt and just go to town I don't know if I'd like hunter they stick their tongues in the ant hole right right right right and just yeah tongues like sticky so it's just like it's just eating for days but what if they wiped them out real quick and then you got a fucking ant eater that you have to feed it and you gotta bring in and see like what kind of it that's more my what eats the anteater what eats a black bears yeah oh you're psycho Buddhists do there is a crazy video that I tweeted of these tourists walking through the woods and they're walking down a trail and they run into a fucking gigantic grizzly bear it is a terrifying video Wow I tweeted yeah it's not on it I didn't put it on Instagram dude this thing is so big and now I come right back up back up sir they got a cap yeah yeah I got away yeah did you see the video of the poachers that went to kill the Rhino and the lion kills a video of it it's a I saw a picture I saw still oh okay yeah I didn't know if they got a video but yeah that's fucked up that's fucking a few dude I've got jacked right tonight's week that's we even that's the lion saying we even this turn up the volume Jamie my bears freeze that's a good boy yeah that's a good boy too he's coming around motherfuckers it's following him it's circling him around yeah he's that thing is circling him man it's going towards him the thing is that thing is coming way too close to him man it's like going in a circle no yeah they got lucky there I would have been gone the scary thing about that is that bear could have just decided randomly through some firing of his bear synapses to take a left instead of a rope just go at him he's just he could have easily decided that all those things scare the shit out of me you know why man we don't believe in things don't see we don't believe in them what do you mean you don't believe in things you don't see you know it's real but you don't believe danger no you don't believe in it it's not a real thing in your world right right when you see if you were outside and you saw that if you were with those people in Australia you uvular oh Jesus Christ there I would know that's the reality that's really like my world doesn't evolve does it involve being somewhere near that close to a bear so want to see it in my world would be what the wouldn't be real not like holy shit this can't be happening but if you were with those people if you went on that trip that I'd be that would be fucking well one of the craziest things you get out of your whole existence gets down to the chance that this thing makes a decision to go one way or another yeah otherwise you're just gonna run you down just like that's like life if you go in certain scenarios you like like this shit can get real real fast real fast yeah that's one of them man that is life in a city life is just like holy shit video yeah right how many people died in Chicago last week some insane number there was a the reporting on the lack of attention that the murders in Chicago are getting and like the national news and how crazy it is hoggle several times the one thing that sticks out to me every time I go there is how segregated it is yeah I've never gone major with a major city like New York is like we're all right piled up together four killed twenty four wounded and weekend shootings God twenty-eight people got shot dude that is crazy twenty-eight people know if we came in the afternoon I said fuck standing on the sidewalk Jesus Messiah Jesus Christ but there is a there is a war going on in Chicago that's way more deadly than most of the wars we're engaging in overseas you don't hear about that many soldiers dying every day now that's another that's another scenario we said like that's real yeah that's real right here's real señor they walk outside in Chicago that is a real right fear that you should have and this is what's create with number of people in Chicago this year passes 1400 1400 people shot now how many people do we know how many got shot like doing tours of Afghanistan that's a good question what is this what is this this is over the year does this year okay so let's Google how many soldiers were shot overseas this year you know the that's a weird thing man that we got a war going on if that was mexicans invading North Dakota and shooting people now many people were dying every day we would be taking action but because it's happening - it was 1,400 and a hundred of them were white people it would be an issue oh yeah it was 1,300 black people and 100 white people they'd be yeah you're really right this is I mean people don't talk about it's 300 to me it's like would be crazy that's a weird statistic it's a terrible situation like culturally to have something this is a clarion you know and with 1400 people being shot that means and people don't want to realize this is you know post-traumatic stress disorder is a real thing in the ghetto as well as in the hills of Afghanistan like of course it's real of course so when you see something that when people like why these guys have guns on them it's like dude 14 other people got shot I'm just trying to get to school and back yeah I'm trying to work him back of course it's you know we're not protecting those people it's exactly if they were stuck somewhere overseas and some in the middle of some war you know and their American citizen suppose please help get us a like you got to get these good if there was a place that doesn't like statistically the numbers of the southside of Chicago where all this murders going down there was a play statistically in another part of the world right we would be saying those numbers anywhere else and it's a it's a crisis if we had let's say Hawaii let's say if we had just moved into Hawaii I just just took over Hawaii and then we were in an area where people started getting shot and killed by locals like that we would want to extract those people right away we'd scoop them up from an island we would think they'd be shooted the helicopters right right well you just look at the real numbers just the raw number that's a crazy number of people getting shot just this year this is July did I just started how many soldiers got shot I can't find trying to find the wounded I can only find deaths okay what's the deaths it's only like 1500 total since like 2001 since 2001 man or 20 this is since January that seems weird saying only I know what you're saying are you saying in comparison to the other number since January yeah that's insane that's crazy that is insane and that's happening right here in the good old US of A in one of the biggest cities in the world Chicago's giant awesome City and it's happening in other cities also people don't know them hmm but Chicago is the most glaring yeah because yeah I don't travel around there so I don't know what happened or why it happened why they have this segregation there and what it was all about go to Chicago man it's like black people all the way over there mm-hmm then is downtown where it's nice and everybody's you know Detroit has that too right it's right as well yes yeah yeah um man then you go down south it's like that go to Louisiana it's crazy you were the king or the president Tony rod I was the president how do you fix this you have to fix this it's a process man first I always say number one is education right education is number one if you're just if you're getting a better education then you just avoid the pitfalls naturally because you just know that certain things are wrong and yeah and by getting a better education I mean you have opportunities to do you know you have a music appreciation you have the arts you have sports you have things to occupy you during school hours and after school hours there's no type of any type of extra extracurricular activities for these kids mm-hmm in Chicago there's gang life which you are born into which you are expected to go into once you're a certain age you all right you a man now here's a gun we don't like those guys those guys don't like us you don't even question it just like my father's been this way my grandfather's been this way my uncle's are this way my big brothers in this way you don't even you're born right into it you know what the war zone you all right and you don't question it and it's a war zone where you sleep and your family lives right not just a war zone with soldiers but a war zone with families and another thing about education you you're more worldly if you see the world you realize how small that how small your neighborhood is and there's a bigger world out there and you could want to go places and see things then you realize like what are we doing here yeah but these are people that I guarantee probably never left Chicago right probably never went on vacation to the south to visit grandparents and realize Dana South is nice and quiet and the people are friendly and they've never been to you know the zoo and saw an animal and went home and googled the mating rituals of this you know open your mind up in your mind you see the world the stuff that you're involved in becomes just so small yeah this guy I don't like Scott cause he has on red and I have on blue I don't get it sort of education that tiny little area you know though that he operates in with his living his life it does matter right right your reality is what's around you yeah that's until you get a scope of the bigger world like I grew up in the hood I grew up in bed-stuy Brooklyn the one of the wildest neighborhoods when I was going to but my vision was past it my vision was yeah this is going on outside but I'm gonna be there one day what do you attribute the having the ability to do that to uh having a mom and a dad my pops my father worked two full time jobs my whole childhood my father literally worked 80 hours a week 180 so just to see him go every day and like Dan is doing this dude works hard man Wow didn't have a lot to show for it made sure his kids had mom was a teacher education was you know she made an emphasis on it Wow you know it was just like my friends like my one of my best friends down the block no dad my friend across the street no dad my friend two doors down no dad then crack came and that was everything fucked up everything started just the neighborhood started just to you know yeah that was like river laying crack was people that are alive today or young kids today they don't remember the 80s yeah there was a like a plague a plague hit everybody knew someone did they got hit and you know so many people's lives were gone done done over people who were doing fine and then all of a sudden yeah I remember yeah it was a weird and we started losing friends that's what and that's what happened I started losing friends I I saw like people don't it was crazy man like some of this shit we saw I saw a friend get shot in the head like talk to him on the corner engaged what's up man yeah we gonna play ball lady you wanna play ball all right cool I hate you later turn to walk down the block look that may be you know a thousand feet away and looked back to like just you know look around the neighborhood and saw a guy just bang like he was he looked like if you ever see a old like Big Daddy Kane album yeah he had the flattop and a bunch of jewelry on on the corner on the pay phone this is beeper days and you know beep right and you got it and the guy ran up on him while he was returning a beep and just tried to rob him and then he went for his gun and the guy just boom right in his head right on the corner of my block Christ right on the corner of my block and I went home and my parents at it I was like this is crazy man and that's where I grew up but my vision was not confined to where I was it was I'm gonna be you know you're very fortune once I get out of here I'm gonna do this and once I leave here I'm gonna you're very fortunate to have those kind of examples you know if your dad who worked like that and your mom very fortunate that's awesome yeah man it's hard for some people if they didn't get the break that you got in that in that regard Lee that's why I don't I I it's not missed on me like I realized like if I didn't get that I didn't catch that last chopper mmm good for you man that's but that's that's where character comes from to means having someone like that as an example like how someone who can work two full-time jobs yeah and that is that's a force of will most people struggle with one man one is hard eight hours a day and he needs you to my dad's rule was everybody had to have a job at 14 13 was your last summer enjoy yourself at there all do what everyone do 14 you getting a job Wow yep no he didn't play at all 14 job yeah he knows it's dogs God he's the thing is man that's a bitter pill to swallow when you're young but damn that dudes who go through that always seem like they have an extra gear you know I know a lot of dudes who went through like boot camp type dads they did not like it but they can do some shit like just a little bit more shit that other people could do you know they might not look like the fact that dad was always telling what to do but these motherfuckers can hike 20 miles yeah and not complain my dad wasn't boot camp but it was like you're gonna work that's that's not even a question you're gonna work and then I have so many siblings that what his rule was you know we had to take care of each other so my oldest brother of course he turns 14 first he's working he gets paid you have to give everybody five dollars you got paid today give all your siblings five down Wow next brother gets a job now his two brothers working give everybody five dollars Wow it was like a socialism yeah my dad just made sure it all worked that's cool that's very generous - that's like everybody that's forcing everybody to be in it together right that's smart and taking man and then it was the rule was it was uh if your brothers in a fight you're in a fight mmm so then it became don't fuck with the rock brothers because there's so many of them you have to fight all of them so that kind of kept us safe during this whole you know wow that's awesome it's a bad situation to be in but a great place to develop character right opportunities develop character there yeah you know who you are you know what you have you know that you you you know you develop a sense of uh you know go and get it work hard no excuses nobody's doing it for you nobody's coming to save you you're responsible for you yeah man we all need to have a little bit more of that in our life and then also a little bit more community - absolutely no oh yeah and I that right and we grew up in a time where it was next door neighbor could spank you right lady across the street could grab you and make you sit down on the stoop until your mother came home right right a guy in the bodega at the corner would tell you to sit inside and see your mother came home yeah people would uh they would police the neighborhood right we live in how we live and don't talk to my kid don't touch my hair yeah right get off my son don't touch my child you know there's a lot of that well it's because somebody mans the weird balance I've talked about this recently but my cousin I saw my cousin get smacked by some lady once when we were we were both like my cousins a year younger than me so I might have been six and she might have been five somewhere around there it wasn't any older than that right and this lady cuffed her and right in the face man she fell this lady fell on the ice and my cousin just happened to be there and she was looking at her on the ground and she did not laugh at her but the lady said she laughed at her she the lady got up she was just angry that she fell and hurt herself she got up and smacked my cousin right in the face my cousin felt down I remember seeing it and realized I couldn't do anything about it to save her to help her you know I was a little kid too and being terrified that this grown-up person just smacked this little kid in the head for something that wasn't even real right like you don't want that either right it's like don't touch my kid it's probably better well that's not long around that crazy people so not helping raise a child that's the right ass adult that's just a crazy she was a crazy lady that lived in our building that was always think about living in apartment buildings right there's always there's always somebody who died right somebody always died and you would be walking by that apartment going what the fuck is that what is that smell we smelled that body and somebody something died in the house dude it is crazy how bad it smells it's so bad people smell so bad when they die it's insane I'm gonna thank God I dude the entire floor smelled like a body it was so gross even after the body was going on it took a while I'm sure for them to clean it I hardly remember I just remember there was a terrible terrible smell in the hallway and then they realized that this lady had died in her in her apartment suddenly going to get the body but I don't remember how long it took for them to clean up the smell but the smell was unbelievably bad and then somebody moves in and all the neighbors like you know somebody died in there yeah they don't tell you shit tell you that's the dead now you've all passed the dead house don't they have to tell you now like if someone got murdered in the house I think that's a law that wasn't a law before I don't think it was I think in some places maybe it was a law yeah that's not a lot I just sell you a house is like hey hey whatever we figured out what happened to hear nothing but good times enjoy your house fuck off nothing but good time bullet holes in the wall hey you bought it hey people get crazy in this neighborhood they'd like to celebrate New Years Eve fourth of July yeah I don't know man you should probably know do you believe in haunted houses and not really no I haven't experienced right oh I don't I don't I don't give it much thought put it that way I don't believe in ghosts but I don't not believe in ghosts have you experienced no normal nope but imagine you're out in the desert and all of a sudden you see an apparition walk towards you in a desert and then this is happening you just imagine just imagine okay I'm in the desert and at nighttime that looks right at you and it looks like like a teacher that you knew from like seventh grade or so this is that night that night and then vanish and it vanishes right in front of you do you tell people yeah what do you tell them my seventh grade teacher just popped up in Oh Tony we gotta get you to a doctor Tony rocks gone crazy no you you know you would do is double people you trust even if the people you trust they'd be like you okay let me feel your head I would put you on a cloud put you in the category Oh Tony Rock might be crazy you do you have to go in the cat category then I have to accumulate more data I'd have to say well every time I talk to him seems reasonable and intelligent he's a really funny guy I don't think he's crazy well you say you I think I saw I was out there by myself it was nighttime you know dude I was talking the student once pulls out his phone and starts showing me pictures of clouds I go what is that here's another one look at this one here I go what is it he goes look at this one here I see them everywhere like what do you see and he goes flying saucers these just these are clearly ships from outer space and usually found during the clouds they're inside the cloud yeah he's got pictures his phone was like remember when Jack Nicholson in the shining all work no play makes Jack a dull boy just types it over and over again this dude his whole phone was just clouds he shows me the pictures on his phone I was like oh Wow yeah that's a little different dude he had hundreds of pictures of clouds and what you say and know what to say he's grown man older than me was it gonna say okay I usually that's what I usually say okay there's nothing to say you think those are spaceships I'm looking at clouds and you think their spaceship something's wrong here I don't want to be mean seems like a nice guy okay it's probably the best bet yeah what do you say hey man maybe he's right maybe he has some they live glasses that I don't have right remember that movie with Robin I can see he's looking at those photos and he sees some shit that my puny brain can't see that's possible too what if people can't see stuff like that what do people just write some stuff and we don't we should yeah be so clear in our sight I think it's entirely possible the people have senses that they can detect things and feel things the real question is how many of those people are being honest about it and how often is it really happen because people the problem is there's a tendency this is the tendency people love to pretend they have some psychic power right or they have some paranormal gift or they're different and exceptional in some way without earning it from everybody else people love to do that like I just have a sense right I have a sense because they like the attention yeah I just know I just know man I just have a fucking instinct and I always go on my gut but that that doesn't mean you're always right so you got to wonder like how many people really do feel like something's wrong when something's wrong and how many people really do like no not to go to a place like something is telling them not to go look something strong and how many people were just full of shit and how many people I think that fact pretend they had a voice that told them not to do it I don't know about the voice but I know that that's real that's that instinct to say hey don't go there yeah a lot of times there's been times in my life where I'd you know just followed the instinct and ended up you know I couldn't one time something happened my brother Brian my brother Brian my favorite brother in the whole world everybody knows oh the other brothers are mad right everybody know everybody knows Brian's my favorite Brian got a guy tried to rob Brian in neighborhood one day he got in a fight with a guy and guy cut his face and he went to the hospital and I was at work and my brother's call me like this the guy tried to rob Brian and and I didn't know where the hospital was I jumped on the train I took the train a few stops I jumped off I jumped on another train took it a few stops I'm like fuck I jump on another that you know yeah you transferred in New York ton subway jump on the third train and take it a few stops and get off and come up to the street and I asked the guy walking hey man you know where Kings County Hospital is and he says right there and I had no idea I just fucking felt it like I got to get to my brother Wow and I literally hey man where's that he's like right there and I just it was I just felt it like I got it find my brother and that's all I was thinking about wow yeah I believe you I believe that's real I know for a fact I don't think I say that wasn't real with me but I don't know about you know see that they live glasses I don't know no I don't think that's real but I I know there's something that happens sometimes when you thinking about someone they call you right because sometimes it happens where this person is like so far out of your memory right like you haven't talked to them in a year and a half and you're like dude how the fuck did you know just I was just thinking of you like man just thinking about you just call check and see wait that the wave is so something yeah Connect you put a frequency to so strong in the air that I think there's something to that wait what is this Ghostbusters laws many states pass legislation in the 1980s and early 1990s to protect sellers and real estate brokers from buyers claiming they were damaged by the sellers failure to disclose the presence of ghosts Wow these laws became known as Ghostbuster laws after the 1980s era movie comedy Connecticut ghostbusters law first appeared in 1990 Wow psychological impact is a thing psychological impact became in non-material huh non material fact concerning real property the overhaul also replaced the reference to HIV with a reference to the Commissioner of Public Health's list of reportable diseases reportable diseases huh wow man this is all that yeah I mean I guess we have to do that right they have to do that I mean you you don't want someone to know that like there was a house that I saw in Boulder that was for sale there's the house worth JonBenet Ramsay was killed and they couldn't sell it I think they even changed the name of the street or something crazy like tile and they still couldn't sell it it was like a really nice house people would just like no thanks wow that house is just poison that's like a Bundy right - a Bundy damn OJ's house oh yeah as an Ontario town Rockingham yeah dude they're Couture down some fucking psycho could move there you know want to live where the King lived the apartment those are the condo is still there Kaito Kaito still lives there no no no oh geez house is gone but Nicola murder scene is still oh really really Wow that is a why would they turn in old days and well someone just made a call that's it yeah that's as low I want to oh my god that's hilarious yeah I'm wondering your honor are we gonna go work back to reference ghostbusters law number one great they usually say like to collaborate Parker jr. as a character witness I don't think in court they ever use those names right they just use like the the docket number you gotta come yeah that's hilarious yeah have you ever been a place where it felt weird we found out that someone died there you've been in a place where I've been in places that felt weird because you know some violence was gonna pop off and I knew right oh no I was like let's get the fuck out here right as you can tell that's you can feel that somebody dying yeah no I was at a concert once in a brawl broke out and I quit I was a security guard and I was an alien concert and it broke out I put a hoodie on a zipped it up covered my security outfit I'd walk right the fuck out of there like I think you out of your fucking mind jumps into this fray and getting clocked in the head by somebody like people were fighting and they were there and they cancelled the show and kicked everybody out I was like fires I was at it's not the vibe Awards when dr. Dre got jumped in young buck stabbed a guy oh I was there Wow and I was doing a show for you P and this was back when UPN was still a network and one of the execs from UPN was there with her young son he wanted to see all the rappers and he's sitting at the table with us and I saw like the g-unit group come in yeah and I sort of death row guys come in and I saw Dre's group commit and I'm sitting there and I tell I forgot to get ladies name I said hey you might want to get your kid out of here somethings about to go down well she's like what do you mean I'm like it's about to it's about to go and she's like he's so excited he wanted to see Dre and he loves 50 cent and I'm listen get this kid it was a little white kid to him like oh my god there's can I go say hi and I'm like get him out of here and when it's like the second time I said it like yo you're not gonna really get him out he's gonna pop off boom Dre gets punched in the face mail a young book stabs a guy and I'm like told you Jesus and like two days later on set she's just like how did you know that like I know the I know the energy in the room I could feel it I've been around it too many times that's a crazy feeling - and people are about to do something ridiculous yeah you see the you see the walk you see the look you know mm-hmm that's like it's sad but it's true like when you grow up in the hood you have that instinct you have that that look you look at a guy walk past you at one time and you look okay it's about to go yeah it's about to go yeah people that have never experienced that probably wouldn't know what to do right who wouldn't they would think nothing of it like that lady like she'd never seen those signs before yeah I've been on the road uh this was recently like maybe three months four months ago I had a my feature at my feature comic with me he's from Chicago actually and we're in a club after the show and there's a couple guys talking in the corner and I said something to a girl she's like hey Tony Rock him have those small talk and she walks over to the group of guys and one guy walks over and stands at the end of the bar here and one guy stands in their bar here and I my friend Dave and I go yeah you ever been a fight in a ball before he said no I said get ready motherfucker you bout to be in one cuz I saw it Jesus and then third guy comes over so funny the third guy comes over he's like oh shit you you are a comedian and I see a say I thought that was you we was already talking I was like I thought that was the comedian guy and it's I got a good picture man I took a picture one of Minnie's calls nothing I'd like it was comedian it was him it was like he kind of just squashed it cuz he I guess they didn't know who I was I was gonna go but cuz I said something to the girl oh like no it's the comedian is hit and I'm like hey fellas now I know all right would you guys need a drink let's do a round of shots you know um Dave's like that's doesn't you know that I'm like I know mother gonna go yeah if you ain't never been around violent people you probably don't smell that vibe right you smell that vibe that's a valuable tool to have if you're in those places especially if you own the road in cities you know yourself on the road you know maybe you have a local friend as like to let me take you to my friends club you want to meet you right and then you're at a place like how do I get out of here where are we I've been in hey my boys having a party this house and I'm like drop craziest ones the ones they have to take you in a shuttle you have to park the car here sorry alright are you fucking kidding me going to a shuttle to a party the worst I was in Iowa one time this is a true story I was at Iowa I was in a Des Moines Iowa did the show there's not very many black people in Iowa so shows up a group of white guys like hey bro you super funny man let's go get a drink let's go to the bar right down the street I'm a New Yorker right down the street is literally right down the street right they get in a truck he pulls a truck around he pulls in he pulls from one of those four-door pickup from mmm big ones and it's two guys in the front and I'm like a jump in man and I'm like oh Jesus I fucking we go right down the street and now we're driving for maybe 10 minutes oh and he's trying to get a point of reference if I got it jump out the truck this Iowa is nothing as far as you can see right or left of the truck just highway and grass right so there's nothing like my jump out which way no this is how girls have to feel every day getting a guitar yes that feeling so we pull up at a barn a barn and the two guys are excited they jump out and they run around the other side of the ball hey bro come around this way and they and they turn and I can't see them now no no and I say to myself like holy shit this is this is how it's gonna end this is it right here oh my god and I turned the corner and I see the neon light that says girls girls girls I had never been so excited to see the ugliest strippers in the world it was like yes yes I wanna let this this wildebeest yes oh my god you thought they were taking you you go back behind there this chains hanging the exact ters exactly oh my god that shit's happened before that's the crazy thing about people like the worst thing you know I'm watching this show Vikings you ever watch it Jamie you got a binge it's a good goddamn show I think I'm on season three or four I can't remember but it's a good fucking show but it just shows you how brutal people were back then like every day someone's getting fucked up on that show that shows a guarantee people gonna die every other second out people getting drowned people holding them underwater people little kids are killing people with axes like it's great that show is fucking crazy everyday people getting jacked and murdered and killed you sound like you like it that's a fucking good show I enjoy it but the point is like these people were like this was this was life for these fucking writebol right that was a real world realization reality is what your reality is yeah like people are like people that don't understand your reality well you're not from this world this is this is a real thing to us to know how a fights gonna pop off to no win a guy strapped to know when is this is our reality what's crazy is that we like to think that that doesn't exist anymore that that Viking style of living doesn't exist but it does they just use guns now it's just happening like that with gun right that's all it is it's basically that same kind of like Conqueror survivor mentality bullets and fuck you and fuck him and the guys that run into jewel and smashed it last yeah that's pillage England gathering right yeah it's like as old as time it's just confined to certain areas now and it's not spreading out like the Vikings did in giant boats and getting on the sea and they're not doing it like the Vikings did it some aspect of it was just you know trying to discover new lands yeah you know yeah they were trying to farm and shit yeah there's meat over here oh there's gold here yeah now they just do it cuz it's like I have to eat them you know I want those sneakers man I wish I could see what it was really like back then cuz it's like you watch the show and the show is really cool but you know they're actors and they're doing a great job and everything but you still know their actors and you watching them do things and everything's really well done means a really well done show but still you're like man I wish I could see it in real life yeah just be with where were what's happening in real life do you imagine just being alive back then when the best clothes were made out of fucking animal hides he just draped in Buffalo skins kill the Buffalo you ate the village ate the Buffalo yeah every you used every piece of it so they lives in glaze it would take their boats out and catch fish and bring him in and people would be waiting on the docks see if they're gonna eat tonight right and there's only like 200 people in the town so if a plague hit have to be able to be dead a woman would have a baby right in front of you yeah wrap it in a blanket and that was it that was it that's how people lived forever people lived like that and they lives a year and they lived and they lived they didn't they actually live they thrived right but wouldn't you take this over that I would take this yes they would too they'd be like you fucking asshole you might be a Viking I want to drive it'll be like not enough fuck riding the horse do not drove in the Escalade today that shit is so smooth it's comfortable they see this way yes but it's cool in here music yeah the music wirelessly charging my phone right there it's like they would be like you're an asshole if you want to live like us all campers and his embodies any of that fucking opened your door with a gun and you know he's the Viking like exactly need this yeah yeah and if you don't take of that problem this is the thing it never gets better it's like a part of its like if you if you are a person and you had like a thing that was wrong with you like a big cancerous Legion on your leg and just ignored it fuck it whatever yeah keep on truckin right yeah but that is exactly what any sort of crime infested area is it's a problem that if you don't address is not gonna get any better Bob Lee's gonna get worse and people don't address the problems in society until it affects them what do you think they could do though like how besides just education how do you stop as much crime how do you give people like counseling like Lukey you can get the guns out of Tecate you can get the guns out of anyway if you want to you think so how would they get some guns down it would get most of the guns out where I can get you can get most of the guns out you can do that that's but do you run the risk of taking guns away from people that could defend themselves in a really dangerous area that's filled with guns by taking by taking the guns out like what about people that are also so like who are you gonna take the guns away from you're gonna take the guns away from the lady who runs the bakery who carries a lot of cash a lady of the lady that runs the bakery keeps her gun lady that runs the bakery that that has eight that has a business mmm that provides goods and services for the neighborhood that one protection at once protection keeps her gun did you see that recent video there's a crazy video these two gals behind a stove and one yesterday it got punched her gun comes back in Wales her in the head and then the other girl pulls a gun and keeps her gun yeah that she keeps her gun because shit like that might happen but that guy now imagine if he had a gun that's a good thing for people to see this is why and I'm not saying everybody should have guns it's a good thing for people to see because we only hear the other side you only hear guns being dangerous and killing people you don't hear people like that lady that just saved herself from getting the fuck beat out of her with a gun I know I saw another I saw that video and then I saw the other video was a guy in a jewelry store yeah comes in two three two or three guys hoodies on masks on you see the guy was coming through the door pulled in there man Stan who it's like on the camera right and then you see a guy walk away from the jewelry display he walks you know cameras shooting this way so he walks out of brings it a camera and when the guys come in he comes back blast and boom whoa that guy keeps his gun Jesus he just starts shooting so they they came in guns out oh Jesus yeah so what happened it was like there was customers in it - sorry no he hit one yeah yeah and other two ran out and you see the guy run out of camera range you imagine being in a fucking jewelry store trying to buy a watch for your wife and a gun fight breaks ring you just like love me and my girl are gonna get and a guy just comes in and you think this could be it this is how I'm gonna go yeah my kids think you know what this is a sign we shouldn't get married I just have too much PTSD that is hilarious yeah but you run a business you keep you keep you gun yeah just a guy in the corner a twenty guys on the corner cops stop them frisk okay taking these guns it's gonna be hard to get them all man and the problem is defining who gets to keep one and who doesn't get to keep one that's very let's have that argument later right get the guns first well you're never gonna get them back like if once you take them away whoever got the guns taken away they're never getting their guns well well know that you you've got to take the guns and then you have to have to be more to just that you got to take the guns and there has to be an increased police presence you have to take guns sure I have to be something to do in school that's out you have to take the guns and they have to be you know counseling for drug offenders and you take the guns and it has to be jobs in the neighborhood you know it's a lot of steps that have to cope with but UK it can be done yeah um you definitely get the illegal guns right if you could somehow another get access to them the illegal guns the legal ones are going to be real tough because if someone has a gun legally and they haven't committed a crime it's gonna be real hard to take that gun away yeah but I don't think if they did the numbers the guys with legal guns aren't the guys that are committing these crimes right the guy with a legal gun I'm pretty sure isn't the guy that drove past then shut up right then you got to worry about the people with legal guns getting robbed for their guns right you know if guns become a shortage the whole thing is very it's a it's a real problem and it's very it's very complicated I think right to try to completely solve it and how do you get these people that are in that life that are everyday involved in gang violence and I don't think I could be wrong I don't think everybody that's in gang life wants to be there I think you're right not exactly right I think they just like what the fuck else is there to do in this neighborhood I right you're right I think if they had an opportunity to you know I think they got the kid that is a very good basketball player that his uncle was it like I said his family lineages gang life mmm if he had a chance to go play basketball somewhere he would take that chance I think you're totally right and I think in the absence of any other chances that's when it becomes something that's our action right yeah and I think it's all about the same feeling that people get when they're joining gangs or when they're like a staunch right winger or a staunch left winger I think it's all the same thing it's like people have a desire to belong to some absolutely make something that makes your life have more meaning I'd like it has more meaning absolutely and then when you don't have that you'll get behind anything you get behind anything yeah well like I say on Instagram all the time it's like I told my little brother just yesterday it's the reason why they call them followers cuz they just want to get behind shit they don't even understand yeah if you like I get my instruments hilarious cuz I get a lot of people like I'll get girls that are like hey I love what you're doing I saw your shows then I get to random guy looks like yo you know I shit you just Chris's brother your you ain't shit and it's like dude that's what you like you think that's gonna hurt me like but just wanting you just want it to be involved in this you just want it to be a part of it you didn't you wanted my attention you didn't know how to get it well the problem is the desire to do that in the first place so who the fuck are you like why would you want to do that why do you want to make somebody feel bad for no reason right for what cuz the do just want to be and we want to be involved in some capacity yeah here's a tip to anybody things like that there's no way you're not a loser it's impossible there's not a single winner alive that would write something like that absolutely do you think like maybe like Michael Jordan goes trolling through Instagram accounts looking for shitty shit without your brother you know imagine you had to sign with the Lakers it's like the fuck out of here that's what it is losers and it's what has been ya losers always have it's like an excuse for it's why they're not winners it's weird you know and I think it's a lot of it is people not having good examples around them and they've grown up getting fucked over being in a bad situation it's like we're just developing shitty people or at least people that have shitty ideas in these cycles where it just does never get better in certain spots I agree I think we're making more shitty people now there's more shitty people than before I agree but I feel like we could put a curb on that I feel like it slow it down people have to change the way they think about shit is it's this time is too short to be shitty you know and everybody's been Shady I've been shitty before I'm sure you've been a little it Jamie shitty the other day remember I'm just kidding we all have been you know it's just people have to figure out a way to do that less and resist the urge to do it that urge to do it is a bad urge it doesn't help anybody you just you just feel good because you made somebody feel bad like for what you don't even know Tony Rock why you talking shit to him like what is that dude fuck you bro but that's the reason why I know about him in the first place he's fucking low-key I know but that's like a fake that's like a fake a sense of feeling better about yourself right cuz it doesn't really make you feel better but doesn't at all and it you and it does it clearly doesn't affect me it doesn't hurt me it one bit it also defines you to yourself because you know you're not a winner because it's impossible right you think Elon Musk goes in and trolls on Twitter and says mean shit to people talks about girls asses he doesn't have the time for that right he's a winner he's busy rescuing they got those kids out of the cave in Thailand yeah that's one of those baby and well type things every few years like a little kid falls into a well why does that happen no man we need to fix Wells learn that shit should not be a year that's fall on his pinky finger off one of July 4th happens every year you think people would learn oh that's probably happening all year round Texas right places we can go to Mexico real quick sneak over there and buy fire every every 4th of July in Brooklyn it's like my closest finger I bet if they had a video across America you know how they have those time-lapse videos and you can see every kid ever documented that lost a finger in a firecracker accident like what hands are at war with fire just look across the country and see from you know from California to New Jersey and just see every Lou belated realisable Jersey oh my god that one pocket which is every year every year what did you see the NFL player they posted a picture of his hand yes it's like me it's like oh no what happened that was July 4th last year two years ago two years ago he blew up his hand he's a basketball oh my god ma T in his hand oh my god so he lost fingers yeah and millions of dollars so that was it he played again so he came back and played with a cast on his hand yeah but a big he was he still playing he could play football yeah as a defense oh okay defense yes dude what in the fuck though he blew his thumb off man and it's we're pointer finger he blew three fingers off I don't know what that is that's the middle finger that's the middle finger was his middle finger that's ringing pinky Jesus fuck man that is terrifying Wow he shared that on the fourth day like oh he posted a video was like be careful on the fourth and I saying good for him yeah yeah good for him yeah fuck those things man they're too easy to get in some spots you know like if you're on a border city just sneak over to Juarez yeah yeah that we wouldn't even see him in Brooklyn until ran around the fort and they disappeared I took a drive to Tijuana once we were working in san diego-la jolla lohanya Comedy Store we took a drive right down to Tijuana and see there's a weird feeling you get I've been to this was Tijuana in the 90s man this is like when it was still Tijuana now people go there for cheap dental work they do people sneak across the border to this is a good dentists really super cheap no cost of living over there's chi this is in Beverly Hills you want that dude to play prime real estate you need to get paid you wanna yeah you want a dentist it's like really hustling not a dentist it's out it's easier if you just know women go down do they they get fake titties in what injections whoa really yeah man in hotel rooms like a hotel what is it what is that it's the map this here's the border and there's all the dentist's right on like holy right right on the main stream right off the border isn't that crazy so you pick who's the first guy right there central yeah do you want a clinic for cosmetic dentistry holla at your boy want to get some pearly whites son I'm tired of these marijuana and coffee stains and choppers I'm going down there I'm gonna come back pretty I'm not gonna say shit Jamie I'm just gonna disappear I've been to see you on them I'm gonna tell you I'm going on a hunting trip and then I'll strike out and then I come back with some shots let me do when they go in you know we go into Miami for the weekend they come back from Tijuana with the other one fake tits are a weird one man because we'd never accept anything like that on a dude but our girl will like take it right like if a guy like fake traps I just like that look guys just put fake traps thinks they found the girls like traps yeah there was a one thing like that but you're right there's nothing that a guy could what not even close nothing's even close so we're like I'll take it I'll take it we don't care we're so much easier than them fake if I have a fake ass guys like you right don't care guys with a fake ass imagine if a girl was like you your butt is so big you must be they'll jump so high and the guys I'd I had my butt done last year girl be like what and then he said ready he said I got my butt done that's what he said then I got my butt that be his nickname they guys don't care we just like my cousin used to have a joke he said I don't give a fuck and your titties just fuck me whoa that guy's aggressive that's funny yeah well if women can hear the ridiculous shit that men say well not all the time the whole shit that makes us laugh the gross thing is people try to pretend that we mean everything we say - especially comic comedy with men in comics yeah but right now men in comedy men in Compton right right yeah that's the problem yeah just like sometimes some of these stuff with just joking you know like stop being moe so seriously most of it we're just joking yeah do you find that this is a more sensitive time for comedy that's what I'm being told and that's what I see in the news but I refuse to you know change anything I do I'm getting kind of can't write I'm not doing it yeah I'm not saying jokes didn't having to issue a statement later it's like I was saying a joke man if you didn't take it if you didn't take it the way out yeah interpreted it if you interpreted it the wrong way that's on you I'm not doing it yeah it's just supposed to be funny stupid right it was funny to somebody you know it's weird that it's okay to do in a movie like you could have some ridiculous scenes in a movie but when you have a ridiculous thing that you're saying like people take it as a fact because oh there's not even acting yeah right yeah there's no acting it's like yeah I said it yeah yo Rogen believes this yeah this is your octave thinks that yeah it's interesting I think this is a like a very unique time in communication for people it's one of the reasons why I stand up is a little bit more challenging right now I think that's all good thing man challenging is good make for a better product yeah it's all good it's all good it's all interesting what you've been working mostly these days I'm on the first quarter I was a until Mike Epps I was Mike Epps we went out from January to like March April and

Portland and San Fran and Oakland and San Diego in California and Phoenix and it's gonna be incredible man you're one of those guys who I'm like what the fuck is going on like how come people haven't caught on the fact Tony rocks one of the funniest guys alive yeah I had a lady at the show the other night she said I think the whole world is sleeping on you and I said that's fuckin best compliment ever well the thing is man you've been under the radar but getting better like I remember matters like as long as I'm getting better I'll pop up on your radio at some point I remember how long ago this conversation was how long you'd be doing comedy now 98 98 so I think we had this conversation more around the like year 2000 ish it was it was fairly recent in like you started doing stand-up we were talking at the Laugh Factory and I remember coming up to you and go dude you got good like you got good like you you really made a big jump yes Damon and you were saying I'm working man I'm out here working every day and I remember watching that set and thinking I don't remember what year this was but I want to say is like 2002 or three or something like that watch the settles like oh dude this guy's about to pop thanks thanks yeah I'll be under the radar until I'm yeah man that's the thing every time I see you getting better that that radars a good thing and then people say oh he blew up but not knowing yeah like you said it was mm we had it's a fucking grind baby how does he got to be in it it's a lot of guys a lot of guys I working at the Laugh Factory you know I see them all about Reuben Paul you know Ruben Paul sure I see Ruben Paul he's working I see uh you know I see everybody I can't I'm thinking two names I'm also named Ruben I see all the time he does is does the room there now he has a Tuesday night showed he does mmm it's like we working yeah that's how to do it it's the only way to it's the only way in this crazy business it's a weird business man and it's just you know if you stay in that work mode is so much stuff going in the world on in the world this material out there you just grab it it's out there yeah there's always something fucked up going right especially today and in your life there's stuff going on you're like okay you got to put that down I mean this is one of the strangest times I think ever to be a comedian because like where do I begin [Laughter] fuck what do I start what do i do where do I begin the whole thing's a mess man we're buddying up with dictators and knows what's happening we got a reality TV star for a president and he's actually the economy is doing well so no one knows what to say right the whole thing is chaos whoo first lady was in Playboy whoa lady was in Playboy she is the very first hot as fuck first lady right no doubt but we haven't seen all the first lady so that's true she's the very first hot as fuck first lady stylish stylish was she she was okay she's okay Melania walked in the room we start talking to Jackie no disrespect no disrespect she was a beautiful lady she certainly was she's I'm sure a wonderful woman but Melania is like stomach she's like supermodel stunning yeah especially when she was younger stunning dude you ever seen pictures of her young Melania no dude when when he first married she's a beautiful woman like undeniably yeah okay yeah well well you don't have to agree with I think she's I see some attraction there I don't know she's like holy shit I think if you around her in a party and you both out a couple cocktails Oh might go down and she touched your thigh you'd be like oh shit I just got lightheaded like Milania are we pulling a picture up what are we doing Playboy picture no just no just just take a just show a photo of Milania why can't we see the playback here we go come on side oh that's not bad she's hot as fuck it's not that one on the Left isn't not bad yeah that's her when she was younger but not much younger and I think it's just how she's wearing what she's wearing she's just more conservative now like if you look at her in the far right pic you know she's more conservative there's not even a close second she's knocked it out of the park that's a like legitimate professional hot chick who's the first lady first right save your bickering sir I stop this Michelle Obama was gorgeous that's true but a different way a different way what's this oh this is her when she was young yeah okay she'll was definitely a different gorgeous this is a different thing son look at that body sit on the couch get the fuck out of Dodge okay come on all right you got it you got that it's like the beginning that door song come on come on that was nice that's wolf that is uh that's top of the food chain right there apparently she isn't into looks as much maybe she just likes the way he treats her it's a strange strange time Tony rock you know strange I love being here as a comic you gotta love it like you said yeah um do you like living around here uh you know what I like LA I don't love it that's not like oh my god I'm such a New Yorker I just I'm used to that how long have you been living down here now but like the first three I was I would go home every you know I was here filming the TV show so mm-hmm every hiatus we got to go home and when it's show wrapped I would go on tour so I wasn't here the whole time the people who liked New York especially New York comics they say that New York comics it's more harsh like it's more fun like people insult each other yeah dislike there's a camaraderie to that he's way more camaraderie yeah way more yeah yeah I come to LA it's like oh I didn't know we were enemies I didn't know we were all against each other oh do you feel that yeah really yeah more so with black comics Oh more so black comics of course like you know that's unfortunate I got unfortunately I have the brother that everybody's like you know yeah oh he's the best and I was his brother fuck that guy this guy's regarded as the best that's his brother yeah fuck him he's gonna get passed along he doesn't have to work hard but you know everything handed to that didn't happen with the Wayans brothers like Kenan and Marlon or Damon rather why do you think that is I don't know like they did stuff together Keenen Ivory Wayans and Damon Wayans yeah like when they were both they were both famous at the exact same time yeah people forget how funny Damon was Jamie's a monster still monster still last when I used to see him in the 90s he had a last his last stand up I think he called it he's like I'm done I'm never doing this again that shit is one of my all-time favorite special yeah hilarious the Tommy Hearns piece 2d is so funny my brother said they even taught him a lot about how did you stand up oh I'm sure yeah it's still the man he was he was a guy who would come in um do late-night spots at the Comedy Store who just show up and you know they put him up whenever he got there and he would just completely explore ideas like he had no worry about right like he wasn't concerned about getting the laugh he was working it out onstage a hundred loves he was a famous guy at the time this is after In Living Color I see Dave do it all the time whenever I see Dave on stage David's like fuck this rule I'm trying to figure this shit out for ya the show right you know but you also want to entertain the room because they are the show too right so the Dave is I think the best at dancing through that line he knows how to create new material better than I think anybody I've ever seen I have you seen mark curry oh yeah mark curry yeah we'll go on stage give me a topic yeah make it a ten-minute bit yeah yeah and that shit is impressive he's such a nice guy I think he's so likable like mark curry like one of the nicest fucking guys like when he would come to the comic store everybody would light up he's just so nice it always funny Gazoo I like real relaxed like him a lot man yeah I

oh yeah tire covers what well you know I don't know but I know what you talking about there's one that a lot of people redo there's a very specific Chevy pickup truck that right there I need that I need one of those 1950 Chevy pickup wow it's crazy what they can do to those two I mean who has ever saw a nice if you looked at one of those in the flesh in 1950 that someone would have something like that in 2018 that looks like something from a movie 50 of cars it costs what six thousand dollars in 1950 did it even cost that much let's guess how much did a pickup truck cost in 1950 I say $1,500 I'm gonna say 3500 how much the pickup cost in 1950 here we go drum roll please nothing popped up off the top they might be giving me pricing for now oh did you write how much did a pickup truck cause there's people price of in retail price in 1950 maybe that's it mmm-hmm people listening there's a board out of the fucking mind right now but do you really care why do you care what a pickup truck cost 1950 are they watching live some people hey people there's a slight delay nice Oh curses no my curse just does the internet I think it's too late we already fucked about how much it cost 12:43 1,200 yeah what are you three twelve forty three one thousand two hundred forty three dollars that's crazy insane hi tenant current value thirty thousand nice so yeah I gotta get one that's what you want why I pickup truck not a muscle car no I want that I want that I want that spunky debate it first oh right 75 minute four right yeah of course I want a Lincoln Continental with the suicide doors the smoke in the band are you gonna have the Firebird on the front end yeah same one I want to I want the the afford last thing that Eleanor yes yes the gone in 60 seconds car and that's wrong that's one of the best looking cars of all time probably thee yeah probably the 66 Corvette beautiful car those are great Gardasil call I have a 65 convertible do you really yeah Louisville you know yeah the great cars a full piece of machinery it's crazy look right there look back the top comes off like just right there Wow cars ever made is that a 67 Jamie that's what it says yeah that is incredible is it called Eleanor before that movie or that come from something from the movie yeah no I think it means something I think Eleanor when you say it backwards like whatever the acronym is the what find it it's the the I think that's they did I think they took some kind of tuner thing some someone's name and used it backwards it's like Roanoke is that it there so I remember very vaguely the story how they came up with the name Eleanor anyway see if you can find it yeah definitely need that yeah that right there the dopes fucking car super dope maybe I'm thinking the opposite maybe what I'm thinking of is someone made a car that's like Eleanor but they spelled it backwards I think that might be it it just said Eleanor is the only afford one Mach one in history to see if a car title credit take the word Eleanor and spell it backwards and Google that I think there's a car that they're making where they spell Eleanor backwards I think this is where I'm getting it the Hyundai rule a new Hyundai rolling lay yeah what would be Eleanor 2005 or on a ol Mustang ah see there it is yeah that's what it is that's where I fucked up yeah so this is a Mustang that they were there were spelling Eleanor backwards to make a dope Mustang oh okay okay not bad yeah not bad for a modern car right fun that's nice those are like modern muscle cars look at that shit oh those cars like that year like into the 2015's and 16s when they kept though they got rid of the live rear axle somewhere around I want to see like pretty recently like 2012 or something like that when when was the the the latest Mustang released the latest model Mustang before that they used to have a solid rear axle like a muscle car like handle terrible but it's but it was fun a go but you would stomp on the gas and thing would go sideways it would burn out everywhere it was really like having a modern muscle car with like anti-lock brakes and Wow a stick shift and you buy it from the factory with 550 horsepower and ridiculous car then they got all the way up to 700 and the last models the last models of the GT 500 there were 700 horsepower front wheel rear wheel drive Wow axle that's insane yeah big crazy rear axle bouncing all over every every pothole you hit the car goes sideways black I need that but they apparently that's like great though those old-school e muscle cars for grip in the ground there's something about having everything all in one feel in offices right those two black stripes on the asphalt as it goes sideways what do you say you have a 60 65 Corvette yeah I love it it's an old Rumble and believe from what I just read that that car was only made made for maybe even used in that original movie and the guy that made at HB Tobi Helene II wrote starred and directed that movie so oh wow it's his car so but I think they made several versions I saw a video of them selling one of them they were selling one of them online yeah but there's a company called classic recreations they make those now they'll though make you so you can get a frame yeah no they do the whole thing from the beginning out and they make you like a brand new version of a 1967 Mustang but with modern engine modern suspension but if you're some rich dude who just you know you Lukas want one there's the thing about this like flossin right but if you have a Lamborghini you look at this guy's doors go up you know there's something about that right the Lamborghini was made for Ferrari same thing you pull up well I don't like look at this motherfucker making it whoa but if you pull up in one of those things that's that's a different kind of enjoyment that's like you're driving around in a art piece exactly you know that's a slice attention grab a storyteller that's that's like people are just gonna stop you yeah that's like an a-plus in terms of like the impact it has on on guys in particular see but girls don't care about that as much like oh I think muscle car I think chicks will dig that one I think that one that one's so pretty big the long ball man like what is that yeah pull up pull down photo up again that's silver one the 1967 silver one that you just had up look at this again club yeah Jesus Christ it's pretty do you know much the one from the movie sold for at auction let me guess $700,000 4 million 1 million Wow yeah Wow what the main one from John wick or from Al Ghanim 60 seconds now in John wick that's what it was it wasn't the Eleanor one I'm remembering wrong it was them they were selling one of the must Hanks in the movie John wick he had a 69 he had it wasn't I don't know but if he had a nice prime the movie right hit a 69 that got stolen right got killed his dog and stole the car and then he got a 70 Chevelle well that's another you know that's 70 yeah that's 70 Chevelles class that's a good one that's hollow I got to get an Impala to Anita in Harlan you know it's even more classic than I said look at that god damn man that's a 69 I think that's a Mach 1 is how it is yeah whoo look at that I'm makes me fucking I get weak in the legs and I see a car like that I'm like oh my goodness look at that thing that is America it's like two pieces that I think yeah they do not drive that good they do not because that looks pretty stock they do not handle very well really no terrible yeah if you have like a modern Honda Accord you'll blow that thing off the road thanks for real you Britt that's goddamn work of art though you know up in that thing you take the Honda code I'll take that look at that look how pretty that is that might be one of the best-looking cars of all time know that Illinois is yeah top three go to that one in the upper right hand corner young Jamie look at that fucking thing Jesus 1969 Mach 1 dude Hendricks was alive that is if I was out that is a sexy vehicle right there Hendrix died in 69 right you could you could have been on your way to a goddamn Hendrix concert in that car in 1969 you would be the man you imagine you pick up your girl shit at a concert net people you know people were just different then mmm nice yeah and Jake's probably would pull up the concert right I'd be a car Hendrix to drive he was a guitar in the passenger seat yeah I found out there was a house that was for sale that Hendrix almost bought I like in Topanga Canyon he's apparently on his way to buying it when he died what is that t-tops son damn that's Jimi Hendrix Corvette holy shit see if you find the other pictures of that thing yeah that's the sexy cause it should look like a shock god Jimi Hendrix had a baby that's just a different one but yeah those are crazy-looking go to that other one that was just on that this is it right here that's so there's only a couple of pictures of the car from the top two Corvettes damn he had two Corvettes those both his back to back is that what we're looking at two different ones it's the same car oh yeah Jimi Hendrix knew how to live old-school man dinosaur beautiful beautiful car yeah what do you drive Tony I have a Cadillac like it I like it I got a cattle which one you got I got the STS as Mazdas old now I was actually gonna buy a new car like next couple months count I don't I don't know what I want to have a crazy new sedan coming out which one is some something V some big Ford or super-powered ultra-comfortable waiting for have you seen the El Mirage can you pull up the Cadillac El Mirage etl mi Raj I've been waiting four years for this car and every time I go to the Auto Show they're like yes coming next year so I wait wait wait that sounds like a superhero and a Robert Rodriguez movie the El Mirage look at this motherfucker whoo for years Cadillac I've been waiting for this car whoa every Auto Show yeah next year that is slick that's a two-door yes holy shit I've been waiting patiently for this car you know when we were kids we thought about what cars would look like in the future that's what they would look like a good future look at the front end of that thing like the headlights those are crazy look at that man that has such a futuristic like pause there for that picture and make that a little bit bigger that has such a futuristic shape to look at the level on the inside and look at that grill look how that grill integrates with like this is how girls go with shoes like oh my god do you see how strappy they are and you save you a girl like I don't get it this is it right here you're not gonna get it this it's so strapping for years I believe for this car why you such a Cadillac dude my father drove the Cadillacs tribute to my dad I like that last call my pops had before he passed away was a burgundy cadillac and the ice cream but he loved it so much and I didn't you know growing up in New York I didn't need a car right when I moved to LA I was like oh should I got to get a car to get around like what am I gonna get tributed a Cadillac I love it that's a good move yeah they make some old-school cars too that you could actually get fixed up and drive yes yes some 70s we're gonna get a whole D and put it and put it in the hands of the caretaker fix it up get you one of them definitely I'll do that two-door Eldorado's what color what color like a money green Oh like like the Bishop Don Juan you can have a more green woman scratch that will then scratch that will go burgundy [Laughter] I don't know girl running up in my car in-n-out burger like I got your money daddy I like the Burgundy I like Burgundy liquid Oh like a little bit of a metallic flake to it ice oh yeah yes all fresh chrome riding those things man I mean you got to respect the fact that it takes a long time to stop those fuckers convertible El Dorado looking at a 76 convertible El Dorado oh my god what a shape what a shape that was back when they didn't know what the fuck aerodynamics was like what didn't oh that's what that's what we talking about right there look at that thing look at that what years that Jaime 67 God people just drove these enormous boats look at the size of the trunk it's crazy that trunk can fit like a smartcard yeah you could easily sleep in that trunk no problem that's nice they just went through a period of time where they were making these giant boats like the the suicide door continental you talked about that's a long time closet yeah all the time classic gotta love that yeah that's another one best cars probably ever made you know it's another best car ever made that I would never want to park anywhere 1968 charger I saw a 1968 charger all done up Dukes it has it it's similar is that is that year 68 or 69 one of those years he's one of those years as badass but those cars they were just black sharks like a big long boats they weren't like in any likely that that's not in any way practical in terms of its shape like it's got to be that wins got to go into that grill in a weird way and probably slows it down it's like having a little mini parachute in the front of your hood I'm sad I don't know shit I didn't know about aerodynamics back then well I think go back to that original picture man that original one was beautiful look at that thing that's what I'm talking about like that car just represents a different world that's not fast and furious right yeah yeah right or similar something similar similar years there's something about 1978 got weird because then they put the bumper all around the front like a big oval you see you ever see that no yeah this car yeah pull up 1970 charger 1970 got weird like somebody got crafty look at the front bumper oh yeah yeah hey hey come here that's like put it back yeah what did you do put it back you had something pretty black one go to the black one right above it where the headlights they roll up they roll up like a 69 Camaro your Co 69 yeah it flipped yeah those things flip that was like the rage back then man people love roll up headlights that's a good picture Jamie but the other ones better because you could see the no no the black one right next to it because you can see the other block yeah that weren't there because you can see the grill like makes out like a little bigger like look how goofy that is look how goofy that grill is the bumper and the the griller like there it's I got an up bumper and a down bumper like what are you doing why did you do that don't do that you had it perfect you fuck some guy was like you know but yeah yeah those people aren't coke it was the 70s they were like you know fuck double bump it let's do it double bumper bumper up top or the bottom it's my thang bro you gonna push that through to the GM hey did you bring up my idea about the double bumper top I'm on the bottom tell me mash the fucking move it's one look at that just doesn't look as good it's still expose it's still the original picture was the one yeah now go to in 1969 1969 is a sweet spot that's when they nailed it and then they fucked it up they should have made the 1969 charger ooh yes it was yes that was tooks or hazard look at that one that black one up on the upper left-hand corner right there upper left yeah right there look at that oh my goodness what a shape those people just had a different way of looking at automobiles they weren't confined by what's the spot big Bob's Big Boy and a pass by I never stopped him I've been to similar things I've been to the LA Auto Show too it's pretty interesting but I guess those cars and coffees and things never done one of those no I heard those are pretty badass people I pull up with weird cars chill and I was always showing up by some Berbick people they have them all over the place they have them in fucking Irvine and all over the place yeah I do every year and I asked about the El Mirage and you're like yeah next year you are just obsessed with Cadillacs got to get it that's interesting how to get it so no matter how big you get Catalano I'll have other cars okay but it's gonna be a caddy but that's your main daily driver probably [Laughter] got to get it I like it man I like it it's a different it's a different kind of luxury car you know and they're really doing it right now - yeah you know what's doing it right the new Lincoln Navigator you see that thing gigantic the thing is crazy big man I think it's big it's do you like it yes yeah I've ridden them before yeah they're amazing I got a test driven one but I've ridden as a passenger in one I was like this thing is badass yeah yeah I like the new was foreign but the new BMW 7 mm-hmm whoo it's like a couch going industry you just it's some insane amount of money greater than $60,000 so most is this one version of it that's the most expensive BMW they have ever made and it's supposed to be the most technologically advanced and I like the new the Porsche - the four-door Panamera man yeah that's the difference between living here and living in New York living in New York so many people don't have cars just you really don't need one yeah like if you have a car New York as a luxury business then you thought you have to find parking in you go fuck this carbon brother kitty had a car for like a summer it was like miss I gotta get up and move it every morning and when I go into the city I gotta find parking yeah and when you drive down the street you see ones with boots on them people don't they don't realize why you see them tickets just piled up put a ticket on top of a ticket yep I don't know LA sometimes people say hey if you already have a ticket they won't put another one I don't know in New York they don't they'll put a ticket on top of a ticket I use like a summer I decide that's a different kind of living living with no car living in the bird he had a Ford Thunderbird like it was like a well older 100 mm flaws were weird yeah too many tickets you know what's weird like that Thunderbird didn't really totally work but the Challenger worked perfect yeah the new yes people like oh Jesus yeah you nailed it you gotta rip the Thunderbird people like what are we doing here is this an old car it's in a new car we don't know are we did they stop making that right yeah they don't make it anymore yeah charges great I don't think Ford makes anything other than Mustangs and trucks I think they gave up on every single car they may bring in a Bronco back I know that yeah bring in a Bronco back I think that was a move they made would you say Jamie have a focus I think they decided that we know recently you're not counting the Ford Focus which might real cars I think recently they said they're gonna cancel every car except the Mustang and they're just gonna make trucks really yeah yeah somebody went fucking crazy well I think they're probably make that Ford GT too and limited numbers but yeah I think the Saleen yeah that's a different company that takes a Mustang and then they put an aftermarket kit on it oh yeah yeah that's Steve Celine's company they do Corvettes and a bunch of other shit too they do a bunch of different it's like Hennessy you ever heard that Hennessey Hennessey performance I've heard of Hennessy performance or like Shelby they take they take these cars and they'll you know like say like they do it to a El Dorado or El Dorado way they'll do it to Escalade they'll do it to Corvettes Mustangs they'll take a regular car put a thousand horsepower in it oh wow and sell it so it's but it's not I mean it's not just a Corvette it's a Hennessey Corvette now it's like you know like a Saleen Mustang is like it's like a Shelby Mustang kind of similar but Shelby they sell from the Ford dealerships some Ford dealerships sell salines some of them do like you can buy them a few how much you ain't drunk when I'm drunken my performance on Hennessey performance Ford to stop making all passenger cars except the Mustang I don't like an explorer yeah so they're just doing trucks yeah then the Bronco but that's it we do one car that's weird that's the Bullitt car that's the tribute to the Steve McQueen movie that's what that green car is look at that thing damn that is gorgeous great movie by the way yeah it is a great movie they nailed it though see Ford nailed it with these Mustangs they figured out a perfect way to make a shape that makes you think about old cars but looks like a new car what do they call it a old to the Past yes a no to the past that's nice young Tony rock Tony I gotta wrap this up we just talked about car last sorry sorry but people please go see Tony rock no bullshit you one of the
