let's be honest if you were entering into a bodybuilding contest I would say this guy does not want to win okay he is not trying to win sexiest man I don't even look good in Europe oh oh it sounds nothing anything wrong with that so death death squad Scotland and death squad Ohio are losing their fucking minds because they're told you stop communicating with those people you don't know them have not vetted them sir I know it gets quite a higher there on you see yeah you Brian does know yeah none of you motherfuckers have a proper filter in place we need to fucking set up some scientific checks and balances much like the CIA uses if this uh can't just decide you can let some other fucker send you some whiskey oh I can't cope enough we have a refrigerator here we're still not fucking around ladies and gentlemen okay we're taking this to the next level Bert Kreischer to see what we're doing here I got my own Buddha I got a fucking care package from on it yeah you got a care package from on it and we got the Buddha responsible for my tattoo we've got the Buddha hi guys oh yeah are you dumb-butt tattoos are you gonna are you gonna I'm gonna fill in my right arm you're right on the guy who did my arm first of all he's a beautiful artist and he's a cool motherfucker his name's Aaron Dellavedova and he works at guru tattoo in San Diego I did I would get tattooed just to hang out with that dude he's so cool I wonder that I will but he's a real artist he is really cool paintings and I love his like his point of view like it's so uniquely his own that you remember that guy that was Jesse James brother who was married to Sandra Boyd that affair with some girl with the swot I saw no no no she didn't have that yes yes no no no no no no no she was not a white power no no no no no yeah she don't know she does she did not know she definitely did no no no shit swastikas tattoos some topics no swear to god though so she's really telling you I'm showing you I'm telling you wrong what's her name it's like Michelle dynamite or something like that no but anyway my point is that she had this sleeve and I looked at the sleeve and I said that's an errand dellavedova tattoo I could tell that his style is so distinctive and I'm I'm such a huge fan of individual points of expression well are like like there's certain like pool cues well you could look at the pool cue and you know that is a there's a queue that Eric crisped me that is a cognoscenti that's a queue to Joe gold made they have like this individual point of expression Michelle Michelle McCain yeah she didn't uh she doesn't have tattoos it's like some crazy photo shoot that she had although it does say WP on her leg yeah like as in white power what it means or WP I don't think what what else what was my point about her you were talking about your tattoo artist did her arm or something I saw her arm and one of her arms I think it's a right sleeve yeah his style is so distinct did you serve that guy out well I looked in California and I was looking at all these different you know it's like you if you there's a lot of really good artists in California even Kat Von D who we've had on the podcast oh she was a great podcast yeah she was really cool there's just so many like I don't even wanna name names yeah she's a million talented artists but when I saw Erin's work online especially sleeves and big back pieces like his style is really about big bold like pieces yeah and when I started talking to him like immediately we hit it off I was like this girl's coolest fuck he's so cool like him right away like I was like like you know what you talked to someone you really like happy to have a conversation with you and we were like on a the perfect level like you really like it you know both of us were talking about all kinds of like different crazy shit and he's our he's an honorable person he's an artist it's like right away I know right away it's perfect guy to do it what did you guys do if you if you remember I'm curious to see if you remember what did you guys talk about while he was tattooing you everything in anything man like do you remember any of the commerce it like is it yeah we have it on but is it like a meaningful we have at the beginning are you serious first sleeve yeah the beginning of the first sleeve a lot it was on video but then the second sleeve is like like about three years old I still have to go back I still there's a few spots on it to me most of it is a miyamoto musashi piece it was the guy who is the oh and there's the graphics joker I thought you got rid of the graphics chair yeah I thought you did too I think they should pimp that out remember really even before I knew what a graphics Joker would you do it right stupid idea yeah she's just cry you did that's my did I drew that in 1990 it looks like shit now it's like it oh my guy who better than water if the guy who tattooed it for me did a fucking brilliant job his name was Danny Williams and he died of cancer really recently and the bottom tattoo that really crazy-looking samurai God that is Miyamoto Musashi and he's fighting a tiger and that's what happened what happened to you sick artwork man like that's all that's all my man errant dellavedova's work and he just said the air he does brilliant work it's yeah the beach what was the what was the turn what for you like were you you went from like one tattoo and not smoking weed to like well I don't maybe I've heard well they don't but what it was um I I always liked like tattoos I always liked the artwork of it I'm a big fan of I'm a big fan of music I'm a big fan of writing I'm a big fan of meat movies and cars and and and paintings and anything that you do that expresses whatever you have inside of yourself through some medium whether the medium of making a hot rod or it's the medium of even designing clothes like I'm like like I'm wearing some crazy t-shirt right now some dude gave me it's a Bruce Lee who's uh he's acting as a DJ I thought that was hilarious so it's great it's funny yeah it's it's someone's idea that's expressed through clothes you know you can express it through furniture like this fucking tables badass yeah I mean you can express it through anything but it really it's all the same thing is that everything that a person can enjoy is someone else trying to express some sort of positive idea through whatever medium it is whether it's a fucking whether it's Li Miserables it's fifty Shades of Grey it's all the same thing but what was the turning point do you remember the thing no no I was probably some psychedelic drug related experience likely yeah yeah that was the what got you there um well if marijuana is a gateway drug I'm really unfortunately a good example they don't think that it's a negative gateway I think we have to get over that idea and I think a big part of the struggle that we have in this country it's a lot of conservative people misunderstand the position of people that support marijuana or cannabis and it doesn't mean that they're mutually exclusive and it doesn't mean they have to be in combat with each other it just means that for whatever reason as a society we have associated cannabis smokers and users with lazy bitches and that's stupid and I think that if I have benefited as an unnecessarily aggro you know child of the 80s if I have benefited from the magical gift of marijuana then I bet you can too it just needs to be used properly and it's gonna make you examine yourself in a way that may be uncomfortable but is most likely necessary you know and the ideas that we have connected to any sort of psychedelic experience marijuana or peyote knee you name it mushrooms automatically people of a conservative nature will assume that the people involved in doing this thing are being lazy or they're being they're being frivolous they're being frivolous because they've decided to like seek escape through chemicals rather than deal with the reality but if they really knew they would know that that's not the case if they really had experience they would know that no it's the exact opposite this I hate to fucking bring up this goddamn radio lab show again they were talking about religious experiences and people who did acid and and they and there was a there was a they were talking about they took these kids it stood in school took him down to a church setting where a church sermon was giving going on they're all religious teachers okay all religious teachers like religious students they all take acid they hear a sermon in the church at the beautiful bells and they said that nine out of ten people in the test group so there's twenty ten have a cell of a bull ship you know the placebo ten another 100 to ten had a religious experience and they were saying that that nine out of the ten also went on to teach in the ministry like 9/11 deal that took acid they were talking about the concept of whether or not you could do acid and whether or not you could create original religious experience and if you could why wouldn't you have that all the time why wouldn't everyone look for that well what we're talking about earlier but like one day maybe we can get our shitty brains to accept a state of opiate time all the time I want like a low-grade cocaine let me think about what's going on I mean all respect to people who are on antidepressants and this is not an antidepressant rat and I think quite honestly that there's quite a few of those rants that are they're ignorant and even though you know we had a conversation with Cara Santa Maria who was on the pot fucking loved her that girl was so fucking ivory Gurjit ated some of her facts in conversation not realizing I'm doing it I fucking was so I was afraid to google her and see what she looked like so I was like what is she's not hot cuz she was so hot on this podcast just listen to her you were like oh she's being smokin and as ours more importantly she's very fascinating very very very really fascinating and blows my point in a row so you know are you taking off yeah next week I'm taking her home didn't he wondered double date nope he do revenant sticker this dog blocking the fuck out of you but anyway the point was that she was describing her own personal benefit from from using antidepressants and her own personal you know her personal benefit from like regulating her state of consciousness but with the use of science and would you really stop and think about it like the some of the best feelings that I've ever had have been under under the influence of chemicals you know whether it's right now or whether it's the first time I ever did anything which was an MDMA anything else with significance when when that feeling is so sensational like what would life be if that feeling existed all the time we automatically have this thought in our head that that cannot be managed and that needs to be discarded right away immediately for the state of consciousness that you exist right now can never be elevated this is what it is but we even know that's true I wonder sometimes because I go I like I feel like I spend my day chasing uh chasing a buzz where it's like like coffee in the morning and then there's this like dead beer in the afternoon for the beer when you feel it's respectable to start drinking at 5:00 5:00 p.m. yeah 5:00 p.m. hello woman at 5:00 p.m. I can say leave me alone hard at work who keeps the fucking lights on some of the best moments of my life are my wife had a job we were living in a partly complex we had a nanny only because I was on the road and sometimes a nanny and I would overlap and I'd be there when she would be there the best feelings my kids are there Sun setting in Hollywood my wife walking up in the door and just going did anyone open a bottle of wine Oh motherfucker I remember getting like chills like it's Christmas Eve like oh we crack open a bottle of wine we pour home for the nanny we just sit on the couch at socks fuck love I love those kind of moments you love like ultimate relaxation moments where everybody agrees yes it's time where everyone's on the same page open the bottle everybody agrees oh it's great that's why you're like sort of the ultimate party Meister it's like you you're the guy that would get it but uh fuck it Burt was to do shots let's do shop so we doing shots give me hug you fucks I love you and everybody we get together I think yeah I love that feeling when like it's like just fucking someone just goes I go was gonna be awkward ever if I order a beer and some wannabe like if you got one I'll get one I'm like we're fucking drinking Yeah right away I can love that feeling you think that's what the feeling people get when they connect when they smoke marijuana is that someone likes it and then they're like they're like okay like it's such a great like there's definitely a thing that comes with being like in that sort of fraternity of people that know you know yeah they know you'd smoke pot everybody's in this like overall cool is right as much as you sort of accept a traditional notion of reality like if you've never gotten high you and I have very little to talk about I mean we can talk about a few things for certain we can talk about facts and statistics and history numbers we can talk a lot about a lot of things but we can't talk about what the fuck is going on when you think about someone and then the phone rings that's them you can't talk about that because you're gonna give me some scaredy-cat answer you're gonna go well there's no relationship whatsoever there's never been a statistical correlation between you thinking about someone and then them calling you and that meaning anything significant whatsoever it's just nonsense and you get a rip and put a tie on wear some shiny shoes with slippery soles and walk down the street like a gentleman hmm I don't know but I know that when I a little light bulb goes off in my head and I think about Bert Kreischer and then I look down at my phone and it starts ringing immediately and it's Bert Kreischer will call me crazy but I think something's up okay I think there's something fucking going on when I think about you and then all the sudden you call me immediately it happens every day non-stop and you know when it happens you ready for this Brian Redman it happens when you live in your life correctly when you live in your life correctly the universe gives you a lot of fuckin secret messages like yesterday this is something crazy as an example yesterday I was talking to my friend who's a ginger and I'm like is there such things as Jewish gingers I've never even heard is like I've never seen a Jewish ginger before she was like of course there is and then like two hours later somebody else just was like oh this guy he's a ginger he's a Jewish ginger have you ever seen money I'm like all right I've never talked about ginger Jewish Ginger's my whole entire life now twice in one day this is a possibility that you attracted that there's a possibility that much like you ever sent an email on Google you know it could be about anything you just like send an email and say hey man I'm looking to get a life-size copy of the robot from lost in space yeah and then you look in the corner of your Gmail when you get on and it'll be all lost in space shit that's because they're reading you're right right right exactly you think somebody's reading my so if I like the theory already this is my point if reality is a simulation wouldn't it follow the same principles that your Gmail or your Yahoo has where you'll see the corners where shit you've sent emails about will be reoccurring themes in your life I do that in life all the time I put it out there but isn't it faster mirrors it mirrors what we know is a program yeah oh that's fucked up it's true you're right yeah it's just the fucking natural course of history of how life's gonna go down it already happens in life God does it will the universe the drink trickles on to you you sound like you're right for a cult okay fucking give me some Blue Knight suck my dick in a house full of feathers I quickly put new cult I've been watching this documentary on the Vice guys made a documentary about this fucking dude who's a he's the new Jesus he's a Siberian Jesus have you seen that Brian listen ladies and gentlemen I pull it up no we shouldn't pull it up because it's a really long piece those vice guys are crazy it's at least I've only watched the first two 10-minute pieces but it's fascinating there's a guy in Siberia that's created a village and he's like the second coming of Jesus is like the new Jesus and he has thousands of people have delivered up their thousands they're all living up there but meanwhile the living believably an unbelievably beautiful place I mean it is stunning if maybe maybe perceiving it find some photos but it's it's staggeringly beautiful and this guy he's not preach anything bad except being a vegan that's silly but I gotta have vegan fucking even when I was doing that cleaning Jesus I'd have chicken with fucking lettuce wraps oh I love spicy shit yeah I wish that animals weren't so fucking delicious it's too fucking amazing and I wish that they didn't fucking keep making animals maybe they would just all live forever and everyone will be immortal when we have enough numbers now and just keep it going I had duck horses dude that's who's let me have the photo of the dude who's the Russian Jesus meanwhile he's get an awesome spot I don't think I ever saw Jesus smile yeah well he does when Green Day's be sad he's heard the Jesus all Jesus's pictures were like hip-hop cover albums like just was a the Australian Jesus is a guy in Queensland and he says he's Jesus so it was just in Queensland what's that I love what you do we just know we did a trip flip in Australia Oh in Queen fucking Australia well that's country I've ever been to I'm telling you want to say this and I'm not shit on America and I'm not shitting on Kanaka Canada can you guys are second but Australia blows everyone away I love I I love the people there I love their attitude it's like that we are so uptight in this country we're really so unbelievably uptight especially when it comes to like going out and having fun and relax I've moved Australian a fucking heartbeat you know heart it's like there's this thing about America that America was sort of founded and created by a bunch of people that have come here from somewhere that sucked and they had enough and they just made it over to some new spot but I think that the the the type of person that it takes to be able to get in a boat and travel across the ocean and land aside man I think it takes several generations before everybody fucking relaxes that's the badass motherfuckers that could get a boat and fucking do that cuz you just shook the the the the loose Leafs got shaken off the tree they were they're so gangster they got a goddamn boat and travelled across super distance with no radio and everything about that though when you travel with your kids somewhere and then you go how would we travel across America like how would how would your family size up you know in a wagon train going from New York to LA my family would've either stayed I mean if you had little children you didn't stayed in Italy or Ireland you would have done whatever you could do to stay where you were but my grandfather's family came over here and I want to say the early 1900s my grandfather's family came over here from Italy yeah and my grandfather lived on a farm and he said tell me stories about how they used to kill rabbits with their hands I grabbed him by the neck and snap him that was like a normal part of your life and there was you know winters where like they would run out of food like there was no food they didn't have to go and borrow food from people that were neighbors so crazy times man it's crazy I know it's crazy more reasoning that is the like and I say this I said this guessing Lee but like the amount of humility your grandfather must have had he was a very humble guy it's like to come here almost too humble you know I got walked on by my mother my grandmother was a really strong woman and she's a yell at him all the time I was like a little kid he's my mom had me when she was 20 and you know my mom did her best but she was really young you know when you're 20 years old and also and you're raising a baby that's a 21 was 21 when I was born or when my my mother was 21 rather when okay dirt I was 10 when I was born I might as well been I would probably feel like oh my god this bitch is 21 she doesn't know what the fuck is going on I gotta get up to 20 grand parents are like 87 no they're all 40 it could have been no no at the time you were born I don't know they forgot me to wrap my head around now I don't want to do the math but the point was my you know my mother was young and so like growing up for like a mother that doesn't necessarily know what the fuck is going on it makes you realize that a young age like oh shit makes you start looking at everything a little differently I don't think she can make eggs see she was okay with that they're both in this fucking crazy thing together you know you realize like kind of early on that's crazy I can't imagine being I can't imagine that my biggest hiccup in life was getting into stand-up because my my I just that bat I didn't I didn't have any humility at that time of my life and my dad gave me a speech on my 26th birthday that was like fucking aggressive like like 26:20 it was on my birthday like he called me and I thought he's gonna wish me happy birthday and he was like you're a fucking loser oh my he's like you make me embarrassed I'm embarrassing you're my son I lie about you he's you know that's liked a lot of privates have a judge heard your son got his life stopped him by Oliver Stone he's in New York to stand up how's he doing because I lied in fucking court he goes it makes me sick to my stomach I was like what can I do different he goes nothing I was like well can I fix this and he does I don't know I failed you as a father and I know it got me to like it changed my life like I went he taught me how to get taught me how to be humble enough to get a job in stand-up so you just needed to work the door but I thought I was above that I thought that I was better than that like I thought that someone just grabbed me and put me on stage and I'd be discovered that's how I thought it happened I know you could literally be humble and say I want to do this how do I go about doing this please help me test someone and he got me into it and literally fucking started doing it the next night and six months later I had a deal and it was like I was the fucking one of the greatest things I ever did I look back at that so fondly those times me like outside this is every single night of hanging outside Jim Norton Bobby Kelly Patrice O'Neal calling like not comic Wayne actually he didn't I've never actually met have been told reason I just throw him in there because I started getting into a tough crowd mentality I started off in credits a tough crowd I was like me but I'm honest I never I've never met Nick either so no I mean I've seen them come I worked the door when you come into the club but I never like knew there's you see him on stage his fucking necks broke niggas Nick DiPaolo to me is one of the most underrated comedians in this kind hands down no questions asked he's kind of guy you can tell his jokes to your friend at a bar and they fucking lose their mood he had a joke about her you remember when Katrina hit dude it's it's so cruel it was so so fucked up but it goes yeah they were they were right and rescue rescue rescue signs on the row on the roof but it was signing to rescue you know signs on the roof but they were misspelling them instead of help it said HAP once I'm happy trick that fucking water if you want some happy Paulo I'm not I'm sorry NIC I butchered your joke I apologize I wish I knew his joke about I'm not gonna say justice either they a lot of people say they haven't said the N word a lot of people say that really I guess you never put $1,000 on a playoff game fuckin good NIC typologies is one of the funniest I watched Narnia north Guardian guardian it i watch the RT and RD and Nick on on on the fucking same thing I watch it and watch it cuz I respect both those guys so much that I go that it's not the best show sometimes mother this is what I think that show would be fucking magic if it was uncensored and to take Nick and Artie and put in regular roles like taking Joey Diaz and make him instead of talk right with a crayon yeah it's nonsense it's fucking stupid i watch it all the time though it's like I love Nick and Arnie someone with some fucking balls please take that show put it on the internet you'd make more money the more people listening and you could still put it on DirecTV or whatever the fuck you're putting it on it still would be but leave let Nick be Nick let Artie be re let him be crazy let it let him looking talk completely unhindered the way he what did I we were talking I was talking to someone recently about bomb lines and bomb line so good when you when you're doing bad the hecklers attacking you and you have your comeback and Nick DiPaolo has a time I am once again a butchering whatever this story is because I don't remember it but Nick said that he was getting heckled by this girl and her bachelorette party and he was on the road in some podunk town and he was like he was like ma'am I hope the next time you reach under your armpit you feel a lump because I've never had an entire crowd hate me more I'm head was scored him but he's a fucking old school like old school kind of like that's the kind of dad I wanna meet dad's it like my kids school and I wonder if they know who the fuck I am like then they then they do know who I am they figure out who I am though Google me and they'll go oh shit I knew you were this guy can be this guy around you like I wonder if like parents cuz he's got kids if they meet him and they have no clue of who he is and then like google him and then they're like oh my god I can tell this joke in front of you he's one of the funniest fucking human beings man I'm really very nice guy did you burn ooh tough crowd yeah no prob was anyone's definitive show of my life yeah I would just had my first daughter show I've been doing the road now and I knew a lot of those guys most of those guys from doing so via tragedy that shows cancelled it's so silly bullshit seems like like why would you ever I mean there's such an easy resource you know it's easy to get comedians everybody wanted to be on it it was very entertaining well get it talking to one it's pretty much a podcast yeah it was a podcast it was a limited like time a time limited podcast this listen man we're so lucky that we are existing in this time where you can do this thing what I could do whatever the fuck you want no one's telling us what to do we're do whenever one we decided to keep going we decided to end the podcast take a leak and keep going there's no producers though that's the beauty of a situation this is when greg Giraldo and and fucking dennis three hit pause for a second Brian this is our dream for keeping story because Geraldo never even went to the nuclear weapons which is plagiarism he never even went to that yeah you know he never even went to that but Leary was so Conti with him like right off the bat greg Giraldo was a fucking beautiful dude he was just the nicest fucking guy he was very intelligent in a time where in my life when no one needed to be nice to me there were two people that were distinctly nice to me and and and gentle and I was bill burr and greg Giraldo like you know Norton and and and Bobbie and all those guys were always nice to me but man Geraldo and Bill burr took time pulled me aside and like they were fucking great guys I remember one time calling in my buddy cow head show and and because Gerardo was on and calling in to listen to dourados interviews I just loved Greg and how I'd told him and Greg goes I'll put him on phone I'll talk to him and I talked to Greg for like fucking 10 minutes in between a break and a song and just was like man how's everything going he was like well yeah he was very sincere fucking fucking great guy he had a show I don't remember what Network it was on it was uh it was his sitcom it was on during when yours was right yeah yeah he talked about partying with the girl that was on your show which one the girl with the big tits who on Newsradio girls tense didn't that one girl big tits no who was the girl interesting there was beautiful girls but I always have big I thought her tits were so big dad to the table ma its mother Maura was the white girl with ya care yeah she was though that's a relief listen that's a terrible misunderstanding oh she was you'd have known that she's very beautiful and incredibly talented what incredibly tell the white one with her so bad did I just seen with her once I'll never forget this and I told her and she just sort of laughed off she's she's like really like you she wasn't she would never like brag about her talent like as an actor she was good but we did a scene together and I didn't realize that she was acting I thought she was saying something to me I was like oh that's the words oh whoa like a holy shit you badass bitch I go I didn't know you were acting I know you just fucking rocked me like she blocked me with what she would say cuz the set of Newsradio was very loose yeah there was a lot of fucking off and there was also a lot of improvisation whereas like Dave Foley was responsible for a huge amount of like what got on the air of that show because sort of like he was I sort of like I'm almost like a secret producer it was because the guys who wrote the show were like they were so open-minded and so smart and Paul Sims the who is the executive producer was just this really brilliant guy who recognized that there was a lot of people like Andy or like Phil Hartman oh yeah Dave Foley or whatever who would have this in intuition while they were on stage working out the scenes that they would come up with new things and to incorporate those new things so Dave was like constantly tweaking things and adding things and it was you know and being able to watch that and to watch someone do that and to be in that situation I was like wow this is like an ideal situation he I was the is there's gonna sound kunti not kunti but weird but uh so like last year was a very good year for me and I'm also in the middle of our school so like our kids are in third grade and like now we've been at school long enough they kind of we know all the parents and so like I was this like I was the resident famous comedian parent like oh he's a comedian I think Dave Foley's kids go to our school now and Dave Foley they were like have you heard Dave Foley like he spoke at a PTA mom parent he's a fucking amazing dad like I'm either that or it's a guy that looks like Dave Foley what do you mean he's amazing dad like he like I believe shows up and does all the shifts yeah and and they were like and I don't go to anything I don't even go to recitals like I just fucking he's a very solid dude that was a great set but what I'm saying about Morris she did she was built oh yeah she's very pretty beautiful woman she didn't have big knockers oh she was fucking haughty shit yeah she's very but you have a greg Giraldo child across from you guys you guys yeah party right and well well Greg was right next door and he was there's a lot of guys who had TV shows there was a lot of guys who like got gigs back in those days it's like they got a development deal and maybe they had a few episodes like my friend Tom Rhodes he had a show for a while can love Tom Rose he's a good dude he's a great dude and I met Tom the first time I met him was we were both on NBC I was on Newsradio and he had his own show and then he went over to Amsterdam and it's just he's Tom's beautiful he's fucking awesome he really is but he never lost his shit you know he's always been cool he's always been like that good night I bet he's a he's a Tom Rhodes is like in my opinion like a fucking legit comedian Tom Rhodes is from Florida yeah and I i-i've told him the story a number of times and he never really remembers it but we ran into each other in Amsterdam we did that Showtime special with Russell Peters and I said the fucking first time I met him I work in the Boston Comedy Club I came downstairs and he was at the bar and I knew this from Florida and I was from Florida and I like to stand up and I walked up to him and I was like I was like hey man my name is Bert I'm a comedian I just started I'd love to ask you and he stopped me like put his hand on my chest his hand on my chest I was like listen you start buying beers I'll answer every question you want I was like all right so I started I put my fucking dad's credit card down and I fucking bought beers and talk to him about comedy for like three hours great he was one of the one dudes that did the Icehouse Chronicles and we had a long conversation afterwards well I was with you yeah it was like the camaraderie is so cool here it's like we have like real comedian camaraderie he was hammered and I said yeah I was with the two I think I was with the two I was with I had a guy with me to drive me and I was like Tom let us take you to here because he was hammered yeah yeah we were trying to tell him there's no way you're good and he was like POW don't worry about me I sleep in the car I wake up and I go yeah you've slept in his car you can't do that that's illegal III just had a simulation thing happened to me Joe I that Denis Leary video that we were talking about last night I watched this movie called happy which is all about depression and stuff like that to document here on Netflix I recommend it's alright but there was a guy in the movie that was like a motivational speaker two kids and I was like who is this guy it's the guy on the right right there I've never seen this guy I never in my life Clark yeah and now he's gonna be on the podcast are you serious let me tell you something the second time I ever did stand-up for money I opened for Lenny Clark I used to say it was the first time but it's a lie ladies and gentlemen the first time I opened up a guy named Warren McDonald that's the first time I ever got paid but the second time I ever got paid the truth is I opened up for Lenny Clark and I was in a place called Jays and Pittsfield Massachusetts and Lenny he's always been like super cool to me he said look how fat Greg looks yeah well considering like comparing now at least you know that Greg would have been going hard as a horrible joke yeah the big guy by the way Lenny has lost a shitty weight yeah Lenny is really thin though he was in that series in that documentary he was pulling out towels because he wouldn't stop sweating yeah and I was I was talking to the girls with last night it was like isn't that crazy he's just standing there talking to kids and he can't stop sweating there was like sweat all over his body what documentary was it's called happy and I just saw it last night and never seen this guy before my life and I just popped this video and he's in this video it's so fucking weird where's the part where Greg and a fight we did that movie together here comes the boom the Kevin James and Lenny Clarke was in that movie because it was shot in Boston and Lenny played a local Boston guy Lenny Clarke rich I fucking love that guy but he lost a lot of weight man he lost a ton of weight he looks great I mean he's like really leave he doesn't ever I've got a tall and they could come back we could have a piece and like they did in this or is this where it says what it's it's it's about the time I think right here what happened a lot Denis Leary gets mad at greg Giraldo has prepared material it's really hilarious I don't know someone should like find this off-air and figure it out because it's a really there's a non-violent way to solve a problem with the country that we hate that hate does let's go weapons point of this I don't think so no you're right like Russia for example that big Russian war Denis Leary's obsessing about it but there are approaches there economic benefits that we're giving them in order to for them to stop developing their weapons I mean I heard recently they agreed to stop stop building nukes if American women agree to get their nails done at least twice a week good boys write so many jokes before the show it's not even funny it's unbelievable he's got a pocket full right there it's kind of what we do here the guy who lifted all the homework and then asked if there was any more that needed to be done that's a good point and if you would try a little comedy writing maybe your show and still be on the air just crushed that you know but that's the thing that happens when dudes get famous I think you guys can't come along and calm who'd tell me about it so first I'm going on the road and I realized there are killers that I've never heard of nobodies when a guy gets famous to a point where you're a Tom Cruise or any any any sort of a person's been a movie yeah Denis Leary when that came out had been in a ton of movies he had been in some really high-profile movies I mean he thought of himself as a guy who had made it so I think he probably assumed he was gonna get a certain level of respect so was maybe if you did a little writing your show would still be on the air that was like a nuclear weapon that he didn't see coming oh that was hubris you look at the look on his face and you can see his eyes twitching and you can see him going angry yeah going uh three two I got this I got this and then like bacon is making his tactical call in his head you could see that happening almost it's a superior mind yes it's superior mind just not as famous but a superior product like what he would he would put out his points of view would be superior I watched his eyes he had the idea that there would be like something funny and saying that someone prepared like a bully well that's the idea that is ridiculous like yes so crazy like oh look at the painter he wasn't painted like yeah what the fuck but it's there's there's a certain personality that and I I'm not gonna speak I'm not saying this is Denis Leary but there's certain personality that's so arrogant in that the way I say it will be so much better than the way you say it as opposed to what I say is better than what you say so like like you could hear the statement before him when he says we're gonna go to war with a country like the it was very arrogant and he was again like that great Russian war I guess that does fuckin work you're not let's say the words you're overlooking the thought wow he hasn't this idea that somehow or another he's gonna be able to solve what hundreds of Scott and heads of states and diplomats and emissary workers and no one can solve no one can solve but he's gonna come along and tell you exactly how things need to be run it's so the ideas of first of all the communication between nations where they don't even speak the same fucking language yeah how difficult that shit is it's so fucking hard just to understand things in cultural context and explain those different people that are in your country that you're sort of representing because Koreans are not like Americans and Americans and all I Koreans people that live in North Korea do not understand how we're living in North America and the people in North America for the most part really a fairly ignorant about what the fuck is going on in North Korea and one of the big reasons is because we can't fuck the communicate with each other if we could communicate with each other if everybody in Korean in North Korea knew how to speak English and they all could read the shit on the internet about how the world is run and what the fuck is really going on in the country and how the rest of the world views things they would probably slowly but surely take action but the fact that they're separate from the rest of the world yeah in fact they speak this one very unique sort of a language that's difficult to learn and you know he's in translatable very easily to English or Spanish or it's Korean not translatable it was difficult our good friends are Korean that when you go to we went to a Korean barbecue my name's Roy Choi's the guy that started the taco truck the concept of the taco truck attempt he started started the first guy the the premise of these correlation these gourmet taco trucks yeah Roy Choi he does he's good friends with Bourdain Asians don't give a fuck dude things done really do they're the fucking future of America when you eat how the fuck did they ever figure out how to get full a fold like a stranglehold on the manufacture of like electronic parts and TVs and lamp cars cars cars are over there now we're in Detroit no one's doing cars in Detroit well isn't Chrysler still in Detroit isn't forward no but no one's in Detroit Detroit's apparently imperil because everyone took their business to asia why it's more is it more is it more an idiocracy not a theocracy theocracy not theocracy is it yeah where's like where it's like the the idea of the state is better than the person so everyone looks up to the state and it's something like that where they care about their job like America just don't care well you know what happened is first of all the the cars they made sucked that that happened in America yeah this something happened we have to figure out there was a period where we got really lazy what the fuck went wrong from like 1973 to the for tempo for tempo was a fucking was a that was a phone-in job by the Americans like that's had that car sucked dick it was it sucked dick in 1989 tempo it's just hard impose a for tempo what the fuck happened to Mustang okay because 80 and say this I can say this I have a Mustang today I have a Shelby gt500 and I fucking love it okay but that's a 2010 and between like 1965 and 1972 or 73 they had some dope fucking car really like to 69 but then something happened in like the 70s and the 80s like you call that a fucking Mustang yeah what are you a communist would it would it terrorists infiltrate the fucking the the Ford plants and hold down the designers by gunpoint and gay up all the drawings I got what fuck do you call that or London gave them I spoke agh ey or none gave them Jo homosexuals like because I wonder if it was it had to do with homosexuality in the end the fear of homophobia and they took all these great gay designers that were super closeted in the 50s and then got in like there was just manliness and they disappeared are you trying to say that dick-sucking designed no there's no way you can tell me as a man what is sexy without knowing sexy as a man what the fuck are you talking about Pete owns the Corvette is the sexiest car you can put me in is it really I just drove one from Miami to Marco Island and I tell you right now the second I decide that seat I would let the steering will be close to my face because I wanted it there it was just fucking that it was gagaga was it a Corvette which year with a brand-new brand-new 3,000 miles convertible all those new ones was it a 426 I have no v no idea 426 is they have the zero six zero six engine and suspension and a convertible so fucking hot like I just felt coolie shit in that car that's not a Corvette Brian it's goddamn Miata and it's pink how dare you how dare you hate America on this podcast hating America I got poop well why don't you go poop man hold on yeah what time is your comedy show tonight Brian and can kind of uh can we guide people in your general direction I don't even know where I go I'm just gonna try to get it somewhere no when you do that what do you do you just show up and say hey my name Ryan red band you might know me on Twitter well you start start a rumor Oh Brian I did I have like three rooms ever so do you think ever will be all contained under one roof do you think that ever the full desk quad family will have podcast studios in one gigantic warehouse because that's what I'm saying I'm saying we also duplicate this at the onic compound in Texas why don't why not yes Austin my offense thousands of acres our own Lake Plus deer to shoot how do we get it how do we get a power bitch did I'm say what what we can have our own fucking satellite okay how do we get how do we get like a death squad like studio in a warehouse where we can make TV shows well I don't why not why not because image I'm bad I just need to be an umbrella listen if I make a TV show this is my next TV show I'm gonna play pool pool not boring boring it's not for you bitch-slapped 99% of the other show is we are very close to sign I can't say it with who there's a there's a show that is a lot of it is based in the podcast what are you doing taking text messages no come on live on the air no this person said that they got a new phone number they're like sorry I got a new phone number and I thought they were lying but now they're sending me pictures of this is that is that who is that it's not see is that Gaddafi yeah I said might be not the person I'm thinking okay what's up what's the new TV show you're doing oh it's uh it's based a lot of it Islands like controversial subjects it'll be it'll stall of it we'll start off from the podcast like examining all sorts of different there's no tenets well we sort of have a tentative title but I'm not necessarily happy with it so the idea is like the way we've done the podcast will we explore all these different ideas whether it's shamanism or ghosts or Bigfoot or UFOs or fringe topics crop circles reincarnation psychics and we're gonna talk about it on the podcast like I'll have a guy like you or Ari or Duncan or Joey or any comedian come on and we'll say you know what it's like we'll do it right now what do you think about Bigfoot do you think do you think that is possible there could be an undiscovered primate that people have been talking about reporting for ages and it's somehow another eluded photography except for a few really questionable photos and some really fucking shitty video that looks fake as fuck put all that aside put all the hoaxes aside do you think it's possible I think it's possible hundred percent why do you think cuz I believe whoa yeah I believe I believe in Loch Ness monster I believe in - pecan fly do I believe I can fly yeah yeah yeah Kelly pee on you if you're a fourteen-year-old girl you know why you were there in the first place I definitely believe that I have the capability to fly in my body I just haven't figured it out and once we do tap into that I will be able to fly okay but like Bill Hicks used to say start on the ground floor little thinks that a great joke about a young man who I'm asked it thought he could fly left to his death what a tragedy goes what an idiot because you thought he can fly why do you start off from the ground do you feel like that I remember when Star Wars Star Wars Return of the Jedi came out no no Empire Strikes Back came out I remember watching Luke move stuff with his mind and I remember being back in my car trying to do that hardest fuck like staring at objects going like I swear to God I was like that it seems logical well there's certain aspects of life it seems so preposterous electricity where fuck is that it just hits you have you seen those Teslin is like experiments where he's like touching electricity and it was like a Bolton's flying yeah big Tesla coil and it's connected to his arm hold on have you seen NS photos did Tesla just come have you seen the new Tesla fucking car did you see them all explode when Hurricane sandy hit the the beach in in New Jersey what yeah there was a whole warehouse didn't like this they were they had a dock and they had all these new Karma's that's what it was the Fisker Karma wasn't a Tesla's Oh badass well they grant it looks gorgeous so there's quite a few really beautiful electric cars right now but the Fisker Karma is the one and they have like a 16 of them I think exploded on the docks because they had him on the docks and the water came up on the water hit these fucking electric cars transformer yeah fucking blew up and everybody was like oh oh okay shit I don't think they knew that would happen what every driver fucking standing water what have you driving home from a flood is your fucking car explode okay because I can deal with my car shorting out they're scared if I can save like two bucks a gallon but my car explodes when I hit a puddle is that gonna happen is that what the fuck is really going on that Tesla looks bad is shit we've won it was either murdered murdered Motor Trend or Road track car of the year one of those big magazines made it the car they are the Tesla not the Roadster but the larger car something that something asks it's like a four-door and apparently it's just a marvel of engineering but the real problem is gonna be state taxes on roads the roads are go to shit there's a lot of problems the another problem is the fact that everybody wants to pretend that and buying some sort of an electric car removes you from the fossil fuel food chain yeah but it doesn't look in fact it connects you with some even shadier mineral so I'm like a really large scale like lithium ion and all those different minerals a lot of those are conflict minerals they come from the Congo they come from Afghanistan they come from like if I was Brian Cowen I'd say Afghanistan if I was amber Lyon I'd say please not in the Bahrain claim um the you know these counties minerals that you you need to create lithium ion battery by the way mad loves Bryan Callen and mad love to Amber line which is fucking with you those two make batteries they come from like really fucking imprisoned in poverty areas their conflict minerals lithium ion is officially like a conflict mineral like a lot of shit that you need to even make cell phones just like I think the Vice had a guide they had they did a vice guide to travel episode where Shane Smith went to the Congo and they were I don't know why there's no channel I would love to see one of their fucking shows cuz it's too deep they go to the same shit Bourdain does no they go way further than Brody way further they said I'm in close sound clothes we're vice vice goes to the fucking Congo deep deep deep and talks to warlords really they go looking for dinosaurs yeah I'd love to see that put that on why not we enjoy watching her on the Internet while you can travel agenda but what you're correct however most people that run these organizations whether it's a network or you know you know cable or or whether it was broadcast television they they're very conservative because they're trying to sell advertising space yeah so when a company like vice comes along and they're really in there they have no respect for any corporation at all this will do what the fuck they need to do to make what they think they have bills where Hamilton Morris goes into the jungle and he's taking Chris drugs and why that is back and you know I mean it's like they're not gonna sell tide during those times you know they're gonna have to accept that you're so tired but this but they do see that's what's really stupid it's like there's this weird sort of game that we play where as we pretend that the people that see all the fucked up things you can find on the Internet are not the same people that wash their clothes there yeah they wash their clothes I wash my clothes I gas or you know any of the variables any of the things we try to target people well the same fucking people man yeah we just have access to different shit now do we need to accept that you need to just stop pretending that we're living in some sort of a Catholic school you know Sandra Bullock movie view of the world well it's not it's not reality reality is there's a lot of fucked up shit about out there and I can find it now I can find it on the Internet it's really easy we need to sort of adjust your expectations accordingly because there's a lot of evidence a lot of evidence it shows that reality it's pretty fucking slippery yeah there's a lot of nutty shit out there but that tells the car looks bad as fuck yeah explode if you had a bottle what a horrible feeling they looked dope I'd like the that's the 426 that one that Brian just put up that's the the new Corvette Convertible that's it's got a 505 horsepower the last version of this this engine I think it's called an ls1 but it's a might be wrong but it's a huge fucked and power and torque that's also in the zr1 the same engine they supercharged it in the zr1 it produces 648 horsepower like this is like for people who like to talk about like muscle cars this is like the greatest era of muscle cars in the history of the fucking world normally yeah the muscle cars that people are creating now actually can take turns and they actually have good brakes like this is a Shelby Mustang they have now that's unbelievable the regular but they have the 302 boss Mustang that's like you know it's like they're like moderately powered it has 440 fuckin horsepower it's unbelievably powerful well is it the dodge Dodge Challenger challenger yes we went to muscle cars oh we went to drive Lamborghinis and Ferraris and Porsches on a track for tripleb and the dudes just wanted to drive the Dodge Challenger they they would take you out for a ride and they were like this is more fun for us to drive why is that I have no fucking idea but they did everything they do the the burnouts where they spin in circles they're like it's just more fun like those things you know I think like I definitely have driven a ton of those Lamborghinis had cars those things are fun as fuck but there it is a different Drive than like it is really you don't feel as loose maybe as you do it as a dolla challenger like in the doc towns you you're fucking sliding and you're it's fun healing it yeah well they have a they have a broad sort of you could pick from like a lower horsepower engine to like a really ridiculous engine and those things yeah you could like ramp it up and there's a lot of people take those cars and they ramp them up even more like and I see you I know Hennessey makes it a 700 horsepower I love when those I love when you get like those special edition cars yeah most of what they are though like the muscle cars of old those things you couldn't take corners in them yeah like this these are clean completely different animals but the Challenger is still like a muscle car whereas like the Camaro has become almost like a sports car because they handle so well might have been it might have been a Camaro they were driving now that I'm thinking about it but like we were taking corners in the lam Lamborghini had like 90 miles an hour yeah taking corners fuckin and see yeah you can do ridiculous shit with sports cars I drove I flew to Italy for a day to drive a Ferrari down the coast yeah they've had to fly I Drive a fly I think it texted you about it yeah which one did you drive I have no fucking clue but it was I just drove it down the coast and I had a chase car in front of me and scraped it and I just fucking flew it was so much fun like those paddle pop just flying yeah those paddle shifters a lot of people are upset about that shit though a lot of people think that a real sports car you should shift it manually and then just because it's quicker to shift it with the paddles like you're missing out on part of the experience and I kind of agree man because I like shifting my own gears I just do fun about it I do too but there's so many people that probably have never learned how to do that they can't learn on a Ferrari I'm sure it's just a sales thing because the paddle shifters are much easier yeah wait wait but it's not as satisfying it's not it's not that it's hard to shift your own gears but there's something that's like mechanically engaging about putting the clutch in sliding the shifter for letting a clutch out hitting the gas the same time super super sexy when you met a girl that knew how to drive a stick and you were like yeah like yeah you got it you're a good dad especially if it's like a fucking Mustang or something crazy this dirty bitch stuff is driving a big fat v8 she wants to drive when you go to the movies you gotta say no and you got to not let her on top the first time we fuck either it's very important and then establish dominance immediately Bert Kreischer you gotta grab that bitch and let her know the feeling of gravity is it the density of the bones and your hips you know I'm saying Brian so Bert Kreischer how much time you spent on the road lately I'm fucking dick load up on the road every week on I feel like I'm home two days this week I'm gonna take a leak talk to Brian about okay this is in the podcast it's been four hours just five minutes Brian I'll tell you a story all right tell me a story see okay joining the story that I had gonna make it okay I'll tell you a good story this is the reason no one listened to the Brian Byrd podcast because I find you funny too often no thank you I find you funny all the time no no but we like like I listen to the podcast and when I hear you say things that fucking that maybe stop Joe or like dice like you said like two or three things that made me laugh so hard during the dice podcast I'm smoking in the studio right now like a bad boy what's in that room right there that's behind me is just an empty room there's a lot of empty rooms here at the studio so I'll tell you the story okay Brian right so I checked into I did Columbus and then I did right after that I did at Kentucky right checked in the Kentucky hotel the hotel in Kentucky and I have four back sex shirts I shirts for two weeks so I four bags bellmen takes my bags take some I have to take it let him take it my rooms you know he's gonna get a tip we won't the elevator he asked what I do I say I'm a comic we get out and and the second our door opens another door opens and it's a it's a older white dude and he walks out like three steps - and he follows me down the hallway three steps - all the way all the way until we get to the end of the route the hall where my door is and I'm like is he going to my room turns out he's in the room directly next to mine so as he goes to open the door and like like put his key in I jokingly in front of this bellman thinking he laughs I and then if you want we can open up that Center door and hang out all weekend and the guy now is like nervous and not and he's trying to get his key and he's like no I know I don't want to do that and I go well it could be cool would like get to know each other how did you ever even bring that up who's fucking around just fucking around as a comic should do all right but what if he says yes uh I don't think he will he's an older man but what if he did he's an older man yes it's all about sex no I'll tell you let me tell you let me I'll tell you the story so I get I checked into the Kentucky I go to do the Kentucky improv or whatever to Louisville and I have four bags with me and the bellman takes my bags up the elevator for me and I got alone is this a gay star no it's not it's really it's one of the funnier things I've done we put music to the back of it yes strong enough story to close okay pull up roadkill ghost choir beggars guild and we're gonna play that in the background come on sweetie let me design this thing I know what I'm doing trust me oh did you pull up this no no you can't kiss me you gotta stop that you know we're playing that out we already did that today with a brad pitt Stephen door lights the roadkill Ghost choir and the song as beggars guild we need to get a death squad iTunes account don't we you just order things online you know we need real internet high high real internet hangout a death squad more yeah okay will do we can do one this week Sarah we won't do Friday's that we do Fridays they were the count okay beautiful all right no Burke rush or what we tell me Columbus Ohio fuck so I've never heard it myself probably the wrong song for this but it's the perfect song for us so tell me what happened a little vine please we had a little more volume so I check into the Kentucky and black dude checks in my bags he grabs my bags puts him on the trail trailer thing brings him in the elevator I gotta let me take of the room he's earned his tip right so we take a bunch of my room he says what do you do I sell my comedian he goes oh okay and we all talk after that doors open take an armed elevator door open the doors next to us in the elevator next to us open and an older white dude walks out and follows us and he ghosts us down like the whole hallway everywhere we go he follows us he's going wherever the fuck we're going mm-hmm we get all the way down the end of the hallway how far away is he walking off I am three feet behind us the whole time it's awkward it's awkward and we're both know didn't confront him we're all noticing it so we get to the last door and I'm thinking is this guy going to my room I would assume that guys try and do something bad kiss in the butt what would you do what would the last thing you would do Joe listen well here's what happens first of all when someone is mirroring you like that through their being very disrespectful cuz they're not they're not just did not just following you they're letting you know they're following you and they're doing in a very arrogant way or they're being flirty well they could read that's what how could be psychotics here's what happened orden why would you meet up immediately I would ask them what the fuck's right now watch what he does it turns out he's in the room next to me so he was going into his room so as he goes are you high no I was drunk oh so you're paranoid no but I was thinking about it he's scared about life a lot I was thinking about my black I knew I was a comic and I wanted him to nudes know that I knew Kevin Hart cuz that's why I thought he was gonna save you no no hold on and so the guy who got old guy goes to open his door and I jokingly now I told the black I'm a comic but I'm done anything funny so I jokingly look at the old guy and I go hey if you want we can open up that connecting door we can hang out all weekend it gets better it gets better right so the guys now can't get is kazi's now I've panicked a mini can't get is so door open goes no no no what'd that happen and I go no it'll be cool man well open it up well hang out with like the darkness and just talk to each other at night he can't get his door open and finally gets his door open and he was I don't want that to happen the door opens and before he can close it I stick my head and I go hey man if you change your mind knock and scratch so he goes no and he shuts the door and he's fucking panicked and I looked to the black guy in the black guy's gone he's in my room okay so I go fuck I did that joke for nothing so I go into the room and the black guys putting the bags down and he gets done all the bags and I go to take you might want to get ready to cue the music Brian he I go to give him a tip and the black guy looks at me and shakes his head he goes now I said well I got to give you a tip man took my bags up here nears now just knocking scratch so I look at the black I go okay so I knock the fuck I falls apart laughing his on the ground Mike so the guy in the next room called downstairs no no no no no no no the black guy the guy who I told the joke for in the first place heard the whole thing and he goes no man don't do it you got a knock and scratch so I knocked and scratched and the fucking guys like I don't want to hang out man we're crashing that's rude I was fucking too funny make it a poor
