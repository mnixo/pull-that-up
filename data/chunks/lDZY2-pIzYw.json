[Music] so uh UFC 207 that was one of the crit one of the craziest events of all time and watching that main event was it was like there was it was surreal first of all surreal because I was my body was all weird out of my chair but it was also was just was like that was the least competitive like main event other than Aldo and McGregor but that was one dynamic shot to the chin that knocked him out like everything about that was off can you knit can you think about another main event championship level where it was that kind of big of a description see you know I'm saying like it wasn't even a fight and I think leading up to it there was some kind of red flags that you saw leading up to it if you think back now that we shaved throw everybody said right physically she looked great but like was what kind of sparring was she doing you know one of the things I was thinking when she was hitting pads she's saying they're hitting pads with Edmond I was like they're standing right in front of each other like she's not moving like she's just hitting pads pop pop pop pop pop hats are tough to tell though right sometimes they do it for the camera if the countdown crews that you don't want to show your new shit but also what did people think was gonna happen like did you think this whole time when she's shooting these movies doing Susie Edmond her come up with a plan for her to stick on the outside jab and move that's not that's not in her game she had to close the distance in clinch you know that should be only the idea of standing with Amanda Nunez is just ridiculous the difference in punching power is like literally double but we've seen website take punches before who bets could hit pretty hard I'm not saying similar but I'm saying what bets did she say she has decent power and she's very aggressive she throws volume strikes but she throws her arms she doesn't hit nearly as hard as Amanda and Amanda torques her whole body in the shit I agree Joe I mean it's it's and matches arms for this long yeah Dan got damn telephone poles and that's all fine but don't you think the game plan - Ben get her to the ground okay and she tried that a little bit she was already living yeah she wasn't there though mentally that that's why I'm saying there's there's things leading up to it and I think the biggest red bread flak for me and you know Dana better than anyone he's a promoter through and through one of the if not the best of all time I can't think of another one Don King I guess but still for him to say yeah you can skip all the media shit and just focus on the fight as a god that just doesn't seem right you know why she's managed by or she's handled by William Morris Endeavor WME WME owns UFC now I'm aware of I'm sure that's what that's his decision who's his daddy one who let we agreed to this it was in her contracts one-time thing I'm never doing again I thought god damn that is she must have put it in the contract she must have said this is what I want to do I don't want to talk to any media I just maybe that's not a red flag do you not have Connor did it I mean Connor doesn't have the choice coming in Saturday to Connors it it but if Connor did it if Connor said fuck all this fucking media I'm going at Dublin I'm gonna train he would never do that if he did red flag don't want to involved at all no Dana this say all good so doing she goes out she goes out grabs hold of man Nunez flips are on her head semi-unconscious catches her an armbar she's the new champ in 35 seconds you're not saying this I disagree oh you wouldn't say there's a red flag if she went out and dominated and got an armbar in the first round you would definitely not say that skipping the media is a red flash so then she's only saying it because this is like armchair quarterbacking it's not though because I says the red flag before this because so if she so if she did interviews afterwards let's say she went out there Dominator in a minute submitter then she did interviews afterwards that's a little different you know I'm saying cuz she's just saying I'm not doing a meet at all even post using hoax yeah well she doesn't want to talk after that I mean why would you think in this the whole cell on this was she's serious now she said oh my god she's focused knowing her she's serious now the whole threesome then the whole thing was like this big obvious marketing perspective like a promotional Hollywood perspective like they had the movie which is a really good like guy who pumped up that whole thing about her coming back and they lift up the garage doors here working out really hard and it's they would they dizzy they created a great hype piece you know if you're in the Rhonda Rousey business Zak Amanda news done what exactly did you add mice with the vest was there a picture promoting this UFC and there's a picture of Robin and her fight gear and around on the street clothes cuz she's back 207 it's like fuck man what about Amanda well I'd say when this crazy somehow make sure who did that picture that he was an official UFC traditional UFC kind of social media post wow it's crazy well now what do you do it's also crazy because it's crazy for a marketing perspective I mean a lot of people thought that Ronda was gonna win a lot of people I was 100% who the fuck knows me too that's exactly how I felt when I was watching that fight play out I was like who the fuck knows I mean you could see look Ronda looked like she was an amazing shape you think about the things that ron has been able to do in the past like Sara McMann you'd think well maybe she ties her up in a clinch blasted with the knee to the body flips her on her back and armbars her who the fuck knows if she gets you on the ground her arm bar technique is outstanding it's just want some of the best if not the best I've ever seen probably but that could have happened but it was so who the fuck knows but the moment she got hit she's not moving her head at all she's standing straight up in the air and then I see her legs get close together and that's when you know someone's really hurt when someone gets lit up and then they start moving but their legs are too close together it's just not working right it's not like they kind of know what to do but it's just not there not their balance isn't good there's no head movement she was probably hurt with like the second or third punch that Amanda hit her with she was probably on queer Street but but I woke her up she didn't know where she was until she got hit Joe look at that one she got hit when you know she's hurt she's hurt look at her face my hands even so she grew up a kick she threw some kicks to try to keep Amanda off I think she didn't realize I think when Amanda hits girls they just go holy shit yeah but what else would you what else would you expect in that you know I'm saying like you you don't realize to get hit but you you hear all the criticism now of edmond who's i'll see a terrible coach but take that out of it if you bring a horse to water they can't drink there's nothing else you can do so mentally she doesn't want to be in there do you think wait didn't want to be in there I said it didn't look like the the same tenacity that we used to see him she was super tenacious until she got cracked Joe is 44 seconds just when she thought she'd that first jab she got hurt with a right hand maybe 10 50 when you watch the whole fight it's 40 seconds fine good it's on YouTube like what do you think it is why you've been saying this you see that she got hit and she she got hurt and you've been hitting her before who know what happens you just don't know what the fuck's going on correct I think I don't think that jab put her lights out it wasn't just a jab dude she hit her first jab that landed it first did she went into Cape close dust first jab landed but then she got hit with many punches I don't understand why you're confused as to the result I mean she got hit by the biggest power puncher in the hundred thirty five Conn division by far there's not a single girl in that division that punches like a man who does I agree with that but not right it wasn't a right hand right away yes it was it was a jab right away generai but a right hand right after that once once Ronda try to close distance it was 40 seconds of Amanda punching Ronda in the face until Ronda without like the idea that something's confused it that she didn't look like she wanted to be there she was hurt multiple times in that in those exchanges I just don't I think we're doing a lot of armchair quarterbacking right who the fuck knows what was going on in your sport leading whether or not she wanted to be there after she got hit the problem is she might have been just rocked and there's also the reality that she was knocked out fucking cold a year ago and it was a bad beating and then a vicious head kick and there was something about those goddamn neck kicks man there's something about when when someone shins you in the neck like she got shin and your whole body just goes limp you're doing so much damage in there but she had 411 days off that's nice I think it was just bad strategy just really simple the strategy was not good just that's just bad that's possible too all those things I was the one who said like way early on I think Amanda's her most dangerous challenge because Amanda hit so fucking hard after she starched Sara McMann and when she when she was beating up me SH I was like Jesus said she punches harder than anybody in that division she's got like dangerous weapons with her hands but I think I really think there's a lot of people that get killed like that and they are never the same again I agree they can't absorb a shot anymore and then also your brain according to chuck liddell he was telling me about it like because he you know chuck was so tough that he would like just fucking use his chin sort of like lineker does like it's part of his defense like knowing that he can absorb shots and after a while his brain was like hey man fuck you like his brain was just like we're not even to do this and just cuz yeah just shuts off early I also think tech to you there's a certain level where the were there that great you look at like a Tiger Woods or Mike Tyson when that foundation gets a little shaky there's just never the same yeah that's true it's just never there like I'm not God's gift of the UFC exactly oh then memory gods don't give a shit exactly and then like we said even if she was undefeated and she saw it fought Nunez noonas gonna give her problems cuz if you watch like the Miesha Tate fight Miesha Tate like even though she beat me should take twice me should take gave her a hard time there's some good scrambles Miesha Tate hit her with some punches if a man that hits you with punches like that you're fucked you can't make mistakes you're in trouble yeah like in a lot of way she's like a female rumble in that she might not be able to close the show with one shot like Rumble Ken but if you make mistakes you get stung so bad and you see it with a perfect example she cracked Sarah with the right hand you see her her whole face is like what if like nobody hits them like that nobody and she's long a man that catches you on the end of those punches too she she's great at distance I also think that the game's evolving so fast yeah where Amanda all she cares about is being champ all she does is train that's the only thing she gives a fuck about I think we saw the same thing in the Dominick Cruz a Cody garb and fight all Cody wants to do is be champ Dominic's doing analysts work he is for the so I think there's there's this kind of change of hands right now where you're seeing these guys who work there and that's what you have to do to beat up in this game in this day and age guys are too good they're too good now think you're dead right I think you're dead right about that here we go we'll watch the whole thing live now give us a volume young Jamie so here it is so that jab landed with five second s jab right there watch this she's down there right there - 22 - yeah see so she's done ten seconds in we're at 443 were fifteen seconds in and she's already like she fucked right there she's fucked that was a super hard right and this is bad this is work that it's real hard to watch Roger Lodge boom to the body - she ripped that shot to the body so like the idea that she didn't want to be there ten seconds into the fight she didn't know what the fuck was going oh there left right on that right hand behind it this is horrific man it's tough a little boom god damn her great stoppage but god damn Amanda Nunez is good she put a finger up to her mouth walked right up to Edmond looked at him when gangster know about she's tough and also she's got that thick old neck that helps look how long a man is arm she's great at keeping distance and not crowding herself well Amanda has wide shoulders and that helps - and then long arms as well and she's got awesome distance man her her ability to catch you at the very bad in the punches that's where all the power is because if you're punching someone and you want to hit him here but they just move forward a foot you lose like 90 percent of your power [Music]
