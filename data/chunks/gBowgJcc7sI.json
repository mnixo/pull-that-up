I found out about you uh I guess it was somebody just I get a lot of interesting stuff tweeted at me and I read one of your Breitbart pieces and I was like check this motherfucker out and then I found out that you're gay and you're you're a part of this gamergate but you're in the game you're on this you were on the side of the people that were not the ultra progressives like and then you were in these debates against these radical feminism chicks and shutting them down and I was on ring lined about me you play somebody look at this motherfucker you're a unicorn like they don't like people like you I'm not supposed to exist known to the principles of the universe I should not be yeah you should you're not supposed to be like fairly buttoned down and conservative and and fair of all but also factually correct like all the stuff that you do the thing that I'd seen and you got in this argument about why certain women and gravitate towards certain jobs and men gravitate towards jobs and this idea that that a lot of this is just cultural a lot of this is something that we're pushing upon young men and young women and you were like well this is in the case at all it isn't it hilarious to watch someone confronted by like they expect that to come from a me they expected to come from some my little island like I ought to be supporting the exact and either and on paper like paper I should you know I'm a metropolitan in other circumstances I would be a liberal I'm a homosexual yeah I listen I'd like pop culture you know all of those things I shouldn't really exist but I do unfortunately for them one-tenth of your tweets are about how fabulous your hair is yes or black dick you know any of the subjects you know it's hair or you know the men that I'm into it's very very difficult for them to beat me for one simple reason which is they've never been questioned they've never been called many of their stuff by anybody serious or anybody who doesn't conform to the progressive rules of identity politics so when they come for me their usual the usual response from a feminist to anybody bringing facts or accounts a serious counter-argument is simply to dismiss them sexist or a bigot or misogynist it's really tough to make the allegation against me I love women all my friends are women I don't have any I don't have a dog in the fight sexually speaking I don't care if you know I don't want to bang them wherever sighs they are however they behave so they really don't they don't have that over me it's very very difficult to come up against a guy that you cannot make a convincing argument of bigotry against so you have to argue on the facts and of course the facts are on my side well that's what the deal is they can't dismiss you instantaneously because of what you represent because what you represent I think well look we got the dirt on him he's gay he's fabulous shit okay what are we gonna do this is the president once you started let's start to hit the radar you note that you get calls from friends who say so this person like you not me trying to check you out this happened to me about a year ago so I I sort of hit I've been a journalist for ten years and some good stuff broken some big stories but I never will I never really kind of crossed over into entertainment into the mainstream and just started having about a year ago and I start to get emails from friends and they were saying I'm so what's going on here like people keep you on me asking me about you like trying to ask like in back in 2011 did he really do this um and what I realized is when they when they've recognized you as a threat when they identify you as somebody could do them damage they start going on maneuvers trying to find out everything about you trying to find out what the worst stuff they have on you is so that they can dismiss you as a bigot or a sexist or a neo-nazi or whatever they can come up with anything they can grasp at because their strategy is to dismissed is to dismiss the speaker by attacking the speaker's credibility because that way they never have to even consider the merits of the argument yes they haven't been able to do that with me which is why feminists now refuse to bait me debate me on TV because they know they'll lose they can't bring out all they can't bring out look at this battery of dismissing they've just dismissal tactics that they've amended over the last 30 years and they've got so complacent because they've never had you know a sassy gay person come up and say it you're talking bullshit and you're hurting men and here are the facts they've never had it before so they've never built up an arsenal to fight it you know so this is this is why I win and why I'll cook I'll keep winning because they they don't really know how to deal with an argument on its own merits and in any case of course the facts are on our side well it's also this conversation that we're having right now is about war you're saying winning and losing and they're taking tactics and strategies to look up dirt on the opposition you're going they're treating this is it's this is an ideological war it's not a debate about the facts of the issue and I think that's part of it because the left has always seen this as a war and the gender warriors you know have always been warriors they've always seen this in strategic terms I'm not sure people aren't conservatives and naturally more self-effacing conservatives tend to be a little bit cool a little bit more chill about things they kind of don't only want to get a really big bill how do you explain my paper dues I think they get very angry about things I mean Ted Cruz well I'm not saying all conservatives how do you explained what's her name the Palin chick Sarah Palin had explained that these are these are the outline is that you know Mike Huckabee even most conservatives find these people a bit much Mike Huckabee I think that guys in is in the end who knows honey so much fatter know he was hollering loss well I mean you know for a lazy got that social TV is so fat he got so I can't vote for anyone else not enough rock and rollin I want Marco Rubio just because he's hot we can't have Trump that I want right I don't think that I think people are silly so whether or not it's a conservative thing or a liberal thing I think there's a vast majority of people that are not very good at looking at themselves and they're not very good at looking at the momentum of their actions they just think that they're right because this is what they've they've been saying for so long and I think that's one of the most horrific things about these conversations these women get in with you about because like when they're talking about what they think are social constructs things like gender identities the way people be and when you shatter that with the facts they're looking for some other weapons there's nothing there you see in their eyes you know because it's not really a debate about the idea itself it's just not what it's not what it's about is gender warfare that's why people like Christina Hoff Sommers called them gender warriors because these aren't people who want any kind of social justice as they say these are people who just hate men well they hate men they want to hurt men they don't want equality for women they want to be they want superiority for women whether it's architected into the education system or you know affirmative action or whatever it is they don't want equality they want superiority and fundamentally a lot of this but you know these these crazy extremists you know a progressive third wave today's version of feminism it basically boils down to misandry and it takes a gay guy because it's so dangerous for men to even broach the subject anymore and any man with a mainstream job puts that at risk by even talking on the subject no matter what his opinion is and it takes a gay guy to go on you know Sky News in the UK and say I'm sorry the facts are not on your side what you're doing is damaging to women it's to me really an indictment on debate in our public square that it is so dangerous for a man to even express an opinion on this subject that it takes a fag to go and stick up for heterosexuals you know if other men could say this they would be but they can't because they would really risk their careers - always talking about silencing young people I see silence - men well that if that is true there's a lot of daxing and going after people and a lot of a lot of anger when it comes to all this stuff but I think what you have in many cases when you see this kind of like disjointed illogical sort of way of thinking I think you have people that are assholes that find a cause that gives them the green light to be an asshole well I worry about this you know I agree with you I think no disrespect to any particular church but I think it's reasonable to say 50 years ago if you were a bully if you were associate path you wanted to take it out on other people you wanted to wreak harm on the world that you thought would hurt you reasonably good way of doing that would be to join the clergy and many and many people did and I think you know most of us who are religious who have religious families know stories like that these days you're better off getting a job at Gawker you know if you want to bully somebody if you really want to hurt them if you have some sort of internal chaos or damage and you want to impose order on the world outside because you feel so confused and broken and messy the best way to do today is become a social justice warrior because not only do you get the same kind of status in society the clergy would have done 50 years ago but you also get media platforms you get money you get approval you get applause and if you layer on these new tactics of you know fake abuse and fake harassment and you know this terrible man you know these terrible men coming for me on the internet and stuff you can make quite a lot of money too
