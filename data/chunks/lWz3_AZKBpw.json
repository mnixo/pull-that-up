and I'm sure he was intentions yeah that's it it shows not to mention what police discovered inside the minister's rubber briefs and if you click that link they found a giant recording audio of all of us yes where we are in the kitchen with docket Russell does the podcast studio has been transformed because a big part of the new sci-fi show deals with the podcast Ari's in it and so is a young Duncan Trussell and we're filming a lot of the guests and some of the discussions here at studio so if you can see this is usually not this cluttered in the raise and they change the decorations a little they gave us this this fucking stupid thing I don't know what that is but it makes it more sci-fi whatever so today was dr. Jeffrey Meldrum he's a legit scientists who heavily believes in Bigfoot hmm but fun stuff and we've been going nonstop the show starts in July 16th and we're the schedules has been ridiculous but we're meeting a lot of really cool people and so far there's a lot of pretty cool shit times don't a lot of shit to show you fuckers shit I'm so tired I haven't slept right in days I've been flying all over the fucking world I flew from Canada to New York New York North Carolina North Carolina here and from here we got to go to Texas Duncan's gonna go to Texas or no Duncan's gonna go to Colorado then I gotta go to Texas and then I gotta go to Alaska shit happen but it's gonna be badass hopefully or it will suck either way I'll tell you I'll create a pseudonym go online tell you my show sucks it'll be really obvious though there Billy Hojo bin telepathy before he said telepathy already exists in the form of language that with language your mouth is making certain sounds and then you run those sounds through a cultural context a dictionary of what we've accepted that those sounds represent and through that I can read your mind yeah and that's what you're doing when you're describing to me your encounter meeting your friend and while you're jogging yeah and and various coincidences that have happened through your life I'm essentially reading a version of your thoughts on the undie subjects and that is telepathy and that is what separates human beings from other animals yeah that what we're dealing with in it as far as like what we call psychic energy might just be a where we are slowly emerging and we were slowly developing these these potential abilities and a guy like Banacek may be able to come along and dismiss all of these because they're not as tangible ism noise that comes from your mouth maybe it takes a million years to develop these abilities and maybe right now we're just the whispers of these abilities are possible maybe where it's like a radio station that you can only tune in during a thunderstorm but it's just like this tiny weird phenomenon that only happens upon occasion that is possible it is certainly possible and another thing about psychic energy that makes it fantastic or it very interesting to discuss is the fact that so many people have claimed to experience it and so many people I think almost recognized at a genetic level that that's coming but that is an emerging aspect of human consciousness yeah the ability to do it non-verbally yeah I mean yeah it's one I can say one thing is indisputable right now there is no accepted proof that this exists there's no accepted proof we don't know if we don't know that it exists right now that is indisputable and that does not mean that it doesn't exist and that's what's really cool about the scientific method in this approach to truth is that it isn't committed one way or the other it's not gonna I don't even think Banacek was completely closed off to the idea that it wasn't real yeah it was he well I thought for a moment he said I don't know me I thought there was like something and they're always like it hasn't been proven but maybe I don't remember maybe I just please protect me I might put that into sleep so yeah he said maybe maybe one thing that I loved about this show what it's done to me is if you think I'm a hippie now before the show I was much more of a hippie and then you come into contact with people who are really invested in believing this thing or that thing and won't listen to logic and then that becomes really appalling when you realize that from an individual's POV it's kind of sad or cute or whatever but from a group of people believing in things that aren't provable shit gets really bad yeah and also one thing that banachek pointed out which I really liked is how dangerous it is when people decide to use methods easily recreated to actually get money from people and prey on their vulnerabilities like they miss a loved one they show them a few parlor tricks makes make them think that they have these abilities and then suddenly they're taking money from them to let them talk to their grandparents who daughter their parents have died that's evil and then you take that one step further and you get in the priests class who convinces groups of people that they can talk to God and then they start churches and religions and then the next thing you know you've got an even deeper problem so I think that stuff that Banacek does and that skeptics do is really important and good and it's important to be skeptical but you can't be skeptical to the point where you step on your own experience where your skepticism overrides something that you've actually experienced yeah but isn't it possible that skepticism not overrides what you've actually experienced but defines it explains it well if the if it can be explained if it can be explained yeah so far everything you've said I believe can be explained yeah and also just because something can be explained it doesn't mean that it's no longer special or wonderful it just means that now you know what it is yes I agree with that I think that's really important and I've become much more of a skeptic because this show as well and talking to people that believe in things you also recognize these patterns that exist over and over again in people that believe in things and it's that they don't ever contemplate the contrary they don't they don't ever consider whether or not what they believe in is nonsense they just go forward with sort of this this blind conviction that what they're whether whether it's about aliens or psychics or Bigfoot or whatever it's about they go forth with this conviction that they have the truth and they want to expose the truth and I think that conviction is they're not stuck up a road range it's the best interior because of his head slide over don't let this means maybe I can come alright good we're good joke and who wants to live forever yeah let's get life after life my hotel room in a white terror and just just overcome by fear and think you
