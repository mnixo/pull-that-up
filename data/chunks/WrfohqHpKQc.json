boom all right we're live what's going on man what do you got there text messaging people know off yeah just put it on silent silent how long have you been in America now for you're you're only here for like two weeks right yeah I came for two week and yeah and three days and I shall fight me at the UFC and did you enjoy it yeah that's great that's my first time that's the first time even at an MMA even you've never been to an MMA oh really no in French so boring you know you know that now he's pretty bitten friends yes and you can't hit a guy when he's in on the floor so that's why he used to be boring in French because they fight like striking and then when a guy take you down and then he's just busy and just emissions yeah yeah oh that's interesting so they're MMA rules when they would go to the ground no striking at all striking so that's why you into the body even in the book oh I think yeah in the body the Kin okay but you can't punch the face no so boring so I never I never been in there having me even friends but UFC at 2:41 was crazy especially the fight the Diaz fight and and and the main event was now as a kickboxing champion and when you watch MMA do you I know that you've been training and I know that you spent some time while you're out here at aka yeah are you thinking of eventually make you way to the UFC I'm not thinking that's what that's what I will do you will do yeah so I will do that's what I I wanna do you know yeah as you say and the glory champ now I have five belt my my first dream before growing was to become the yeah the greatest kickboxing in the world kickboxer in the world I wanted to beat everybody in my division that's what I did before Nicky Hodgkin was the the champ champ yeah and defeated since six years yeah it was the greatest injury and I was like him how I would wanna beat him you know so he's so strong and I believe I beat him yet twice I beat everybody so after that before people was asking me do you think to go to Ma because I think you should do something great in and I was like no I don't like him and he had what III don't like like Wessling be either like this kind of sport I'm a striker you know I was like no I like it and yet two years ago I was like damn I think I like it you know because I I train once and I really I really liked it you know did you like do you like MMA training or did you like MMA yeah MMA training in jiu-jitsu I was and I was watching jiu-jitsu all the time on TV and more I watched jiu-jitsu I was like house it's so complicated he's so yeah it's not only two guys who are rolling and making strange stuff under is this more than that so I was like oh he's complicated is very it's not easy so right yeah yeah I wanted to learn that I wanted I wanted someone to teach me that and yeah I was thinking about every man now I really want to do it I want to do you know what kind of McGregor couldn't do you know he he was the best in MMA in one combo spot and he wanted to beat the colomac for Floyd Mayweather yeah in another combat spot he wanted to be the greatest in to converse about different combat sport I couldn't do it he failed and that's what I want to do and I think I really really will do it I'm the best in kickboxing and I want to be the best in MMA and I think I read if kickboxing was as popular as MMA do you think you'd still have the same desire to do it yes yes yes because I just want to be the best yeah because I'm younger on 26 I my dreams came true you know I'm the best in kickboxing my nickname is the best yes I'm really did this so well I'm a big fan of yours and I was really excited to get you in here and one of the things I was really interested in is that you sort of changed your style and you were more movement oriented and you would win on points but then you started fucking people up you started in like people like Nicky Holt's kid had said that about Jay you're a mover arena yeah that you're a runner I was trying to say nice that's what he say but man you changed that around yeah yeah you don't want people out because yeah my first my first big big fight in in glory was against Nikki Moscone and that was only my third fight in glory as I beat the the rank number two who was neutral crew not as I beat him the they put me a tighter shot right after and I was like Nikki Ã¶zkan is really really complicated and you were like 24 right yeah I was 24 that's very young yeah fight Nikki Holdco yeah I was I was yeah I was I was impressed by him because he's very good he's very good and I still I still impressed by him because for me is a very very great champ it was and I was like I would not knock him out I used to before Gloria I used to fight every month sometime I we to fight I used to fight three time a month and I used to be known as a mother really yeah because of tournaments I used to knock people out at the first round and when I saw Nikki I was like okay I will not go for the ko so I trained myself to do all five rounds to make points and to and to stay myself like funny in the ring and yeah and make a lot of movement heat jokes play with the audience share you know and that's what I did and yeah and I kept going did that way after Nikki I kept the same style the same style same Sun and once I failed you know I lost a fight because because of that mine my diet wasn't very good you know I make a good first round and then I was tired as fuck so I couldn't do the job what I I wanted to do and then I took a diet now my stomach my dad's perfect and what did you change like what were you eating before before I was like okay I to prepare a fight I I start two months before the fight the G day and then before I was like okay still tomans okay start more I start next week the diet I start to move tomorrow and then we are two weeks before the fight like him six kilos to lose okay I start today and then I come in a fight week and I never started the diet and I started in doubt and like three days before the fight I had five kilo to lose six kilo to lose three days and I was like okay I don't eat anything no more now I just train train so not training with no food with no food now that's silly with no water and that's why that's what that wasn't smart you know it's so hard for people to believe that world champions do things like that yeah but that is the case sometimes and sometimes you need a bad fight to sort of snap you out of it and realize hey I have to be disciplined for many many months out in advance right you know what the first thing grow is say to my manager before when I won the first title they say a cedric is very lucky because we don't we don't even know how how does he come he arrived at at this level with no no diet no you know no strategy no trainer nothing there was there was very surprised and yeah I I think I think a lot about this and that's why now I'm very professional and after the death diet I start to knock everybody out so what did you change in your diet like what do you eat now now it's like you know my diet in France is she's very famous you know her name is Cecile golden coach his name is golden coach yeah that's a real name and yeah and she take care of many champions in France and yeah she I cannot tell you exactly what what is in inside my diet because it's so complicated but I told a I don't want I don't want you to tell me how many grams and this and this and this just tell me right what I need to eat Monday Tuesday morning evening and that's what that's what she did so you just follow her and yeah I just follow an instruction and you have a meal prep camp someone who makes the meals before you do it all yourself not yet yeah yeah there are some in France in Paris especially but I didn't choose yet so what kind of foods you eating I love African food but Africa yeah by freaking freeze very ready no good for my diet become a lot a lot of all Latoya a lot of meat good that sounds great hey sounds great but wait no I used to eat Japanese food Japanese I really like Japanese filled sushi fish as gellick food is very healthy so I like Japanese food Korean food so that's what I used to eat when I'm I go out restaurant so now what does she have you eating now yeah now I don't have to prepare any fight I just keep on shape so it was what I want which one yeah what I want today today yes but I starting September and then I'm gonna start a new diet and yeah morning is like two eggs two eggs and how much do you have to lose like what it what is your normal weight my normal weight in kilograms is 85 85 what is that like what is 85 kilograms to pounds maybe one night 190 yeah it's a 161 point to point to what 188 and you have to get down to 170 170 yeah so what I when I say when I say that in the decade it was like oh you good oh yeah but before I was before oh the biggest thing I did is in seven weeks I lost 15 no 17 7 kilos oh wow 7 week yeah last time I came to a K I was 95 95 is is 200 202 Plus yeah 95 kilos we got a calculator here what is it 210 yeah so you were 210 pounds yeah and 7 week later I lost 15 7 in kilograms because of Sicilian oh yeah yeah that was very very very hard but your energy levels okay well everything was good I was just training twice a day and diet diet every day every day yeah now kickboxing is huge in Europe it means yes very big people with big people I mean I had Rico Verhoeven on we discussed this like how enormous kickboxing is in Holland and in Europe yeah and in America for whatever reason it never caught on I thought I don't understand it I've been a a fan of glory and I've been trying to tell people about them for a long time I cannot blame and you were say for that good the the legalized MMA so MMA just more more attractive for people you know the people who doesn't know shit about about fighting they just watch MMA is like Oh two people are fighting then that's interesting you know keep boxing and like things like spot like wait I kick boxing if you doesn't know the rules scandal yeh just want and you don't you don't understand you don't understand but MMA is more easy to understand you know yes yeah just yeah two people so I don't I really don't know why kickboxing it's not easy it's not maybe at the same level as every main USA well what's crazy to me is boxing is very respected in the United States and MMA is very respected but one of the things that people like about MMA is stand up there like the striking yeah but the best striking is like glory yeah or Muay Thai like the best elite kick boxers are the best strikers that's right but I think people love the cage people love the blood so small gloves no that's why that's what people like people don't like you two don't like how you say that knockdown like ko or nothing yeah they don't like the break and one two three no they like they like to see to watch ko so that's what I think that's what they prefer yeah I mean they well is there a movement to try to get mm a full MMA legalized in France uh I think in January is gonna be gonna be okay so they're gonna have to allow strikes on the ground yeah yeah everything every soon soon on January hello in January and I think you were thinking the coming so they're probably USD in Paris yeah for sure okay that sounds wild yeah yeah well the more guys like you get involved in MMA though the more it complicates kickboxing though because like when elite fighters world champions like yourself make a jump to MMA then people might look at kickboxing as a stepping stone instead of as a valid individual sport yeah yeah that's right but you mean when a guy a step from kickboxing to MMA yeah they're like maybe people won't care as much about kickboxing because they'll look at it as a stepping stone to MMA yeah yeah of course and yeah yeah that's right that's what I that's what I wanted I want to do also because I think for a guy from kickboxing to to go in MMA it's not really difficult for him if yeah if you learn the ground game and wrestling - yeah I think that defense if you learn that it's gonna be more simple than a guy who come from wait I you know Muerta is is really different like kickboxing kickboxing when you fight them kickboxing you moves a lot already you know this thing standing target instead of Muay Thai we tell you that if you watch me tie a fight they don't move a lot you know the still and the fight is is all about power forward kicks or punches so why do you think that's different because the clench because the elbows knees like because of the the the movement the movement in MMA they stay still and in key boxing the there is no you know there is no break you know they just keep fighting we're at 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 and then in weight is more like 1 1 1 l boom knees and yeah also but the clean is good for everything because then you know in Madrid yeah this is good for me now in France is it easy to get wrestling do you do you get wrestling training I in France I get grappling training I think here in USA you call that BG noogie yeah no yeah that's right that's why I'm training in France what about takedowns or takedown defense wrestling but you know this this style of noogie training I get is a it's a little bit different like as BG because we start on our feet uh-huh and and we use the whisk and then after the takedown we continue yeah so it's not like an an Olympic West ring right but is they call that luta livre I don't know lucha libres with the called Brazil but I know what you're saying yeah yeah yeah so in America most presume gg2 they start on the ground are ready to start on the knees or something like that to avoid accidents because you know you got a class full of 40 people rolling around together and they're trying to tackle each other and yeah people bow their knees out and things you know that's why I'm training in that in Paris very big team the coach is mediate man is very good and he say for the photo shoot I'm very very good I learned fast I learned very fast and course yeah now at 26 but how much time do you think you need between now and when you have your first time I'm a fight you know what is my dream yes now is now I beat everybody so like I'm getting bored in in kickboxing you know I still defending my my title because I like it because of the cash price also and my dream is I still in contract in for one one Yin hull a little bit more than one year my dream is prepare myself to MMA during one year so I still got time and after the end of the contract directly go to UFC and take the champ for Derek title shot all a top five ranked guy I really I really really would like to fight Nate Diaz aw and Tony Petty's for from of my first fight MMA - why - to to shock only to shock the world to show everybody that a guy who come from kickboxing directly his first fight is against a top guy in MMA and he he fuck him up that's what I want to do and I really really believe in me and I know I will I can and I will do it now have you been in talks with the UFC does UFC know about your plan not yet not yet what they do now but I think after this show now they're gonna know yeah so your training at aka was it the first time you ever trained up there you know it's my second time second time when did you train before before was one years ago November yeah I came here after my glory fight I broke my ribs so I took a little bit vacation in Thailand and then after that yeah I just fight to a case on was a and yeah I meet I met everybody DC Kabir wasn't there but I met there a lot of great great teammate the the West Wing level is just amazing there so I'm it have also yeah I mean Xavier Mendes yeah see so that's a great camp for a guy like YouTube because it's very wrestling have yeah yeah that's that's what I that's what I like yeah I want to Train you know what did I say to meet you in front I say I want to train wrestling because he like I want to be a world world champion of wrestling you know so I just wanted to think resting like a restaurant I I don't just want to train my takedown defense or shit like that no I joined I want people to be afraid of me and on the ground you know I learned fast as I really like it I think that's deliver I wanna get and how is it going when you train it okay are you hanging in there like I did do you find it uncomfortable of course as a striker in straighting yeah I'm my level is higher than anybody else in a key but in the ground yeah and they're fucking fucking strong yeah everybody the the I top everybody everyday I top in again yeah yeah for the moment and yeah they say I learned you have plans on tap yeah of course yes for the moment I tap and because I'm learning and this I learned very very fast like they show me once and then I get it you know five minutes later I get it and so I feel very confident for the future in me and I think I wouldn't do it you well I'm hoping you do it's always exciting to see world champions and it's particularly kickboxing make that way to MMA to the UFC and Ferg I like you it's a perfect thing because you're so young cousin six and you're already a very accomplished world champion that's right and I think I'm thinking about Israel Addison yeah you know mm-hmm he he he Anita I couldn't do it you know but he was very smart yeah it's real the way he planned it he really worked on his takedown defense and made sure that he by the time he made it to the UFC he was already at an elite level yeah he wasn't lit but he got a title shot in in glory and he lost and after that he went to USA you know so that's what I want to do I want to be the only one to to be able to yeah to do that you know and glory kickboxing champ and then UFC champ he fought wellness right witness yeah yeah very close fight yes it was very close I thought he won some people tell you yeah and some no yeah but Jason wellness is a leak this is the lead of course well glory is like so exciting I'm such a fan I love watching it man it's like one of my favorite things to watch it drives me crazy that it's not popular and and I was very excited when it was on Spike TV in America it was they were making a big deal out of it it looked like they were gonna you know try to promote it as much as possible and they tried it for a little while then they stopped and now it's on ESPN a little bit it's on UFC fight pass which is great I think that the country will go is very most polarizing onon mm-hmm I think yeah your friend is so popular you know yes some people recognize me in the street when friends yet because of gluey is very popular in Europe well Martel growing heart he's is he the guy that you're fighting next he's the guy who want me to be this next I don't know if I will fight him Nick do you have a fight scheduled next mmm not yet no growing hearts we're talking a lot of shit yeah he talked about shit you know I'm the money fight right that's why he's talking against me but yeah I would like to fight Newton next because when we fight each other people really really like it it's a great fight yes very good it was very fighter is very entertaining and yeah people like it so but you've already beaten them sorry if you already beaten him yeah of course yes it was what did how did that FICO I'm trying to remember I I won my point but was it a good fight for me you know wasn't a good when I look at that fight today yeah for sure I'm saying that it was that four years ago how many years ago was yeah 400 years ago yeah yeah four years ago yeah before the back yeah four five years ago I was in Paris and yeah I won the fight and yeah for me it's gonna be interesting if I fight him because I thought everybody in that division so I don't know who they're gonna be all gonna be my next opponent but yeah it sounds good for from your tail and then yeah it's gonna be a it's gonna be only rematch you know only rematch rematch rematch then so from then out one year plus then you make your way into the the world of the UFC no matter what even if glory comes with more money glories like listen to Bay we love ya I really I really like glory you know glory is my my first great experience as yes a real champ and they're doing great job for me you know I really like glory but I have to think about me first right and legacy yeah my legacy and I I like to do what I love to do so for a mama I love kickboxing I love defending my title I loved the the the gloriam event you know that the team I love every every everybody and everything in glory but tomorrow I don't know I don't know I just gonna follow my my goal follow my my needs and yeah I want to be the the I hope the first French UFC champion and that's what I that's what I want I want to check the water I wanna I wanna write my story and a new story people never heard about it so even if glory come with a big big big money no I just wanna follow what I want you just have a plan yeah I have a plan and I I know I will get more more after that so I renewed Fame I'm confident so you've been out here now you went to the UFC event and then you did some training at aka like when you are outside of Camp say like whenever your fight is scheduled how much what kind of training are you doing when you're not in camp are you mixing it up now and trying to do a lot of jiu-jitsu a lot of BJJ when I'm not in camp what I do so my my conditioning trainer Valentino got a jeweler he follow me everywhere he's with me today and we just trained strange conditioning because before that's was my weakness the condition I just I used to knock everybody out at the first round so I never trained my condition I never took it's very serious because I used to knock people out at the first round so when I did my first five round I was like wow the condition is so so important so that's why I'm training a lot you know strange sure conditioning and also yeah when I'm not when I I don't have a fight kickboxing fight plane I trained ehehe I trained wrestling MMA and again is a completely different condition it's crazy when you when you Wester with a guy and then you you get up and you're trying to strike the arms are filled with blood you do nothing legs yeah now what kind of strength and conditioning are you doing and how often you doing it like say if you're if you're preparing for a fight how many days a week do you do strengthen auditioning when I'm preparing for a fight every day every day every day it's not of course it's not the same training but every day I see Valentino and we trained together yeah every day I train more conditioning and strange more than kickboxing really yeah I don't have a trainer in kickboxing what that's right yeah really people people don't believe doesn't believe it when I say that but I'm trained yourself I trained myself that since I have of course my friend in in France hold-hold meets for me for sure I can I can hold meet for might myself he own me for me and we just talk together we just plan a game plan together for a fight we just saw I'm my own coach you know that is crazy I never be at your level yeah to be your own cut you've never had a coach of course I I had the Pharaohs teach me after that he couldn't teach me anymore because because of his job you know why not when I was young and then I just moved from the country and countries and countries to learn to learn to learn and then came back in France Paris and I just trained myself that is insane how many world champions just train themselves I think nobody how do you do that that sounds great but why didn't you get another coach I don't know because I need to find a coach who can I don't know we can just teach me I really don't know that's a good question either I don't know why did I what I didn't found a new coach I don't know because I thought about making any trips to Holland or the time no you know Bordeaux in France sure yeah so I was raised there that's where I started the kickboxing I started with full contact you know full contact sure Rick Rufus yeah really yeah why I was watching reproof his brother really is one of the big coaches in yeah his name is 'm his brother Duke Duke Rufus yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he's a friend of mine it's great oh nice yeah he's out of Milwaukee yes yeah Rufus for yeah yeah so when I started full contact I was watching all the fight of yeah jet especially a recruit force against Rob comin the first and the second was crazy crazy crazy recruit against a nice toast contact fight so after after Mike my first coach couldn't teach me anymore I just float to Amsterdam because yeah because of Cameron you know in my mind I was thinking about okay where is the best kickboxing in the planet I'm Howlin so I went to Holland meteor gym was famous because of camera and because of Remy Bonjasky sure and I went to meet Georgie my train there maybe two years you know I was flying Bodo Amsterdam during two years and yeah the coach was on him and not me teach me a lot you know I learned a lot and when I I figure out that I couldn't learn anymore else in majority I just went to Belgium because I met samyamas Ruby is a very very great coach for me is the best coach I never I never had why wouldn't you spend your camps with him man why yeah because because we meet each other at an event in France and then I saw one of his fighter it was fighting and then when I saw his technique he's his condition he was you know his first round was looking the same at his fifth round was crazy a very very high level condition his name is Muhammad Indu was very crazy and I say that's that's like this I want to fight right he was so technical you know and I say that's what like this I want to fight I went to Belgium in Brussels and I trained with him also two years I was driving Paris percent Paris Brazil two years during two years I trained with him and I that's with Samir that I won my first Bell against Nikolas can he if you watch my face before Nikolas can and the fight against achillion is completely two different fighter so why don't you do your camps with him now now because you live in pure sense I can't so that's why I left some you but some is still in my corner when I fight just come you know but I don't train anymore which I mean so there's no one in Paris no nor in Bordeaux that you can for me the best the best the best trainer the best school is in percents the Queensbury gym and I never found another under the gym with that kind of role so I cannot train with any coach you know and I just tried myself my friend hold meat for me I trained with Valentino the conditioning training for me was more important than than the kickboxing everybody knows keyboards now we know how to keep us but the difference we will be make with the condition for that's interesting you know there's a there's a thought process that follows those lines in MMA and it's more for innovation and they've only trained a few fighters but they've had very high levels of success because of their conditioning and what they say is that they already know how to fight so just let's concentrate on the conditioning it's gets your conditioning to a super high level and that when you're fighting you can just go yeah that's right that's what I say every time when I when I I give advices to to people they say what should I trained is this technique listen between two two fighters in the same level the same experience what's gonna make the difference the condition in the fight you know if you fight one two three rounds and then you fucked up you don't lose the fight right if you tried five wrong and even if you're not good enough technically you're gonna win the fight for sure because you don't get tired yeah now another crazy thing about you that people might not know is that you're a comedian yeah that's right your stand-up comedian yes right which is hilarious before yes but do you for you to be a world champion kickboxer in a stand-up comedian that is a very unusual combination that's right because photos my first dream and the still still my dream today is to become an actor a comedian and before before I started a combat sport yeah I was doing stand-up I was I was in high school also I was learning comedian stuff actor acting and I really I really liked it and then come the campus spot and then I started to improve myself to become yeah more to fight to fight to fight and then I I stopped it a bit yeah stand-up acting but three months ago I was I played in a small movie short movie in France yeah I play that is gonna it's gonna go out in few few few weeks now when you do stand-up in Paris are you working at comedy clubs like do they have comedy clubs in Paris it's not in Paris comedy club in the environment order yeah yeah I was very young I was I still young but I was eighteen nineteen and so Bordeaux has comedy club yes coming to close it's all obviously in French in French of course yeah not in English right have you ever done comedy in English never never oh yes one in he can find it in YouTube is I was I was teaching people how to cook how to good air to cook a great chicken yeah I did that I did that with glory I was promoting my my my my second fight against nickel skin and I was training in Belgium Purcell and I did I did it with glory one find it on YouTube so is that something you would think of doing once you retire from five yeah that's I really want to do it that's my first my first and my first way that's what I really really want to do in front in the top five bottom and in the top of my heart does does what I want to become because I read that you if you had to choose between being a famous comedian or a famous fighter you would choose to be a family really yeah really but that's so crazy when you see how good you are fighting yeah you know people people doesn't believe when I say that but if if I didn't find if kickboxing didn't found me because I think I didn't find it isn't found kickboxing kickboxing family if kickboxing did never find me I would follow my my Wayne and comedy stuff yeah yeah for sure and so now I'm good and keep working so I just follow myself well you're better than good now how did you become how did kickboxing find you you said I found you because I was I was 16 so 10 years ago I was 16 and I was playing soccer I was playing soccer and I wasn't that good I was yeah just I was just fast you know but and in front of the goal I was falling no I wasn't that good you know and one one day my cousin just just call me and you say hey in front of the house in the neighborhood there is a gym boxing is there I thought I thought I thought that was boxing like Muhammad Ali Mike Tyson I say yeah if yes but so what he said yeah let's go try it yeah it's gonna be maybe is gonna be funny you know I saw I saw people who goes out from there they had how you oh yeah black guy this is gonna it should be fine and say okay once we're gonna do good so after my my soccer training I went there once I tried and I I discovered that it was full contact with legs with high kick middle cake was a little bit strange but I just follow I just train getting better and better and just I like it so immediately like you caught yeah immediately after my first training I went there and you know that that and you know that my mother was against that she said no no no I don't want you two to fight I don't want you to train a boxing I don't want any boxing in this house I was I cry when he when she she say that because I really like a full-contact combat sport so I cried when I when she told me that and I was training but she doesn't she doesn't knew that he doesn't know that no secret yeah secret was secret how old were you when you had your first fight my first 17:17 didn't know no no so this was for contact or contact which may be three years from contact and then I yeah let's explain to people don't know full contact is no leg kicks yeah yeah no full contact is no low kicks low-key yeah yeah one case yeah that's all I can kick the legs yeah laundry me the kinks yeah yeah yeah you guys have different turns it's called low kick you know yeah we call it leg kick make cakes yeah but low kicks is correct low kicks are correct so you just can't kick the legs which is interesting because that's very effective and you're very good at that yeah it's a part of your game yeah yeah so but I'm better in boxing because I start with with full contact and he is it is a little bit similar than than boxing the way you move the way you fight because no low kick no leg kicks right so yeah it's a little bit severe I was boxing and when I was training for contact I was watching a lot of Muhammad Ali so yeah movements yeah I'm better in the in in boxing when I fight kickbox when did your mom find out after after one year after my first fight she was like way when was you I see no I was a soccer training and she why do you have gloves I said Oh sometimes I go to watch boxing and she say I told you I don't want you to watch em to fight I said no I know I'm not training just watching she said no I don't want it and everyday I just went to the - train - train to train and she doesn't see me with any black eye or things like that so one day she was very very tired and I say yeah mom listen I went to the the boxing training and she was like okay and then the day after I wanted a boxing training I was like okay I think because she didn't see me with any black eyes I thought that's why she was scared first right yeah and then she just accept the thing because I make her in French weak record at fussing I just I just went to the training like fuck it I like it so I do it and - what do you say in French forcing forcing yeah forcing like we just we just go hey you you don't care you don't cave someone they say don't do that it's like a bucket yeah like for kid of my mom so it's very funny because sometimes I sent her this video I say look at you look at you you you didn't want me to to fight first and now look at you and now she's very excited yeah well I mean she must be happy that you do it now now that you're world champion yeah she's just watch you on television yet that's my motivation my mother well that's beautiful yeah for me everything if I country my stories is is amazing my mom did everything for my sister and me [Applause] that's wrong oh that's amazing yeah wow that's incredible man man that's amazing that's amazing and no she's like that and that's got to be so crazy imagine if you're a mother you give birth to a boy you'd give birth to a child and then you grow that sure they raise that child and then you want a child become a world champion yeah that must be crazy this is yeah yeah baby and she's like and when I when I sometimes when I talk with my mother I say listen I really I do my best in the gym I train every day harder than how to to to knock people out and I really hope that I will never get knockout because I don't want you to see to see me yeah fall down you know I don't I don't want want her to feel this this kind of ambition yeah I just wanted to be to be happy that I want so he trained very hard so yeah that is an amazing video she's hugging he doesn't even know he's your last fight against how do you say his name nah bf I love you yeah he's a bad motherfucker man yeah he's very good and for you to knock him out like that the way you nobody knock him out you know it's very tricky yes sneaky yeah that guy fights very technical yeah yeah but I was so focused in on the fight because did you ever see Robin brat you know Robin black is no Robin black is a friend of mine and he he breaks down fights yeah he talks about like what someone did that works so well the guy who say enjoy the acidity my friends yes yes that's exactly he's famous for saying Bink I love that guy he's a good friend of mine but he did a breakdown of your fight the way you set up that right I said the way he knocked him out was very cool it's very cool to see that getting more and more attention knob you have this very good man so for you to set him up like that doing second room I say I say before if I say I wouldn't look him on at the stick around because second room the first one for me is just warming up and then the second I feel very very good but it's the most dangerous round when you fight against me because the second one I'm wrong you know I just look just ready yeah yeah I'm ready for everything so he's a very good fighter you set a trap for him now a trap yeah the way you said yeah yeah yeah yeah for me I I just follow my you know my my plan you know I just wanted to fight I I didn't want him to read my my move my measurement yeah so he just the kid came before that needs before that me because I touch him with the left hook and the right hook it was wobbly on his on his legs mm-hmm and then yeah he just throw a knee in boom yeah so they finish now it was very impressive yeah very impressive to knock that guy out and that has to be so as you're looking at your career now and you're saying that there's no one else to beat after you knock out a guy like not be have yeah it's does that make it harder for you to get motivated no because for me is an more you win fights more I'm getting to the top of the world like UFC champ enough yes maybe after the UFC belt I will have another I don't know maybe a yes no for me I still get because if I now I'm great champs so if I lose my my my title defense now I'll be good I will go down so I need to keep the same time laughs yeah yeah the same level so that's one money way what do they mean yeah so when you tell me that you do strength and conditioning everyday look what kind of stuff are you doing today like we talked today and you said that you were running on the beach yes so today I wanted to Train first like it's not so strange but is like I don't know how to call that in English but it's like conditioning conditioning training we we want to do and I think that's what we will do after conditioning with them as a bike the bike was amazing also also raining I show you different stuff also raining and he's like he's training me the same way I have to I have to feel the same thing I feel inside the cage inside the ring so does that's the conditioning training so today was a relaxed run relax running and yet tonight is gonna be harder you know were you training tonight so tonight I think I will train right after the show in your gym all right yeah and I gotta take a picture yeah my gym so I think I'm chained there because you have yeah your gym is so so fully so complete so exhaustive so cool I like it so you see how are we gonna try okay I cannot talk about you know I'm like you wanna give yeah you're the coach tell me what I do push-ups okay I just don't you just do it yeah sometimes I ask question like when I'm in decay in the ring why do I need to do that and then he explained to me and then I okay let's go but no I can talk about exactly the training what does that meaning so he has you do a lot of cardio exercises but I just want him to yeah that's what I say before we we started training camp I say hey I want my couch you're better than ever and I wanna keep my power even improve my power you see I got you and then we go so is there a lot of weightlifting as well no no not a lot we need to maybe twice a week we do that very poor training twice a week legs and upper body and then what kind of weightlifting are you talking about like Olympic style tree like Adele's Condon squat squats and deadlifts deadlift presses stuff like that yeah yeah our move not presses but we do it in any lateral like one legs one leg okay yeah yeah yeah that's what it is how you do yeah so unlike Ross you to use kettlebells I I hate that hurt me yeah I don't like the feeling and I have big hands so my both of my hand inside the cutter but yeah I feel like all four swings yeah yeah yeah well you say if you learn how to do it correctly it doesn't hurt as much yeah yeah you just got to learn how to swing it through why put it through when he comes here yeah that's hurt me a lot yeah yeah you gotta learn how to just rotate it through baby guys you do it you rotate it through maybe I don't have the technique yeah but it is did you ever get a good kettlebell instructor to show you okay but answer it sir yeah I even don't know that yeah I can show you a little bit I'm not qualified to really show you but a really good kettlebell instructor it's a technique as you're swinging like if you're like cleans yes to clean as you're doing it you're just sort of punching through a lot of people they lift it up and just yeah yeah you don't want that you want to control the kettlebell I guess yeah yeah it's some kid yeah I'll show you some stuff it's I'm a kettlebell fan yeah yeah but obviously you see all the machines I saw I saw the C's like at the back she's all the monkey oh yeah yeah we have a Bigfoot I have an alien I have gorillas I have camels yeah do you see the Bigfoot one that's the big that's fucking huge like yeah that's I don't know how many kilograms that is it's like yeah we got Star Wars ones yeah we got a Darth Vader that quit yeah those are all from on it yeah we have a bunch of cool-looking kettlebells but just regular kettlebells are fine I'm a fan I just think they're the great thing about kettlebells is they make you use your whole body and everything all at once not like an no regular weight right now like isolation exercises yes do you do battle ropes do you do that I do it yeah I like it the most that I like is the you know the the things where you run but he's not electric just running yes we have one of those yeah that's from the same assault bike company yeah it's called the air runner assault air runner yeah that thing's the shit 13% harder than regular running that's a fail yeah because you're forcing yeah you're footsteps that's what I said Valentina because it he he wrote me a program like 400 meters you do this 408 and I was like this machine I was like maybe you were stylist you know it was good - it's hard oh yeah very good what about the versa climber you ever use that one oh yeah I use it once that's amazing what the code.you is good yeah it's amazing how many different machines there are you could get your cardio on so the beautiful thing about it is I like it because it's variety yeah you know different things all that yeah force your body adapt to different things my best training what I like to do is to run but on stage that's training I prefer yeah I do it once a week yeah once a week every Thursday morning that's the training I prefer because I have big legs and yeah I yeah it's also not pounding - right because you're pushing on yeah you're pushing just slamming it yes like when people are friends that run on concrete and Mike Wolfe yeah if you're bad for your knees that can't be good yes not as good for me I like it well Hills stairs yeah I prefer oh yeah yeah no do you run you say you ran on the beach today yeah do you have any it's bored bored out doesn't have beaches right not not in Bordeaux no the bitch is too often too far - it's too far to go training that's a great way to run - though if you can run on sand yeah on sand is very very good for the core and also for legs you know that's works a lot of muscles very deep knee versus yes yes like now when you're training you doing strength and conditioning are you using a heart rate monitor are you using yeah what's the brand of the bowl oh yeah and it's especially for the trainer because I don't care you know II just look and make his cocoon is it's mathematics oh so he keeps you at a certain heart rate yeah you want to keep me in there do you monitor your heart rate in terms of like when you wake up to make sure that you're not over trained no I never do that no no I just just goes training if I feel good a good training FIFA style I got trained you know I funny man some so many elite fighters the same way I had Terence Crawford here yeah yeah same thing yeah yeah I like whole school good things I like also new school things like you know polo things you know I like those kind of new things but for me then yeah the compass part is it's a mind thing or so you know don't get too much how you say that too much electronic technical yeah you just a you have to train twice a day every morning every everything let's go you feel tired let's go training yeah when I'm sick like when I got I get the cold I just could run in training you know and instead of people say no I'm tired I don't know I'm trying I go training because I think the sport is the the best medication in the world well that's right even when you're sick even I want to seek and that's that's work because when you say training you're not kidding you're not sparring not sparring just running yeah just in the bag hit the bag in looks boring because sparring is then I will contaminate my yes my terminate yeah that's funny yeah so when you say Mentos do you use a mentor coach do you have no no because I think some people need a mental coach and some doesn't need for me like my story is a I think I have my of course I need a mental coach writing I am my own mental coach my story for me is is a big motivation for me so tell everybody your story it's like he's fuckin long but I can tell a short story like like when I think about everything I I went true in the in my love I'm talking like I'm I'm 55 but yes yeah of course I was born in Cameroon and then my mom moved to Paris when I was 8 and then one hour later I we went my sister and I we went to Paris to follow my mom and yeah we was living in a in a small apartment you know a very small apartment one room you know no water we was we we went to the how you say that to restaurant to to ask water with big bottle of water empty we went to restaurant to ask water you know it was yeah my mom went roof of so many things when I think about everything we went through in when I'm in inside the locker room I'm stressed you know I'm nervous I just think about it and I say hey listen look where you are now you trained for that you trained for this you trained for everybody is waiting for you everyone is screaming so don't get nervous this is nothing you know so just go in and yeah do what you you like to do fight overcoming hardship a lot of times is the best teacher yeah that's right so you know where you came from so you know the hardships and I know where I want to go where I wouldn't learn so for me I'm before I fight the Nicholson I used to get nervous in the look home and I say hey you wanna find Nikki Hawks can and you nervous for this guy right come on I know it's funny it's like you get what you asked for yeah but while you're coming up you're like oh shit it's now inspiring I was like the same with me I talk a lot of shit on internet right before and when I'm in the locker room like why did I say that I remember the fight against Nicky I make a poster on internet with his head like oh yeah and I was like that's gonna us was gonna happen I mean the fight and he was like no I don't care about Internet I don't care about Instagram I don't care about torque I would talk in the ring like and during the fight it was in front of me and the referee was like check check handsy for what if we if you like it was like he went back to his corner like let's go I want to fuck him up and yeah I was like oh you talk you talk shit but now you have to back it up so I remember that fight yeah it was very interesting because I'm a big Nikki Holt skin fan as well during collision yes yes I remember that fight I was watching I was like wow like this guy he's got his number like you you buy that by the time the fourth round came around I was like you are you're ahead on points and it looked like you had his style figured out yeah yeah yeah I was this is I think for me this is one of my best fight in the my best fight ever I was so small in this in that fight so yeah you were small enough right in what way what do you see you said you were so small on that fight no I said I was smart because I didn't want to knock him out right I said I would knock him out but that was fake right yeah that was only a strategy so I know I I would know I would not knock him out because he's so strong he's so smart and he's a counter at the counter fighter so on yeah I was very very small make my pawns and then yeah after three fight against three fight after Nikki yeah people was calling me a runner because I was making a lot of points and and then now they'll call him in the number one powerful power in glory isn't that crazy yeah you fought Nicky twice twice when did you find me again well the second time I fought Nicky and then I fought Congo and then I fought Nicky again and you beat him again yeah yeah point and after the fight I remember I say you run too much I say respect my style I respect your style a West I'll do you think you'd fight him differently now mmm y-yes yeah yeah I think if I fight Nicky like tomorrow I will find quite different I would go for the knockout this time because I'm not the same fighters before so I think I really I wish success I will knock him out he's over in one Fc now huh yeah which is interesting because they fight in a cage yeah little gloves too ya know oh he's using wait time when is some time you fight little glow they mix it up yeah they did a lot of a lot of different rules yeah when he knocked out Cosmo Alexander dolls yeah it was it crazy yeah that's a crazy knockout but showed you how good he is and then you see Cosmo Alexander fuck up sage Northcutt and you realize how good Cosmo is yeah and then you see how bad Nicky beat up Cosmo yeah he's good yeah it's very good I like you know before before I fight Nicky it was one of my my yeah my best fighter III I ever liked because when I was watching him against Karim gaji the French fries when I watch him against Joseph wealthy lady yeah fucking fucking strong Daniels yeah I was like because for me Joseph Anton it's not a it's an easy fight in the opponent he's very strong so he stopped him in the last round yeah with the with the right hook or maybe a left hook well bartolini who's a really good fighter he got a little carried away was trying to trade with him yeah in the end of the fight and yeah Niki Karim was I was like I have really really liked this final and then when I when I received that email that I will face Nicky was called like thank you the skin and you were only 24 yeah thinking at the time like holy shit it's here yeah and I did I didn't even have a strength and conditioning coach now only kickboxer only Samia boxing and now I was doing my my shit alone running in the morning and just train by myself what kind of kick but what kind of strength conditioning were you doing other than running uh push-ups running some crow's feet but nothing what you doing now no no I was doing things I was watching on youtube you know world champion watching stuff on YouTube learning it's great like John Jones before when he thought I heard about him he was saying that he saw the MMA watching a fights on on YouTube sure yeah try moves out yeah fights yeah yeah well some people just talented ya know some people find a way now when you think about those fights like and how important those fights were to you especially the Nicki Holtz can fight when you look back it's got to be kind of a crazy feeling that that that sort of that made your career that Nicki hose can fight particularly the first one yeah right because you know my father was a little bit hilarious because the story of that fight I was the co-main even and I think that fight was was made for Nicki on screen you know because I had only three fights in robbery and they put me a tighter shot as I was a little bit and entertaining and I made pasta and things like that they say okay it's gonna be a good good show but that gonna be a fight for Nicki you know for sure I think this say to themselves Nicki gonna win the fight Nicki is undefeated you know nobody could beat him you're gonna win the fight and yeah is the fight just before but very Enrico fights so a lot of eyes was on us so I just created the surprise and yeah I just surprised everybody and that's why I have a lot of fans in Morocco because they there was waiting for by the rarefied and they sold me so yeah I was like I receive a lot of beside from like oh my brother I really like a spy you you funny and yeah and Moroccans love fight yeah yeah yeah those are wild people I liked American or Rican fans in American people because uh yeah I went to Brazil during two years and who says a lot of American people in Holland also a lot of American people do you think you'll be fighting on the next Rico bar horrifying it seems like you think so yeah it seems long as that because before that there is a December December before December there is a - event in in in October and there are they are almost booked so I think yeah for me it's gonna be December it's gonna be a good thing because I like butter army yes and yeah to fight in the same Cod this is my third time I would fight in the same color I think that's bad huh yeah I'm very interested to see how he fights Rico in a second fine me too very very interesting because good knows very good crazy cardio first yeah Crisco Joey's and he moves like like a welterweight house when he fight if I'd like working it's not like a regular any weight well they beat everybody in every division he beats everybody yeah he told me that when he was training when he was coming up he was training with the light guys yeah so he's like you have to move yeah so he developed that cardio and that ability from training with guys like 180 pounds yeah yeah that's what for me and the fight him the way photogate - jamol been said they yeah like it was almost almost done the first of the second I don't remember it was almost done and then the way home knock him out back and the last of the fourth night in the forefront it was great I was like yeah this is a good chance it was a real champ that's so smart it's very small but you know I like I really I think people like butter re because because of everything history because of the man the bad boy yeah and then he's fine yeah he's very strong and there is it's really cool to watch and yeah and when when butter come when the when the the speaker called bother re and he comes in him the mood is just you know everybody's you can see the flash of many phones in the original it's great it's very crazy feeling when when bothering fight he's the most famous yeah is famous in the militant he's a legend and he's not just a legend because of his fighting which is mean he's been an incredible fighter but also just because he's so crazy yeah he's always get in trouble yeah that's right yeah that people love by the road because of the fighter yeah also because of the bad boy yeah it's funny fighters that get in trouble in Conor McGregor's been in a bunch of trouble lately yeah you know some people are upsetting them and some people are not and it's just it's not good you know everything's not good but he's a wild man wild man do wild shit yeah not good to smack that guy at the bar though I watched that again I thought it was like a touch last time I talked about I thought he'd just sort of touched him in the head was hand I saw the video looks like almost like a punch yeah almost like a buzz yeah he hit him I misspoke I thought he just I basically thought he just touched him in the face no cuz I watched it on my phone and it just wasn't that clear no and I watched on a computer was like oh what does what does he do you do that oh my god I don't know maybe the guy said something really bad to him but either wouldn't you know you just big star so huge doesn't want your whiskey but he's although the wild shit like grabbing that guy's phone and stomping on it I saw that he's just a little too crazy just a little too crazy sometime I didn't notice that maybe it was drunk I don't know probably maybe something else yeah I can say nothing about this yeah but yeah maybe it was drank that's what I told first I was like he was drunk mate but even your team may control you you know your guy may got you yeah if you offer a man at a bar a drink and he doesn't want it and you punch him in the head he's definitely made some mistakes but I love why personal fight it's a wild dude it's amazing how many fans he has - I've never seen anything like it why don't ya early on is it you early on in his career before he was a champion remember after the fight yes when you when you slept guys your name keep keep it keep it but the problem with him is gonna be guys like khabib and he wants a rematch with could be do you think he could be be kind of fired could be fucked him up yeah why would he fight him again that's right I think a money fight yeah I think the money fight for him is Nate Nate Nate yeah that's a big fight but Nate they're talking about Nate fighting miles Badal you know fights Jorge Masvidal I think that fight is that's a huge fight as well and you know Conor may or may not ever fight again like who knows he says he's going to but yeah maybe maybe poor you just yeah maybe but poor yeas got a fight could be yeah you know I mean that's next month that's that's the big fight yeah right and khabib is the big I mean Cubs the only one undefeated in the division his wrestling is fucking terrifying he gets people on the ground I see shit out of them I assume more than okay it was just crazy Kobe's yeah he started studying a common spot when he was when he was kid yeah it's very yeah you ever see how they play basketball little Harris my friend who's will Harris productions been in here before as well he filmed these guys playing basketball I was watching that podcast and then after that video I just went to the future to watch the video you was talking about and yeah the basketball crazy it's crazy the Western basketball gets a guy in a rear naked choke and the guy stopped you can't even tap like the whole thing is so like they're they're hard people and they are hard people I i watch the poster girl it was talking about he went there to film Kabhi and yes it was yeah well what was very talented will Harris he does a great job of capturing these guys stories yeah and put in he's a nice guy people like him so they're loose and relaxed around and he's very talented as a filmmaker so when he puts these these pieces together they're very impactful and that theme is on the YouTube yes yes all the stuff is on YouTube what is this Conor McGregor two-faced Floyd Mayweather in Japan what is today that so this is I just looked up his name so I brought it up there's a game show they supposedly have assigned to be on where they're gonna compete against each other and this says he signed or he's going to sign for a reported ten million dollars to do it to do a game show non-contact so Winchell like break contract or anything so he didn't get that much money for that like ten million bucks for a game show well they paid Floyd nine million dollars to fight that uh the Japanese yeah he's supposed to be part of that too yeah intention yeah yeah yeah Naz Okawa who's a bad motherfucker but he's tiny yes so small yeah and a lot of people thought that that fight was fixed with him and Floyd I was like no like even good fuck good like fight commentators thought that was fake I was like watch it again let's watch it again first 120 pounds he fights a hundred and twenty six pounds Floyd beat the fuck out of him he's so much bigger Floyd was so loose he just was just clubbed him in the head this is that clearly when you fight freely mÃ©rida you must train like like you ever did then they didn't even give him enough chance like the ego was a couple of months yes didn't have to get in shape for that look Floyd is way bigger than him way bigger I mean Floyd's on a big man yes way bigger than tension tensions tiny he's a tiny little as but against those other 120-pound guys he's amongst those guys up yeah it's very good very even in kickboxing yes he's very very good very interesting yeah does like wild shit like weird spinning kick yeah like Japanese fight a very good like a second Oreos one of my favorite fighter in Japan yes yes and then twins brothers or yerba Co Yahoo Robby and the other guy I don't know it's it was damaging to tensions legacy because everybody thought he was a joke after Floyd that's what I thought not even if he left Floyd let him kick it would be a different fight that's what I was hoping I was hoping when they were talking about a fight I was like it's gonna be a kickboxing fight like me Floyd be so crazy that he's a go ahead and kick let's see what's up there's only been a few world champion boxers Vince Phillips remember when he fought he fought in Japan he fought Masato mm-hmm Assad known the son fucked his legs up walk this guy was a book son yes world champion cool ins Phillips yeah see pull that up Vince Phillips vs. Masato and Vince was like at the end of his career is like 40 he's in Canadian Vince fitted aa thing he's American I think he's American and Masato just fucked his legs up and kicked his legs out from under him frans both remember friends both that he fought Tyson there it is Vince Phillips and you know Vince was just it was it was a fight was just a terrible idea and he's fighting barefoot and I mean he really should have fought with shoes on just said I'm not gonna kick because he wasn't gonna kick anyway but Masato just fucked those legs up did it rain like folks just went either fuck man I don't know because look he's getting lit up Paul Shannon Briggs did to Shannon Shannon the cannon he went over there and he falls he he's already done his Caitlin um I think it was k1 yes I mean they basically just set it up so making his leg Masato just Fox his legs up kicked into his arms and everything I mean Masato barely tried to box with them and look this is already done you can't even watch anymore already done his arms are fucked up and then misato's trying to neum means fucking those legs up man it's a like a master class in how to fuck up a world-class boxer with kicks see lik Masato's already he's getting him to bite those faint so I believe that leg kick right there oh you know he's done his leg is toast right now he could barely walk look look how he's trying to walk around he's just hanging in there hanging in there he can't yeah there it is there it is there it is yeah he's fucked look he's in agony you can hmm yeah books and again the kick books I know you can't it's amazing people just don't know they really don't know they don't know what it feels like to be like kicked especially by a guy like you even a kickboxer what even me when I get low kicks they're easy even the first round in the in the ring because you are in the locker room you're just warming up you know and yeah but when you inside ring punches and kikis you feel i don't maybe twice ten times more than in the gym it's not the same like a sparring and the fight is not really the same no no because of the pressure the light the yeah everything is different serving you know everything even the the the smell of of your your opening body some people don't wash just so they stink when they fight the Matt Lindland apparently was famous for that he used to wrestle that way he's to not not wash himself and then like what guys would fight on the ability what a fuck one of one of my last openers it was thinking of fuck really I can say he can say is no he was in glory I was like damn at the first one he clinched me I was like purpose no I don't think so have some things fuck with your head a little bit no I think a good move to smell really bad yeah maybe guys wouldn't want to have anything to do with you because I don't think they test for that something people would die all on the gloves oh how odd is really one time when I fought in the in France and the final of the tournament after the first one was my skin was burned I was like seems like somebody put me you know tight all on the face and get in your eyes yeah and after the fight my coach told me call me you know this that team used to do that they put oil on their gloves for the first round and then they just put you on the on the face on your eyes they just clean shoe and then after the first one you fucked up like that's terrible it's crazy I don't know how people can do that if you win even if having the fight they don't test for that they don't check to make sure time sometime the referee smell the gloves then the hose before it's the small organization okay not like glory yeah you can't did you ever fight more Thai as well I found two times my rules to time Tokyo did you fight the same way your same style with a lot of movement and a lot of movement yes but was was yeah old K were the first of the first round yeah as I said before I used to kill people first one I didn't care about I just go boom boo-boom boo-boom ko ko ko ko before glory because now I'm giri's I love it fighters it's not easy to knock them out who do you who do you think it like the best fighters in glory outside of you outside of me who do you enjoy watching if Nikki was still there I was saying Nikki but a snake is not anymore which fight I like to what he's gone also Ruben when Huisman yeah this is really like he's gonna fight MMA yeah he's guy he's training in Florida with Henry Hooft oh yeah yeah in Farina that's why he's told me yeah but now as a Ruben is gone a guy I like to watch fight yeah instead of bothering me but ball ready don't fight often yeah I don't know there are many fighter I likes so um so we can look forward to you fighting again sometime around December hopefully yeah yeah when you do dis to come to the UFC please come back and we'll talk about it and we'll we'll make an announcement we'll make a big deal out of it what you mean I want when you do fight in the UFC yeah you leave glory oh you want it's that's a big deal yeah a guy like you world champion kickboxer cool make it one of my yeah my big ring if if I had Dino white in front of me right now I can hook that up I would say hey Dan I was up so you try a champ right you trust Camaros man or you trust your fighter right I'm the best I'm the best in kickboxing I'm the best in combat sport and I can beat your champ and I can became become your next champ I'm the future you know I'm 26 all those people in in welterweight division are hold or boring to watch so yeah I'm the future and I I really think I can I gonna beat anybody in well there's guys that you're gonna have to fight first I'm just gonna be honest with you they're not gonna give you a title shot yeah I want to see you fight against a good fighter but they could give you a fight against a top-ten contender yeah that because like guys like Camaro othman I mean they will earn their way up to me a champion of cool you can't just I don't I agree em but that's that's why he's my dream but a guy like Anthony Pettis yeah who's still an elite fighter but who just lost Nate Diaz that is possible that's possible yeah if you came in with a lot of hype and you know and obviously glory is on UFC fight pass so they had an agreement with glory so they could use your highlight reel yeah of course and we could sell it even Greek and talked with us in we can make something and I think yeah I don't think I will do it so yeah pitties is good and then especially as a striker yes that's what makes yeah Paris would try to stand with you maybe but first yeah yeah as a confidence first I was thinking about Diaz because I really like the way fight is so crazy yes yes and I think yeah if I fight and because also nobody could knock him out maybe I'm wrong what Josh Thompson knocked him out yeah in yeah yeah so far him in the head kick I thought nobody couldn't knock him out so that's why I wanted to be the first no Josh Thompson who's probably one of the most underrated fighters ever who was one of the very best in the world but then he left the UFC when the UFC dropped 155-pound division many many years back and he went over to Strikeforce and became one of the best he said it's absolutely one of the most unheralded professional fighters in the world he's an elite elite fighter but he knocked out Nate Diaz oh yeah he's the only guy well he stopped him he dropped him with a head kick and then finish them off I just second one maybe you'd be the first got to submit him with that yeah but listen man I'm a fan it was an honor having you in here I really appreciate your time and we're gonna take some pictures are you working out here cool right yeah all right Dubey ladies and gentlemen thank you brother thank you very much [Applause] [Music]
