and stefan molyneux - right I mean you do not believe the deviations I think some people just cough it up but the Klingon air boys wrench correct yes but it's like French French not like WABAC French oh ok what is this mystery Corvette French and French French um well you know like the Queen and cockney episode a the difference right so Quebec French is like the gutter at least by the French that considered to be the gutter the gutter press Oh rude I know it's party or anything very nice people yeah very nice people indeed and for the French to look down and people after the Second World War takes a lot anyway for folks listening this we're we're in Toronto right now this is the first time I've met Stephin I met him just a few moments ago down in the lobby but I've seen a lot of your internet videos and I was particularly impressed with several them but really the the trayvon martin one i think you covered that better than anyone i saw online on TV in the media you gave a real you know that quote the Fox fair and unbalanced you give a real fair and balanced approach to that subject and to me personally as a human being that was one of the most frustrating events of our day not just because a young man lost his life not just because of the the race-baiting that went on with it but the cloudy muddy thinking that I felt was perpetrated by the media and by politicians and by all these people that were looking to capitalize on that event there were the the thinking was so disingenuous and they were showing these photos of him when he was like a fucking baby yeah it was it was really confusing stuff to me and actually if you looked at George Zimmerman over time the pictures got wider and wider like they actually applied photo retouching to make him look lighter oh yeah I was I mean it was it was like Gestapo style propaganda it was just wretched Wow I didn't know that they did that and you know they edited his 911 call right really yeah so so Zimmerman called and he said that some suspicious guy rolling around the neighborhood right and then the the dispatcher said what is his race and he said well I think he's black and NBC added it out the question so it sounded like this is a suspicious guy rolling around the neighborhood I think he's black like he just saw one but he was actually responding to a question they edited that out the woman lost her job and then he's now suing NBC for defamation edit it to make him sound like the racist well you know I don't know if it's really bright for him to be involved any further in the legal system but I think you know what they did was it was horrendous it was very strange it was very strange to watch I think you know what my approach and you know all said he wanted to live in a colorblind society and I think that would be great so for me I always try to try and look at it like well what if he wasn't black what if he was just some other white guy what if they were both black or what if they were both rainbow colored with Dolphin heads I don't know right but what if it had nothing to do with the sort of black energy around break the negative energy around race and so for me I really just wanted to look at it like you know that Joe Friday thing you know one of the facts what are the facts whatever facts because I really have stripes driven and it's hard to do in this culture to just treat people like color doesn't matter mm-hmm and that means you don't get to play the race card yeah you know and I think Britney would be great if we could achieve that yeah seems so hard for people against it well it's too common it's like it's almost it's just as a natural part of our culture we that pattern has been so firmly established that path has been so deeply carved that people just slide right into it you know well I wondered too you know this this horrible shooting that just happened in the Navy yeah in Washington Alexis I wonder I there's no proof of this yet all bullshit Mike the hypotheticals but I wonder if this guy was a black guy and apparently he had a real chip on his shoulder about you know I'm not gonna get ahead because they hate me that why he hates me and all that he had real chip on his shoulder about being black and trying to get ahead in a white world or whatever I wonder if the degree to which they did not intervene in his is obviously escalating mental health problems with because they were afraid that he was going to launch some complaint about racism or something like that I wonder if that actually scares people off from dealing with people just like they're human beings because they're afraid of that card hold and then getting dragged into something god-awful yeah well it's almost like we're still responding to the echoes of the imbalance of the past that you know the slavery era echoes and the civil rights era echoes of the the 50s and 60s it's almost like we're still not even the ship hasn't we haven't made it level yet you know it's almost like that's why this stuff is still tolerated it's it's very confusing to me though when it's it's so obvious and so blatant like it was in this case it's also very frustrating to me because as a person who deals with a lot of martial artists and a lot of people with anger issues who have become you know really incredible members of society and really admirable human beings people who have learned to harness this this frustrated energy that a lot of young men have with if they grow up and Confused the households or whether the absentee parents or bad neighborhoods or whatever the factors are that lead them to be these angry people that can be channeled and it can be channeled into a way that develops character and it doesn't happen so when I see a guy like Trayvon Martin do what he does and get shot and die and all this I see a massive loss of potential just as a human being a young human being you know a young human being that commits crimes and those bad things about 18 is not even necessarily a bad person what they are more than anything is just misused potential and misguided a human being is so incredibly complex there's so many facets and aspects to being a person and developing as a productive member of society that it needs guidance and most people don't get that guidance and it's up to them to kind of find it I mean you see it an unbelievable tragedy like that anything I always think of like all the the terms and the steps and though other possibilities that might have happened early intervention some teachers somewhere some relative or someone who would have just seen something going off the rails and really stepped in and made a difference I think that title way it can be stopped early I think once it gains real momentum it stuff later on around you know early intervention yeah really really seeing people who are going off the rails and then really working to intervene if we could get that down as a society man I think we live in a different world we would absolutely agree with you we would work live in a different world but it is very very very difficult to do incredibly difficult to pull someone out of that momentum the momentum of being a bad person and you know and almost reveling in it you know which is a big aspect of you know gangster rap and well you know they've they've done some really interesting studies because you know they just over the last 10 or 15 years we see inside the brain but for the first time ever again these MRIs again really see inside the brain yeah and they found people who they've who've been identified as sadists and they show them you know pictures of people being hurt intentionally and they're like happy joy centers light up their little like brained Anselm's night huh that's so messed up it's a crime you know because it's like opposite planet you know it all thing we've got this thing from religion like everyone has a soul and we're all kind of equal all made in the image of God of this and then the other but I circle into this people I've talked to a research that I've done I mean there's some real predators among us who really are not kinda like us at all yeah and it's somebody who like sees you know some camp being driven over and he giggles and like finds that really quite thrilling I mean that I didn't even know what species that isn't anything there knock people out there that they make life kind of difficult for the rest of us yeah it's a real issue it's very scary and how are these people becoming that is it because of nature or nurture is it because of you know abuse that they've personally suffered that sort of stimuli seems to be really yeah yeah but I mean this is the fascinating thing about epigenetics right so I mean when I was a kid growing up there was this nature versus nurture like you got your genes that's what you're born with right and then maybe you can influence it a bit with nature but what they're finding out now is that genes turn on and off depending on experience so they found like if you have a particular gene and you're a boy and you are physically abused as a child almost for certain you're gonna end up you know on the bad side of things like you're gonna end up violent aggressive criminal in jail or whatever right now if you don't have that gene you're abused you likelihood but it's less and so certain genes for aggression get turned on and strengthened based upon your experiences you can end up dead twins who grew up in different households in different genetics based on their environment so that's what's so important about you know something I focus a lot on is a parenting parenting parenting it seems to me so many people are out there and they're just so messed up like you just you can't rewind and you can't send them down a different path but if you kind of look at the next generation the next generation what if we could get the percentage of people spanking their children down through 90% I mean it seems so weird in the 21st century that that's how parents are really close it's still not interesting depending on where you count at 80 to 90 percent it's less so in Europe like in in Sweden I think it's been banned since like 1973 and you'll know why hellholes dislike them yeah they're doing fine but yeah it's still 80 to 90 percent in well it's legal here it's it's legal in America from 2 to 12 you can hit a child in Canada legally just not in the face and not with an implement so it's just end because these are the most vulnerable tenderer helpless dependent you know lack of freedom members of society and but it's you know it's hard to see how a weird society that we have you have this great bit last night go see the show anyone who's listen to this my show we did this great bit like what a space aliens come down and try and understand you had kim kardashian which of course it's tough enough that but what if they tried to understand that culture it wouldn't make much sense and but you realize that the the hierarchies and everything that we have the wars the prisons you for prisons unique person guys through wars you need soldiers you can't get healthy happy well-adjusted people to go out and do that guys yeah so i think our whole society relies upon the maltreatment of children and if we didn't have that a lot of people who got a lot of money in power right now we're to kind of find themselves out in the cold yeah I don't necessarily think that it's engineered that way but I certainly think it takes advantage of the situation at hand yeah I don't think there's a secret kebab handshake but you know lions get together to hunt gazelles they don't have to plot it out in some smoke you were mad their instincts to go get the gazelle that does get sort of hypothesized though right that that is what's happening that they're trying to keep people down with a lack of education that's why there's such little funding for schools and they're trying to keep people poor because poor people don't raise their kids correctly and you know and so on and so forth and it continues I think we have an instinct for domination as human beings and I I think animals do too and they don't have secret key bottles and rockefellers and smoky rooms organizing everything I think we just have an instinct for domination and it plays itself out but I don't think it's something written down and handed out in the secret Braille Scrolls for something like that I agree with you I think we also have an instinct for escalation you know and no matter what we always want more you know if we make $500 a week we want seven you know if we control middle of the Middle East we want to control Africa we want it's just it's a natural thing that if we do a certain thing we will continue to do it and try to push the envelope further and further until we hit some sort of a wall or resistance and I think in America we are starting to see that wall build up and gain momentum the wall of resistance against the Syria invasion was bigger than anything that I had ever seen in my entire life I've never seen University across the board the entire country go fuck this yeah this is crazy you're not this might be the first war it's actually stopped yeah like in history there'd be the first war that popular resentment and resistance has actually stopped against all the financial military industrial complex momentum that is in the states which is huge I don't know if you know the fact that yes the people who vote voted YES for the war in Syria get 86% more funding for the military-industrial complex and the people who voted now let's just both of you send money in blood to the donors right I mean it's horrible but the hack that it might actually be pushed back and the fact that the Russian guy that Putin is telling the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize to not have a war is upside down University living in you know not only that but Putin said a really interesting thing about about claiming that citizens of the United States are exceptional and how dangerous that is yeah and about how we are all just human beings and to have anybody established as being the exceptional people this is a very dangerous idea and for the United States to sort of promote this idea that we as Americans are different like yeah that's that's he's absolutely right well if an individual displays that characteristics they're called entitled or narcissistic which means that just good things can should come to me matter what and if if they don't they're not brought to me I'm just gonna go take them and that's a really dangerous personality trait but somehow it's elevated through the magic of patriotism it is it like wonderful stuff right I find it fascinating I mean and as I get older I find it even more fascinating because a guy like Obama I'm 46 the guy like Obama is just a couple of years older than me so it's not like this thing where when I was a boy and I would look at president yeah they were way up there they were different you know it was there were always a part of this system already political system educational system skullenbones all that but this Obama guy was the first guy that doesn't fit that mold to me and it's close to my age and you know the concept of me being a president is just the most ridiculous thing of all time to me but this guy is essentially my obviously more educated than me but essentially my age and I find it amazing how he has gone from being this political outsider this rebel this guy who's gonna change this and close Guantanamo Bay and and then all sudden he gets in and he's exactly the same thing that we've seen time and time again over the last eight years it's easy the same person is Bush I mean it's been more and more more drones more detainees and and the only reason he ended the war in Iraq was to quite fast there to get tragic you know if you have hope for the guy right the reason that they had to pull the troops out of Iraq was that Iraq was was gonna stop holding the troops criminally responsible for what they were doing because they were facing such resistance from the population for the occupation they finally said ok you guys don't get a get-out-of-jail-free card anymore we're gonna start applying international military or military law to your troops and Obama is like okay fire up there the airplanes were gonna pull those buggers that because they were going to be subject to the rule of law and they had to get him out that way well how about what he wrote on his own website the change.org website about whistleblowers and then removed it you know after it would was he was called out on and after the Edward Snowden case like they said like what did you say about whistleblowers what did you say about whistleblowers or exposing illegal activities when you were running for president and now here you are the most as far as at presidents go there's never been a president that has been harder on whistleblowers you know bomb never nor have there been more revelations and more important revelations as far as the direction of society and privacy in the United States that was exposed by these whistleblowers that has a massive impact on our culture massive impact on who has the right do you do I have a right to send a naked photo to a friend as a joke or is that gonna be held against me you know if I don't pay my taxes or if you know I I have a dispute with the government over a certain issue are you gonna pull things out of emails because they have someone rights bomb and an email you know as a joke does that get flagged in this comedian that's it you may well use now i defragged i don't know what you're gonna call it now and kind of use that word anymore yeah I mean but there's a lot of hot words and to me that's that's a dangerous things I think what we're in right now as far as the whole privacy thing is this strange transitionary period to a point where I think ultimately there will be no privacy and I think I don't think that's bad because look if we were all really cool and everyone was really nice to each other with their privacy wouldn't be as as important it becomes important when people violate privacy and there's stalkers and there's you know people that fuck with people and people that you know or have agendas to mess with people's lives but ultimately privacy what we're dealing with information and the trend in society and technology seems to be the dissolving of boundaries between people and information and I think it's been amazing as far as education when you look at your phone you can google something you get have answers to any question I mean this is we live in an amazing time when it comes to that but that trend that you know was talked about escalation it's just what we do well good that trend will escalate further and further and I think ultimately it'll escalate to the point where they'll be no more secrets yeah I mean I I mean the technology that we are having this conversation we can broadcast it to like millions of people yeah I got like 50 million downloads of my shell which for a philosophy show is incredibly right but this is huge right so it's like these two bullet trains going across the landscape and the technology of control versus the technology of illumination I think it really really battling and we got to keep pushing the gas to stay ahead because we've got this incredible thing you mentioned it in a show recently like the gatekeepers are down right we can have this conversation broadcast it directly to people nobody has to tell us what we can talk about nobody tells us what words we can use or what concepts we can explore anything like that which is unprecedented except maybe for the Gutenberg press like the 15th century when they printed the Bible aside to handing it out to peasants in a language they could actually understand before that you had to know Latin and all that crap right right so they got to read the Bible for the first time in life holy shit are you kidding me this is in here this is senior they started to develop their own thoughts about it and that broke down the monopoly of the Catholic christened it right which had been around since the Dark Ages so when you get information to people you fragment the central narrative of a society which is great you know that's that's what you wants and their narratives are incredibly dangerous you know who had a great central narratives the Nazis that had wonderful central narratives about the the role of the white race to dominate all the other races and Germany's manifest destiny in Europe communists had a great story about that we've been a rise in the proletariat destruction of the middle classes and the end of the bourgeoisie narratives that are really well inflicted and Universal incredibly dangerous all the lemmings run the same way so we've got this massive airstrike on a central narrative which comes directly out of this technology which is where you can get exposed to viewpoints that you never would have been exposed to before do you think before the internet American media would be playing anything that gladiator put instead about Syria you'd never even know the guy said anything a totally right now you can get it all and you can connect with people I want to talk about about the comedy stuff where I think the connection stuff is really a good theme in the show last night by desert race because the degree to which we can shatter the central narrative and individuate what we're doing in the world is you know they're racing with us to try and control and make us afraid to communicate with each other and afraid to get to the truth and I really view that as a pretty important trace of it like the next 10 years yeah I agree I think there's the real issue in this world is information and then of course the big one is the monopolization of resources and the monopolization of resources which are I believe I think resources should be a global asset for human beings I don't think anybody should be able to control the amount of oil you know it's just like I don't think people should be able to control water I think it's ridiculous the idea that a group of human beings decide to control water I feel like that that's an act almost of terrorism of social terrorism the idea of keeping water from people that need water you know the idea of keeping oil from people I mean if we all agree that we're gonna use oil the idea that one person can decide you know who owns this shit that has been in the ground for millions and millions of years yeah just cuz you planted a flag on a patch of dirt it's fuckin craziness but that's where all the influence comes from the influence comes from this massive amount of money that you can gain by controlling monopolize and natural resources and it's just like when they used to be able to monopolize the information that was received just like when William Randolph Hearst basically controlled most of what information got out to people you know ran newspapers that that's a dangerous aspect of our world that is eventually I think going to crumble under the weight of its own bullshit I just don't see how it can continue I don't see how people can continue to live the way we're living right now in the face of the information that we're being presented with well you know the great thing is once you go outside and Harris it don't you find me for me I feel pretty retarded most of the time like I'm not a dumb guy but I see so much information out there so many things so many stories like I do all this research for my shows and stuff like that I feel like it I've barely scratched the surface yeah there's so much information about there and with the central narrative you feel like you know well you know we're Catholic so we're we're Jews / Jesuit so we got we got it down we got the whole thing down right right but the great thing is once you shatter that central narrative you realize there's such a vast amount of conflicting information and opinions and perspectives and I don't know what the hell is true half the time and you know I'm lucky to get 10% of it so I think that it breeds the kind of humility in us that that is the opposite of the desire to dominate the designer denominator is well I know what the hell people should do and by god I'm gonna make them do it I know they shouldn't smoke marijuana and if they fucking smoke marijuana I'm gonna round them up with cats in blue uniforms and throw them in that prison cell you know where 200,000 times a year they get raped I mean in America more men get raped and women you know it's all prison stuff right yeah so when you feel like you just know how the hell everyone else should live you know the way we should help the poor is take money from these guys by force give it to a giant bureaucracy and have little drops of it drip down to the floor to keep them in Independence Day so if I keep voting for more and more government if you really feel like you know exactly how people should live and what they should do then you've no problem bringing out the air strikes at the military and then the police or the prison system but if you humble and you realize that we're pretty much retarded about everything that's a few things that I'm good at but most of it you know I'm not gonna drill my own teeth I don't do my own appendix I barely even clean my own house right but it once you get exposed to a vast amount of contradictory information you realize it's just like we won't kind of stupid and that's why we should be humble and not order each other around at the point of a gun which was so addicted to doing these days chants we've got a great quote about that about the bonfire of enlightenment and the one as the bonfire of enlightenment grows brighter the surface area of ignorance becomes more illuminated images you realize the more you learn the more there is to learn and then it becomes impossible look even knowledge doubles every 18 months these days like this is no possibility that anyone can be anywhere you know I was too mastering any any significant it's great though I think that's great because I think that there's a real danger in claiming you know anything claim that the kind of arrogance that comes from especially very highly educated people in this specific areas if you're very highly educated in a specific area they oftentimes are arrogant about things that they're ignorant about and it's it's interesting to watch that become an impossibility you're faced with such an amass of amount of data that's just online on my Twitter every day I'm exposed to dozens and dozens of fascinating stories each one we don't because we got to live I got to go make it back away all right but just love to dig into all this stuff and I'd love to learn every language there is and I'd love to know every song that was yeah but you can't we can get at least a small grasp of what the fuck they're talking about when they're talking about quantum physics understand quantum physics it changes on you it's one of those things yeah that fog behind mints quote was it if you think you understand quantum physics and you don't understand quantum physics I tried to read so many articles on it I don't know what I will explain it to someone will say this amazing thing that just came out today but I don't know what it means Geoffrey some geometric object that explains the interactions of particles as long as my shoes don't turn into shocks that eat my feet because of some quantum flux I'm ok with it I know it does some creepy shit deep down I know that also red light by the time it comes to the level of your sense like it all cancels I haven't you you know this is still gonna be a table tomorrow but deep down in the roots that matter some crazy shit is going on yeah subatomic partners a part was blinking in and out of existence existing simultaneously in two different place oh yeah in motion and still at the same time like what are you talking to me we basically what they're saying is that the heart of matter itself the the smallest measurable portion of reality is magic you know you're gonna get emails from physicists they don't call it magic ain't not magic it's a little confusing thank you the correct thing made all the magic to us but then these microphones are kind of magic to me all these little magic penises that record everything we say it's I had dr. Amit Goswami on my podcast who's one of the great quantum physicists of our age who is just impossible to understand okay I mean it just he would just go it's gone so far into the bush is the fastest God it's talking magic and I mean it's just it's so strange but that is the accepted smallest measurable part of the universe and it's amazing when you really stop and think about what we know about nature nature being fractal in so many different ways the universe itself being fractal and then when you get down to the smallest measurable the components of reality itself being this strange fiction almost world it's so bizarre it's impossible to know everything so I think this this this age of enlightenment that we're in right now is really unprecedented I don't think there's ever been a time like this yeah and and once you break down the narrative right so I my boring education is all in history philosophy and science and you know in the in the Renaissance and the Enlightenment is when people said well God doesn't answer anything you know God is a barrier to an answer because one would you say God did it we got an answer when I did it you know with like and then it becomes something that's blasphemous to the question and so when people began to doubt the god thing then they began to be able to explore right they began to say okay well if God didn't do it what the hell how did we get here you know what is the world and what is the Sun how does it work and all that I think we kind of get in there in a really painful difficult way I think we're kind of getting there because we've got this narrative and it's good in the future I guarantee you it's gonna be completely insane to look back and say people ever believed the ship I mean you know the guys who cut their own balls off to go join that comment you know do you look back and you say there's someone who said you know when you're bringing out the pinking shears and taking up here your your tighty whities there's got to be someone who's saying we were kind of going in the wrong direction here but I think in the future I can look back at this like that and say what were they thinking like we have these geographical areas called countries and in those countries we have a tiny group of people with all the guns in the world and they tell everyone else what to do and somehow we think this is gonna work out fine I can't believe that wasn't recording I wasn't recording up until just now oh I have yeah I have to get the first 27 minutes I we got it there we go there's folks who listening this will normalize these are the mightiest they're the voice quality goes up considerably yeah I'm so socket technology I'm sorry I can't believe that this wasn't recording but well we just not again and you know that that's what we solved everything we had the whole bucket thing did well I'll make sure it gets normalized but the you know I think the enormity of the times we live in really it's it's really easy for us to not notice it or not it's so normal to just be able to call someone in your cell phone so normal to able to get on the internet and just get information I think the the enormity of this as far as what is that what that's like in comparison to having to go to a library into getting your education from a school which you're getting you know with you're taking science you're getting it from this professor and this professor is going to recommend these books and there may be a completely opposing point of view that you're never going to be exposed to yeah if you google something you know and then Google that sprays and then debunked yeah I can't tell you how many fucking times I've had someone send me something and then I'll say Google will you just set me and then be bumped and then let's talk and if you haven't read that stuff they talk to me cus you'd be able to get one slide it's not any site at all yeah you're not you're getting this weird sort of confirmation bias e thing that it exists I've heard that argument as to why the Internet is bad that one of the bad things about the Internet is you seek out like-minded people and you sort of confirm each other's biases and get together and you know Pat each other on the back sort of yes but I feel like those are just little camps you know outside of the wilderness of information which is New York City you know I give my you might have a tent where all you assholes get together and say the earth is 6,000 years old right but you know you're you're an hour's walk from Manhattan right you're not gonna you know I survived well I don't remember all those people talking about a unity of narrative it's you can't like-minded people really complaining about say the church that I grew up in or the public school that I grew up in where I was taught that you know governments were necessary beneficial wonderful and you know we fought the Second World War to defend against National Socialism and we wanted like we had we already had that narrative now people are fragmented into their own narratives but that's still way better than one monolithic nonsense pile that we're all supposed to admire frame yes yeah and it's also like as a human being what we have been given is this insane amount of potential in the mind and in the body's ability to manipulate matter in nature but yet we don't have a real direction book and we're sort of figuring out the abilities of this mind and the the possibilities of society and our interactions with each other and the accumulation of information that we can all rely on each different aspect of our culture to contribute whether it's you know history or science or mathematics or and all this stuff comes together and the potential of it is almost unfathomable it so it's almost impossible to really truly wrap our heads around and we only figure out how to do things right by trial and error we have to fuck up and then go well we can't do that again and we have to drop a nuclear bomb and go well that's a disaster and we have to you know it's we have this incredible device the human mind and we have a very little idea of how to utilize it properly or even less control or engineer a engineered thought into how to develop people properly and and to try to enforce that as a culture or to recommend that or try to just mean when you see the president on television what do they always deal with the leader of the free world well they do with conflict they're constantly dealing with conflict and loss and and finances and they're dealing with all these things that are important to people that are developing how much thought is actually given to developing people how much thought I mean how was last time you heard the president United States talk about what we really need to do is focus on the lowest rung of our ladder with the weakest link in our chain of human beings and strengthen that wouldn't we be a better country if we had less losers isn't that something we should concentrate on but it never gets brought up we there's never talked about enriching poor neighborhoods or setting up community centers finding ways to help young children that don't have guidance bring in people and have fucking companies like Halliburton funding you want to make a lot of money rebuild Detroit you know rock Iraq rebuild Detroit for the fuck going to countries and blowing them up and rebuilding the metric concentrate on what's already fucked up right here right and it's never done and it's it's we we look at it in terms of you know it's almost like going from going from presidential run to presidential runs like these four-year terms that they do and in a way it's almost like the idea of having a president and having these small four-year terms it's like you're always gonna concentrate on what just problems as far as like conflict and money here he's gonna concentrate on what's on the tip of people's tongues all the time but not on the engineering of society yeah it's all here no prevention yes right it's all just playing whack-a-mole with whatever fucking crisis is coming up at the moment and it's not how are we gonna make it so the society can be sane in 40 years we don't care about any of that stuff I mean that's why there's a national debt that's why this war because it's just about getting elected like if the Federal Reserve just said well we're gonna keep buying eighty five billion dollars worth of US Treasuries even though we said we were gonna stop because there's going to be an election coming up and what do they care if they pass it the bill to the unborn I mean they're gonna be long gone so we have this weird society that does these really narrow time slices yeah which is just all about you know whack-a-mole and and satisfying the noisiest people and keeping those people but the actual work of preventing in the long run which is so easy the science is so easy it's so simple you know reason with your children don't hit your children's do treat them like they're reasonable human beings I mean I'm a dad I'm not gonna stay at home dad for like four and a half years never had to raise my voice at my daughter never had to yell at her never had to hit or never had to have a timeout we just reason things through they could stop doing that about eighteen months of age two studies show that it's not the reason things not to negotiate and if we have that if we had that as a society I can virtually guarantee you that would be almost no criminality I agree but don't you think there's an economic aspect to that that really can't be ignored you have the ability to do that and very few people do that's the real issue is that so many people to give a working mom and a working dad and the kids by the time they see their parents they mean they're ready to go to bed means four or five o'clock at night if they're lucky you know most the time you'd be suited parents after work so it's six seven you know and they've been in there since 8 o'clock in the morning yeah they're exhaust didn't everyone they got to feed them bathe them then I really have time for quality interaction it's very difficult the idea that people have been sold that you can raise a child and have a full career I think it's madness you can't do it you can't do it yeah and this idea that daycare just kind of you see put them in daycare and that's fine it's just not true I mean statistically factually scientifically they're kids who are in daycare for more than 20 hours a week experience exactly the same symptoms as those who've been abandoned by their mothers like it's it's the experience maternal abandonment at a very fundamental level it changes their neurological system it changes their stress responses changes that quotas levels permanent that you measured 10 20 years later it's still the same so this idea that you can just March people off to work hey it's great for the government I mean a government loves it when both parents work because then they got to taxes to tax bases to tax cattle out there spitting money into the Treasury Plus then they got to put the kid in daycare so then there's somebody else who they can tax who's taking care of the kids so the government loves it it really ops the GDP because everyone's working they get much more taxes and the problems of having kids intake yeah well I get shovel down to the next generation and who the hell cares about that kids don't vote right yeah but what's the solution to that I mean it's going to be so difficult sacrifice sacrifice you know I mean I mean people go to war you know I mean millions and millions of people went to war the Second World War the First World War I mean marching into hailstorms of bullets and and typhus and all that kind of horrible stuff that went on you know would we say to people I say to people all the time you know you you know if you went to college you know you live like a dog here most people live like dogs when they go to college for four years because it was a good investment well take that same approach if you want to have kids you know both have to work just downsize get rid of the second car just we're not asking you to go fight Japanese and you know in some godforsaken island in the Pacific you know just maybe move to a smaller house move to an apartment just a couple of years from the kids you know kids personalities 90% done by the time they're four you know so all you got to do is first couple years just sacrifice have someone at home breastfeed your child for god sakes that's what nature intended and and sacrifice you know so maybe you don't get the big-screen TV but you don't know what you get is like a happy child throughout your life and you get to develop a human being in the correct way yeah it's so easy for us to say you know my wife is a stay-at-home wife stay-at-home mom and you know we have three children and you know we're very fortunate and everything works out great but in a unique financial situation that can happen where I have a lot of friends that are not in that situation they're trying to raise children and they're also trying to put them in daycare during the day and you know the wife just went back to work so we have bills and this man and you see it and it's it's not it's not the way a child wants to develop and it doesn't seem healthy no I mean historically you know you put your kid in the backpack you went out and worked in the field city you go hunting you bring you I mean that's supposed to be it's so weird that 21st century to say children are supposed to be with their parents you know how did we have a drift away that that even needs to be said you know what do you think that is do you think that's just a desire for materialism and some sort of a rationalization that you can you can go after both that you can acquire all these things and keep up with the Joneses and just have someone else take care of the the busy work of taking care of your child while you do that is that what it is yeah I think I think what happened was and this would have happened in the 60s and 70s Oh in the 50s this whole amazing series of labor saving devices came out which freed women from the endless drudgery of you know your dishwashers came out and laundry machines and vacuum cleaners and all that kind of stuff right so basically a huge amount of work was done by machines now which which freed up women then of course a lot of them were like okay great I'm gonna go workforce whatever but I think what's really been downgraded is is the skills required to be a good parent I mean I've done some tough stuff in my life I've built businesses I started this crazy show and all that kind of stuff nothing to me is more exciting and challenging than being a dad I mean I know it's a cliche at once although it's the most wonderful thing but it really is an incredible thing to do especially if you don't do any of the agression stuff because then you got to come up with other stuff right other ways of dealing with conflicts other ways of dealing with quote bad behavior it's really challenging now if you just bank the new kids and yelling at them I guess it's not that challenging and hell of a lot not fun right because all you're doing is spending your whole day trying to control someone who doesn't want to be controlled that's no fun so I think that because we've got this hit them and put them in timeouts and send me to bed without dinner and yell at them or whatever I mean that's retarded anyone could do that you know you can get a angry robot to do that right but if you don't do that stuff then you have a really unique challenge of negotiating with someone who's three I mean how exciting is that what an incredible challenge that is but because we've still got the hitting and the yelling and all of that it's retarded and some people say well this is stupid and not fun so I'm going to go to work but it's only stupid or not fun because you're yelling and hitting if you didn't do that it would be really engaging and it's the most important aspect of our society the most important aspect of our family is the most important aspect of our community is developing good human beings and it's one that we leave to everybody we just go look I know you fucked your whole life up but take care of this person and that person will in turn transfer everything that you've taught them and they anyway that you fucked them up or made them better and they're gonna go out into the world and spread that energy and it literally changes the tone of our entire society culture and it's fascinating when you see different cultures all throughout the world if you study the the the different ways they interact with their children how vastly different the the culture itself becomes because of these styles of interaction and our culture which is thought to be universally one of the most materialistic selfish childlike cultures is one of the cultures that embraces this idea of the two parents working the childcare the you know this this this idea of how we've decided to promote becoming a human being is one of the most awkward weird examples of it on earth could you imagine could you imagine it's your anniversary but endo you got mad a couple years ago you'd be with your wife a long time I imagine it's your anniversary and she calls you up and she says Joe you know it's our anniversary glued on the back for a nice dinner I got babysit around you and you say oh man I can't believe what a cliche sorry oh my god that's so embarrassing but I tell you what I'll do I'll pull up someone we don't know and I'm gonna pay the minimum wage to go out for dinner with you now they may not speak breaking great English you know they mainly I mean they never met you before but I'm sure it's gonna be pretty much the same as going out for dinner with me your ever-loving husband so let me just make that call to the agency to send out some half-broken english-speaking guy to go out for dinner with you and it's gonna be exactly the same cheaper like no it's not the same because you're my husband a decent guy I don't even know but why the hell would we think parenting is any different yeah I mean how the hell do you replace the bond of the you grew the banner challenge at your belly and recipe the child that you know that child but I'm sure some minimum-wage stranger who's rotating in and out of a job every four months it's going to be exactly the same as a parent it's not the same and the consequences to society are significant and it's very frustrating to me when I communicate with people that are especially women that are single that are thinking about having a child in Iran I've had so many yeah it's and I get it I get that they want a child and I get that they want a child and that they can't find a man I understand that it's hard to find someone you compatible with but god damn is that a terrible idea it works sometimes sometimes it works sometimes you get lucky and you meet someone and somewhere along the line you know some people flood ways out of a building of your way that doesn't mean that that should be your next step yeah engineer engineered that way those God such a disaster statistically right I mean statistically and factually there's no single worst predictor for a kid's outcome than being from a single mom household you know and I hate to say it because I mean again lost the single moms out there really trying to do the right thing some single moms like husband got hit by a truck terrible you know and they you know all the support although you know but the vast majority of it is you know didn't find the man or just ditch the man or whatever and it is catastrophic for kids I mean the statistics are horrendous like 80 percent of regulars come from single-parent household 85 percent of murderers I mean not again not that they all turn out that way but right and you see these significantly negative elements a lot of against traceback there's this theory that says that the economy's kind of working this out fairly well they say that if marriage rates had stayed at the 1970 levels because you know marriage rates are really low these days and marriage not necessarily the same as you know two people committing to stay together while they raise a kid but we would have almost no deficit in government spending if marriage rates and stayed as they did in 1970 you know when a majority passed majority's got married today married and so on because marital disintegration comminuted huge rise in welfare state huge right and criminality costs huge rise in every everything you can think of in society that if you trace back the deficit a lot of it has to do with this is bright the family which is I mean some people say it's all engineer night behind them I don't credit the ruling class with that much deviousness but no so it is it is something that is really has to be talked about I mean it and particularly for boys I mean boys these days are having it real rough you know like the schools are really focused on on girls and how girls learn and you know boys yeah oh yeah this oh well the huge change has been boys like to learn hands-on I like to learn viscerally they don't like to just sit there and read about stuff we'll see the teacher do stuff on blackboards and about 30 years ago a bunch of feminists said well girls getting shortchanged in school and it's all designed for boys and they totally shifted the curriculum and since then boys have been just falling behind catastrophic ly like so 60% of like people in universities and now girls and you know I think it's like 9 times the number of boys are on these psychotropic brain killing meds really yeah because they just boys don't want to sit still all day but the society used girls is great and boys is like broken girls you know if we could just get them to be like the girls and sit quietly and you know with their legs crossed and all that but that why is it just getting a little rough in school these days and again because they growing up without dads they don't have that role model of how to channel that aggression and so you know it's real rough and this is why they just get medicated so badly and then it escalates we talk about escalation escalates from there get one drug for ADHD and then you can't sleep so you get another threat for that and then you start developing bipolar symptoms you get another drug for that and then oh my god I think he's getting psychotic you get another drug for that next thing you know living in facility for the rest of your life is monstrous and that's a huge issue in society the amount of money and the amount of influence that pharmaceutical drug companies have on our society the fact that this money is something that they count on this is money that has been coming in and once you have a corporation that's used to acquiring wealth well we have a bottom line this is what we make and why are we making less now why don't you know they're not going to step in and say listen I think we need better for society we we earn less money and smoking created by that CEO is that someone else has to be providing this is gonna do that when you talk about this in the show yesterday look is a Gator roll Oh Gator roll when you're a gator grabs a hole that's prey they roll but yeah I'm not gonna be close because you gotta see this and I gotta tell you I was haunted by that when I bite on to spin the newest thing they try and rip it out of the joint down or something that's how the Dead has not helped my mental image to think if your mental image with an alligator that's all don't know my job but go see if it's worth breaking it but but you had to scrape it but you're talking about like its promise to do companies well you know trying masturbating and with pot and you say wait but I think there's something else too which is that you know why is tobacco legal and pot is not well as it never discussed well I just killed five thousand people in there and because tobacco is a factory found product pop you can grow it all right so if you enable people to self-medicate you know and I don't mean that in a bad way but it's self medicate right I can't havin trouble sleep and house smoking a bit of pot you fall asleep right you can throw that shit at home in your basement in your back yard or whatever there's no profit to anyone so that stuff like the stuff you can grow tobacco you kind of grow tobacco in your backyard in photo tobacco you would have to have a license to do so right right well it's not like he could grow tomatoes like you can grow your own Tomatoes but when you deal with anything that affects your consciousness you have to have you know the government has to step in and allowing you to do so which is we can't just make your own booze all right write your own moonshine yes in a week I mean there's gotta be some sort of regulations it's like you you craft beer making right but how does that work if you have to well I think as long as you don't sell it I mean I think you can make your own stuff at home or whatever but I think with tobacco you need like a big you know certain only certain place isn't a big crop and stuff like that versus it gets pretty hard where's pot use grown smoking so I think it would be really tough you know cuz we measure the economic productivity this weird way you know like if someone gets sick the GDP goes up like how is that same I mean surely sickness it's a bad thing the GDP should reflect a negative result but you know they go spend a lot of money on treatments and suddenly it's like we're richer you know and it's the same thing if you then have people some smoke and pop that they've grown themselves your GDP is going to take a huge crater and then all these people are going to be out of work supplying all this horrible stuff to people and so on and I mean the way we measure stuff now I mean it's just completely its agent forces everyone into these really really bad decisions yeah one of the things he said that I really agree with about how boys are so ins different than girls when it comes to learning I just recently started volunteering at my daughter's school and she's in kindergarten and I watch boys do you know you volunteer like he's he's table set up and you have to everyone has to put together this little book and cut these pieces out and put it in order and you watch boys do it as opposed to girls it they're stupid they're a different animal it's a completely different thing they're almost like they're they're so challenged like the girls can just nicely and humming to themselves and cutting in the lines and they're barely paying attention to what's going on they want to run they want to go do something it's like that's how I felt growing up I always felt like I can't wait for this fucking bell to ring so I can run out of here yeah and I thought at the time well obviously I'm not very smart I'm not gonna be good at school and it wasn't that at all but what it was was I'm not designed for this like there is a society and this society is a broad spectrum of human beings and we have various tasks that we will do and we will be really good at and we'll have different occupations that we can choose and different ones suit different personalities but this fucking cookie cutter shit that they do in school they want everyone to be the same way because that's all they have money for that's all we have resources for we have we have the ability to stick you in this class from 9:00 a.m. to whatever 2 p.m. and do this stuff and then you know we need you to listen and then you go and then you leave and give you a great event that's madness the idea of that as an educational backbone that as an educational foundation for a human being it's madness no it's nothing to people their history you know this there's two things that are best the best predictors of empathy right empathy is what we really really need as a species like we're fucked without empathy because we got these weapons of mass destruction we got into your weapons we got like if we don't really work on empathise the most important resource so the question is how do you grow it two things seem to Kim come up on the top of the list for how to grow empathy I would never have guessed them it's all I ask you the driver the two things that that rice at the top when it comes to developing empathy number one the presence of a father it's not interesting cuz men are considered to be less empathetic and women more empathetic presence of the Father is the number one predictor of their for the development of empathy number two is freak life in nature hmm free play nature my daughter is really into this right now like we have toads that live by our house and we have a froggy pond not far away and she's learning a lot about how to handle things delicately had a play with them and all of that she's great great with the animals and free play and nature in the presence of a father now what's happened over the past 40 years in our society kids don't get free play in nature anymore most of its scheduled shit in the gym you know with the dance classes and all and nothing wrong with those but give them free play in nature the glorious anarchy of childhood where it's just like here's enough to do to go do something right that's number one and number two of course is dads have vanished from so many hassles and this is why in the last 15 years sociopathy one of the most malignant forms of destructive personality traits sociopathy is done in the last 15 years the people who grandiose zero conscience they use other people they're superficially charming but never keep their promises especially rats yeah so see you guys they have no name no conscience at all and there were no measurable conscience like you can show that the most horrifying stuff where you and I use our brains would light up like like Christmas tree right and they just don't have anybody and this has doubled in our society to to the point where now like between one and twenty five and one and twenty people are sociopaths I mean it's terrifying direct correlation between not growing up with a father and not well those are two hot significant risk factors there's other stuff in a physical illness how do they go late in all this so they just find socio passing work backwards back end what they do be you know they do big studies and they ask people all of the questions and sociopaths will rely to get stuff wrong because they just don't have empathy they think you fake it you know they kind of know well that's what's expected right but they don't actually feel empathy for other people and you can find that with a series of questions you can also measure their brains and find out how they react to certain stimuli and how it's different for the rest of the population and they do big studies on that and then they extrapolate that to the population as a whole we were talking about fMRIs before this recording stars we can audio engineer and put it all together but the fascinating thing about fMRI is being able to measure various aspects of the brain and reactions to certain things on my television show and have you ever seen it it's called Joe Rogan questions everything well one of the things we did watching we talked it's actually from that Finding Bigfoot show they again they're talking about it long before my show but we I spoke to a woman who is a she was an expert on use of the EEG and fMRI and she said that there was actually a court case where a woman was convicted because she had functional knowledge of a crime scene and it's based on fMRI Wow that she had functional knowledge of a murder scene and the woman who was a neurologist felt that it was very dangerous because she said there can be functional knowledge of something based on how much have they talked to you about this crime scene have you formulated image Reese in your head have they shown you photographs of the scene have they like what places and how do we know I have what what aspect of it relies on personal creativity or the imagination to sort of concede and and and play it out in your head and then that this is registered on the fMRI a fascinating fascinating stuff where we're getting to really understand the various components of what makes us a human being what memory is really tricky do you have these things I have these things jail where like that I have stories about my childhood and I swear to God I could not tell you if they're true or not very honest told it so many times I don't know you're a fireman factor there's a trip back from the planet I'll never I mean I'm not sure right like I don't know the stories like that all I remember when you did this and I mean I don't know if it got extrapolated or it got back I don't honestly know like a you know picture some of the picnic I don't no it's um and I think that's true for a lot of people like you talk yourself in and how to stop they did a study recently they blew my mind about people's ethical integrity right so they did a study where they got people to agree with a particular ethical statement okay I agree with this ethical statement bortion is bad or whatever they get ethical state and then they had been closed the book and then they the book stuck a new word that made it exactly the opposite statement right I now agree with this thing that I formally condemned isn't evil right then they opened it up and they asked them can you just week that again and tell us what you think about 70 to 80 percent of the people would read it again and completely agree with the exact opposite state but that they've made not three minutes before and had great reasons for it - Wow I mean this is the level of fluid unreality that people live in and it's really dangerous because we all live yeah and we want to fight this tendency for sure well I've had real issues with people when you talk to them about past events and they they start giving an incredibly distorted self-serving version of it and I wonder whether or not they really believe this or not and then I I'm really I'm a big proponent of if I criticize something I criticize myself first because I think that if I criticized a various aspect of human nature like memory my memory is fantastic and yet fucking terrible no I can argue the Ultimate Fighting Championship when I do the broadcast for the fights I you know I can rattle off statistics you are um you a great with names thank you you know you a kiss for me people might as well just introducing myself to me but like hello I'm do that because that's all I gotta say and that's a concert but you just like the mains just rip off your tongue I think that well especially when it comes to like mixed martial arts or something about I can remember details of fights very important things but like last night last night's show was amazing I've been looking forward to it for a long time to be product like that was a killer Jeff oh is a lot of fun so it's 3,000 people I'm on stage for an hour and 20 minutes and if you had access to my memory of that night it would be blurry member and NASA thing it oh yeah did I do that job I remember if I did that job I have notes I mean I have a moment yes you're in the moment yeah you can remember it - well you were watching yourself you weren't in it yes but it's but it's a huge event for me of important once a year thing when I come to Toronto and yet my memory of it is this incredibly cloudy thing and it's like that is the case I think with most human beings when it comes to memory and we were looking at we look at memory and we try to pretend as if my memory is rock-solid you know it's it's in there I bolted and it's screwed in place and it's not going anywhere and that's nonsense the mind doesn't work that way there's various things you can remember I remember how to use this espresso machine and I pushed a little carton and then I press that button and the junk comes out but you know the reality of my day like what went on today is just snapshots like weird both flashbacks of food I ate the jokes that we tell old and yeah it's it's very strange the human mind I think one of the emerging aspects of technology that I'm incredibly fascinated with is the symbiotic relationship that we're starting to have with with computers machines Google glass I think we're going to develop an artificial way of recording things on an artificial way of recording life that's going to be like I'm gonna be able to you know stuff on please check out my day and you're gonna roll is like holy shit why are you fucking terrified in this well this is a crazy moment like what we fast forward each other's lives and share what do you know that whole bunch of lawyers are trying to get in touch with the NSA these things because the NSA records everything right and so they're saying look I mean from my court case I you guys know his cell phone was here when he was talking on it and they say he was here but when cell company doesn't have records go back two years you you guys can get this guy out of jail and they prove Freedom of Information Act they're just hammering these guys trying to get facts out to get people out of jail or put people in jail really completely admit that they are recording everything I mean when Obama addressed that situation it's easier to record everything than something no what if we advance on an OP when we said something important we're just recording metadata yeah it's not a concern we're not spying on Americans yeah yeah the fuck you're not man they're spying on everyone and they're putting it all in these gigantic hard drives and no I mean hot pipe rack space is so cheap now but I've always lived like this all is being recorded ever since I went online smart oh yeah come on it's a smart way to do it I mean and it's showing now at this point in time that that is what if you send something if you transmit something someone can receive it and someone can pick it up someone can either intercept it it's a it's a very strange aspect but again is that's what we were talking about before I think it we are in an adolescent stage of this relationship that we have to technology in this relationship that we have to information I think ultimately it's going to get to a point where there is no boundary between your information or my information and I think where that really gets weird is with money because money essentially right now is just ones and zeroes and when you get down to this the this finite point of this finite barrier and that barrier breaks and there is no there's no boundary between anyone and information mine is just information it can start getting really fucking weird yeah money is a great bullshit it is let's both believe in this bullshit and real right that's how churches get bill yeah but money is this is complete fiction as you pointed out I mean you know it used to be used to be gold used to be some stuff yet to dig out of the ground you can just make it up like that right but to bring the Fed buying this we mentioned 85 billion dollars worth of Treasuries they don't have that money I mean it's not like they went out and made it up man that was a long shift their weight the beeps I have to get those tips man they just they type whatever they wanted to their bank account and we don't think that's gonna corrupt human beings let me give you a break it's so strange it's so strange and we live in the weirdest time when it comes to money as well because of the whole collapsing of the banks and the the bailouts and the president getting on television and saying that he's gonna limit the bailout the guys who we bailed out who's gonna limit their fuckin bonuses to half a million dollars you know what where's that money coming from at our money wait a minute you're gonna take our money and you're gonna give it to these guys it's a bonus for faith yeah like the banks failed and so they get a bone what are you saying but what is this madness we're living well Obama of course you know there's some theories it from one of the main reasons he got elected unless he took he took the most money at all the candidates from Wall Street from the financial companies and I mean what's he gonna do to throw them in jail like they just did this fine I think it was yesterday JP Morgan got hit with a fine of nine hundred and twenty million dollars right and first of all that's just bailout money they're handing back you know it's boom earning money here you owe its back right now but secondly I mean let's say that they did they seem to a committed to some illegal stuff right so they did the legal stuff which crossed their clients a lot of money other clients getting the money back no government gets it it's like phone at the cops and saying somebody stole my car the cops said no we found it we're gonna keep it but we found it I mean why would the government get the money for what JP Morgan did to rip off its customers plus the JP Morgan employees aren't gonna get raises because I mean but the JP Morgan executives they don't pay anything it's a corporation I mean they can't pay I mean the corporation is just this abstract fiction that people make up so it's shield themselves from legal consequences so everyone's like oh well they got fine so they're you know somehow the JP Morgan executives they're out that money and it's like no they're not I mean they never get again thrown in jail for anything never never gonna get thrown in jail for things that the the average person would be locked up for the rest of their life if they were involved in fraud at that level if they were involved me just think about just think about what when people go to jail for just for what they do with the stock market for manipulation of stock market I mean that is essentially how much different is that really than what goes on with the banking crisis when you're talking about moving money around you're talking about manipulating things and figuring out a way to profit from these manipulations yeah how is how is insider trading any different from what these guys have done well it's not and I mean if you want to talk about manipulating the stock market I mean the Federal Reserve buying the Treasury bonds is because nobody else wants those pieces of shit frankly right I mean the Chinese are sick of them that the Indians are sick of them the Japanese are sick of them because they know that they can't possib you redeemed without hyperinflation or some other defaults right as either a software a heart default they know that that stuff is junk so the Fed is buying them just to prop up the prices and they're doing that so all the other governments don't have to admit that they're basically toilet papers didn't Bob wait you know dollar toilet paper and it's all just this crazy thing that it can't possibly sustain you know I did this show once they've been about 240 like just paper only with coffee accounts right paper only money in a history of the world 240 240 different ones differently like just different you know they you know some government gets in power that issue some bullshit currency and then if you blow this up and then they issue some new currency whatever and there's only wanted them that's still in circulation from a couple hundred years ago it's the British Pound though it's lost like 97% of its value the dollars lost like 98 percent of its value since the Fed came in in 1913 and people say gas is expensive it's not if you guess it's cheaper now than it was in 1960 if you pay for it in silver if you pay for it in this paper shit that they hand around pretending it's money it's really expensive because it's been devalued so much when I first came to Canada in 1977 I was like 11 years old I could get a candy bar at night you know now and within like 10 years it was like a buck because they're just printing all this crazy money printing money is a great gig because you get to hand it out to all the people who are voting for you and then the inflation hits like two years later and nobody can connect the dots it's beautiful and plus everyone blames the local supermarket to raise in the prices as if they want to right but it's all the central printing money stuff is just really really dangerous and it brought down the Roman Empire was exactly the same way they just kept putting more more crap into their money until what was so bad in areas which originally a hundred percent silver ended up being like one and a half percent silver with basically like you know zombie teeth but hair shit shit thrown into it right and it just destroys the entire the entire economy and this is gonna have to be this huge reset in the global economy soon what's oh is that gonna happen I mean what's fascinating is that now that we have this incredible access to information and now that you know people like you were putting this stuff out there and it's it's become a part of the narrative people understand what's wrong it's not just a matter of it goes wrong and it takes years for people to put the pieces together and then you have to go to school and learn what's wrong it's really right in front face what's wrong what happens now do you think that there's an adjustment period do you think that because of this this incredible groundswell of information do you think that it can be re-engineered can it be redesigned can it can we can we somehow another Bitcoin our way out of this well that's a long-term solution which i think is multi-generational which has to do with treating kids better around raising they're actually not using aggression on them and all that so there's a long term solution I mean the short term solution I think is just you know trying to invest in human capital try and convert paper currency into something tangible like real estate or gold or something like that I think those are sensible strategies and lots of people who've been on my show all these economists I'll talk about I think that's all good stuff I think what's gonna happen in the short run is obviously the government's gonna run out of money I mean no matter how much they print they're just gonna run out of money and then what happens is there's gonna be talk of sacrifice now not the kind of sacrifice like forget the second car stay home with your kids that we've been talking about before but like real hard enough sacrifice are they gonna say well we've spent the Unruh means for so long you see this happened before in history and they just basically turn on the dependent classes they expect of welfare recipients to live on less sit Social Security recipients to live on less and their just start squeezing the dependent classes because that's the biggest single bill and also you'll see you will see which is of course is the goal of a lot of overseas terrorists you will see the u.s. begin to withdraw the Imperial presence in the world right they got over 700 military bases all over the world that's an expensive stuff is that really the number now 700 700 700 in 20 now that's incredible oh it's crazy well we talked about like the Roman Empire when people talk about being this con constantly in the world like that was nothing okay because God was basically just a fuck machine you know like a third of people in that section of the world can trace their lineage back to that guy I mean he was working overtime and he like he never dedicated I think that thing it's pretty amazing when you think about how much damage they did though you really would read or listened to Dan Carlin show hardcore history yeah he's been on my show actually yeah he's got a great job great guy yeah he's his piece on the con the wrath of the cons five-part peace on the the incredible accomplishments of Genghis Khan's Mongol hordes oh yeah they're responsible for the death of least 20 million perhaps 70 million people like depending on the ass over the course of you know his lifetime the lifetime of his sons like it's madness that's a bad shit man with horses and stuff horses a horse it's with arrows they killed at least 20 million people I mean that I mean wouldn't your honor like that's a lot of you have tried pulling a bow I mean those to us on your compound yeah those bows would require 160 pounds of pressure to pull yeah I mean like at one point you just like get my fucking arm flies off you know they don't even like it doesn't even shoot an arrow anymore you just arm gives a cross-legged boomerang I don't know what you do at that point and then women that could pull those bows yeah and and shoot from a horse like that a bull's-eye while your horses thundering along I mean right and also shoot sideways talked under the horse oh right where I couldn't get hit from arrows from the side right right there were like shooting them so I mean if that was still going on would you take narrating that job right it's a complete violation with your non-aggression principle you know the beautiful thing about the UFC is it's a mutually agreed upon competition absolutely a character contest a contest of will and planning and discipline and to me it's you know the Ultimate Fighting Championship is to me literally the ultimate in competition for a human being as far as like I don't think ever its before everybody it's it's certainly not but I think as far as like the amount of time and energy and focus and then the maintenance and the control of your emotions they're in the contest because you're literally putting your health on the line and your consciousness you can get incredibly badly hurt I think it's one of the reasons why it's so incredibly exciting and the discipline you come over the name of the final but you're saying it's one guy who keeps a list of everything he wants to accomplish by his bed and like first thing that he gets up and he just focuses on that stuff you're right Faber does the same thing yeah they both hate each other coincidentally let me let me spin your theory because we're talking about the fighting stuff and I was I was watching the show last night and I was I was thinking about like why is this occurring like what why people could be doing anything with their time in my coming here to see some like really funny stuff I was thinking about a lot of the stuff that you and the other two comics talked about is pretty visceral right I mean you you've got this great phrase that you use the monkey energy you know like you got this crazy monkey energy when you can't pay your mortgage and you know but you got to go out and do something physical because your body thinks it's like a tiger jumping at you yeah up like that yeah and I was really struck by you know dick fart jokes and stuff like that I mean cum jokes and stuff like that they're funny but I think it's really interesting the degree to which people respond to that because it's not polite conversation you know this I've never seen a sign like outside the box office relative to yours they said the most extreme possible language will be used like do not if you if you like Jane Austen your head is gonna explode in here like it's just I had that same sign since like the 1990s everything actually that sign I put up it's on my first CD which is called I'm gonna be dead someday which I released in 1999 and the that sign was something that I started putting up in comedy clubs because I got tired of people complaining and I said it would contain this show will contain the most extreme content imaginable yeah and it really did like I have a pretty good imagination thinking okay but why are people so drawn to this because it is it is a very common component of comedy and all that and let me give you a tiny theory and they're going to tell me that it's an outside non comedian I'm completely full of shit which is fine but but I had to some idea like we're supposed to be united in what to me is just a lot of crap you know like countries patriot is i initialism our god our Saints our whatever our clan are really like it's all nonsense and it doesn't actually connect people because it's kind of fantastical right I mean nobody I mean countries they don't even really exist they literally colors on a map I call them tax farms but they don't really exist like a real thing but where we can connect and I think where this comedy show last night really did how people connect wise we are all the mammals mm-hmm you know and we have these bodily functions and we have these impulses in these urges and these fantasies like the first guy talking about his fantasy of yeah el gato I'm Bryan Callen yeah really brilliant stuff and anything again and I'm ENGLISH enough to know that anything that mocks the French gets on my anyway but so I think that there's this like monkey meetup Club that goes on in comedy clubs where we do connect to that really visceral level of you know of shitting a fucking of farting of sex drives of you know the guys took a guy and the elevators talking then one of the funniest things to me that night with the noise he made but he's not forgot to breathe easy some like this food is so good why am I like that yeah and these are also really common experiences that we really can't talk about because we live in these refined abstracts and countries and religions and clubs and all that but here at this level we really do I think connect in a very visceral way and there was so much talked about in terms of connection and I think the audience is laughing because we never get to talk about how we connect at an animal level and I was thinking about the UFC as well that a lot of your life I think is around getting people to connect at a very visceral animal level an animal level sounds bad I don't mean it that way at all I think it's really this is where we do connect at the beginning you know we connect insects we connected fighting we connect finally primally and there I think a lot of your work has to do with that the fear factor is also involved that's really primal stuff time off of years that people have confronting them and overcoming them people watching that I think can really connect with that fear with that desire for the money and the fear of the circumstances and all that for the primal fear of competition itself the the fear of failing the fear of overcoming adversity or not being able to this that's a real part of being a person is the challenges of life itself and with fear factor is a stupid show you know how many grandiose ideas thanks for that right hopefully a factor it's a stupid show it was entertaining and I know people enjoyed it but the what is what was fascinating to me was I have a background in martial arts and tition more importantly I thought most of my life from age 15 to H 22 it's basically all I did with my time and so I understand what it's like to be confronted with a daunting task I understand what it's like to be standing there when the referee looks at you and goes are you ready you know and then looks the other guy goes are you ready go you know in that moment that like here it is like a cliff right and it's a very strange thing for us to just say ready go and then go do something it's it's really hard to do to do like to anticipate and also as human beings we can calculate all these different variables and one of the things about being an intelligent person and facing a difficult competition whether it's fighting or anything incredibly hard is like you are aware of the variables you're aware of the failure the aware of the humiliation you're well aware of the embarrassment of failure you weren't aware of the personal dissatisfaction but your own performance and depression that's gonna come with that and all those variables they can combine to create like a constriction effect where you just almost can't perform you know you're you're overwhelmed by the possibilities and branches freak the fuck out it's called being dwarfed by the moment the moment comes and and one of the things that I was good at on fear factor is to talk people through that yeah and just to let them know like look this is you can fucking do this you just go out and you don't think about anything else but doing it all those other things are a trap those other things are demons you got to keep those demons at bay don't don't entertain them don't feed them don't give them water push them away they don't exist well you're going to concentrate on is repeating the mantra that you can do this and this is how you're going to do it be in the moment and go do this and I helped a lot of people get through that show because of that and that that is a primal thing that's a that's what's that's the difference between someone who survives an encounter with a Jaguar and someone who does it you know there's someone who panics and freezes up and gets killed and someone who runs away someone who figures out how to climb a tree somebody figures out how to pick a rock and smash it in the head the the difference between someone who encounters an incredibly difficult situation and learns from it or dies because of it that's that's a primal thing man I mean that is one of the reasons why we're here is because people did confront predators and the reason why children are afraid at night of monsters is because we have genetics they're monsters Jaguars and leopards eating us I remember reading this story about a guy we've got bitten by a great white shot and not like they've bitten went off like it took his whole torso in his mouth in its mouth and it swam underwater with him and he was so dazed he said he remembered it all very vividly and because he wasn't a head injury writing you forget stuff then right but he was he was under the water and he was just be basically pulled along into the deep water by this shark which had this in his jaws and he was just dazed he was like on fire you know okay well what am I gonna do here right and then the image of his kids came up and his wife and he's like no fucking way and he just reached out but he jammed his hand the end of the eye of the shark Wow and it shook him free didn't let go because you know I guess that birds say I can imagine right and he swam to the surface and he lived and he made it back to shore cuz that's that moment where you just go like no fucking way I'm not going out like this Wow and that I think is that thing that's a primal visceral response whereas before it was just like I'm gonna surrender to this god-awful thing and then it's just like no no way no way I'm fighting back this well that's what's fascinating about martial arts competition is that everyone has that sort of no way thing but the reality of no way is if you're in the Octagon with John Jones and you say no way it doesn't matter what you think you say no way he's gonna kill you I walked into that I'm like a fine red mist of nothing to sniff at tense that a person has been they've prepared their entire life for this moment and it's not just the no way that you get when you're getting bit by a shark but it's also knowing that that no way is coming every fucking day getting up at 5:00 a.m. when the alarm clock goes off and eating healthy and running and making sure you get the right amount of rest and take the right amount of vitamins and all that knowing that you have that instinct to say no way but so does he and that's not going to be good enough right right you're gonna you're gonna have to control your body control your mind develop your skills and have an intelligent approach to this very difficult task in front of you and you've talked about when you were a kid that you saw violin in your home fortune was incredibly sorry is it true that for a lot of these guys they come from some rough backgrounds and some aggressive for violence a lot of them almost all of them and what do you think the connection is there because in some ways you'd sort of think well if you saw that kind of stuff wouldn't you want to get away from it you do you would but sometimes you can't and so you want to learn to protect yourself that's what a lot of it is and a lot of it is a lot of guys were bullied I was bullied not too badly nobody really hurt me but I was intimidated by a lot of guys you know I scared that a gift in your head the bullet just circles around you it's humiliating and it's humiliating it can you know causes people to jump off buildings you know it's it's it's a huge huge problem with human beings this natural inclination to pick on the weak to satisfy our own insecurities you know and for me I was I was a small kid I wasn't big and there was just too many moments where I was scared and I was like okay this is not how I want to live my life so I started taking martial arts I was like I have a fight because this is just too scary okay what if I Armand isn't gonna end it you get excited if eternity like this is gonna be the rest of my life and the environment is not gonna change it the teachers aren't gonna stop it there's no way for my parents to stop it like if I don't act this is gonna be the same fucking day for the rest of my life it was clear to me it was clear to me that no one was gonna help me and as a boy it was one of the core issues of being a boy growing up was dealing with the other boys and this balance of power which was so against me you know that story or the kids from the jungle they think it's like some island somewhere when a plane goes down I mean high school i'ma do boarding school I mean it's it's not it's not some Island out there it's like walking into the end of the school building it's human nature and there's the dance like who's the Alpha like what's what's gonna go on here like who's gonna be the one that controls the situation who's gonna get the first pick of the girls who's gonna get you know what who gets to pick on people and get away with it and that is a part of being a human beings and it's also a part of being a human being that as you said is developing in a society where children not being raised correctly so you're not if a child grows up with martial arts as a young boy you would be incredibly embarrassed to be a bully because that is the worst thing you could ever be in a martial arts class I am a black belt in jujitsu and I roll on a regular basis roaming spar with people who are complete novices and I don't hurt them ever I've never heard one you know I just and I coach them along the way I'm like you gotta you gotta turn your head like this but I keep eating my daughter because we play wrestling it's like right between that for sometimes it's big strong men they're untrained but the point is like if I like humiliated them or beat them up or something like that it would be a massive embarrassment for my school a massive barrister for me as a martial artist like everyone in class would hate me because of it there are people like that that do like bully and try to hurt like lesser ranks or novices those people are kicked out of class like there's no place for them in martial arts it's it's about developing character and then about representing that development and character like having honor and having respect and if kids learn that at an early age there'd be no bullying in class there would be none of that there's always going to be people picking on people and people making fun of people but bullying it's specific like ganging up on people and detonating them that's that is one of the scariest aspects of growing up and it motivates a lot of martial artists is it to learn and that's what motivated me so ultimately it's like this terribly negative force channels itself into an incredibly positive thing that really became a developing factor for every aspect of my life and they became it became a real vehicle that whatever they love music sprays the vehicle for developing human potential yeah so some of it you find out because it's so difficult you find out what you can do and then other things become easier yeah oh yeah I think the mastery of anything is really challenging I've seen great things for selves yeah now when you started taking the martial arts what happened with the bullying I mean did you end up beating people up or did you end up having the confidence that they then found weaker prey I have a very you physical altercations outside of competitions you know I have like one or two small ones in high school that were really no big deal the nothing like crazy but the fights that I had in tournaments were so extreme you know like so many knockouts and just so so much great the violence of physical competition is so much more intense than anything you would ever experience in a your average street fight you know if you're dealing with trained killers yeah like you and another trained killer doing it so like there was no motivation for me to prove to anybody that I knew how to fight and then somewhere along the line other kids knew like oh that's you know he's a black belt is this is that and they just left me alone right it became just become scary enough so that they leave me alone and then you don't you know you avoid the fight yeah dimension is always kind of the tiara and you have very little aggression because you're always training so like when you training all the time you're always tired energy it's like oh my god I just got to get from the futon to the cash somebody give me a wheelbarrow it was a famous karate master who once said that the the turret egos are not nicer they're just tired from training they avoid these things because they just it's too hard to just get up for it right right but I think that human beings have a massive amount of you know what I call chimp DNA that the monkey instincts there's a massive amount of those that are not being represented by the way we live our lives the the bodies that we have are essentially the same bodies is the humanoids that lived a hundred thousand years ago or 50 thousand years ago there's very little variation yeah and the the need for physical movement and the need for just activity and all these different these different hormones and chemicals that your body just naturally produces they have to be satisfied they have to be they have to be moved around and I think it's a huge part of balancing your perspective in life balancing your view of were there just to exercise these things out of their system and for boys especially huge huge part of being sane yeah certainly learning how to manage it aggression is really I think one of the yeah I'm a strong atheist and I think one of the things that was really harmful about religion was this idea that we are antibody that we are souls trapped in this prison of the flesh and we're you know aimed to be these rockets that rise up to meet the glory above and so on because I think that gave us this feeling that the body is somehow and it's very explicit in some forms of Christianity and other religions do that the body is Satan's device to draw you away from God the lusts and then the comedians make fun up and then celebrate I think it's very Pro body right because it's funny and it's an enjoyable place to be and I think that this hostility towards is called in philosophy the mind-body dichotomy that we're this glorious mind tracted this horrible fleshy corpse kind of thing I think it's really really unhealthy and I didn't really get that when I was young like when when I was 20 I went to the National Theatre School I was be an actor in a play Ryan did some of that for a bit but what they did there which I thought was amazing was real body work which I've never been exposed to before I grew up in England you know England's relationship to the body is you know it's crazy or I haven't even cleaned their teeth look guys I love the taste of gingivitis in the morning smells like Empire but when I did in this body work which was like I don't feel the Aleksandra technique which of the body repositioning technique that we did gymnastics we did sword fighting we did play you know stage fighting and all that kind of stuff which is like in some ways more challenging and we did stretching and and I got into yoga and stuff like that and I was encouraging this in my show because in I deal with a pretty hyper intellectual audience and I keep trying to remind people you know drive your brain back into the body driving rain back into the body that is a seat of everything that you are and you know if that doesn't do well you're not going to do well in the long run and don't split yourself off from the body but this is a weird thing in society where we are somehow not our bodies and it has to do with the soil idea we can continue afterwards and I don't think I'm gonna have any more reality after and death and I did before I was born which is to say not at all and this is this is where we are and I really try to encourage people to really root themselves on that you know we second brain called the gun which is almost as complex as the one we've got up here people say I've got a gut instinct that's that's real that's not an imaginary thing this is great book by Malcolm Gladwell called blink you should pick it up if you haven't read I have yeah okay so where he says you know people get stuff yeah like so incredibly quickly and that's not a intellectual process that is a full-body process and I think the people you know in terms of you say how do we heal the world I think our bodies detect immorality a lot quicker than our brains do like yeah I have those people and they come around you're like and there's something not right about this guy I don't know if body language they may look perfectly normal or whatever if it's a slight vacancy the eyes are something like that or it's over the stiff body posture or something like that I think that if we could see you call them I think exquisite douche bags like you're talking about there but the Ducks Stanhope's the party in the desert yeah yeah then he could have these parties but in maybe a thousand cool guys and then one unbelievable douchebag who would just ruin it for everyone I think we can see those people but I think we can mostly see them with the body and not with the brain because the brain we can talk us out in and out of stuff but the Bonnie I think really connects at a very visceral level with the people around us I don't think if we could train people to be more in the body I think they'd be better at detecting bullshit and better at detecting bad people and shunning them and then we kind of isolate them and quarantine them not breathe but them not having them over fucking up our kids and I think then we'd be able to pass that gene out of the cool so to speak sorry that's a hell of a lot read for you no absolutely and I think that the idea that the body is separate from the mind it's really kind of silly it's they work together and if the mind is working the overtime and the body is falling apart though the minds not gonna talk to them even if you have an incredibly advanced mind and beautiful knowledge and information it would be better if your body wasn't shape it'd be better if you were a limber if you'd be better if you weren't stressed out like we experienced a physical stress of the deteriorating bodies it's legitimate it's a hundred percent real it's not not just a vain thing you want to keep your body in shape to look good you know that's an ego thing it's not it's it's you you're some weird symbiotic thing you know it's the mind and the body and then also the intestinal flora it gets really freaky when you start realizing that you're actually an ecosystem yeah yeah yeah animals you know enough one thing and the ecosystems even within the mind as this great therapy called internal family systems therapy which basically says that we are we don't have like a single cell like we are a competing ecosystem of you know our parents and those who want stuff from us in our own of you know some of our own needs which is also to please those who want stuff from us and it's all a competing and if you think that you've got like one ego you end up being a kind of tyrant because all these other voices in your head that they're telling you to do stuff or encourage me to do stuff kind of tamp them down because we need unity but I think the idea that we are always in a state of negotiation with ourselves is really positive in you know I spent years in therapy and I think it's just fantastic to work from that kind of approach that we have I call it the Miko system like me as an ecosystem and and it really is a lot of give-and-take and a lot of negotiation with yourself and because if you can negotiate with yourself I think you'll end up with a society where people negotiate with each other I think that the people who are tyrannical with their own identity end up being tyrannical with others I think that the way the world is out there it's very much a mirror of the way we live internally and if we can be more at peace and negotiating with ourselves that recognize that we should not have a single dominant Authority within ourselves but everything is a negotiation you know do I want to work out or they want to have a nap I mean I have those negotiations with myself all the time and that way I can negotiate with my wife and my daughter or my listeners and all that and I don't have a tyrannical part of myself that says well you just got to do this god dammit no matter what because I'm always afraid that if that's the way it is for me and in here that's how it's gonna translate to the world out there I always feel that the the most massive structures in the world that the government states armies and all that just a reflection of how we deal with ourselves internally and I think trying to get people to relax about how they deal with themselves internally and negotiate more than dictate I think is really important I'm completely rambling but I hope that makes sense and the rigidity being rigid and not being able to be flexible about things there's also a huge issue the ability to alter your ideas about things and not feel like you're looser because you changed your mind you know like the ability to admit mistakes and to able to express where the mistake went wrong and what what you believe now I think that's very important I think one of the the things that I see in people that I admire is one of the things I admire most is the ability to make it wrong the ability to make mistakes the ability to admit admit personal failures and then the ability to grow from learning about that mistake and one of the things that I find to be one of the most incredibly weak and intolerable things is someone who cannot admit that wrong no I can't communicate with people like that I can't can it yeah I make mistakes all the time if you don't you know maybe you're the perfect person but if you do and you don't admit it we can't talk we can't well is it most of life not working out I mean this is most of the most of life failure I mean that's you know one of my favorite writers is Charles Dickens or or you take Shakespeare Charles Dickens wrote like thirty five novels of which like four or five or famous so usually he's the best novelist that we've ever produced as a species and he's got a success rate of 20% you know shit Shakespeare out of fifty four plays yeah hundreds of sonnets and of his plays maybe ten are like regularly produced know the Hamlet's off fellow's Merchant of Venice and all that so he had a success rate of about twenty so the greatest conceivable geniuses in human history have a success rate of about 20 percent I've had some of my biggest breakthroughs from failures from my disgust in the failure or my discontent and my recognizing where what wrong and then miry energizing and and refocusing like they stand up comedy failures I can literally point to the moments on stage like the worst bombings in the history of my career and then the giant leaps that I made in progress after that it's always been the case and I now it to this day if I have a set that's not so good I recognize that I hate that so I will now refocus and then this is a good thing because this has taught me well you got a little sloppy there or you got overwhelmed by responsibilities or what you didn't put enough focus in it whatever it was now is the time to recognize that just like every other time in the past you are now going to grow and it's you'll be better than you ever were before yeah I did a bunch though and I thought I did the right research but I didn't at all I did a show on health care and then this woman who was a doc it was pretty high up in the profession she rubbed me this long email detailing every single thing that I kept wrong in my show and so what I did was I you know I am like I just week this whole email completely sorry I just you know I thought I knew what I was talking about terms that I had done had come so far in my house I'm seeing back out of my own eyeballs good on you yeah I need to read the whole thing because if you're not correcting yourself how you can have any credibility because nobody believes that you're right all the time that's impossible I correct myself all the time on the podcast because a lot of times during the podcast we're completely talking out of her ass I remember something and then I'm like fuck and now I go home let me google that like I'm constantly Google things well in the middle I go okay I'm full of shit cuz actually they proved it in 1972 that this is you know and I think that's really really really important especially when you have this weird responsibility like as I know that you do you have a massive following online and a lot of people very much respect your opinions and thoughts on things and consider them very highly so when you know you you say something or you go over something and then it turns out that it was incorrect or it was you your original assumption was based on some bad information it's so important to be flexible like that it's so important to be honest like that and so that people recognize like you're a human being and everyone who's listening is a human being and we're all essentially in the same boat together one of us may have focused more on a particular topic or one of us may have more talent in a particular area but we're the same goddamn thing yeah no I think I think it is important and yeah especially when you put out a lot of shadows it's gonna get style and you can't be an expert in everything and that's no question that you have to read and you know someone want to model that behavior for people right I mean because if you have the defensive guy who can't admit that he's wrong I mean the kind of people who are gonna end up being comfortable with you are not the kind of people you want to have around oh this guy never admits he's wrong he's an okay guy for me you want to have that force field that repels the people who want that because that's not a good place to I have a very critical forum and sometimes critical in a bad way like there's a lot of kunti be a lot of people and just a really just negative people but a lot of really intelligent people - but I really rely on it sometimes if I have a show that doesn't go well or if I something happens there's a dispute about something I like the criticism I think yes he usually important especially if it's honest and it's intelligent because that wasn't available before and one of the resources of the internet that's so fantastic to me is that you can get opinions and you can get intelligent ideas from people that you would never be able to contact with 10 20 30 years ago yeah it wouldn't be able to and now you get them and you can interact with them in real time and it's it's a beautiful thing it's so enriching and it's so important for your personal growth and for the growth of anything you're trying to do to have these intelligent people giving their point of view you may or may not agree and that's one of the things I find along the way like how I read it would be the intelligent review of why something that I did was not right and I'm like I see where you're coming from but I disagree entirely I can respect that but I I don't like that I don't like this that you're saying is good only I don't like Smashing Pumpkins I don't like Grateful Dead there's a lot of things that a lot of people like that I don't like actually I do like Smashing Pumpkins shouldn't say that both the blue skies have designers do - yeah what does that one song 1979 I think if they're really something that I know it's that world is a vampire so shouldn't they smash my temptation though I gotta tell you my weakness is Joe you gotta stop me if I do this I want to nitpick back nitpick back so I talked to a lot of libertarians and libertarians God loved them greatest people in the world but if you make one factual slip like six million guys are gonna come down with you like Ricky Reed references can be a boss so if the other day I was like I said something about Tigers in Africa right you know and like 6 million people email me dear God how can you believe that there are Tigers in Africa Tigers are native to India there's no times in Africa no times in Africa completely true except one tiger in Africa when you're rolling your honor I give a nap again with that yeah well you know people love that sport of calling people out on mistakes there's a certain like scorecard that you keep you know we can bust someone on I or someone on a misquote or a mistake it's that's it's a big part of the debunking movement I had a guy on recently a guy named Nick West who's who runs contrail Science org know the contrail stuff yeah yeah and it's all about his website is he runs Medibank which is a message board it's all about debunking conspiracies and ideas and incorrect awesome one of the things that these guys love doing is debunking things for like a score they like for them it's like you know incorrect this is what's right and this is and they like calling people out on Wright State right it's a it gives them a sorry that's the wrong number of grains of coffee from my coffee I've explicitly told you the right number and that's just off by three like I've done great speeches about really important stuff and make one little error and people like it's like they have a big picture people you know the Sun has spots that doesn't mean it's not like they're right right right right yeah oh I just wanted to ask you a penis knowledge yes absolutely and I really felt that this was essential to answer and I don't know if you ever figure this one out but I watched the stuff he did on circumcision because we did it was Mike's idea actually we did a video on on circumcision as well which started off with a video of someone getting circumcised the baby and it's like if you can watch that and still go ahead with it I mean lordy check your soft hand against the man's right but you had a question about because I think in the show you got the opinion that women said that the sex with uncircumcised penises was better and I think you were looking that up in the show and I don't know if you ever got the answer but we found I think we found the answer through various experimentation with with fruits and veg but what what it is is because the the the foreskin it makes the less friction for the woman all right because when you thrust the foreskin has some gift right right so it's less friction II for the woman and because it's less friction it's more more comfortable unless you know it's just then a rough and rugged rabbit right so right that so you thrust and the foreskin has give back and forth and so it doesn't stress the woman's vagina as much through that friction that's about which is why I think guys who are circumcised need more lubricants and stuff like that hmm you know like a good spray of wd-40 before you go into whatever expert mentioned that and this it prevents a tennis knife what the fuck is that about yeah I mean well first of all those studies are heavily suspect yeah then rely on self-reporting and stuff like that and secondly it actually lets say it does reduce a to certain amount which is not actually being proven to do it's actually kind of dangerous because then the guys think while I'm circumcised I don't need a condom yeah but even if you are circumcised they still say well for God's sake wear a condom if you want to know so it can't actually be kind of dangerous and increase the spread fates if people believe that there's a recent study instead the 60% decrease in age you know I don't need a condom because how do you justify those numbers I would love to see how they figured that out it's that guy and you have a lot of sex with a guy with AIDS and then you know you circumcised them and well now he's even less AIDS II yeah like what how are you doing not known for an excess of soap right I mean this is we rub your asses down there right so there's that problem the penile cancer thing I mean even the American Society of Pediatrics because they say you know you put penile and cancer together you usually go get emancipation because you know these are like I preached up my ears of penile when you added cancer to it I really really began to listen but the the numbers that go down are so infinitely small and the chances of getting it or so teeny-tiny I mean it's like saying what would remove the baby's breasts because she might get breast cancer you think the support is about them the support for circumcision the you know almost universal support that we find that's in America you that's right find any non-muslim kids who were circumcised what is it in America I mean is a barbaric mutilation of a baby's genitals as far as I'm concerned yeah I think it's some ancient bullshit removing half the skin of the penis I mean it's not just a tip I mean sorry I put it bluntly and you have to put put shit in to wedge it because the baby's born with the foreskin in here physically adhere to the penis you gotta go in anyway sales of deaths or mutilations which are numerous but the idea that it still exists is troubling to me idea it doesn't there's no rationale is no rational sense to it there's there's things that I get I see a cause and effect and I see I see why people do it I don't see that one I don't understand it the only thing that I see is perhaps a justification of the old ways and the fact that it's been done for so long that's misspelled and people say I want the son to look like the dad oh and I mean how often in your son and your husband comparing penises is that a big family hobby I mean Adam dinner saying well you know it's longer and bigger so I think I think a lot of it has to do with you know why does trauma repeat - trauma it's a big question why does trauma repeat and I think partly why trauma repeats as it gets normalized yeah right I mean so obviously made the great decision after seeing your dad to denormalize what your dad did to hitting your mom I mean you you said like this is not how men are this is not how I'm gonna be right so you denormalized it but if you totally worshipped him when you thought he was the best kind of heifer and this is what men do you would be most likely to reenact it well actually did until I saw that it was one of the most didn't what was it when I saw my dad hit my mom when I was about five it was the first time I've ever seen him strike her and I never forgot that feel I mean it's really difficult to remember exactly what I remember but I do remember very very clear feeling and that very feel clear feeling was oh he's fucked up too like oh I thought that my dad was my hero and I remember being massively disappointed I'll never forget that feeling of disappointment like this is not what I thought I thought my dad was this awesome perfect guy and he's not at all you know he's a bad person right and this is a bad scene no mic but why do you think you had that response because some kids wouldn't some kids would be like oh I can't wait to grow up and hit my own woman right I mean why do you think you had that response guess I cuz I love my mom you know my mom was not a bad person she was another angry person then out of that yeah because it she was yeah she was a strong woman she still is but she realized at that moment like this is not happening and she packed up our stuff and we were gone but I'll never forget the feeling of disappointment they're like oh you know like when you're a child you hope that your father is a hero and to know that he's not so I think for me it was this this very young introduction to clothes violence violence within the household was sort of a defining factor why I you know was terrified of violence and why I wanted to learn to defend myself like really early on like the idea that someone could just do that to you or that someone could do that to their wife there's someone can do that to my mother right yeah it is I think that kind of recording from it so you do normalize it was a bad thing I do you do as a dad I mean I know me as a dad I mean I'm the idea that I would ever see that look at my daughter's face Laura would fall from grace doesn't that terrify you terrifies me I mean I'm not like you know constantly trying to be like some statue of perfect fatherhood or whatever but the idea that I would disappoint my daughter in that fundamental away where she have that crossroads with me and no longer look at me in that same you know look how to kind of way I really think about that like every day yeah I ever want to see that but I think the love that people have for their children often motivates them to be better person yeah be a better person I know it does for me you know I I couldn't imagine you know I mean if I even raised my voice to my daughter it's like come on seriously you can't do that you can't hit each other can't throw things through a window you can't you know the idea of hitting my daughter is insane it's alien it's impossible and the idea of hitting my wife is so completely out of the idea of what's possible it's I I wonder what my feelings would be if I didn't grow up in a house of violence I wonder if I wouldn't be so repulsive to me having actually physically experienced it in person up close but I did you know so I was inexorably that's that's a part of my psyche you know that's that that being a negative thing that being a horrific crime and there's also just don't weakness I can never forgive a man that's willing to do that to hit a woman like that it's just so weak it's so incredibly weak just such a such a failure of character and such a negative selfish impulse to hit someone like that it's a you know it's it's one of the major things that's wrong in human interaction is the ability to hurt each other to want and leave to just reach out and injure each other and they didn't express our ignorance in such a violent and selfish way yeah and I feel that I'm sure you do too but I feel that even more strongly with parents to kids yeah who is so much bigger yeah your wife can my wife can leave me your wife can leave you anytime if you're a joke right your kids can't think I know let it go right they got they can't just say well that's it you know I'm getting the divorce from you dad and I'm gonna go find a better dad but they know where to go they have no choice there's so tiny yeah and I think violence always makes you smaller than your victim yeah you know and I hit a four-year-old I mean are you really so far out of options as an adult with all the choice in the world that you actually have to end up hitting someone so tiny dependent I mean that makes you way smaller but I was really some account of a guy who's losing custody of his child the him and the wife had gotten divorced and and I was reading this articulate well written account of the horrors of the legal system until I came upon this thing where he said that his daughter went back the daughter was three went back to the wife and told of a mild spanking that he gave her and I'm like oh you're a douchebag you're a lying douchebag and her piece of shit you spanked your baby and what you're doing here is manipulating reality with your blog to try to paint yourself to be a victim you beat your fucking kid man I don't care it's a mild spanking you don't mildly spank a fucking three-year-old when you're a grown man it's nonsense it's crazy you don't have to do that they throw a temper tantrum hover over them communicate with them until it's over and then give Mahad and but this is when I know it gets frustrating it's but for us I've had frustrations and what that's the number one thing that I always do when I communicate with my kids I always tell them when I was your age I was even worse at that when I was your age Christ a lie all the time when I was your age I used to do this all the time I always wanted to be first I always was selfish I wanted to have all the toys but then I realized that when you share toys it makes it better it's hard to realize that in the foyer role but one day you're gonna figure it out and that's why I'm telling it to you and but I have you know I have a lot of time I have I'm a relaxed person I'm not constantly under the pressure to perform in life I'd like to to you know to do better I'm in a good financial position I'm in a good relationship position when I see people that are stressed out by life and then the wife is overwhelming and the like what happened there it's like it's almost like they're they're overwhelmed by their plate and it's terrible on the child yeah I always wanted my daughter to remember that I was a kid too and that's what you're talking about I don't want to think that I'm some giant authority figure that's in her life in fact I told her so much about my childhood she likes to play with me as a kid okay I want to play with little Steph and then she wants me to come into the room as little Steph and play that way and I think that's great because I want you to remember that and I think the God if we could just fix language you know the good fix language I think would fix so much in the world there's an old Confucian saying says the beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper names I hate the words Bank just say it yeah you know just say it I can make it mild spanking come on I mean don't call it war call it murder that's what it is spanking yeah don't call it the rest call it kidnapping don't call that taxation call it theft I mean just listen use the proper words for things we'd solve so many problems euphemisms are you know they just the plaque in the arteries of the brain that confuse so many people you hit your child it's not a spanking we say while it's mild it's just a little SWAT on the bat no no no no spanking it's to deter behavior is to change behavior which means the child has to hate and fear and I wish people could just be honest about it but they can't even be honest with themselves and then they get mad at their kids for lying I agree that the categorization and this this this thing that we do where we make one thing better than another thing even though it's exactly the same like spanking it's better than eating you know but they're the same goddamn thing you know like how about this I mean it sort of unrelated but not really this thing that's going on with with this deploring of chemical weapons it's somehow no they're murdering people with chemicals in that fashion is way worse than using drones these robots that shoot Hellfire missiles into buildings and kill 98% innocent 98% women and children is that the actual statistic 90% Jesus they're so bad at killing only the targets like the idea that these are pinpoint precise maybe it's fucking terrifying shit but yet Obama will be on TV talking about how these chemical weapons we have to deplore the actions of a father pull these children begging for them to get up what about the fucking kids you blew up from the sky what about rockets launched from robots like some Orwellian nightmare flying around cities with night vision where someone's got a remote controller in Nevada and they're pressing the fire button and launching these missiles the the the you know this this idea that we need to take military action we need to kill because people have killed you know we need to go murder innocence because innocent civilians are killing Syrians so to solve that we're gonna kill some Assyrians the Assyrians not to kill the Syrians and we're gonna do it with pinpoint strikes meanwhile they know for a fact they're gonna move innocents and civilians into those areas that are high risk military targets they're gonna move prisoners into those those areas they're gonna up the body count you're gonna do it on purpose and you know I mean the terrifying thing about it's not just American weapons of modern weapons in general is the fact that they will fuck with entire populations genetics like this is something I did I just did this study yeah the sort of review of the Syrian staff and America's outrage of chemical weapons and complete without even getting into Vietnam where millions of people were destroyed by these unbelievably horrendous weapons the only thing America didn't use was mustard gas and nuclear weapons everything else they just threw from bombers down in this population in Fallujah in 2007 they used this white phosphorus which is basically just exploding glue that mounts human beings and they just was fired it indiscriminately into the city and they use these depleted uranium shells because they're good at piercing armor of which there really wasn't much of in Iraq anyway but this stuff has a half-life longer than the planet itself and it's so screws with the genetics of the population because it goes into the desk that goes into the linesman a 600 percent increase in leukemia and in the years after this Fallujah attacked run by America abiding by the Special Forces by the army fifty percent of the children were born with birth defects and a guy a geneticist who's kind of studied the city says that he's never seen a more compromised as a nice way of putting it basically a more fucked up genetic population the this is going to go on for generations these genes have been completely destroyed by these weapons and then they're saying well you know this guy in Syria yes use these chemical weapons than someone it's like but at least that stuff is not gonna completely rewrite the genetic code of the population for generations - people definitely denied the use of depleted uranium even though there's a lot of evidence that shows that they are they used it in Serbia - and I have to apologize to people cuz I was talking about where they used all these depleted uranium and all these guys from Serbia right and say what we don't count I mean come on I mean what would they used it with us - with the same effect and then that's also the cost of this do this this Gulf War Syndrome that all these people have come back well as horrible illnesses that mirror radiation sickness and then the government has denied them medical treatment so there's nothing wrong here is something going on here it's it's a sad sad statement that that's how we are their name Oh some people that I meet it really nice you need a lot more people than I do they say the average famous person meets like ten thousand people a year or some crazy number right yeah and but don't you find that most of the people that you this is the weird thing the world is insane so full of like the most soul-destroying evil but yet most of the people that I meet are unbelievably nice yeah yeah I mean like who are these reptiles who run everything because I meet these really nice people and there's all that horrible stuff in the NIP it's going all fairness you live here yes that's your Anto that's true I don't live you know he proposed yeah it's a lovely place and people are pretty nice and try very wise yeah like overall I say 20% less douchebags in Canada than America well you guys the NW factor which we ran into a couple of times in the drive down the BMW factory yeah you know that old joke about the MW so what's the difference I'm gonna tell the joke to a poor needy and so I'm gonna go to a fucking line and a BMW there that BMW there and then poke you find the bricks from the outside so other than the BMW factor very very nice people they they must bring them in from Kosovo or something that's also always gonna be the case when people are privileged or when they have more money or when they feel like they've worked harder and the other people are weak and lazy you get the fuck out of my way I've got the Mercedes I don't people love to think that the accidents of birth or personal virtues I mean it's all you know with a kiss a lot of you know a lot of people who make it big you know like what couldn't contro isn't there a godfather like Steven Spielberg or something like that and she's a talented actress a lovely lady but she got a bit of a leg up in the business right but a lot of people like oh you know I have to be born to this great family I happen to be born in the West when you and I'm born in Kenya I mean what the hell are we gonna do with those ass you know the time the rubber tyres to our feet to run around and I mean it's so much of the good stuff in our life is kind of accidental 100 percent and mistakes after personal virtue is it's a really great failing because it really kills your empathy and on the flip side it's also an incredible weakness that people have when they point to successful people going on they go to love ten years you end up a lot of luck right what's your ass and then you get blocked all the time it's weird because I you know in your life of course you need five years to stand up before you got anywhere near TB or anything I gotta do that and that sense I got super lucky cuz that's really rare it's really rare to get on a hit sitcom when you're five years in a stand-up well yes but I bet you when you got that sick you work pretty hard today for us I sing from the people who like who were more experienced on the set and you really just want you to fail no it's not hard it's not a difficult process of all the things that have ever done in my life acting is without a doubt the easiest is that it is it's like other people's words and you you just have to be credible and hit your mark kind of certainly that's a part of it but it's also it's just not that difficult to just pretend I mean we all know what happens when someone gets upset about something would all know what happens when someone's confused we can pretend and it sure it's also when you're you're acting you're it's you have a chance to do it over again if you fuck it outright it's not hard it's coming from martial arts and then coming from stand-up comedy those two things between you don't get to walk back and say I'm gonna do that joke again maybe once you know but after that people are like well he's not he's just good yeah wake up from being knocked out we're gonna fight again my Mulligan we do this then not only that it's it's one of those things that when you see someone on a camera you see them on screen you see them and this weird alpha male primate thing that we have where we think that the person who gets to talk is special the person that's on camera is special because like that would be like the leader of the tribe or so this is weird it's sort of they've hijacked our human reward system with with media and so because of that when you see someone who's on film and someone's crying you give them incredible accolades you were amazing that film had changed my life is amazing all he does is pretend they pretend to be a murderer they were trying doing a desert for 12 hours a day anything a four-year-old can do I don't think it was Marlon Brando who said that you know anything that four-year-old Shirley Temple he was talking about you know anything before you all can do I'm not sure we should be a big prizes for watch Ricky Schroder in the champ it was like six years old and it was fucking incredible at John Lyon is a sin still hey that kid just gives you those braces it it's not hard to do and it's not something that requires like like learning to play the piano or learning to speak French it requires a lot of research stuff which is really significant you know it's our stand-up comedy's infinitely harder than acting and they granted I was acting in a very limited way I was doing a sitcom there's one of the more limited forms of acting but we also created a lot of the dialogue in fact Dave Foley was probably responsible for maybe fifty percent of everything that got made on that show he was like a secret producer because he was such a brilliant guy and so good at ad-libbing that what he would do is we would we had an amazing executive producer Paul Sam's brilliant brilliant guy and created the show the head writer and executive producer a great writing staff as well but Paul was really open to us experimenting so he would they would give us a framework they'd give us a script but Dave would rewrite entire scenes and so so much of what we did on that show was adlet almost maybe 50% right so it wasn't just about reading people's lines being be easier it's just an easier gig it's it's easy it's like so my my stumbling into a sitcom it was because of a bunch of lucky factors lot number one that they saw me on MTV and they saw got to somebody in my comedy special or and to be half-hour comedy hour when I was on this television show where I did like 10 minutes they saw that and it went well and then I got these opportunities to just opened up from that and then this show came about and then I got on it there was a show that was already created so it was all luck that was all luck and the idea that you get that successful after five years of doing stand-up is really really rare so I can't take any credit for that but then from there you know for there you want to look and even that I mean to do the hot fire on TV special up it was a hell of a lot of work and that comes out of years on the road and knowing how to work an audience the timing and what works and what doesn't and all that so that's all worked yeah Stan anybody who's good at stand-up that shit does not come in no no no one who gets up there and can can kill an audience of strangers that's all work you just can't do it from the beginning yeah anybody who'd add to that you know lots of average guys just just go give it a shit I wouldn't you know I knew at once maybe you will have a couple of good lines even Klum elated or you've developed over the course of your life some observations that you think are really funny you wrote them down they might be valid they might be good and then might work a couple of times but not when people are paying you know people pay 30 bucks for a ticket and they say one you know one after another I mean I was just amazed because the our 20 that you are onstage last night Exley by for me you know at a Mac are you saying the court you memory kind of flew by to you but I'm thinking the amount of work I mean the amount of material that's written in discarded and tested and discarded the amount of the concentrated work that there's an hour and 20 of making people live well that's it I mean man tip of the iceberg last night huge amount of work underneath when I'm not working on other things if I'm not doing the UFC or from not working on my podcast I am always thinking of stuff like is this funny is this interesting but it's also I've kind of designed my life in that the creation of material outside of the actual sitting down in front of the computer and writing which is critical you have that has to be done that's one of the things that a lot of lazy comedians don't do post it since then yeah you can't just do that you have to do both you have to do the writing down notes and stuff is important too but the actual sitting down and crafting the bits and putting them in order and figuring out a way you free ball when you're on stage and let it come when it's on stage because when you're on stage you never know where the hell could happen but that's what you have to be in the moment like when the guy came up to me in the beginning of the show and handed me the hockey puck oh the fuck do you do then it became like five minutes of me goofing on this guy yeah but it was yeah had to do it it was this is this is the thing that happened you know this is what it's all so it's stitching everything together it's the ridges between the stories that I was watching for last night how do you get from one bit to another and I hate work bit because it just sounds like such an insignificant thing right but that's what we call yeah but I mean so getting logically from one one bit to another is really like how do you order them how do you have to do that and if you don't people don't want to follow your train of thought the what you're doing when you're doing a stand-up performance it's not just telling you much jokes but you're borrowing someone's consciousness you borrowing someone's mind and the only way it really works is if someone trusts you enough your thoughts are as the they're as developed as they can be there you they're they're surprising they're stimulating to the point where someone saying okay take me on this ride through your mind take me on this ride because if you're talking like I've seen a million comedians and there's so many that I've seen that they start talking again I can't listen to this guy's mind because what he's doing he's got like a one-stop like his premises are short they're they're obvious concluded oatmeal's nicely which is the challenge Anderson there's no depth to the thought there's no unique point of view there's nothing there they haven't done the work or they're not capable of doing their work whatever one it is I gotta get out of here because I can't give them my mind you know that he wants cuz you know you talk about you know being a positive force in people's lives and bringing you know happiness and you certainly did that last night do you want I owe you leave the witness right so do you want people to come out of your show better wiser no how do you want them to come out of the show like it's not just happy calorie entertainment that's all I would argue that you actually do put some you do put something they were so into you're intelligent enough to put some real wisdom I think into what you do and I think that people can come out of your shows with some interesting connections that they hadn't thought of before I'm not saying you're an educator obviously but I think that there's stuff that it's not just a burger yeah you know it's not empty calories right because there's a lot of thought in what you do well last night's set was particularly rich an idea to some of the new things that I've been working on are there's a lot of stuff and I'm working on about the sort of weirdness of progressive thought later like this really aggressive progressiveness that's going on where people are denying reality and they're doing it so because they feel like people have been marginalized in the past which is true but it doesn't mean you spring it back the other way you say a bunch of stupid shit it doesn't make any sense yeah oh you judge people harshly for judging people harshly it's like yeah how does that works right that's right hating people for hit it exactly exactly and some of the most aggressive people I know are liberals it's really good I mean there's an amazing video of the University of Toronto of this guy who is speaking about Men's Rights Lauren foul yeah yeah and these feminists are protesting students screaming in their face these students that want to go see this man talk about women's about men's rights and about that you hate women and all this and they're incredibly aggressive the only hate I see is in the protesters the only a not that we've and by the way incredibly ignorant to what this guy's actual words are and they weren't even aware they didn't even bother doing the research they didn't even bother formulating a true opinion on these this guy's ideas they just decided that this guy hates women and that's a weird thing like I've made some posts about feminism on online before and one of the things that I've found incredibly strange is that I got called an MRA asshole so I go what does that mean was that MRA so that I have a sense that were fighting glue gun and are afraid I didn't know what it meant at all it's men's rights advocate or analysts yeah we're not area I was like wait a minute a feminist a person who wants equal rights for women is saying that being a man who wants equal rights for men is an idiot or I could call the dodo and Mr a dodo and I would oh Jesus Christ like well yoga well they're the compressed Socratic arguments alright I could call it Mr a asshole Emory dodo no I didn't even know what an MRI mean I'm not immense rights advocate I'm by any stretch of the imagination I don't visit any blogs and on visit any forums but I'm a believer in equality as far as like the laws and regulations as they apply to human beings and I do not believe that the laws and regulations as they apply to human beings this country aren't even for men as they are and women I don't think they're even for women and I don't think they're even for men yeah if it works what laws are fucking horrendous for men and some of them are atrocious some of them in Canada are god-awful yeah Dave Foley for the longest time I don't know if he's resulted anybody who's listening to this just Google Dave Foley Joe are experienced divorce and there's a there's a YouTube video that someone compiled of just him talking about divorce it will make your head spin and and I know back to TV yes because what he lost ten million dollars his last divorce yeah yeah yeah as he said it's not alimony it's all your money that's it is it it's insane it's insane and that's not fair it's not fair I don't care what anybody says I I think that absolutely if a man and woman get divorced the Manship in child support absolutely and if the woman was not working during the time of the marriage I think there should be some sort of compensation something fair and something reason we had some of the assets that he developed by focusing on whatever yeah sure absolutely but there's internal payments that's just not right no it's not it's not right and I have a friend who has to pay his ex-wife they were they were married for 12 years he has to pay her for the rest of her life until she gets married so she plays this game she has a boyfriend and the boyfriend lives with her and he sends the investigators over to figured out the boyfriends not there and then he leaves and the investigators leave and the boyfriend moves back in and so he has to continue penny like like she's cohabitating with a man and he still has to continue to send her money and it's just a manipulation of the legal system and this guy has paid her millions and millions and millions of dollars she's in his for million dollar Pacific Palisades home I mean it crippled him financially and on top of that he had to pay for her lawyer why they went to gone through divorce and here's where it gets really crazy she went to every lawyer in town and consulted with them every good lawyer in town that she knew of so that he could never use them as counsel oh because they'd be conflict of interest right oh man what's madness I mean she planned it out she planned this divorce out for a long time was incredibly calculating and the idea that men don't deserve rights and because of the fact that women have been marginalized which is true they have been but that doesn't mean that men haven't been either I mean human beings deserve to be treated fairly that's that's true to you you deserve everyone deserves to be treated humanely I don't believe men are I don't believe women are I don't believe humans are but the idea that you could separate and be a feminist but the anti men's rights well you're a fucking crazy person that you know you're not a humanist you're not a person who's looking at all human beings your brothers and sisters you're a person with an agenda you're a person with an ideology and that ideology is that you're on a team you're on team vagina and everything that's on teeny penis can go fuck itself and that was the that was the the feedback the blowback that I got for a joke about male feminists yeah no I mean I've stepped on that landmine a couple of times and I keep going back to it because it is it is an important one you know men in the legal system I mean not just been divorced but I mean the sentencing disparities between men and women what they call the pussy bust yeah you know I mean it's it's horrendous I mean you call feminism Marxist with pennies socialism with tits but that was a bad character in one of my novels but now I just go over feminism as a socialism of panties and it's very true because I mean and then people call oh my god that's so terrible if I just went through all the founding major outs of the feminist system that all Marxists all leftists and so on and also in feminists is so Pro woman then where are they with Margaret Thatcher Margaret Thatcher was like the first leader of a Western country she struggled up from nothing I mean an incredibly powerful woman but she was on the right you see so they hate her what about Iran Iran wrote the most influential book outside the Bible and the second most influential book and according to the New York Times Review of Books after the Bible you know reshaped Western philosophy in many ways in Western politics and the feminists hate her why because she was on the right least that's what they think she was not actually on the right but so I mean I have these sort of suspicions when they're sort of is it the leftist ideology or the pro-woman now if it's the pro woman then they should be incredibly positive where are the feminists when people insult people like Ann Coulter where are the feminists when people insult Sarah Palin you know like Bill Maher called her a cunt I mean that's really pretty vicious like publicly openly right I mean where the Fen because they're on the right and culture and considered be on the right so they get past when people go you know but you then say something bad about a woman on the Left and so I think that it is more left than it is Pro woman because when they choose between their politics and agenda they always seem to choose the politics of an agenda and that's my eyesight's leftist rather than than Pro woman I agree I think there's there's a lot of really emotional and non-objective thinking attached to feminism then there's a lot of there's a lot of really strange the one of the more recent ones that I find incredibly strange is this there's this new trend of accusing men of rape if they have sex with a woman who's had something to drink this is a broad sweeping thing that's going through the internet and a lot of these it's really weird because it seems to be there's a lot of it in this what they call a skeptical community and the skeptical community seems to be have like integrated with a lot of male feminists and feminists and this is something that they've adopted this idea that somehow another skepticism and this idea that they combine and I it's I don't know if you're aware the the case the Michael Shermer thing you know accused of some significant sexual impropriety way yeah no evidence other than a person who doesn't want to reveal their name yeah who he the guy who wrote the piece heard about secondhand yeah you didn't even hear about it directly from the person and this is a person who supposed to have a Nazi okay don't understand these things oh yes means yes getting sue now yeah it's the idea of that being the skeptic community I mean one of the things you learn as a skeptic when you're breaking down any idea whether it's a religious idea or whether it's an idea about an event that took place is that a person's I win this account of any individual event is suspect and that it's one of the worst forms of of evidence and it doesn't mean that a terrible thing didn't happen with this person but it does mean that if you look at the the in the context of the way it was explaining in this guy's blog is that she was put in a position where she couldn't consent like what what kind of weirdo language is that and then the the corroborating evidence that he uses in this blog is that a woman went to a party with this guy and he kept getting her drinks and he was flirty and that she got drunker than she usually does and that's it that's the corroborating piece of evidence that the man and a woman who are both adults were drinking together and she got drunk I mean I you talk about remove be yourself for personal responsibility they heat this guy was responsible for you getting drunker like that's insane but that's the same for a person who say the same drinks what choice did I have feminists like why how is it possible that a person who believes in the power of being a woman could think that a woman is so much weaker than a man that she can't control how much liquor she consumes when she's around a man yeah but the man somehow or another by being with her and drinking with her forces her to consume more than she normally would that's madness and there's no excuse cold I was drunk I mean try that the drunk driving right it's at what point is that okay yes you had diminished capacity while you were driving but you were responsible for drinking and getting in the car it's the one time when we're willing to alleviate someone of their own personal responsibility and only women a man is more of a man who if a man is more responsible if a man and woman are drunk together but the woman feels bad about the encounter in the morning the man raped her leaving all the man was drunk as well but the men are always the aggressors and always therefore guilty I mean that's not humanism but that is taken and this is a long dark road that as a man and you know I'm sorry that if you're a woman it's really hard to get this we have had so much negativity over the past 40 or so years hurled at masculinity that I mean we were like half criminals just for breathing I mean if you look at the role models on TV how how men are portrayed you know the Homer Simpson's and the American dad so that front leg unbelieva they dick we're all just idiots and sex-crazed and irresponsible and stupid yeah and the amazing thing is that it's true then if you look at the bell curve of intelligence for women it's kind of spikes in the middle so many more women are average intelligence than men now you still have your brilliant women you still have your dumb women but if you look at the bell curve of male intelligence much flatter which means that we have a lot more geniuses and a lot more complete idiots right and what's happened is everybody's focused on the idiots among men and have completely began to ignore all the brilliance that meant bring to the world all of the amazing incredible inventions that men bring to the world and it's just we're focusing on this low cluster which is incredibly it's like saying okay well blacks in America they commit a lot more crimes and we're just gonna focus on that and say that's all the blacks are that's all we're gonna deport Reyes blacks as criminals bla bla bla I would be incredibly racist but the sexism of portraying men as idiots because we happen to have more cluster as a gender on that side and completely ignoring all of the incredible stuff that brilliant men bring to the world it's incredibly sexist and it's really hard for for for people to see I mean I like the idea that that you're talking earlier the idea that a woman can competently raise children without a man around it's just taken for granted now it's absolutely not true matter of essential to the healthy raising of children but the idea that we would recognize that as a society is just we're just the disposable it's also a very unfortunate situation when in Garcia feminism that a lot of people are dealing with their own personal experiences that they've had with a few asshole men in their lives in regards to them not being sexually attractive or not moving into a certain social group or not and then they have somehow or another extrapolated that that all men are pieces of shit and rapist or a massive amount of them need to be curbed and laws need to be changed and if you get drunk with a girl and you have sexual earlier a rapist right I mean and a lot of this is based on their own negative interactions with men and the stereotype of feminism unfortunately is like there's a meme online this is feminism and it's a woman who has a the political holding up a sign saying I'm a feminist and she's fucking 300 pounds and you know and everyone's like yeah that's feminism you know like this is yeah you're right it's a big fat I'm gonna go they don't want to fuck that's really unfortunate but the person the type of person that is a large unattractive woman is gonna deal with an immeasurably it's gonna be so much harder for for her to find people were sexually attracted to her for her to find healthy relationships for her to if you it's an unfortunate reality in this world is that if you are not sexually attractive you are not gonna have as easy a ride when it comes to the opposite sex it's just a fact well I mean but sexually attractive in 300 pounds I mean somebody who's 300 pounds is for most people gonna be sexually unattractive but if they should lose weight and exercise that's sort of a different matter that just kind of a basic human confidence but one of the things that I thought of like I grew up with a single mom and and we lived because single moms we used to be broke right I mean because it's a test wife and so when I grew up with a single mom everyone around me had single moms as well you know what's interesting is that the kind of men who float through single mom world they're not always the best kind of man right they're kind of trashy right because it's like the really competent and successful and intelligent men aren't falling the girlfriend problems of the single mom you know though rent housing get ups right right and so I think what happens is a lot of these women have grown up in single mom households or or in this sort of environments and Sue who with the men who floating through that they tend to a canapé losers they tend to be pretty unstable they tend to be kind of parasitical they're you know they don't tend to be very the very best specimens of masculinity and so I think the breakdown of the family has created an environment where a lot of girls growing up don't have a positive male role model in their life and the kind of men that they see floating through their moms bats tend to be kind of trashy so they're like well this is masculinity it's also very unfortunate that in the criticism of masculinity you've removed a lot of allies you know bye-bye blanket generalizations of men you removed a lot of people like myself who I can't support you on that even though I'm the entirely Pro human being and pro-equality but when you make these mass generalizations and call some of the men's right advocate asshole like that these these are nonsense statements and it's unfortunate that I guarantee you these and it's not saying that all feminism feminists are unattractive or all feminists or you know not not not sexually viable but I guarantee you almost all of them have had a lot of negative experiences with men and it doesn't mean that all men are negative and it doesn't mean that there's not people out there that you would assume would be assholes that are actually very nice people but you've got this this idea that's it's easier to define the world by these rigid dimensions that you've sort of set up for yourself and when I when I when I read things that are from this and it's point of view they're so often aggressive and it's so often and I get that there's a blowback I do get that I get that they've experienced marginalization they believe that you know society is set up to support rape culture and all these strange ideas and that there's a blowback to it but I don't think that the way it's being handled is I think it's I don't think its objective I don't think it's irrational and I don't think it's balanced and I find it really weird when really intelligent people attach themselves to these feminist ideas yeah and and but the problem is you know in Canada here I had a guy on my show a great guy bill Gardner who wrote the end of the family and he pointed out that there's a revolution that occurs I think that initially is necessary and I think this is also with blacks in America too there's a revolution that occurs that is initially necessary but the whole point of a revolution is to define itself to end right so yeah I mean there was stuff that needed to be done obviously we talked about this earlier with blacks in the 60s and some stuff with women is kind of different right so because women there's always been those women and children first right like the vast majority of the people who died on the Titanic were men offering up their lifeboats to women right because there has been a sort of women and children first and women have been kind of elevated there was no black people first in the south right it went there so it's a little bit different but there was I think some push for equality that needed to happen but then what happens is you get a lot of people who get heavily invested in this call us and they becomes their ego their identity right like I fight for black rights I fight for women's rights and sewing but then what happens in society you will often listen and respond in a positive way and then what happens is that course begins to diminish and people are like you know supporting like I'm not gonna support to the abolitionist course because slavery is ended like I just not going to do it I it's over I mean there maybe are the problems but that's not the problem right like I don't I don't support a lot of you know that's let's deal with polio victims because we've got this vaccine and we don't really have polio victims anymore right so the whole point of revolution is to defund itself to end for people to move on with their lives but what happens is when you have a government you get these voting blocks and you get like in Canada over the last 10 or 15 years Canadian governments giving three hundred and million dollars to feminist groups that's not coming from Canadian women or Canadian for that matter cuz you know a lot of its kind of be dealt with but these groups continue by by poking these scabs by continuing these grievances and by finding the Trayvon Martin situation blowing it up into a race war and all this kind of stuff a lot of the stuff has been dealt with but because the government's still given the money they still need to whip up these kinds of hysteria but just to justify their own existence I mean the whole point of revolution is to end the whole point of I want to deal with measles it's get a vaccine and end measles you don't take in the same amount of money a year after year but if you have a government funding it then you have to manufacture these grievances which just keeps things going again with the point of revolution is a resolution yeah and this resolution never seems to come play it's never gonna take place if your approach is imbalanced and there's just some things that are being some proponents of feminism there are endorsing one of them being the ability to withdraw consent equals rape the the ability that you mean after the fact after the fact yeah that's insane you consented he doesn't like me giving you my coffee and then charging you with theft when you walk out the room yeah take my coffee Oh office like he stole my coffee because I changed my mind after the fact like he left all the idea is that a man can lie to a woman in order to get in bed with her and then if she can prove that he did that that she then he's a rapist because he tricked her with his words yeah because of course women never lie I mean they don't use makeup they don't puff up their tits they don't ever falsify anything to elect a man because he's wealthy and hope to get pregnant with them either I mean I don't see any feminists that are decrying that and that's a that's a horrible affront to womanhood to think that the only way that you can make a living is to lie to a man and make him get you pregnant so that you can get money from him from then on I mean with feminists true feminists should be horrified by that that represent will focus on the false rape accusations yes they saw straight I picked accusations which in some studies are 20 30 or 40 percent study on the Air Force but they actually even women who've withdrawn their accusations 20 30 or 40 percent of rank written accusations in some studies who knows what it is universally are false I mean how horrendous is that and women should be coming down so hard on women who make false breaking great accusations because they make it so much harder for the women who actually have been right because then there's that problem or false paternity and the problem with false rape acquisition is a very few women face repercussions for them in my book if you can you accuse someone of a crime and you lied you get the punishment they would have got you this football player has recently been released he got on tape this girl admitting that she lied about him being him raping her and her family received a million dollars for $850,000 and now they you know they have to pay the money back but that's the extent of her punishment this guy went to jail for five fucking years you know and now he's trying to Reaper sue than what anything have that we would still be there well not only that is just one of many I have three friends that were falsely accused of rape I also have friends that were raped I know that there's I know rape is real you know I have friends at have been roofied and you know got out of danger because someone recognized and the drug it's not it's very common you know rape is a disgusting horrible anti human crime and I think rapists should be treated the same way as murderers you're you're denying someone their humanity you're doing you're taking away something some part of them you're removing a part of what who they are as a person it's kind of permanent yeah somebody's you can get a new car but there's something about sexual violations that it's kind of a permanent it's horrible but so is lying about it that's horrible - lying about a rape is just as harmful other bluffing to get a man raped yes yes and this idea of this idea of withdrawing consent you know and that's somehow or another you can do that and turn a guy into a rapist that's that's like hating thing that's a you know what you're doing is you're you're you're hating someone who's manipulative you're hating someone who can con you into bed but that's been what men have been trying to do since the beginning of time like you're heating in the game of courting a woman and there have been men that wear shoes that were they would never wear and watches me would never buy and cars they don't give a shit about an apartment that they decorate just to get the woman to believe that they're like this it's all a lie my friend Brian who you saw earlier tonight last night first show Bryan Callen so hilarious guy the first time that came over his house back when he was single he had Jack Kerouac on the road sitting on his my table opened up like a phantom and I you know I'm a predator so I come over as how's my bitch you ain't reading that you know I find weakness in people very quickly so I saw that I go you're not fucking reading that I go you're hoping a chick comes over and she sees that she's like oh my house to pretend I'm smarter than I am I did that there was a Stephen Hawking book a brief history of time or whatever right and I had that on my yes and this woman I loved her to death we went out for a while this woman came over and she's like I quote bullshit and she what she went over and she opened it and it creeps like an old boat spine was completely yeah we lie we pretend you know I've always I have this thing that I say people and I think a lot of thumbs we lie and pretend big part of us because we're not happy with who we are we're we're not really and we'd like to be we would like to wish that we were someone better I always tell people be the person that you pretend to be when you try and get laid you want to really be an admirable person be the hero of your own story and be the guy that you pretend to be when you're trying to get laid and if you can find people who love you for who you are I mean my god isn't that easier problem with the pretenses you know it's fine in the moment but man you got to keep that shit up that's a lot of work and you have to love yourself too in order to be loved if you have all sorts of flaws that you don't fix and you don't like various aspects of yourself that you don't correct what normal person they're normal and they're sensible mind would want to engage in a long-term relationship with some of this incredibly flawed knows it and does nothing about it like that sounds like a nightmare that's all like taking on a dog that shits all over the house you know you're you're just taking on a giant problem you got to fix this person and some people do do that they take on projects yeah you know I mean I have a friend of every fuckin girlfriend dates is always broken and they can never see that you've what you your problem is your own life is a mess and you don't want to deal with that so you bring people into your life that are more fucked up and you could fix some of their problems give them advice yeah you constantly give them advice are you gonna fix them but fix yourself bitch and if you did fix yourself you wouldn't want these people in your life like if I date a 300-pound woman the fact that I'm 280 looks better yeah so I have to diet right yes I could smolder all right next day yeah I mean I think that that is a huge part of what's wrong with people in relationships what's wrong with a lot of people in relationships is internal it's what's wrong with you what are you bringing into a relationship until you are happy with who you are until you're you're just a reasonable person who's objective about your own actions and objective about your own path and life and enjoying your own path in life you're not worthy of a healthy happy relationship you haven't gotten your own shit together yet well this is terrible I think dichotomy where you know women get married to guys hoping that they'll change and guys getting hurt to women hoping that they won't you're not gonna cut that long hair are you like when you have kids are you gonna keep exercising right you're still gonna look great right and all that and I mean the idea that you with someone in the hopes that they're change it's just completely insane it's like buying a Buick and hoping it's gonna be a vote I mean it's not you thought about time to thing into a boat it's ridiculous well there are a lot of women who'd like to do that though we like to pick some change again yeah decorate him and he's gonna be just great it's a throw things out look where's that what does that book I shouldn't read that what or you know there's still three atoms holding my underwear together how dare you put them in the garbage I have a friend and his girlfriend he went to the bathroom and his girlfriend was confronted by my other friend's girlfriend about the kind of car he drives because he drove a sports car and he had a Ferrari he's a wealthy guy and the the the girl from was like why'd you let him drive that car yes that was her words like your guy driving a car like that it's like you know he's like he's like why do you let him have that college she was correcting him because she was concerned that her boyfriend might get ideas like hmm I can get a car like that too is my friend so she wanted to what she was worried about her and she did it in front of her man like two check in she went to this girl and was correcting her situation over a fucking car I mean it was like despise you've got time don't you have shit to do with your life rather some control to manipulate and if she was incredibly manipulated this woman and you know those those people are not in my life anymore but this woman was incredibly manipulative and she she would the guy was a like a wealthy strong guy but for whatever reason this attractive woman came into his life and just started dominating him she didn't work for everything and she wouldn't let him do shit she she chose everything that he did she dressed him she bought clothes for him and he was not allowed to buy a sports car she's not the same be great about having a sports car but I don't understand if you're gonna be a capitalist I'm gonna be a materialist which they clearly worried this big giant house she'd would buy whatever the fucking car you want if you really gotta bust your ass snorts twelve hours a day I'm not saying there's any great honor or nobility and buying a Ferrari and if you really want a Ferrari and you've got a lot of money buy a fucking Ferrari who gives a shit that reminds me best moment in your Peter Joseph interview because I'm we're doing it I'm doing debate with him on Monday ah because we have slightly different ideas about how the future should go and we have a debate and as I listened to your new show with it which is really enjoyable and I love the bit right he said you know you know they could make better cars you know like the Ferrari they could make that better you're like no they absolutely could not make that car any better than it is anyway something like that was like I mean that's the pinnacle of human engineering I better shut the fuck up yeah like I mean unless you're gonna have like an angel's wings and wheels that you cannot improve that car that's about as good as you get yeah that's that sort of silly socialist ideology where you don't vet your facts out before you start blabbing you know you can't say you can make a better Porsche no they fucking race the 24 Hours of LeMans they compete against the best cars in the world they brilliantly engineer these be- guys live up the update for the porsche is the fucking teleporter in Star Trek there's no better way to get around that right when people talk to me like that if they can make a better cart no they cannot stop you don't know what you're talking about you don't know the history of what you're saying you what you're doing is saying something that goes along with your ideology you would like it to be true yeah because it would make you more brilliant make your points but if I have to bend facts to meet your theories that makes it brilliant right they might be a slave to the facts right he's got a great thing going on he's got a really interesting thing going on but it's very culty you know there's a lot of there's there's a lot of cult enos to that and it's also it all falls out the window when you realize he's a stockbroker he was for accident like he still does it so he makes his money really yes he's a day trader doesn't he get people that like rip out their kidneys and email them to run a call he's a very smart guy yeah and I don't think he's finished yet but yeah he's quart of sort of a frustrated musician and a day trader yeah very bright guy no and Mark said play the stock market at marks Bank is made and then kicked her out when she had a baby because you know exploiting the working-classes it's really bad yeah exactly just do it as well as the capitalist that's my problem there's a lot of those guys out there that become intoxicated with the attention that you get from having good ideas you know and that's it's a real common occurrence in human nature whenever someone gets to talk to people listen and go you're amazing I'm amazing you don't go hmm does that person just dumb I need more of you all the smart people out the room I move you and your second cousins especially if you've bred together bringing your children they'll just fit right in I'm always the first point out that every single thing that ever comes out of an office essentially just some things that I've read thank you very humble about that like you openly say like I'm not smart enough to understand this I don't really get that but she's in my thoughts and that is important yeah because I mean nobody has the answers the best I mean I like what Socrates did the best you can do is provoke thought I mean how many answers have we given to people in this conversation yeah not really many times I don't get your kids yeah that's one reason with your kids maybe you stay home with them if you can any kind anyway this one yeah but but those are sort of make that such common sense that this work that's a fortunately but big answerís you know man I think you always really worry about that you know the immoral instructors have mankind that usually complete control freaks and assholes i 100% agree I think it's almost impossible I think we all together can work things out by talking and and exchanging ideas and exchanging opinions and agreeing and and seeing each other's points of view I think we could help that way we can all help each other but the idea that one person is gonna be the mall of moral authority of the voice of wisdom it's a very dangerous position it really is I've been there's a few things that I'm comfortable saying people shouldn't do yes but outside of that I have no idea yeah I'm just gonna make you the happiest in life I mean yeah don't steal don't kill don't break no yeah fine fine fine how many people really do that not many right right but actually how people should live I mean man if they stopped pointing guns at each other we're gonna stop having these crazy law stuff throwing people in jail for the wrong bits of vegetation I think that would be a great step forward you know let's just stop pointing guns at each other get stuff done outside of that no idea what people should do to make themselves happy I'm not even sure myself right I mean yes if there is a well what should I do with my day that's gonna make me the happiest all right it's nice to have to choice over that right but as to one other people should do you know who they should be with and what careers they should follow I mean that's really it's impossible it's hard to know it's a very important point you bring up that especially because there's so many things that people like that I don't there's so many things that I like that people don't like I've got really really intelligent friends that go why do you like this mixed martial arts stuff I don't know I just do I like it I understand that it's it's controlled violence I understand that it's a it's disturbing for some people to watch but to me it's been a part of my life since I was a boy and I you know I find it incredibly fascinating sorry you don't it's okay you know you know and by the way the people that I've met that are mixed martial artists the fighters are some of the nicest people I've ever met in my life and one of the reasons is that they've conquered their ego to a certain extent and that they have a much better control over because their being checked over and over again on a daily basis in the gym Oh discipline is highly underrated virtue I think it is me more highly rated discipline I mean their discipline to to say when you're wrong that you're wrong I mean that's what bothers me so much about people is this lazy edges of their permission slips you know like it I was when people do like really stupid shit part of me is just like how is that how do you give yourself permission to do that yeah like how is that how is that on your list of possible things to do and still be happy about yourself or or even look at how is that you know I hit my kid I how is that like how is that even on your list of possibilities like how do you have to look why would you say no I'm not gonna do that like not the discipline to not do it that seems to be pretty obvious very underrated aspect of being a man of being a human is having a code that you live I said self discipline like I mean the guys who get up at 5:00 and work out and stuff like that maybe you know the other day I was like yeah like most people like I'm kind of tired should I work out or have a nap you know and you know part of you is like yeah so just that kind of discipline is is really lacking we I think we used to have a lot more of it when we were really confronted with nature a lot more but now we live in this noisy city where you can get everything 24/7 it's all easy to come by and so on and we've got Kenna and the materialism to me comes with the laziness and the laziness comes with the death because we talk about national dances on I mean in America and to some degree it's almost as bad in Canada to people like have debts way bigger than their income and it's kind of laziness to you like what's with the deferred like why not to first and gratification you know they're gonna study on kids it's called the marshmallow study they take four-year-olds and they send them down they say you get have too much manners now sorry you can have one you care you can have two marshmallows now or you can have four marshmallows if you have too big if you have one now and wait there's take two now well know that some of them that that will defer real and there's some of them that won't and they're the fact these kids through life and they find that consistently those who are able to defer gratification just to a hell of a lot better I bet you there were times when you got up to do fear factor and you're like if there's one thing I don't want to do today its beer back there is that what you want no but I mean the discipline to just get up in here I mean important what Woody Allen says you know 90 percent of success is just showing up that's kind of just having the discipline to do it when you don't feel like doing it the deferral of gratification I'm sure with the training there's time in with your ass kicked or you pull them on something just like while I'm gonna go back and do it all this time so like that cheesecake looks like I'm drooling like a tsunami here but you just don't do it and I think that kind of discipline so you say that the fibers are like really great guys I think it's because they probably really work that muscle of discipline to the point where they have a courage they have a set of personal responsibilities and they don't let themselves step outside of that and so there's a kind of security and people who have a lot of discipline in whatever field it is that they're working in I really like being around people who've got a lot of discipline because you know they're not just gonna do some random shit it's also inspiring to me yeah I like being around people that work hard yeah that makes me feel like I should get things done to some people accomplish things around you and they're they're they experience joy and success and and they experience this feeling of like how I did it I pulled it off that's inspiring it makes you want to do the same it makes you want to and the more things I accomplish and the more things I do well the happier I am and this person I find as a direct correlation do you have a plan I know you've said yes a little bit you know grab what you can as far as your career goes and a little bit on the less than planned side but do you have a sort of an idea of what you want to go five years you know ten years kind of thing no good yeah I I'm here lists are overrated right yeah well I'm here you know what I'm doing right now I love I really I like to keep doing it my plan is to continue to do it but but if I if everything maintained exactly where it is right now I don't think I would do anything differently I think it would continue to work on my stand-up I continue to do the commentary for the fights I continue to do podcasting and I enjoy all those very much I continue to try to be the best father I can continue to try to be the best husband I can all that good stuff but other than that no I don't have any plans my plans are just to enjoy life and I enjoy very much my plans were to maintain that enthusiasm and that happiness the joy of life and spread as much of that as I can inspire people if I can and just inspire people by enjoying myself as other people have inspired me by enjoying their lives I'm inspired constantly but people love their craft by people who love their profession but people love what they do this is very infectious you know so that's that's the only goal than I am and that's I mean it that's sort of the definition of a happy life that if it continues the way it is yeah that's pretty damn good yeah you know and maybe grows and maybe maybe gets I would like to get better and everything that I'm doing that I enjoy but you have to like an jiu-jitsu you don't maintain you get better in comedy you don't maintain you get better you continue to focus on it and you learn from your your past experiences you're going to improve if you apply intelligence and focus to anything you're gonna get better at it there's it's not like you can become a master at comedy even if you are a master you know you call yourself a black belt in comedy there's there's there's a room there's always room this room in jiu-jitsu there's room and martial arts there's room and everything disciplines with no limit but you can't ever say there's at the end it's no end it's never ends there's no there's no like you're never a total master it's not possible I mean you you can teach and you you have a certain amount of math like there's certain moves that I can teach someone in jujitsu but could I teach you jiu-jitsu mastery hmm yeah something you have to like sort of pursue on your own and most likely you'll never achieve you might have a master you might be masterful over one particular skill level but then someone else come along that is much more skillful than you and master you you know it's it's it's a constant series of levels and it's fairly infinite and then there's also you know the physical challenges and you know athletic ability and all sorts of intangible that different people bring to the equation but I think that in pursuit of those things is where you find yourself and that they're really the interesting aspects of it is the the growth that you achieve in those things whether it's through the growth in writing or comedy or anything difficult those things matter first itself it manifests themselves in the risk of your life as well you get better at everything yeah that's what it asked you is there a dream guest for your podcast that the attacks McKenna he was alive and his brother on it was a fascinating guy the dream guests I think I've heard he had I know I mean I would like more of the same you know Neil deGrasse Tyson was great he was one charismatic guy he and I once you know it's great to have someone front and center rational thinker putting it after the masses that a beautiful Manor team from tool was great Graham Hancock there's so many great guests I did I just I enjoy doing it I enjoy just talking to be but I think it's it's broaden my perspective immensely to be able to have these kind of conversations thank you and I sitting down here for hours just chatting I think that's a it's really difficult to pull off in the real world you know and yes we're agreeing to have a podcast it's really hard to just set aside three hours what we're just going to talk it's hard oh it's an incredible privilege I mean I feel incredibly fortunate to have the opportunity to have conversations like this all other people that do on my show I mean you know what I but it's gonna be a dad I got all the parenting experts in the known universe to come on my show it's like whoo you know so I get to learn that how do people get to learn I mean it's an incredible privilege and this technology that makes it possible and then you tomatoes it's fantastic yeah that like look how little we're using here you have a camera setup and thank goodness you have a backup record yeah yeah first 27 minutes we didn't even get this and that was the gold stuff bang but this is just a little piece of you know electronics and it's plugged into the wall and that's it and maybe a million people will hear this a million really because each one of my downloads is over a half a million right at the minimum I'll shoot a million can we start again them because I would see like a little rusty yeah but is that how many times you've been no stand-up comedy show before oh I used to do a lot I mean I used to go to a lot when I was in the business world we'd have clients come up and I'd always want to take it to a comedy club because it sure beats a movie right yeah and so I used to go see a lot of comedy I did a little bit you know just an amateur shit when I was oh you did yeah the mics and yeah just open mic stuff and they it wasn't really my thing but it was fun to go up and try I was like doing that sort of stand on the cliff edge thing yeah but I I love stand up I think I think what you guys do is like fantastic I think it's just a real ray of sunshine in human life and what you give is you give permission for people to be to be funny themselves to have fun and to the joy that you guys have one of the things I love most about stand up either the braking bit and you did it a couple of times last night well you did something that's so funny that you yourself found it funny because maybe it was unrehearsed or somethin taenia so you had a thought because that's seeing somebody have joined the moment is really really enjoyable there's some people that do like fake brakes and they laugh at their jokes a fucking billion times in a row and every time you see them they laughing at the same way it's kind of gross but last night I was working on a bunch of new stuff so there's one of the reasons why I thought it was so funny yeah and I mean you know going back and forth with the crowd I mean it's it's really amazing to see the the energy that you have I think people don't see the kind of energy that a really energized stand-up comedian hats they may see it in a rock show you know but this is the lead singer or some Freddie Mercury stuff or whatever right but when you go to see stand-up you see somebody who's really putting out a lot of energy and I think it reminds people that they can begin canvas and they don't have to be like these dull embers which most people trudge through their days and their cubicles and whatever I just dragged themselves over and what I think seeing people really energized it reminds you that it's this moment it reminds you that did you can be energetic that you can be powerful that you can be commanding that you can be generous because stand up coming up comedy is is very generous in my opinion because so vulnerable I mean you out there like I may be gonna get a lot for not you know like I did acting and I didn't do much comedy did some but I mostly did like the serious stuff and if the theater is quiet you could just pretend that there really moved and you know crying and all this sort of stuff but if you're going for laughter I mean it's there or it's not it's hanging out there right and so I think I'm not gonna tell you your job because of course you know it a million times better than I do but what I really love about the stand-up is just that openness - honestly the vulnerability and the energy it's funny that you call it generous did a lot of people think of it as selfish because we you're the only reason why you're being vulnerable because you're hoping that you're gonna get a laugh you know you're yeah but you kind of make little of the life has to come honestly yeah right I mean if you bomb nobody laughs out of generosity right and if they do it's haha yeah or like hecklers come out of the woodwork in the US like then you're fighting a losing battle and all that no I do I view anybody who provides the services of vulnerability when you're out there selling your CDs of the street poets as a vulnerability and so I view it as a very generous thing instead I've come between is to of course you get paid and you know cost you nobody that's not like self sacrifice you enjoy what you do but the audience has to know that you really care about them having a good time in order for it to work I stay around after the show and take pictures with everybody helicopter to your lair tunnels or whatever you do that to me is part of the the generosity idea yeah I think it's important it reinforces the relationship that I appreciate them very much and you know I'd be happy to take pictures with them and if it takes an hour and a half out of my day after the show's over and that's great fine I need to lie down the show I actually put in work that's always the prep if you don't I get yeah well right now I'm working on a lot of new material so right now there's a lot of writing involved during the day the day of a show I like to sit down in front of my computer for at least three or four hours and write because it really like fires up all my synapses and coalescence all these ideas together and then before the show I write things down physically in longhand form but like the day they're like all the stuff that I wrote about the Toronto Mayor with all that house I wrote that the day of okay that was all new material that I wrote specifically because of the silly guy I thought I had that's crazy yeah it's amazing it's a lot - good stuff I'd forgotten about him because you know I try to blank out on politics as much as I know it's like the endline fluff in the wind it'll sting your eyes with that smile I prep I feel like I can definitely do shows without that I mean I can just to a show would not you know I have enough material I just go to a show right now like you know who open that door there's a comedy club get on stage and it'll work out but to do it best I have to prepare I have to write especially when the materials new there's like a lot of stuff that I have to make sure there's certain tag lines I have to remember and it's like there's so much memory involved in somebody paths that have to and then there's also experiments I have to figure out what's the right path like sometimes I'll open up with this and then I'll close with that like you know like last night I closed a lot of stuff on being a vegan though that's I would give the last line away by that last line with like a brand in my head I like thought about that all the way I would you go see the show if ya listening to this but that last line was like that was the perfect choice for me oh thank you well that's how you want to end it yeah leave him wanting more yeah um I wanted to ask you because I I this is something that I asked of pretty much anybody who I think is a thinkers like looking at this crazy life do we live do you have do you have a positive outlook for the for humans for culture do you think you think that we're gonna work this out do you are you a voice of doom guy or you do you think like you know what I think this is actually moving in the right direction ultimately yes most important question they give you one way I think that the world will go how the most important and energetic people will make it count right so I don't believe that I'm along for the ride I I am NOT a big movement in history kind of guy you know like big aliens remarks is sort of you know bullshit and technical but they all believe that that he's being historical movements and you know the the the zeitgeist and this and that and the other and we're all just kind of along for the ride like you know egrets on the back of the hippo I don't believe that I believe in the single great willpower individual theory of history that when people who have ability and intelligence and passion commitment they're the ones to make the world go in a particular direction right founding fathers didn't did it one way and it went I think it a pretty positive direction you know once the slaves and women got caught up with the oil than or equal tend of thing it went in a pretty positive direction you look at Rhodes Pierre and the reign of terror in the French Revolution had been in a very bad direction if you look at the Soviets of the Russian Revolution in 1917 the Lenin & Company have been in a seriously bad direction have killed like 70 million people in the Soviet empire right but these are all individuals all individuals with particular abilities making choices so I don't believe that the world is going to get better unless people who can make it get better I think in entropy as things get worse right I mean the the lowest common denominator and the worst demagogues tend to take over but you can really fight against that I'm a single hero theory of history like you just you take a stand as best you can and you shine that light as bright as possible and then most people will simply go one way or another based upon the willpower of the individuals that they listen to and and the clarity and the focus and humility of the people they listen to so I think that it goes the way we want it to go but it's not going to go there unless we make it go to a better place I think you're right I think that's a brilliant way of putting it too I think we do get energized from others and the people that do have power and influence do have almost an obligation to energize people with ideas yeah look if if you know how to do the Heimlich and someone's choking on a fishbone go help that person know you know if you can swim in someone's drowning go help that person you have ideas to make the world better you think you'll go to express them yeah I mean there's I mean I don't believe in unchosen positive obligations like if you choose a contract then you're bound by that contract I don't think you have to but you're kind of a dick if you don't you know like if you're like oh I don't wanna give that guy tracheotomy because this ravioli is really good even though you could and save the guy's life it's not like you should be thrown in jail for that but it's really douchey you know and I think if you have verbal abilities and you have skills and you have energy and your education and you have some capacity given now how easy it is to to broadcast to the world by God you've kind of kind of owe it to the future you know cuz all the great stuff that we was people putting themselves on the line in the past you know all the great like the freedoms we have to the political freedoms all people fighting hard and a hell of a lot harder than we have to fight you know the guys of the the founding fathers they faced down the British Army for God's sakes they could've got muskets through the head right musket balls through the head what do we got home maybe some people might say bad things about me online it's not exactly Joan of Arc stuff right so we have an incredible platform we have so little downside to to bringing light to the world that that's what drives me every day it's just I want and especially again when you come at dad you really your your whole timeframe extent it's not about your life it's about how my daughter is gonna have lived me but like 40 years I hope right 50 years and it really is about I just can't let the assholes take over because assholes love to do to be in charge right and the problem is good people to want that bossy because good people like living that live and you know I don't want to be in your face and in your business and you know what I can accept but also is love to be in charge and they keep congregating at the top of power and I don't want to be in the top of power I don't want to be a politician I don't want to have power over others I think that's the ring has to go in the fire there's another way that to use it I agree and so the problem is that bad people are just anal and motivated and douchey and power-hungry and they just work like assholes to get power over others and good people are like well I don't want that power cuz I'm happy and I'm in love and you know I've got a great life inside where you don't want a boss everyone else around but we have through this technology we don't have to have political power to have an effect and we don't have to be a professor and teach maybe 5,000 people in that whole Korea or write some book that maybe 10,000 people read a million people can listen to this for what you and I spending a couple hours having a great fuckin conversation I mean what markers have we you know and we can do that now first time in history it's in chrome there's no burning at the stake there we're not getting burned alive as witches we're not being thrown into you know rushing gulags like Solzhenitsyn I mean we have this it's win-win we have a great conversation the world hopefully get some nuggets of wisdom and we turn the ship a little bit more towards delight I agree I think that's really Dennis all right thank you so much your
