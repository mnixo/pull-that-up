day's not bad and I'll see how I deal with it if anyone dies this whole thing has been completely fucking insane and you realize it yeah I know I want to tell you but you caught this madness his outrage culture right at the peak I think you you hit peak outrage culture thank you well people didn't give a fuck if you were making a joke you didn't give a fuck if you had no idea that that lady was black didn't give a fuck what your mental state was didn't give a fuck if you were on ambien didn't give a fuck if you were drinking didn't give a fuck if you want but they didn't care that you you sincerely apologized and did not didn't mean to offend you were cracking a joke about a woman it it was funny how they've mischaracterize didn't lied about it and added words to it yeah but yeah I like to talk about the tweak but yeah I seriously apologize to all whom I'm inadvertently offended and because they were offended for like it it wasn't even what they say they were because it didn't say that no but they think that I tweeted a said she looked like you know somebody and I never said anything about her looks it was a political tweet and it's just proof of how everybody's under mass mind control because they took a and of course I'm always interested in that you know you know that I'm a spy in control yeah I think about it self-imposed that's what I think I think people are under the wave of self-imposed mind-control I don't think it's like there's anybody poem you think you can get out of it no I don't think anyone's pulling the strings I don't think this is no I don't I don't think it's by design I think you're caught up in a wave of fear and paranoia and political correctness and I think one of the reasons why I attack they attack someone like you is first of all you're wealthy and successful and famous and be original you are beautiful thank you and one of the best comics of all time oh thank you and you're also you're you're an easy target you're a white woman well I don't identify as a white woman what do you identify us I identify as a Jew well there you go yeah and this is what you thought this woman was as well though she looks like my cousin Sharon she looks just like my cousin but it wasn't nothing to do with how she looks that came after my tweet but the most blasted about it was about the work of her hands what she engineered in Iran and I've been on there talking about the the I call it a woman's revolution in Iran for years and speaking to people in Iran about it and what it means to the women who are second-class citizens there and so if you take that one tweet out of like probably I tweet a lot yeah you know no I don't go crazy I stay crazy I admit it I mean what the fuck they're like you know what you've said you're crazy for years and you know what you're crazy well yeah I said it for years well it's also one of the crazy yeah all comics are fucking nuts Oh at least I don't wash my keys like some I know some guys they add they gotta wash their keys five six seven times where they can go onstage what's his name oh I'm so bad on names Chris Farley I always ask comics you know I asked him what's what's your secret number what's yours Joe well number you don't have a number no you don't have to do something a number of times you don't have a number what's your birthday eight eleven sixty seven eight what's that August 8 11 67 you were born in 1967 yes Jesus F Christ I was in the Mike I was in the Utah State Hospital when you were born what were you doing given birth no I was in a mental institution oh that was my first hospitalization it lasted for nine months and it was the Utah State Hospital improve oh where the Osmonds are from it's always a big Marie Osmond fan the the mental health aspect of this conversation is an important one because here's my take on this it's extremely important it is important and yesterday was Mental Health Awareness Day yes I know and I was quite aware of being mentally healthy yesterday as I was smoking if someone had cheese all I eat is cheese if someone has an injured leg you don't expect them to run marathons if someone has you know something wrong with their liver you don't expect them to process food correctly you don't blame it on them but if someone has a mental health issue and they do something erratic yeah or they say something that's inappropriate and then they apologize for it or if they're comedian or if they're comedian and you you've had legitimate real diagnosed treated mental health issues trauma related issues there you go so little I did they help you better can you yeah but for whatever reason people want to pretend that this is a deliberate act by a calculating person who is just being an asshole and that's not the case you're not actually not at this time huh I have been an asshole but you worried her but you weren't that's not what you were doing no I was talking about Iran and the woman's revolution there and how how and it's always been because you know what I had my DNA done because I wanted to know and I am of North African ancestry how much it's like a very small percentage but it was something like twenty five thousand years ago they left North Africa which is kind of Syria and they went to Lithuania and Russia and some Europe did you like 23andme or something yeah yeah and it just answered so many questions for you know why I feel this yearning towards that part of the world but I do you know and especially the geopolitics there are some have always intrigued me and I have always attempted to use my voice to you know support all the people there well it's a fastest so it was you know this one tweet was like about it was about I mean it's actually a genius tweet if you really fucking me what did you say what exactly did you say to us find the tweet Jamie I'll tell you if it's the artificially rendered there's an artificially rendered well yeah there's a lot of them what people distorted what you actually first it was racist Roseanne and then about couple weeks later it was disgraced comic Roseanne and her racist tweet and then after that it was disgraced comic and her offensive racist wheat because there's all these hoops you got to jump through you know they're never done punishing you well like we're saying before the man said don't apologize too social justice warriors because that's the kiss of death that's fucking chumming the water blood in the water you know it's definitely a little bit of that but what I was saying before the podcast to you is I don't I don't really what I really think happens is they find a target yeah and they don't care if it's a viable target but once the target gets greenlit they go after you until some new target comes along until the target and it's recreational outrage they find they attack you and they go after you and know what the fuck you said right and obviously they don't that's what kind of cracks me up is like they look at this look what they're saying it meant and you know I'm not going to bow down before them and say you were right and they want me to but they weren't right I'm right I wrote it bitch so I know what I meant so you don't forget to tell me what I meant but they don't care and that's the thing is they don't want to look at it rationally and say oh here's a woman that has a history of mental health problems she was on ambien and drinking and she says something that is slightly irrational but given your explanation of it you both always think all my tweets make no sense you've been saying that for the fucking year since I went on Twitter you're like her tweets are just button straight-up crazy well you have you crazy tweets for sure I don't think they're crazy you just don't get them well maybe if I was in the same mindset as you I would get him yeah but obviously no one when I say crazy I think they're I know I don't think like other people I know that I've always known that my whole life I'd always test other people to see what they were thinking like as even as a kid I'd be like you know but I try to fit in they go let's play Barbies you know and I'm like a fucking I don't want to you know I'm like okay well but let's have Barbie be a resistance fighter that paratroops into you know I into the hidden lines of the German thing and save all the Jews and they'd go you have to be her cousin skipper then they'd have me the skipper doll I always had to personify skipper and they got to be Barbie I didn't even know if Barbie had a cousin yeah skipper she has a little tiny too and I resented that because I always had very large pendulous breasts since I was four or five I did I don't I don't think or look like other people I am an alien really what planet you think you'd be from well somebody told matters from Pleiades do you know anything about that yeah that's the people that call our Bell show they would always say this yeah yeah Hades yeah they say round faces are from Pleiades see you got a round face that's what I told you I don't even go by what people look like except for I do look at the shape of their head I have to admit that's how I classify people I classify people my own way cuz I don't think like everybody else thinks I take a person's shape of their head and that's the group they represent to me and I have noticed that the Dutch have the largest head the big people the Dutch have pure score not all of them of course but some of them you know the average height for a Dutch person like 6 feet tall I know the way my huge folks yeah Vikings yeah Vikings yeah I love all the different peoples of the earth because they all have a variety of foods that I enjoy so I like to you know I don't just mix with one kind of person in my real life I mix with all kind of people and you know up I'll go anywhere for a free meal but I don't but I love I love cultures and I love all people that's all I want to say you know I wouldn't have I'm not that person so you're not you're not a racist by any stretch of the imagination but you are a person that is an through I'm a misanthrope you are a misanthrope but I'm a respect receive no man or woman but most comedians yeah we're all like that was a misanthropic intentions or you have to hate on people the same but you definitely have to mock and make them it's part of your job description yeah that mom can make fun of and you you look for things that are irritating about everything no shit right that's not only that that was part of your character on your show yeah it was part of the reason why ABC on you back it's part of the reason why the show became such a giant hit in its return I mean it was a fucking huge hit coming right out of the gate yeah 28 million people that's a lot of fucking panels number one every episode yeah that's a lot of people and a lot of that was because people love this aspect of you but as soon as you get labeled a racist everybody throws their hands up it goes whoa I didn't know she was racist she's racist and they don't care about nuance they don't care about the details they don't care about ambien they don't care about alcohol when I called you on the phone it was the first thing I one thing I've learned Joe if you're gonna take an ambien don't not do not drink a beer always only drink a wine yes with ambien I have a good friend of mine who is one of the nicest most respectful guys you ever want to meet he woke up in Germany on a plane covered in his own vomit with the police standing over him asking him if he knew what happened he wound up getting arrested they brought him to the the jail in Germany and they out and he's a CEO of a large company and they went over things with him and they said what happened what do you remember he goes well I remember taking an ambien and then I went to sleep then I had I guess I had a beer at some point in time and they go okay stop this is what happened and so they described how he was hitting on the stewardesses and trying to start fights with men in the cabin oh he's being as well free so wasn't his being his real self he was on ambien yeah I know a distorts things he's the nicest guy if you knew this guy you would never in a million years believe that he was capable of anything remotely like this and the German people actually let him stay in the country they let him continue his vacation they're like okay forgave and he promised not to do that again he was I'm never fucking taking that shit again in my life yeah and one of the things that I said to you when I called you up I said what were you doing well and you told me you were on ambien and I said okay we'll stop right there because I know quite a bit about that cuz I've had personal experiences with friends that have had real issues with ambien I had a bit I did in my act about a friend of mine who literally made a meal while I was on ambien cooked supported right what God food cool look at Tiger Woods that he was on that and then you'd go driving off in the golf cart to meet some chick you know and that I don't understand what people said they have sex on ambien people say that's a big thing that people take ambien to have sex I don't even know how they can stay I thought yes they don't stay awake but another part of them wakes up and they're sex part comes out that's all I can figure I've never taken it I'm terrified of this don't ever take yeah I did no I have no problem going to sleep I've never had a price but you know what I found is THC they sell it down it the dispensary and there's one for sleep at night yeah I've been doing that and I've been sleeping through the night when I was taking the sleeping thing to sleep and drug ambien well I don't want to say it cuz we don't want to get some eye candy man you know I say it three times you don't get sued not me by saying ambien I bet you they give a fuck did you see that did you see that yeah well you know I had Hamilton Morris on the podcast who was a drug expert yeah and he writes for vice and it does pieces for Vice and he went I just did a piece for Vice after your incident he came on and went in great detail about how there that that is something that happens to people that were they have no idea what the fuck they're saying it's called a hypnotic that is the classification of drugs that it falls under and people do all sorts of involuntary things when they're on it no it doesn't just make you say racist things but you didn't say I think it's actually racist know about the work of Valerie Jarrett's hands and I also was referencing my very favorite movie so if we could talk about how fuckin awesome that movie Planet of the Apes great fucking movie also it's the definitive people get your come on people now it's not allowing you bud it's like come on it's like the hundredth monkey is that the thing is that the name of it yeah that's what it is the hundredth monkey on the typewriter is the thousand much what is it how does that work that if you have a certain amount of my hundredth monkey that changes everything right if B if if a species does something 99 times in a row the hundredth time it's gone into their DNA oh yeah yeah and then they evolve to a next level hundredth monkey effect this monkey effect it's a hypothetical phenomenon which new behavior idea is come claim to spread rapidly by unexplained means from one group to all related groups once a critical number of members of one group exhibit a new behavior or acknowledge the new idea yeah yeah well the thing is a lot of people put pictures of that woman no picture the picture was put up after my tweet I understand well I do I'm not gonna do with that picture I didn't say she looked like anything I seriously I'm not that fucking shallow okay I never talked about nobody's looks unless they're like thin and blonde and I'm jealous but you know and youthful now but or whatever wasn't there another tweet that you made a long time ago about who was that other woman Susan Rice yes yeah well you said she has giant swinging eight balls yeah that she's a man Wow let me explain that now because this is the regional istic regionalism I'm from Utah and all the girls in Utah when we got married and aren't we heard our moms do it - it's always where's your ape they go what's your ape doing this Sunday and he's like oh he's watching football all good let's go out to lunch you know is all of the men we're all Apes that's how it is in a breeder culture like Salt Lake City breeder called yeah it's like where's your ape and there's like man your ape has a big fucking swing and eight balls I give him that you know it's a regional istic thing and you know so I used it and apologized but you know I didn't really you know I just sometimes forget what race everybody is as if I could tell after time anyway I even see people to tell you the truth I need like bifocals trifocals and I never identified other human beings by what they looked like for God's sake I just could tell if I felt a liking to him you know whatever they look at my point is that there's only two things over the course of thousands my point I said Susan Rice let's say that she has she has incredible audacity that's what I meant and she does but you didn't mean it in a complimentary way if someone is audacious is that negative or positive we talked weren't you talking about her in a negative way though I said she has a lot of audacity that's what I meant mmm okay she does whatever it was that's a lot but that was one that got brought up as well that was also in the middle of a huge conversation about you know Benghazi and the Iran deal those are the two things are two of the three things that I like to do on Twitter although I'm no longer on there you got off yeah bad for you yeah I was glad to see Kanye West got off two did he yeah what deleted all his accounts last week and I was glad to cuz you're just like once you're a target it's just too painful yeah well you definitely shouldn't be reading that shit no I don't read it yeah but well when you become a target how do you know if you don't read it well I'd know what I'd lived through when it first happened and that's been like four or so months ago so I just know how I've reacted in my locker real life since that happened to me how long it take for this die-off to die off slow down where they weren't just coming after you constantly like I told you that news crews when they found out that you were gonna come on the podcast the first time they were trying to show up at my house they were trying to show up at the studio they were trying to find me at The Comedy Store yeah I mean they were just trying to hunt down yeah anything about you I know I've sneaking cigs from my boyfriend at my mom's house when I did it you know we were at home in Salt Lake City when I tweeted at 2:11 am I just woke up into it I had this thought in my head oh my god this can make so much sense and then I tweeted it and I went right back to sleep and when I woke up at 7 this shit hit the fan you know yeah but I was like I'm going to expound on this later there was one of those kind of things right you just want to get it down and I you know always slept with my computer and tweet when I wake up like you know when you're old you have to go to the bathroom a lot saw his tweet and fall back to sleep see and I and then on the ambien tweets my daughter I used to always when I took my ambien I called my daughter and she or she called me she goes mom you you're starting to do the ambien tweets get off get off the Twitter you know but I saw I just called my daughter then every night when I when I was doing the ambien and I'd go you know what here comes a big fish she recorded it here comes a big fish right through my window oh oh he's getting stuck in the mirror and that's what she goes mom turn it all off I have my family telling me that I almost need her standing guard by your bed yeah hold on let me read that before you tweet it no no no that's what she does now she don't she took my Twitter account away will you sir program she tweets all these liberal things that I want to get just get up in her face and smack her around for not with you know on her own but I'm like how come it's okay for you to say this but it ain't for me well mother I didn't lose everything oh sorry trying to help you oh my god I hear for you and your fucking help sticks in your face is just this year a serious liberal they all off three and my daughters are serious social justice warrior types and what do they think about your positions well they think I'm a frigging crate they think I'm crazy they always did like you know they always thought all my choice for president were crazy but then oddly they were all very supportive when I personally ran for president in 2012 they were really supportive of me well you're there mom yeah that was cool but like all the other times it's like oh god mother it's your generation it's a baby boomers are the reason everything is all fucked up so stop letting yourself off the hook Oh political conversation that's in the bar household yeah oh yeah oh yeah what what was it that when you first got brought into a mental hospital what was it about well I had got hit by a car and the the hood ornament went in my head in my brains and scrambled them and I I used to be an a-plus math student I was just great in geometry oh my god I loved geometry I got straight A's and then you know I sort of fell apart after that took a long time to heal from it and you know how much did your personality change oh it changed drastically but you know you read all that stuff about traumatic head injuries now because I do read a lot and talk to a lot of football players who have the same thing and we do discuss it yeah you change right away yeah it's still you but it's like a it's kind of like an art 'el artificial intelligence you do you find that did you find that you became much more impulsive oh yeah yeah you know right well yeah here's what happened I was crossing the street on my way to school how old were you hmm I was 16 no it's 15 going to first week of high school and I was a big nerd and anyway I was crossing the street and it was the top of the hill and this woman girl she was on her way the University and the Sun blinded her and she ran me over and the rest is history how how long were you in the hospital for mmm so first he's must've been you must have been in a medical hospital first and then you were admitted to a mental hospital well there was about three months in between right but I was in the hospital for a while you know and I had a head concussion and a brain concussion and I had hamburger meat four legs so they did all these what do they call them skin grafts on my legs and yeah I was in there for awhile then I came out of there and I had forgotten everything about math when I returned to school where's matter of weeks after that maybe two months I I'm really bad on time now but uh and I had forgotten all my math and it was just terrible that was a big depressive depression I went into because I couldn't remember I couldn't remember things you know and also became way more impulsive then I was like I don't know what I did then I started going really out there into the ethers I went way out there like how so way out you know how you go way out do you ever go way out no I'm really I'm I've had a lot of head injuries oh yeah I've been into it not terrible mostly just punches and kicks nothing like car accident yes sir never played football yeah but my head injuries have you know they were just more of cumulative when I was young till I was about 21 22 I stopped stop fighting stop sparring mm-hmm but nothing but I definitely I'm subject to impulsive behavior still yeah keep it under wraps I keep it under control because I'm aware of it but when I was younger I didn't understand who's going on I would just be subject to whims very addictive behavior but I tried to keep it positive but I would be addicted to things addicted to doing things addicted games addicted like ridiculously addictive like spend 10 12 14 hours a day playing video games that sounds like my kid yeah just normal because video games are awesome but yeah it would be for me be everything martial arts pool whatever do is I'll just be completely obsessed with it and to be thinking about it all day in port where it wasn't necessarily healthy yeah just on a whim I would just want to go do something I just I almost had no control over compulsions mm-hmm you know and I think some of that is whatever brain injuries that I've had are very mild in comparison to a lot of people that I know certainly very mild in comparison to yours there was a lot of trauma in the State Hospital that you know I'm like you know being there and seeing and experiencing and how long nine months so what was it that they brought you in there for what was how are you behaving that they decided that you needed to be admitted I was out there you say that like what does that mean um I don't think there's any words the English you just can't understand didn't have a control of reality you didn't have control of your behavior your thinking was screwed up I was you know not thinking like the normal thing that they say you should be thinking about and but people around you had realized it that it was it was so bad that they had to admit you to a hospital wasn't just that Oh Roseann she's eccentric it was she needs actual medical help yeah I asked to be admitted do you knew something was really wrong yeah I finally admitted it was did you know at the time were you completely aware that it was connected to your car accident no you just knew something was wrong yeah and back then they didn't really kind of understand that the way they understand it now no they didn't understand too much about bipolar disorder or they knew nothing about multiple personality disorder trauma related traumas related yeah PTSD now they call everything pts yeah they don't even say Dee anymore they say pts mmm post-traumatic stress so when they admitted you what was the treatment like what did they do to you when you were inside the mental hospital well they right away put me on an anti-psychotic what was it do you remember Mallory what did that do I don't know I went in there there you were gone I was gone I was just watching these people I was in the mental institution with and I want to tell that story no cuz there was this one lady I think I told this to Paul Reubens - I think it might be where he got Large Marge there's a swine lady and she's in this cage you know if she's in a cage with keys on her ward there and Christ I can't remember her name either Marge her man was Marge yeah and she's about 600 700 pounds whoa and she's funnier than hell you know I thought good man this this chicks got some good lines you know and I it's traded lines with her and she'd laugh you know yeah you know I was like jokes you can always find a joke wherever you are you know that's the key to life I think but um so she oh everybody called me chunky that was my name chunky and there was another girl in there named shorty so it was chunky and shorty we were like a duo but anyway um so she's like hey Roseanne get what's-her-name's keys when they go to dinner and open this up here you know come in here and I'm like okay you know cuz you know after all I was crazy too and I don't like trust I don't know I just always I never questioned that there was danger anywhere I always got in trouble you know caught beat up something you know but uh so I did it you know and I can't Oh uncle that was her name the head nurse I hated her cuz she told me I needed to bathe I'll tell that story later it was horrifying it changed my life but anyway so they all go to dinner so I go in there steal the keys out of the thing where they are you know the attendants and not go in there with Marge and I leave the keys in the door and close the door yeah so I'm like hey Marge you know how's it going Marge ha ha and she's like chunky you know why they put me in this cage don't you take some joggers over I go what why no I don't know why well chunky it's because they consider me to be dangerous I'm like how calm I am I'm like Gomer Pyle seriously I'm total golden you're like 16 at the time 15 about 8 minutes into it I realized oh shit oh shit something's going on here that's how long it always took me like to zero in on what's happening guys I'm not even there you know I'm always ignoring when other people talk I don't listen funny thing you know yeah so I'm always in my own head I never get out really except for when I work but uh so then it got then it took a turn you know she's like um so it got to why do they consider you dangerous you know I had to ask it cuz she kept on getting me there to that point well she wanted me to ask it I was trying to delay it you know cuz I knew they'd be back in 40 minutes and it was like going on 20 now she goes I'm in here because that's my voice I got to do what Marjorie I'm in here because I broke a couple attendance bags didn't they tell you that like no my hat how'd you do that and in my head I'm thinking don't change don't miss a beat don't miss a breath don't look nowhere just to keep on act no you know Utah Utah girl did you knew she was dangerous well that's when it hit my head that it was hah oh she's talking about you know I'm a I'm feeling like prey right you know and I go how to do that cuz I figure oh it's an accident you know it's good ol Marge she sells good jokes she goes well it's easy you just know I'm doing me again I gotta do her it's easy you just put one hand here and one hand here and then you're like oh where'd you learn that I'm changing the subject 100 how was your mom what was a school like you went to put your favorite book what's your favorite color what kind of ice cream you like you ever seen that there's worms in the oatmeal you ever noticed that she started got that one got her she's like I did I did notice there's crawling motherfuckers I go yeah next fret dusting eat that this this one you know I like suddenly I'm transported to a confederacy of dunces when he's on the thing against Levi's pants remember that rant that book so I'm just tap dancing really and then I hear it click I grab I got up fumbled the keys out of the door put him back in the attendance room went my room when you said you hear click yeah I knew the first door got open there was two doors I heard the first door open and they're coming back from from dinner so you got away supposed to be sick you know in my room what so I didn't go to do yeah some is laying there and that was like daily I mean there were so many weird people in there we had this one girl Rosie her name was where she'd always grabbed she always end up with a pair of real sharp scissors and lunch for someone's throat where'd you get them springing her them scissors you know but anyway I went on my antipsychotic medicine and that was good that I was on there for the shade I saw nobody saving my friends hanging and stuff like that sorry friends hanging yeah in the mental institution so I saw worse than that would you say I I saw you know victims of abuse terrible by the guards know of kids coming you know Oh victims of abuse that came in that were mentally scarred like that yeah yeah now when they put you on antipsychotics was because you were exhibiting psychotic behavior last what kind of psychotic behavior while they thought it was psychotic I was just scared that they I think I was throwing them off cuz I wanted to think I was I caught it I didn't want to thank them to think I was schizophrenic I knew enough not to let them near me they if cuz what you got the once you got the diagnosis of schizophrenic they would or no shit shocks and they'd experiment on you basically you're a new guinea pig and I didn't want that so maybe I get you know and then you know so yeah I I was doing weird things like walking down the middle of streets after hit by the car I walk down the middle of streets I don't know I thought oh you gotta get over your fear of crossing the streets that's what was in my head and then I'd walk down a highway you know I was in a whole other realm it was like a real surrealistic and metaphysical realm and I I grew comfortable there but you know I think most artists writers and performers are in that world I mean we got a toe in it at least I've got in and out you know depending on you know now I think I'm on the right medications that help me there's a lot of comedians that have similar stories yeah some of the grades you know Kinnison has a similar story - you know he was hit by a car and changed his personality radically and it happened in a similar age it happened when he was young as well and he was one person then he get hit by a car and then after the car he's his wild man yeah wild didn't give a fuck Wow totally impulsive it's not that I didn't give a fuck it said I just thought different doctor I I was just um I don't know my mom says when I was 18 months old I used to go out in the street and direct cars we lived on a highway and you know that she'd come to find me there just 18 months all the holding up my hands Jesus Christ and stopping traffic it's always had a weird thing going there but uh you know I don't know I think I watched too much of that police show you know where they'd stop traffic I used to love TV shows and think they were real some of it how many people do you think know this about your mental health history you know anybody who knows me I don't think very many people know it that we're angry at you oh yeah they did I don't think they did yeah they did I think I don't think people look past the surface I think they looked at you as a rich white lady who said something that they considered to be racist and they decided they were gonna attack you and then the perception the optics of this it was the reason why ABC canceled the show the reason why it was ABC right yeah yeah it's the reason why they canceled the show is the reason why everybody pulled back away from you and what did that feel like when nobody defended you people who should know you the way I know you and I defended you from the very beginning because I said no my son told me I might thank you this is not a racist person I go this is a woman who's kind of crazy he's brilliant hilarious yes this is why I love you well you know they try to outlaw comedy that's what I think well I was surprised that more comics didn't say nothing because you know they I don't know they're scared people they're scared to support someone that they consider to be racist yeah I mean I got a lot of shit from it but I don't give a fuck they can think what they want and call me what they want it don't change me it doesn't change you well it just takes time before the dust settles and I knew that once I knew that once you and I talked if you and I sat down and talked like this people would get a chance to see who you really are you know well you know they may not like me I don't have to you're not a bad person you've never been a bad person no I'm not a bad person but I've done bad things and like I was talking to you know I'm a name-dropper i I hate to drop his name I'll but forgive me I should have asked him first but you know I was talking to Mike Tyson you know and he's been through some stuff and you're like well the thing is you got it you got it become a pacifist that's that's your only yeah don't battle with people don't know you can't battle with people back and forth on line you know I mean um there's too many people there's not enough time and you'll go crazy you'll get wrapped up in conflict and you'll just be involved in it every minute of every day yeah I call it feeding the beast yeah because that really is Tower of Babel Twitter well it's it's definitely a strange strange environment where all these people just they don't even know you they have no contact with you other than your this person they could reach and get to react to certain lines and the more explosive and the the the more derogatory and insulting the lines they say to you the more impact it's gonna have on you so that flavors the way they communicate with you yeah it was tough working with a lot of social justice warriors and remaking Roseanne it was tough on me mentally so when you mean like the staff that you were working with look I was the only one saying I'm not a Republican nor am I fucking Democrat I'm an independent and I'm just anti-corruption I'm just anti corruption don't don't make me into your idea of Who I am there's no idea who you were well they thought that since I support a president Trump that I was you know a racist in a scumbag and you know anti everything just cuz I voted for him why did you support Trump I love what Norm Macdonald said if I can quote him can I quote no please do it well says it better than anything he said the American people I hated Hillary so bad that they voted for a guy they hated even worse I just don't rub it in that is Norma Donald that's brilliant you know true I wasn't I wasn't for Hillary and I was a woman and that was like a big no-no right that's bellick basically comes down to yeah because it was a woman's turn but you know I'm anti I just want a government that works for the American people the type a taxes and I expect something from my taxes and you know here's news to all of them out there including POTUS I think it's some time the American people need to audit what happened to their tax monies and I think we should all have a say in what this country does with our hard-earned dollars and don't just assume you speak for us because obviously you don't or we wouldn't have a trade deficit of twenty trillion dollars so STFU and let the American people handle what they should handle in this country it's a republic and it's runs on the on the consent of the governed and it's really really time to talk about that now when you say social justice warriors that you had to work with like specifically what were the issues that you were dealing with well Trump was the big elephant in the room my support for Trump and they're just they're patronizing shite can I call it yeah well we have to remember that the I mean I'm gonna paraphrase but it was a lot well you know the ignorant unwashed people who voted for Trump it's not their fault that was kind of what it was like mmm and because I said well you know it was working-class people that elected Trump so I I really can't I can't let you say that to me cuz it's not true you know they already had in their head what it means and of course they are wrong like they're wrong about you know this being about a you know that cabin on being about abortion rights they're wrong about that too so you know how are they wrong about that cuz I don't think you know he said pretty much that you know you can't overturn something that's in law Roe vs. Wade yeah yeah but you know they fear monger to get everybody thinking that's what they were after and I don't think it is what they were I don't think that is why they wanted to I think they're concerned with anything that Trump's trying to pass anyone that Trump's trying to get to the Supreme Court any any bills at Trump's trying to boil and they should put on their adult pants and get involved and make sure that he represents you know the will of the people of this country you have to become involved in the process then but don't just sit there on your butt criticizing everybody and calling everybody names that that's really not any kind of a justice warrior that's all phony you got to get involved right now when you were first approached about doing a Roseanne relaunch when they came to you how did this all take place and did you get to pick the people that you work with I had already said about a year prior to that that I supported Trump over Hillary and it was like you know a big it was in all the papers in Hollywood help how could she and you know this and that the other but it didn't seem to bother the American people know my audience you know you know I always tried to make content for the audience not for the critics right and not for the industry not for the industry you know the industry is ruthlessly left like in down to the point where it's not even a thinking thing it's just like they automatically go left because that's the way you're accepted in this town that's the way you stay working that's the way you stay invited to all the good part that's the way that certain Stalinist types in show business keep it you know you know everything about the media is tightly controlled in Hollywood so when they came who came to you with the relaunch how did it how does it happen that they did a sketch on Sara's talk show and everyone liked it and Sarah called me and said she said John said he's in if you you know if you're in so you say Bob Johnson of course is Laurie yeah Laurie's in okay yeah let's do it so what who turned on you after this was over um well I'm my coven of lawyers advises I not get into this at this time that's you know I'd say it self-explanatory well people could find out yeah I don't know that they turned on me I think it was always that way since you know I came in and said I said somebody on the show has to be a trump supporter none of them would do it I'm like it's a great role you know yeah you could do it you're the kind of person who wouldn't pen they were like no so I said okay well then I'll do it because you know I did both for him and everybody knows it well people forget Archie Bunker it's one of the greatest characters in history sitcoms nobody wants to be the quote unquote you know other person a bad guy in Hollywood or you know be the other in Hollywood yeah but you know I I was up for it I thought it would be great I thought it would be you know I get some lines in there from the other side once in a while you know I let him say all they want to say I never told them don't say that about him don't diss Annette like the day of the filming you know I'd been saying you know I let my writers do their writing you know but I lay out all the stories or approve them you know and so it was that first show and I'm waiting for a line about Hillary I go I let you have seven Trump jokes in this show and you can't even one fuckin Hillary joke it didn't want a Hillary Joe no what was the Hillary joke do you remember I said you better get me a Hillary joke I did I go it ain't about you your name ain't on this show what did they say about it like why did they not want a Hillary joke did they have an explanation for it no but everybody knew they wanted Hillary yeah they felt it would go against their morals to say that there's another way to vote or to acknowledge that you know half the country voted that way or that she's extremely flawed well at that point they didn't care that's what's weird about it isn't it yeah things where there's a complete denial of reality that's like this is not there's nothing to do with women has nothing to do with liberals it is another you're talking about an extremely flawed person well I don't I'm not gonna talk about her as a person I just talk about her concepts and her voting a necklace not even used word person politician extremely flawed politician with a background of deep corruption and lies demonstratable lies like this we're not talking about some amazing gem you know well let's just put it like this a lot of us people who liked Bernie voted for Trump yes yeah well especially when they found out when Donna Brazil's book came out they found out what they had done to Bernie during the primaries yeah it's dark shit yeah it's dark that that just everybody was like whatever whatever they said nobody I'll vote for a Jew they do use that one hilarious in the cell to this day mm-hmm to this day they're still doing stupid shit like that but you know I didn't want her even though she's a woman but you know I did wonder in 2008 I wanted her not Obama cuz I liked her health care plan better at that time when I was still you know I had before I walked away so um you know they're doing a whole March I might show up a March for what walk away walk away from what the Democrat Party who is they who's doing this a whole bunch of kids youths and what's the October 27th that the cross from the White House they're gonna walk from the DNC to that Park there and make statements but walking away to wear to an independent party no they're they're Batarian they're going Republican Republican that's what's bizarre the polar opposites the right and the left to blue and the red and all those guys golf together let's cut through the bullshit they're all making deals and scratching each other's back whether from one party or the other come on well Trump paid Clinton to be at his wedding he did yeah while that smart you got a photo op and a half out it out night I mean he paid those people forever it's one of the reasons why when when he was campaigning they he had you know so much animosity towards them and towards the system that he was a part of for so long he was a Democrat most of his life I know well he's getting me he's getting it too but uh that just proves it right there you know you they give money to both parties you know in Hollywood they don't just get it the Democrats party together the Republican Party too but they stay silent about that well it's kind of smart to cover your bets you know which government contractor couldn't be able to dip into me and isn't that like what Hollywood's really all about well there's so many levels to it right I mean there's the the blatant tribalism of right versus left where people pick a side and they adopt a predetermined pattern or behavior and they adopt a conglomeration of I download the program yes yeah and they're just BOTS exactly they pair it and then below the surface you got geopolitical aspirations and you have the global war machine yeah yeah I'm that's that's what you have the the money the real money but you know what Joe I always say and people call me a pea and whatever they call me but I'd I have optimism and I've said for a long time when when the right people are at the controls of all the machinery and technology that will be so great for Humanity yeah we have it right within our grasp to you know make sure that this is a good place for all kids we could do that tomorrow so I think we should start thinking about that and all this artificial intelligence that gets us fighting with each other let's just step out of it like the matrix you know let's go to a new place where we're about solutions and working together bringing this country together and getting some real good jobs real good health care things that we pay taxes for better streets good education the things we pay taxes for yeah and mental health most of all I think that's what we need to protect for our veterans they come back and they're they're untreated and they won't even give them marijuana which really helps they won't even legalize that for you know people who have pts and marijuana does help with pts and you know you know talk about supporting our troops 22 of them a day are killing themselves they're homeless I mean that that's who we are I don't want that to be who we are come on they people think nobody can see us and what we do but they do and they they want it right people want things to be right and worked and used for the good of all people and stop tearing people apart from each other we're neighbors you know that was why I wanted to go back to the Roseanne show and say all those things and I'm so happy that I did I did it in 9 episodes I wanted a 10th season and I did all-night episodes were exactly the episodes I wanted to do so and it was number one every week and I just think my fans for that know you know a turn of fortune but I did what I wanted to do and and it was so gratifying it so wonderful and I don't want that to be forgotten I don't want that ninth season to disappear I mean the tenth season to disappear what do you think about them doing it without you how fucking weird is that it is weird I'm like oh I get it they're sending me a subtle message to OD on opioids is that what you think yeah that's some of it mind-control stuff yeah so you think that they want you to kill yourself well I don't know why they would do what they did let's just put it that way it doesn't make any sense I just I just think they're being completely inconsiderate they don't care about you know they don't and they they so belittled my contribution to the show to it just you know was shocking that was the most painful part of the whole thing well one of the things that I read was that you hadn't considered the more than 100 people that work on the show when you did what you did and I'm like that is that's a ridiculous statement I didn't cancel the show but not only did you not cancel the show you were on ambien drunk tweeting the idea that you did this this was some sort of a deliberate ploy to get the show canceled or the idea that there was any justification that your show could be canceled at all like what you can't just say something that you you didn't want to come out that way and apologize for it for three months no yeah they don't know who you are no they tried to wipe me off the off the map of the culture because people are scared to be connected with anybody who's a target yeah and they acted like cowards I wouldn't have done I mean if it were my friend definitely I would have of years two decades or more I would have said something but that's just me and I definitely one thing I would never have done is stab somebody in the rush to condemn somebody who you know was my biggest advocate there was a one sometimes an only advocate there was a lot of that I saw a lot of that yeah that's about them it's just about them it's not about me I just let go of all of it because you know I I am a person of belief and I just always tried to do what's right in front of me I feel like what you know my higher intelligence place in front of me I'll do it and because it knows better than me and which is why I don't think like other people but and also that I was not going to fight not at 66 I'm too old I I'm pretty frail and I think you know I worked really hard to get a second season and it's kind of ironic I crossed time zones to do promotion for free for months and you know during that time one year old and you can't sleep and you're crossing time zones going from Hawaii to New York and back and then back again and back again you know you know I kind of became dependent on ambien and I you know almost every night took it and you know obviously I something was wrong because I I didn't think I thought that tweet was about a science fiction movie which happens to be my favorite movie and which i think is very apt in in the world today particularly in Iran we're just a small group of corrupt leaders are oppressing the citizens and I think it I think there's a lot of references in that movie that to go along with what's happening in Iran of the human beings rising up to throw over their to overthrow their overlords and that's how I was looking at the whole thing so when I woke up to tweet there that was what was in my head it was certainly not somebody's looks and it was also about the Arab Spring in Egypt which which you know Obama he didn't handle it right and so all those things are interrelated with Iran and the Iran deal the Iran nuclear deal you know I'm I'm extremely well-read on that subject I certainly wouldn't be at the height of my power and my fame being on there going home so buddy needs like a Yankee excuse me I'm not an idiot okay I went beyond their GDP naked monkey I'm a well-read an intelligent woman and my word and things that I write to people over in that part of the world there I've brought a lot of people together in that part of the world with my tweets and most of my tweets are you know spiritual in nature anyway so it wasn't what people thought it was and still I apologize for inadvertently hurting anyone's feelings still I apologize for inadvertently and not you know be I apologize that they were wrong and they misheard it and misunderstood it but that wasn't good enough either and you know just get to a point where it go I'm letting go of it my fans who know me and my family and people who like me and know me for my life they know who I am and that's all that matters you know they can call me whatever they want I don't accept their definition of that word and I think that they should read more well one of the things that's most shocking about this outrage culture that we live in right now this age of outrage is that there's no path to redemption there's there's no acceptance of their IDs there is though via but there's not from the general public oh yeah the public everywhere I went people run up to me I never felt so much love in my entire career in real life but not on Twitter and not on social media not on social media social media it magnifies the very worst aspects of humanity because you're not interacting with people in the real flesh right you're not experiencing social cues you're not looking them in the eye you're not seeing them as a person you're just seeing them as a target online well I think that Twitter app has is a purposeful plan like Facebook I got our Facebook years ago cuz I realized what they were doing what do you think Twitter's doing he was doing the same thing that Facebook did how so it's manufacturing consent and you know using bots to do it I'm thinking about manufacturing consent it's a place where like Noam Chomsky says you know the press manufacturers consent the consent of the governed so that's what they're doing is manufacturing the consent of the governed but they also manufacture dissent they control the opposition to on Twitter and I'd like getting in between those two and causing a ruckus because I knew it was all artificial intelligence anyway it's all just to track us we all know that just like they do in China so what are you saying you think there's some sort of a grand plan to get people to argue with each other yeah I think it's a social experiment to turn one group against another which you know it's smart because it's divide and conquer and as long as we're like you know it's all these people getting robbed all these taxpayers getting robbed sitting there pointing to other taxpayers that are getting robbed and blaming them but nobody everybody needs to look upward of our government asked for an audit of our tax doesn't actually take responsibility for the things our country does we're getting judged for it anyway I think the certain what we allow realizing I think there's certainly people that are capitalizing on all this chaos and all this all the conflict but I don't think it's manufactured I don't think it's engineered I just think it's happening yes this is a new thing this this ability has a mind of its own I think people have a mind of their own people are inherently tribal there's almost no way to stop them from being tribal these smart people are tribal but the problem with tribalism is that you sometimes have enemies that are unnecessary so you develop this or you could have your or you could have allies yes on common ground well that would be nice if we all looked at ourselves as a tribal world that's how I do look at the world and why I didn't want Hillary Clinton because her party is very much for corporate law and the Republican Party is very much for tribal law and I am a tribal person and I think tribal people should you know have their land tribal in what way how he tribal me yeah well I'm Jewish when I go over there to the Middle East I visit the graves of my teachers that's how I'm tribal I go to their graves and you know that's what we do that's what all indigenous people do they want to control their sacred bait burial grounds and that is anti-corporate law and that's why I'm anti corporate law I can't I'd like to study papal bulls and corporate law and maritime law and all that kind of stuff you know I like to read so I have a lot of information and you know it makes me angry or sad was more it that that the work of an artist over 30 years you think they think that we just pull that out of their ass and that they can copy it you know without the artist they can copy it you mean your show I do yeah and it it is you know all the stuff I suffered in my life I put into that show that show is about my family my children and it's just like wow that it's so huge it's so huge it's it's beyond entitled but what are they gonna what is their plan and how are they able to do that did you let them yeah I signed off Why ask me - why'd you sign off because I felt like I would be a huge hypocrite to have talked 30 years or more in my life about labor rights and the rights of working people if I took away those people 200 people's jobs so that's why I did it I wanted him to work I know how they had planned on another season and they probably I'd already spend the money was there any consideration of redemption was there any path where they could allow you to apologize or do something that would endear yourself to the people were they for that I said let me go on all your ABC shows and explain my tweet and how it was a political and not a racial tweet and you know that was denied me it's like you can't say anything till you sign off you can't say anything until you sign off so they wanted you to sign off the rights and then they would have you do whatever you wanted to do go on their interview shows no they didn't guarantee that didn't guarantee that so they just wanted you to sign off and they offered you nothing in return they offered me some money but the idea was just to be able to redo the show yeah to take all those years of my ideas and how I thought of 20 years of those situations to come back it took me 20 years to figure how would these characters where would they be now and I did that by living among regular and normal people for 20 years I never lived behind you know racially segregated gates like other stars I lived in working people for neighborhoods and I farm around farmers and I wasn't gonna be that big of a hypocrite like macadamia nut farm I sure do it's gorgeous you should come and see it I love to come see it I love the Big Island isn't it gorgeous amazing people are done there though today you know what I read some people some lady took a boat full of people too close to the volcano to look at it and the lava overtook their boat and thank God no man were killed but they were got like about two feet up on the cloth oh jesus oh don't do that Hawaiians don't do that somebody got hit with a well that's probably why it's pretty good weed yeah they got hit by a flying chunk of rock from the volcano on one of the boats too they were having lava tourism and someone getting clipped by a rock it's so not smart it's so stupid it's a dangerous dangerous situation shouldn't we don't go on those tools is your area safe my my area flooded a bit I had to replace my roads for about the 10th time in 10 years I always got to replace my roads I really got into making roads that's one thing that I really did enjoy yes I'll be headed back there and be making more Road so I'm excited about it I can cut a road like nobody's business joking I'm a hell of AI want to write a book my granny is a scout and because I do scout the jungle you know and make a road in there I love the attitude of people that live in a big island it's a very relaxed laid-back friendly attitude they just have all the time in the world it's a different sort of vibe when you go there yeah everybody helps their neighbors there they don't like turn them in yeah you know well everybody helps out their neighbors and their neighbors are like every every kind of people you can think of it's very very diverse cultural how'd you wind up back there well I went there because my son buck I had I made him go to the school out there so then I bought a place right by the school because this kid you know he had feel he's 23 now so he don't get mad but he had some severe ADHD there so I had to do what I did to get him now he just graduated from college he's doing real good yes yeah he's my first college grad mm-hmm all right ADHD maybe he's a comic yeah he's so funny oh my god he's so hilarious maybe is he's a comic just wait so sure it's all my grandkids are - they're all yeah video that you showed me yes they're all hilarious yeah they seem very funny what are they gonna do to your character on the show they're gonna kill you off yeah I think they did didn't I someone might know they didn't tell me how weird is this some of my spies told me how weird is it they're taking you out of Roseanne they're calling it the Connors it's all going on without you being there what does that feel like um it's a mind warp and a mind fuck you know so I'm just trying to call from a tweet yeah a misunderstood tweet I misunderstood tweet while you're on ambien why are you drunk deal I wasn't drunk only had like one or two beers well when you have one or two beers with ambient yeah I guess you're drunk you're fucked up I was yeah I wasn't in dance my wife a lot too right no I don't think I'd smoke pot down hmm no I didn't smoke pot down I was at my mom's house puffing on the cigs I went down in the basement I was hiding down there in the basement because they were surrounding my mom's house paparazzi's and such and says I down in the basement and that's where I always used to go when I was like 13 and I found this stuff and chalk on the on the walls of the basement there that I remembered right when I was 13 and then I found an old but from one I snuck cigs when I started smoking oh hell yeah it smoked good no but I was hiding down there smoking they were knocking on my mom's door and I was like oh my god so my boyfriend got the door he's like a big man you know he's like may I help you you know that's my man character and I thought they were gonna you know say something and they're like we just please tell Roseann we love her and you know we don't like this and blah blah and that was happening all the time and that's when I was like jeez I've never ever felt this kind of affection from people in all my career so it's kind of a cool that's that's the thing there's the social media outrage and then there's a people in real life that feel terrible for you because they feel like you got a raw deal yeah they think that there's Delta there there are so many double standards of people who said things on the air remember I just said it to a small population less than 600,000 people on Twitter but these people say things on the air and they are not well I know Joe I had to go pants and apologize so yeah what did Joy Behar say about pence it was so bad she something about his Christian faith yeah that they're psychotic or something because they so she called us yeah that's what I heard you know an apology with your network behind you really works like with what's-her-name that called Ivanka the names I can't no Samantha bee yeah and her network was behind her and that was far more offensive and it was on the air and but when your network is not behind you you don't really and they won't the thing about its they were they didn't want me to tweet the whole the whole truth is I I told him I wasn't going to tweet and you know I promised him over and over and although they never sent it in writing which was required but anyway they called my publicist and unloaded on him all the time and you know I should have stayed off Twitter I did it to myself and you know I made a mistake and and the ball kept rolling but it's just crazy that this what I think is an insignificant mistake especially in light of your apology could lead to no redemption possible yeah that no redemption possible that this giant fucking hit show and look I don't know what's gonna happen with the Conners but I think it's gonna fail if you asked me if I had some money to bet if I was in Vegas that shit ain't gonna work cuz you how are you gonna do Roseanne without Roseanne if you wanted to have a whole new sitcom with all those people with a totally unrelated storyline that's one thing but you don't think America's gonna know that they killed you off like what the fuck is that and that and now with time and consideration after time has passed and people can review everything they're gonna go was it really this bad and they're gonna think about their own lives like what about me what if I say something fucked up just fuck you shad dude I take ambien and accidentally say something crazy and don't even remember saying it and then it's misconstrued or it comes out wrong is that gonna ruin my whole life like how can you have someone ruin their whole life for something that is misconstrued mean also you know really I mean that's why I think first of all US women we needed to do a better job of raising our sons and but at 17 everyone's out of their friggin mind I have five kids there's not a one of them who didn't do something horrendous at age 17 well we were just talking about that with Andrew Santino who was in here earlier yeah when when young men especially young men that don't get a birds in the B speech and who knows what the fuck is going on in their home you know people do stupid shit my son that went to college but he says he learned the day he started college they gave out this pamphlet on sexual assault to all the boys I guess I gave it to the girls too but he said he read it and he realized it was any kind of sexuality at all his don't even do it and I told both my sons you gotta get if you're gonna have sex with somebody you make them sign a consent form and have take it to their lawyer and get it properly notarized and then make a date for after that happened even that's a dangerous time for our sons and our daughters well it's always a dangerous time for women right in if you really with the wrong man well or the wrong woman are you shittin me women are just as horrible as man until we're horrible with women to this one of those sexual assault and rape amongst lesbian couples it's it's pretty bad but I mean what about rape in the prisons nobody talks about that that's that's the real rape culture where men are learning you know it's terrible well yeah well we can get into depth about bad prisons are in general and how people aren't routine I watch that orange is the new black so I know I've never seen it it's great oh my god it's great but the problem with you know there's no rehabilitation it's it's very very similar goodness in prisons what you you're doing is you take people and you make them better criminals or make them more hardened criminals surround them with other criminals you give them a horrible work one further because most prisoners are in there cuz there are abuse children well and what percentage of prisoners are in there for nonviolent drug offenses really drives me crazy fuckin and so that's when I ran for president on legalization of marijuana for that exact reason well slowly but surely that's becoming a mainstream idea I'm glad I'm glad too I mean as a rabid pot user I love it now I think marijuana's it makes you more sensitive aware person it definitely makes you paranoid but I think that paranoia allows you to understand all the danger in the world that you're probably ignoring yeah you're like I was like I was with Marge you know once I started smoking pot then I got real paranoid of people and that was a good thing you should be paranoid of people you should be aware for sure continue you watch cable TV for crisis that ID channel what are you doing now like what are you gonna do now you were saying that you have some other things cooking you know I got twenty thousand ideas a day why don't you do something like that I gotta focus into something why don't you do this like something like this so easy I thought about it but you said you'd help me I just can't I don't know how to write in a fuckin password turn this shit on listen you don't need that we can get you to connected to someone who can do that for you that shit's easy I'd like to talk to other people who've fallen from grace and see how they get back up but the fuck the real truth of it is that there is redemption there is in there there's moving on and there's like stopping the fight and there's like you know for me it was all I realized they're not my family right my real family is you know a joy to me and sorry I got a great real family I raised two good sons and you know of course I want them protected from crazy women for crying out loud i io ver modulate their dating lives I do you do you filter them yeah you have to how old your sons once 40 when I was 40 try to filter my dating life I'd be like mom I love you yeah shut the fuck up well that's cuz your mom ain't me that's true cuz I go oh no this is you know we can't have no bitches up in here I can't I can't take no that second class bitch telling me I'm beneath her that's why I help break up my son's marriage because she why she treated me oh you had someone who's disrespecting you well I would never allow it no you're never gonna fucking well that she's never loved it and all my daughter's thank God all their sons they listen to me they do what I tell them so it's great so I have good son in laws well that's good the one no he's a problem he's from Russia he's Russian and on his wedding night here's what he says to me he goes um does he have a Russian accent yeah can you do it oh I can't do that I try well here's what he said to me knowing this family it's about it in this family we do what the purpose is we don't know what the grandmas cry ma says oh I go bitch are you new I go okay boy if you want to live a cursed life go ahead live a fucking curse I got voodoo on them yep I put that Jew do ya he's come around though I knew he would cuz I know they have a son and he has ADHD too and but he's brilliant and as all on my grandkids and anyway so they were there those lib tart oh I shouldn't have said that Luke tardes no you can't say them against it anymore no you're not to say that I forgot cuz I'm old I mix them up who says you not to say that everybody says you don't say the T word oh so long as you don't have a rebound for it I think you're allowed to say it no I don't say it in public but no I don't but uh anyway so um you know the kid he's bouncing off the walls to like all my kids were so I know how to deal with it you know right I said just leave him over here with me I'll take care of it so I did what you do with them let's get him active yeah you get him active get up do and stay exactly I go I bet you can I bet you $100 if you can't run up and down that hill ten times in a row ah perfect ha see ya got a kid boys tired yeah I guarantee I have ADHD I have all those things yeah you probably do just do stuff just burn this stuff yeah brine it out and then you can become yeah yeah luckily I think those kids just have a lot of fuel I do they have a lot of horsepower and a lot of fuel and it's all misdirected yeah cuz they getting with the girl and she start telling them what to do see I'm telling you once they get under the control of a female say they're they forget their selves yeah girls do it too sure they're getting the control the wrong guy yeah you got to not get in control and Noble anybody right does the key autonomy and what do they call it sovereignty you gonna keep that find somebody who doesn't control you right just accepts you let you be yeah don't make your shower yeah no they have to make them shower oh boy you should at least suggest it yeah in a nice way yeah I should let him know yeah fuck is going on with your smell son yeah I come from weird line of women that like that man smell it was gross my mom she used to always go over and sniff under my dad's armpits it was so gross don't wonder I'm like I am mmm you know so when you were Oh Tarzan oh she likes monkey smell don't say that word monkey yeah white guy it's alright oh he called white people wanting my dad was real dark how dark he was brown brown yeah well maybe it'd be problematic oh yeah she was ruled their mom so I've learned a thing or two Joel I hear you but to me all people look like some kind I mean I didn't say anything about Valerie Jarrett but on the subject I think people resemble animals a lot well we are animals oh yeah we are animals yeah like I think I look like a beaver when I look at my pictures dude no he look like a beaver or a cat more of your time yeah I could see myself as a cat I think that never my kids think I'm real cat like yes yeah my boyfriend says sloth cuz I just lay there in bed watching the ID channel on murders and sex oh my god cuz I love how this character is put together you know writing characters mm-hmm you know you just look I like the forensics thing right when they put shit together you know and they go the are our perp is a our purpose of 40 year old white man lives with his mother and he's probably it was in the Navy you know all that said right I love all that I would have done that if I wasn't a comic genius I think the real prize a problem with that though is that the more you study that shit the more you live in that world the less happiness you're gonna find I've talked to guys that what world the world of serial killers the woman study in it yeah the actual people that investigate those people oh yeah they have a real hard time with life they have a real hard time because they know too much they know too much about the did you watch that show mind hunter didn't watch that one oh that's about John Douglas yeah I've seen so many of those shows I've read books on serial killers I you know and I've known cops that investigated stuff like this well after I had that thing with Marge I got really into it like oh my god well you realize there's some people out there that are they have a dark mind yeah they're capable of some fucked up shit yeah they are and if you're around that all the time I just think your appreciation for it's like it's one thing to know that it exists and it's a real but it's another thing to let that enter into your yeah your view of the world and how in there is a standard standard kind of behavior I guess it's wrong to do that but you know nothing else interests me who why is it interesting to you so much just because it's such like how they get away with it and they're like oh he was a nicest guy I mean how they their front you know the Golden State killer right you know that was a just us together that was it what he was called the Golden State yeah that fucking guy got away with it forever Patton Oswalt's wife who died of a drug overdose was actually investigating that she died of a drug I thought she died from fentanyl Oh everyone's dying from that ran from that shit everywhere I mean where can I get some it must be good if that's the connors to try to get you I don't know what you're gonna do I don't want to say nothing negative be back you'll be like you could be like from beyond the grave you could give advice to people on the show that'd be a great way they can kill you off and bring you back the same type of ghost yeah a ghost you come to John Goodman the middle of the night what the fuck are you talking about yeah you think they can come up with something better than just killing you off yeah they just letting it go well I think I mean they do have these movies about robots and other war they don't want to be connected with a racist i know you're not a racist and that's what's so fuckin stupid about this they had a number-one show a great sitcom it returns it's even better than it was when i think you know i think it was a bit better - it was great thank you well you know that was all I was meant to do so you know I did it I did it number one after 20 years and what about doing stand-up again I'm doing stand-up on Couture next year yeah bitches I'm really yeah and by then my gag or it'll be over sorts can you talk about the gag order or is that a part of the gag order it's yeah I wish everybody I just want to say I wish everybody the best you know I wish well for everyone on earth that's all I'm going to say what are you gonna do stand them next year 2019 where you gonna do it yeah I can't remember what they said it's in the Midwest all across the Midwest are you writing already are you performing at all I mean are you I'm right you're just writing yeah and how you gonna do it are you gonna start out at clubs are you gonna do theaters casinos do you have a framework of what you're gonna talk about yeah then talk about raising good sons and all that that entails are you gonna bring someone with you on the road to warm up or I probably should I don't know I was kind of saying I wanted to co-headline to I thought a coat headline with Monique would be a blast that's a great idea yeah me and her talked about it that'd be fun yeah I mean anybody just yeah just a good out there again tell my jokes I really like hearing people out there'd be a great thing for you too yeah I'm doing stand-up oh I did it just before you know in fact I think that's why I got so run down you know I got so run down when I you know this whole thing I was so run down at that point that I had no b-vitamins in my body how's it impossible well I mean it was a really low love mmm and the doctor said you know that can cause psychosis so that's where I go okay that's what happened to me really I was at weight I was getting way out there in Salt Lake City Utah anyway after I did do stand-up all through Canada and then I ended up in New York doing promo for Roseanne and I just got to run down I didn't I didn't watch myself and do what I should have done for my physical health well this this time around let's get you sorted out let's get you on some vitamins and okay get you a nutritionist and get somebody who's gonna you know do some blood work on you and make sure everything's okay blood work done I always go I go to the Cancer Center at whatever that Hospital is called over there yeah that's good I always have to have been fusions every three months cuz I I don't absorb minerals more vitamins what do you mean you don't absorb them yeah I had this gastric bypass about 25 so years ago and I can't absorb minerals or vitamins and so I have to go get infusions every you know when I get to down and I like I said I was promoting the Roseanne show and also doing some touring in Canada and I got to run down and I I just I I think I had a mental collapse I told the network I said obviously I'm not behaving in the right way and I will check myself in and get my meds check to make sure I'm you know you know so I said I have mental health issues and you know I I said also I thought that woman was white and it wasn't anything about race it was about Iran and it was like well we'll see how this washes out that's what is very Sherman yeah we'll see how this washes out because the scene minutes later Wanda Sykes tweeted let me off this show and then Sara Gilbert tweeted shortly thereafter something about she was ashamed of one cast member and what that one blew me away Anna and Michael fisherman tweeted he was ashamed of my racism or some shit and that was hard to take but it's because it was so it seemed orchestrated because they used the same words you know egregious unforgivable but in fact it might have been offensive and like when I was talking to Mike today I said you know we all say things they're racially insensitive at times all of us do that I'm a Jew I've heard everything and you know it or ethnically offensive to somebody but that doesn't mean we're the KKK okay that doesn't mean we're you know fascists or you know and especially if we apologize because most people who are offensive they mean to be offensive and they don't apologize and I think that's when you know there's a difference and if you don't have the discretion to understand that something's wrong with you and I think something's wrong with people that they're so hateful and so unforgiving and if you don't vote the way they think you should vote that they feel justified in being so what's the words so sanctimonious and self-righteous and when they themselves are you know kind of saying far more offensive things about people's children and such for instance I think people are just cowards and I think when things like this happen they want to separate themselves from controversy and make sure they're not a part of the package I can understand this I can kind of understand it but I don't get it that's what they do you know and you know I'm like wow they also get really really upset when a few years later somebody does the exact same thing to them got what goes around comes around and that's true and especially true in Hollywood the guy that fired me just was fired a couple weeks ago for what I don't know his contract wasn't renewed mmm in his last words were well I didn't know I'd be forced to cancel our number one show he wasn't forced to do anything well he might have been forced they're all fools they should just first of all they should have let the dust settle second of all they should have examined what you actually said and what your intentions were and let you apologize yeah and then have a conversation with you on one of their shows in long form you mean a teaching moment such as if Valerie Jarrett would have accepted that yeah I said I would like to debate her on the Iran deal and explain what I would said well you know that's not necessary I mean what Americans should know about that deal well maybe they should but I don't think that's completely related to your tweet but it would have been a teachable moment maybe but it also would have been a distraction from what you were trying to say well they didn't let me say it right and you know but to get involved like openly politically I know that's dangerous but Taylor Swift just did it what did she say just say get out and vote for the Democrat yeah but though it wasn't that like it's almost abstract get out and vote you know no she said vote for the Democrat I don't like the Republican Marsha Blackburn she didn't like her although Marsha Blackburn has been the author of a lot of great anti rape laws and all kinds of stuff like that but she didn't like her because she's a Republican so she took a stand a political stand I guess you know some people can do it yeah but some people can't and the political stand I took which I just want to remind people is that I'm I'm an independent that's my stance and I just thought both sides had gone too far out and needed to talk to each other so I came back and did a show about that that sustains you took with your show yeah and in my life it's like if we can't even discuss things that's really really bad but that's not American we we discuss and debate we don't label and blacklist we certainly can talk things and maybe that's something that you could have done once they had a conversation with you about your tweet but I mean I just think that what they did was just very hasty and very foolhardy and they should have known who you were beforehand they should have known about your mental health issues they should know they should have known about your medication issues you know those things they knew but this is what my point was if you have a person with a broken leg and they can't run and you get mad at them because they can't run that isn't that ridiculous well if you have a person that has brain issues and then they do something that's erratic and you're mad at them for that well you're a fucking idiot that's stupid and you call them a racist or chastised them in front of the world so that you remove any possible any possible negative opinions that could be cast your way I mean that's what a lot of it is it's deflection they're worried about negative opinions and negative feedback that's going to come their way so they immediately turn on you they turn on you in a disproportionate way well they did cancel the show before even one advertiser had pulled out it reminds me Sarah Silverman's bit I'm for against it remember that I'm for against it yeah well there's a lot of cowardice going on there's a lot of people trying to save their jobs and people panic because people are aware of the outrage culture that we live in this is an outrage nation right now it's it's one of our number one forms of recreation people love it they love getting mad at whoever the fuck it is as long as you react the way they want you to react oh they love it it's an inquisition well it's it's the understanding that people have way more power to affect change whether it's good change or bad change they're pushing buttons with social media and with outrage and with their ability to express themselves it's unprecedented there's never been a time like this in history no we're people well Salem witch trials yeah I mean it's like okay well if you swim that proves you're a witch and then we have to drown you there's no it's no it has so there has to be a loser because there can't be two winners well there has to be an understanding of what's happening here and then people have to have an understanding of the power that they're wielding and what they're doing and that it could turn back on them as well it doesn't ever just stop at one person that's why I said I'm surprised that a lot more comics didn't defend me because you know this means that anything they find in your timeline that they think is offensive they can mischaracterize and bring a whole battle against you that you can't possibly win and take your life's work well how many did defend you nobody defended me well I did you did thank you and hope did Stanhope did yeah there was a mountain that we're working we know none of them that worked with you well everybody that works you wanted to keep their job yeah and I don't blame him I don't blame him they probably you know needed the money and probably already spent it well the other thing to the sitcom life that that fucking schedule is ruthless it's cool but you know what I think it was a lot of it was you know I gave him the gun to shoot me I mean yes yeah I wasn't a helpless victim although I think my explanation you either make sense or doesn't make sense but well if you're compassionate it makes sense yeah but uh a lot of people aren't but um you know I forgot what I was I don't even know if they're not compassionate Rosanna I think they're scared I think they're just chicken shit I don't think they're looking at it from in terms of like I can't win here and I can't lose here let me just look at what's right see I didn't have anything to win or lose so what I looked at it I looked at you as someone that I admire sometimes I think is one of the best comics ever who I think I know that you have mental health issues I knew from talking to you that you were on ambien and I knew you had alcohol as well I know what that does my mom took ambien she woke up in the middle the night and drew all over the bathroom rug drew all over it with lipstick and and and and nail polish she said like a little kid said she woke up in the morning she had no idea she did it she's terrified of that shit she won't take it now yeah I have my friends many friends that have had bad experiences on ambien I have too and I thought well they shouldn't have shut down that conversation like that they shouldn't have it's a fucking dangerous drug too for the wrong people in the wrong situations especially when you mix it with alcohol I mean it's beneficial to people that need sleep in certain situations I don't recommend it I don't take it but some people like it that's fine but to ignore what the actual pharmacological effect on the human body is is ridiculous because they're Studies on this shit and that people understand the interaction between chemicals and the human brain and they're erratic and especially when you mix them with things you're not supposed to mix them with weird should happen yeah I love that tweet I thought it was gonna I thought I was gonna expand on it in the morning and you know talk about that movie and too late yeah yeah it was too late but the whole thing is just fucking crazy when well they told me not to tweet yeah well it's probably a good idea but now honestly the problem also with Twitter's fucking text is just to it's too simple yeah it's too crude a way of communicating it really is you can get across some ideas like you can say hey I went to see littlefoot's a great movie that's a good thing to tweet yeah real simple shit like that well I want to talk about like political things or things that involve nuance or seeing things that are complex I just don't think it's the way to communicate I don't either anymore no that's a terrible way to communicate yeah you know it's not communicate it's like what did he say Search and Destroy eat well for some folks yeah people there's gonna be people that always want to make things crash and burn they like it they like hitting the buttons they like to see people suffer well they definitely are suffering themselves look there's a giant percentage of our population that lives in misery I know it they do all day long and they they have mental health issues they're exhausted they're depressed they're there they have despair they're overwhelmed with bills they're in shitty relationships they're overwhelmed and they're angry and they look at someone like you a rich white lady and like fuck that bitch and they just want to attack you and it doesn't have to make sense because it's a reflection of their own personal pain as much as it's a reflection of their irresponsibility with this power that they're wielding through social media and then there's the mob mentality there's a bunch of people that are already going after you good I'm gonna go after two I'm gonna show the world that I'm not racist you know how I'm gonna do that I'm gonna shit all over this racist this racist Roseanne they don't care if you're really racist but the thing that gets me about it is this I'm gonna shit all over this Jew because I was talking about Iran as a Jew and speaking about Persian Jews and you know all kinds of Arabs we're talking about complexity it is complex but I always was on there talking you know defending or you know speaking for Jewish people and so you know I just I think that in the long run I really want it to be known that I am a Jew and was speaking as a Jew and when I spoke about the Iran deal and its effect on Jewish people in the Middle East and I really thought first they didn't know that but now I think well they had to know some of it I don't think they want to know this is what I think you say someone says that's a black woman even what is she 1/8 black like what is she something very small 46% or something really yeah she had her DNA done was talking about it oh and 40-something Caucasian and it doesn't look like but whatever whatever yeah we can't tell who people are by how they look I'm 1.6 percent African cool awesome that's the heart of the world when you look at what happened I think it's real simple I think she identifies or people identify her as a black woman you said Planet of the Apes racist yeah it's that simple I don't think they give a fuck of you're a Jew I don't think they care yeah not racist I think this is a viable target yeah well I said I voted for Trump so I was a target to that too and then and then they could find out a tweet from the past but let's not let's not forget either oh yeah I got in trouble for though don't many times yeah you know you just things you can't say and then there's worse things that you can so it's weird cuz they don't censor anybody who's you know calling for you know to kill all the Jews there are thousands of them let me check about they're not famous women with sitcoms yeah they are who you know people that are are tweeting support for Valerie Jarrett who you know are pissed at me and saying how could you say this about they're not saying that because they're saying kill the Jews they don't they don't maybe know what your point was well then I didn't know like I didn't know about her parentage I mean come on this is this is the truth this is who I am and you know they they they did this but they're not really saying kill the Jews it's not like a valid comparison well I'm a Jew I understand that but the people that's how it feels maybe it feels that way it does but the people are number oh boss they're upset at you because they think you said something racist I know you're not saying kill the Jews well but they are to us okay you see how when people look at your situation I can see how they think but but you see how when people look at your situation and they think it's racist uh-huh that is also how you look at they're reacting to what they think is racist and you thinking that they're saying kill all the Jews well they're saying like you know Iran every day threatens the Jewish people in Israel with annihilation and they've already survived you know not too long ago an annihilation so and then we make a deal with that government what does that does say something I understand that this is many steps past but to me I thing that you said a racist thing or thinking you said a racist and I understand that they think I said a racist thing yeah I understand that completely they have no idea that this had anything to do with Jews versus Iran they really don't have any idea the I've never seen that I've never seen that Ridge because it's not important enough to them to know that well it's probably not been explained to them yeah for one I know your position like this like you're talking about now I understand why they might not even think it's valid like if they went back and went over it you might disagree with the political aspects of it yes and they're free to do that I'm not gonna try to internalize but you know I'm saying like they're not the reason why I said it's not a valid comparison they're not really saying kill the Jews but to me and to other Jews they are in fact saying that and and that's very common amongst us so you know that's that's the truth that many of us think and you know people don't understand it or they don't you know care to even consider it well they don't have to but I'm still going to say it because it's the reality it's the reality to hear that and to hear that United States went and gave them billions of our tax dollars when they're the number-one supporter of terror in the world it is and they always do kill Jews like in Paris and wherever else they go did they do it in London too I mean you know I hate to wake people up but you know it is important at least it is to me and to people like me and to many other people many Christians it's very important to them to they're under onslaught - I'm not exactly sure what you're talking about because you're talking about Iranians killing people in Paris in England I'm talking about being the number-one sponsor of terror in the world Iran but they're killing people in France and England yeah that are Jews when when is this happening well when they that theater and a lot of other times but there's a lot of Baby Bottle Jewish women to death in her in her Paris apartment there's a lot of it I'm not saying they only kill Jews but they do kill Jews okay and the money goes back to those terrorist organizations that are funded by Qatar and Iran this is a there's a pretty these are general things you're saying yeah it's very general and there's a hundred shades there's a hundred shades but I'm just saying as a Jew with a family in Israel this is what we think and that this is how we feel and to not even acknowledge that in any discussion and it's kind of disturbing actually factored in I don't think it's a matter of not acknowledging it I think it should be factored in I think they're aware that this had anything to do with your motivation well it's not expressed I've never read it anywhere what's that you can't say it that's what I'm saying it can't say it yeah it's not really smiled on to go against the people who control our media and say especially social media and say that you're pro-israel or you know that you think you don't think that the media will allow you to be pro-israel I mean that seems like a really common thing not on social media for the most part no it's very anti-israel y'all I'll send you statistics well I see some anti-israel sentiment and especially in relation to a they treat the Palestinians like I see a lot of that yeah well I'm not gonna play into either of those because I I really believe that you know there's a solution to that problem the solution is peace and I think it can be achieved so I'm not gonna play either one of those games about who does this or what I just like to see a solution that works for all the people they're all people there so but it can't be yeah but it can't be if one side has been completely censored and it that isn't a discussion nor is it a debate and nor is it American scary it's scary times when you know like on our college campuses today I know this because my son was on one and you know it's a far left there far left professors that expose that kind of stuff daily in all of our colleges and it does find its way to the media you look at the media that most what are they called millennium Millennials consume and it's heavily to the left it is yeah and so that's where they're forming there they are getting their opinions from only hearing one side of things on social media and I don't think that's good well I don't think it's good that all conservative voices are being censored off Twitter you know and well not all I shouldn't say all but that so many are because that's a way to shut down discussion too there's quite a few conservative voices on Twitter but some are when they might think they're inflammatory or they think they're espousing hate yeah right you're deciding that it right it's people who are heavily political yes yes that's not right it should ease lean right all of them it should be more in the middle where both sides are considered to come to that's what consensus means is a diverse opinion and that's how you reach consensus you don't get a consensus nor a solution from only listening to one side blather on the same shit for 20 years well not only that keeps people fighting out each other not only does it keep people fighting I think it recruits people for the other side I think it does the opposite of its intended effect that's what one of my friend said he said he thinks Michael Moore that's Michael Moore's role since he's a billionaire - that he's a billionaire well they said this what they said I don't know but it's a in that vein it's like well he did get so many people to vote for Trump when he said that stuff about people are angry and they I don't think he did it on purpose I think he's just there's a lot of people credit him for voting for Trump for that speech yeah well I'm sure so my friend said maybe he's a double agent which I don't think you know I think this is one of the things that happens when it's like when when you give people that much suppression and you you try to indoctrinate people into thinking a certain way there's gonna be people that resist it a larger I hope so and it seems larger and larger but freedom of thought is the basis of this country it's not freedom of speech or freedom of religion and freedom of expression the Second Amendment those are symptoms of freedom of thought yeah and it's good to consume endless propaganda and and never have it broken down or or debated or pointed out that it's false there is an issue when you're only getting one side of the argument and the people that are controlling the media only want that one side expressed that is a problem yeah and the notion to that right now swing version of it well cuz they won't let it happen who's that you know the people that are in charge of program in the networks they don't want that team toe seemed to always lean left I mean technologically oriented companies yeah in corporations always almost invariably lean left why do you think that is they're smart they're educated they're fresh out of college the colleges are indoctrinating left-wing kids yeah you know you have a vast majority of professors at universities all across the country that identify as Democrats right so this is the indoctrination they get from people that they respect deeply and that they're learning from there's also an understanding that this is the way you advance you know and then when someone comes out that has anything wait a minute you said you didn't think that it has a brain Center you just think it was coordinated it's not coordinated in terms of the government I think what's happening in the universities is you've got people that are first of all they're existing in this bizarre glass walled garden where they they go to universities they're getting doctrine into these left-wing cultures and then they start teaching at universities and they never get out into the real world and then they teach children these thoughts and ideas and then most of the kids leave and they take these ideas somewhere else and then slowly over time they become more moderate most of them do or they they reject those ideas and either go to the center or go right or some of them stay left yeah but when they go into tech does Moscow Center a lot of unko Center which is I think probably where sanity is I think and I think discussion is critical I have a lot of friends at a Republican I have a lot of friends that are liberal there's nothing wrong with either maybe their mindset and the only way we find out whether or not we really agree or disagree is we let people express themselves right and as soon as you suppress that kind of expression then you run into real problems that's absolutely right and that's what I wanted on my show is that there that I would show that there was a a Trump lover and a Trump hater in the same house and they managed to deal with it and get on that's a great that's a great premise for a show and it was one of the reasons why I think people loved it so much is because there was that conflict and because look people can love a lovable curmudgeon people can love someone who has ideas that they disagree with people can love someone who lives with someone who has a completely opposing opinion they figure it out and they get along that's fine that's great that's all I thought it was great and my boyfriend said my boyfriend said your mistake is that you put a cramp in the hate business I don't think that's the case I think that just you you you became a target if I don't think they were happy from the beginning they I don't think they really wanted me to come back I think there's a certain amount of that when they found out that you're a trump supporter and then the show became successful and Donald Trump loved it and then they thought I was a troublemaker in a big mouth they've always thought that well you're a comic I know and everybody remembers when you sing the national anthem and grabbed your crotch and spit on the ground I don't remember that when you do that gastric bypass thing is that something they can reverse they could reverse it but what the hell then alway 800 would you really don't know a large Marv you wouldn't yeah I would would ya oh fuck yeah that's how I had it cuz I couldn't stop talk about addiction impulsive right oh yeah all day long eclairs what have you i whatever you loved it yeah it was great I hate those goddamn things eclairs no got gastric bypass surgeries people yeah they do but I just wish there was a better way it's just because it fuck's up your nutrient absorption abilities yeah yeah I mean I've heard that from several people I know guys have gotten in that's your mental state yeah I'm sure oh for sure a lot of it has to do with the the the health of your you know your your body your your ability to absorb nutrients affects everything your mood your yeah your energy levels everything you mean food doesn't get in there the right way no I just lay in bed till they called for me you know man I'd like to stumble and do my thing go back to bed I just had no energy listen bro Sam why don't you do something like this what like this oh this conversation was - you could do this on your time whenever you want to do it yeah without anybody telling you what to say or what not to say without any executives without anybody to fire you won't they ud you to be or something I mean they kick you off everything they could but I don't think they would and on top of that you could do it off of your own website you could do it on Roseanne Barr calm yeah yeah I'm always afraid they'll come you know I'm part I I just feel like hey this the time my life from 66 it's probably time for me to just lay low do stand-up sometimes that's a great idea you know that's even better yeah go do that then and show us some of my farming videos yeah but some people like to know about how to grow food and I'm really good at growing food when you do stand-up and you go on a tour I think it's gonna be hugely successful thank you I really do I think people gonna come out in droves I think it's gonna be awesome and I think once you get your legs on to you you start doing a few shows and get things cracking again you'll be like the Roseann of all you'll be crushing it I was crushing it I have to say in my tour of Canada I was crushing my shoe and one blast I had oh my god I just had the most fun you know ninety minutes of beautiful control over you know Bing Bing Bing and I've got like a big life every 90 seconds and beautiful you know I tailor and craft it and love it love the people that come out to see me good diverse crowd - which is great well I bet it'll be even more diverse now well it's gonna be way better I think cuz I'm gonna really start talking about the real me such as my abhorrence and fear of serpents scared of serpents oh yeah I always have been don't go to Florida no I won't don't go to the swamps for sure you heard about what's going on down there what with people releasing pythons oh no over decades you didn't know no oh Florida's overrun with pythons oh my god non-native pythons cuz people release them as pets and then they moved to the swamps and bred yeah they've eaten everything there's almost no mammals in the swamps oh my god I said 99% of all raccoons are gone we couldn't find any Marsh rabbits they couldn't find any Bobcats and the the pythons have started eating alligators o of them out there say the world's gone nuts raising stay away from Florida I will I had a I had a turtle that kind of felt are we done no I mean we can be done help or you can keep going well I had this turtle that fell in love with me one to me with me in Hawaii I was so weird now this is for true I've either been really afraid of serpents okay so uh so I go in the ocean there and my friends they're like don't touch the turtles there's a five thousand dollar fine of something you don't touch yes he feels big old thing yeah sound like you know like I say I'm a Jew so since I hear that I'm like yeah well fuck them I'm touching it you know so I did and then it turned it when and start swimming around me and then it went in this big circle and its head came out of the water and it's I died me and I was like oh Christ it's the serpent I've been afraid of my whole life and he chased me on to the shore she goes that's why we don't touch the turtles because they bond with you whoa like this guy wants me to marry him with you yeah if you touch him they like you they're like hey she'll go for it it was a terrifying I've seen them in the water they're fucking cool to look at they're swimming they're awesome they're like a little Volkswagen with these four paddles not a serpent head coming out and like this they look so did they go side eye I'll know now mmm it was terrible something to think of terrifying yeah I've never gone back in that water well yeah I could see where that would be a problem and I have a lot of serpent things and also like when I see people I can see if they were serpent or not you know how they say the reptilian like I told my kids is the hardest thing like that David Icke type shit well I really do see him know I sort of believe him he's gone down a rabbit hole that guy oh it's more like a like a gopher hole some were real deep into the core of the earth but I think he talks about that stuff anymore no he kind of laid it back but that's as I confronted him did you just lost it yeah well that's what I was doing on Twitter to his DM and people going you've lost it it was fun like I did it so I used to do these uh fake phone or crank phone calls before they got that star-69 and I was married what's-his-face then the oaf and he came in the room there and he told me stop doing it and he looked at my address book and I was I was calling general Schwarzkopf to do it to him and he's like you don't crank call generals work cuz I had all these numbers anyway so was I saying yeah you said yeah but then I went to the DM you know on that's the way get like people like just getting riled up that way well just go come on you're losing it

hardest thing I'll ever tell you but and I didn't know so I couldn't help it at the time but I recently found out that your dad is reptilian but sort of a joke but they are half reptilian but I can
