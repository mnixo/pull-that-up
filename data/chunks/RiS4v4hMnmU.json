hello freak bitches right it's very different than a regular movie what did he start doing the serial I mean I think of like Game of Thrones is a serial movie right there's a hundred parts to this movie but it's a big giant ass movie and it's it's it's so much better than a regular television show in terms of like its special effects and the grandness of it all if they can figure out how to film something like that but let you participate in it I mean let you strap on to some 3d treadmill type thing and move around in this fucking weird world and follow these people on their journeys be right there when the orcs slaughter the people I got like the blood splatter in front of you and you're watching them get chopped up and then you're going to go over the mountain to where the castle is you have to actually walk over the mountain but as you walk over the mountain horses ride beside you you get to see them I mean we're real close to something like that I feel like that's only a few years away have Avatar world coming out soon like in Disney at Disney Disney World what are we going to do how's that going to work one of the they've been showing some things like this is I think this is just a Imagineering low idea but just like you're going to be able to take a boat ride through the middle of the Navi forest okay well that looks like it's a small world with like a little like that but they're going to have some VR stuff you're going to be able to float through and glue a while yeah here's how they look in Disney world right now oh wow so they're building it right now you're not going to walk on that when is this going to take place I think it opens this later this year Disneyland is exciting here but what you're saying what if they just took the extension of that and just instead of like making the avatar movie they just went look avatar five is avatar world and if you want to come live it out you got to come to Disney World and pay fifty bucks 400 bucks 450 bucks Oh 300 bucks something crazy to do it now you're talking now this is what you do you construct that world and then once you're in that world then you put on the VR goggles if it turns everything into fluorescent neon greens and blues and like the Avatar world you can see everything and then you actually watch the movie play out in there oh I'll be the nerd Ganymede's I feel like there way close to something like that then we are everyone being able to do this well the thing about that though is it's going to require so much resources and land and money that doesn't change right but we have these notions of fairness play out in different ways were adults but different political groups and different tribes favor these other notions of fairness more than some others so let take for example the issue of pro-life versus pro-choice right okay so you have let's just here's the question are liberals pro-life or are liberals pro-choice they're more pro-choice on the issue of abortion right so on abortion it's about freedom right okay well it's very much about women's rights yeah women's freedom it's a big it's not it's not even thought of it as a human freedom because it's it's about the woman not about the child that's right so it's about the woman's freedom yeah right so they've hooked up to that idea of freedom right now and then you know conservatives are pro-life this is about caring and protecting from harm and all that sort of stuff okay unless you're talking about war unless you're talking about war and that's exactly the point is that you know are all humans hypocrites or is it that we selectively use these same intuitions that we all have for different causes so if you look at for example gun control our liberals pro-choice or pro-life they're definitely pro-life aha so what you see is that on abortion they're pro-choice and on gun control they're pro-life but in when it comes the other way exactly publicans are pro-choice when I come right guns so we all have these same intuitions but we use them in different ways to justify our political arguments well what's interesting too is that there's two positions that are taking place in the American psyche at least that we're almost reluctantly agreeing to and it's that the Republicans are or the conservatives are more realistic more hardcore ready to kick ass ready to fight for what's right yeah whereas the Liberals are a bunch of whiny crybabies we're going to give away their money and then creating welfare babies well that's first their if it wasn't for if it wasn't for the Conservatives these fucking people would be speaking German live in fact Lee right well at all tribes the nature of tribes you tell something that makes your tribe look like the good guy right right does the sport big is it ever going to be clean but way cleaner now in the UFC than it's ever been before but I think there's also I like the fact that one Fc is available for guys who don't want to be clean horizons available for guys who don't want to be clean yeah you know there's an argument either way you have an argument for the pride way which was everybody knew that everybody was on it they tested pride right we're thorough but if we lost when I tell you never a game item hey boss what's this why is this vile just civic here I mean buddy I did a thing like I believe will be cold as a boss to I was going backstage with a camera showing everybody hey man what's up hey though a distance a look at that is friendly training and you know and then I say okay we walk into the room from the doctors so I opened the door and I look to the side and I see all the pee test there with all the little sticks on them right and I close the door right away they look at the camera I said give me one moment they're very busy let me walk in and ask for permission so I walk in and I grab one of those cups and I see green tea I fill it up and I put the same cup next to it so then but you weren't even you should open it aloud to that be that close well was that so I'm yeah yeah see see I could contaminated everything so Morgan inches and I say oh these are the doctors here and look to the center go away to the pee test i same hand wouldn't it be great if you can taste what fighter it is and these people they looked at me as i take what my green tea and i take the thing off and they go like no no no no no here take a little sip and I said now go it's at a Coleman or Turkana they were freaking up man oh there you go there's a clear illustration obviously Bonnie series yeah not wada yeah and it's all at the end of the day a manifestation of probably some shit you haven't worked out which is still a feeling of insecurity still a whole you can't fill or I hope I can move with that savage
