how we communicate yeah like I can't tell you where half of these guys who are my best friends grew up but I I'm ready with so many insults for them if one of the moms back wearing a stupid jacket I can't wait wait Norton is awesome with that to everybody Oh Norton has crushed me so many times Norton talked about this funny story he talked about our OB ante where he was uh he had a slice of pizza and Louie CK saw him on the street and just slapped a slice of feature to the ground and called him a faggot and he starts to laugh and he's telling the story he's like I was a juicy pizza pizza too is a nice one another person that you know they wouldn't appreciate it the humor in the inappropriateness the other night we were just playing Keith Robinson's when he got eliminated from Star Search we were playing it over and over again in front of him by the way don't don't think that you can come to Amy Schumer slap her fucking pizza down that's not we're saying know each other good friend but

don't think there is a funniest guy alive but he's one of my favorites that's for sure yeah but he I was saying at the table with my dissing relevant female comics and we were all like eating like dessert it was like a really like sad moment he just like hey Dave he's like Oh what are you guys having no boyfriend alamode [Music] just like brick hey Dave he didn't even see us till he turned and then just boom fired up right off the cuff boom you didn't tell me what dumb huh story thought well from out keep Kimbo Slice Kimbo Slice I'm Ultimate Fighter yeah when your guys for doing that they'd even show this on the air so this guy I'm liking mentions name on the show he lost and you drink all that alcohol you want in the house and there's only at the time there's only four of us left still fighting Roy Marcus Jones Mitrione Mitrione and myself that's the for fighting right so one of you guys and one of the other guys is hammered hammered he's lost right hammered wasted all of a sudden this guy gets super racist in the house and there's a bunch of black guys in the house starts time out how his wife loves them because the Aryan Nation and starts throwing up racial slurs and throwing up these you know the hit hey Hitler stuff pile Hitler's write his name on this piece of paper for me alright dude dude this isn't getting out though right needed enough for my own edification so he starts doing all this stuff I'm sleeping I have the biggest fight of my life the next day Dana White literally stops us in the car does listen if whoever makes it to the finale where you win or not you're gonna be a superstar it's huge man the biggest season we've ever had you guys want to win this fight thank you no pressure so I'm sleeping and I'm sleeping and I'm sleeping on the ground and I thought it was a dream Kimbo Slice and marcus jones and this and this D'Amico and thus D'Amico Rogers comes in my room they go yo shop get up dog get up man I'm like oh three large black guys around

crazy turnaround leave and I hear that's what lock shop you can't tell what the hell he is and I go hey Kimbo that's racist Dalia's why you just cuz I'm athletic can file I gotta be black heels you could be the other day I was I was in Venice Beach getting lunch and I got a beer and a burger and enjoyed something that's known in the state of California to have medicinal benefit and I looked up in the whatever this place was this restaurant and right over the door was the picture of Obama from his Hawaii days he had the Hat on and he was smoking a doobie and for like a half a second I thought that's my guy right there that's 2008 campaign trail Obama and then of course that's not what we got we got smart Bush instead we got somebody who can like come on to the The Tonight Show or the view or something and just have the host eating out of his hand by the end of the interview so he's much smarter and more eloquent but it's still doing a lot of the crazy shit that Bush was doing and I think that he could still kind of like what's the word I'm looking for like come out ahead and like still come across as a good president if you were to just legalize weed at the federal level I think most people be like okay he actually did something meaningful that will be around 50 years from now and it's not just like I'm gonna tax I'm gonna find the shit out of you if you don't sign up for my health care website and I've done more drone strikes than any other president in history I've allowed NSA programs to expand and said almost nothing in response if you were even with all that shit which i think is awful legalized weed at the federal level and I would rate him as a good president sheer hilarious first of all I don't think that that's a joint I think that picture is a cigarette I've looked at it many times I've studied it like this approver film let's look at it quite closely have you ever noticed this when you're high like everything shows up a reminder that you're high no because I've been getting high longer than you son holding it you never hold a cigarette like that yeah we're enjoying yeah close in on that bitch let's get a CSI on this yeah look how a closer look how it's not like like it looks squished and stuff like it's a roll joint look at the smoke signature and you know what here's a here's another here's another point um look how far down he's already smoking it he would basically be in the filter if it was a cigarette you're right understand whould his own cigarette met a cowboy I know dudes who do that rolled menthols oh fuck how dare you he's the commander in chief you're a man boy and he's the commander-in-chief you son of a bitch [Music]
