hello freak bitches way most people think that if you don't use it your and like if you don't it say if you do something every day like I had a friend who was a longshoreman and he worked with this guy that would shoot heroin every day at lunch and that always freak me out because the guy showed up for work every day on time he was a responsible guy he was married he had children and this guy would get heroin he would cop every morning he would go there and he would sit in his truck and he would shoot up and you know whatever however long that that lasts you know he gets an hour lunch break and they would come back and go to work and I would like it every day he goes every day like I did it every day well you know I this past summer the past three months or so I I was in Geneva I just got back in the States and I was working in a heroin clinic where they administer heroin every day seven days a week twice a day to people who meet criteria for heroin addiction and when I say they administer heroin I don't mean like small doses I mean doses that go up to like a gram a day a thousand milligrams a day a lot more than what people use here in the states typically and these people who are getting heroin every day a large percentage of them also go to work a large percentage of them have families and they're taking care of their responsibilities they are this is their treatment and this is a treatment that works for them but their treatment include two daily doses of intravenous heroin seven days a week you know and and so like when I think about well one of the reasons I went there and I did this because the way we think of heroin in this country we think of it as such as evil drug and that's just American mythology and that's just wrong and that's ignorant and but that's how many including drug experts in this country think of heroin but that's just we have all of this great technology but we're so ignorant when it comes to many of these drugs so heroin administered intravenously on a daily basis is not it's not devastating no in fact some peep we'll do better by having the daily dose as a daily dose of heroin or another opiate no it's not devastating see even me yeah I would go fuck man that's gotta fuck you up like taking heroin every day yeah and it's it's been this whole journey miss since I saw you last time I've been all over the world in this whole journey to see what people do with drugs or with drugs they're using and how they do it it's been so I opening even for me someone who has spent their life studying drugs and I'm learning so much more now and but the switz experience of a the Dutch also do this there are some parts of Germany that does this they have small programs in UK they had small programs there are other countries but the Swiss by far have the biggest program and they've been the most successful they've been doing this for more than 20 years now and they started doing this in response to HIV concern people worried about folks getting HIV so they had to do something had to have clean needles we had to make sure that the drugs were pure so they were worried about death HIV all of those things and this was a rational response where they put it in a medical community where people got treatment in along with their heroin and they have no plans of going back nor should they because it works the mind is such a motherfucker like if you could just get your mind to do what your heart wants to do life would be so much easier yeah I think like there are so many times in the cage like right and I don't know if my brain knew what my heart was trying to say but that's what I wanted to do you know and it's so and then you fuck brahh can't even put words on you you know it's crazy do you do any mental training do you do any meditating or any visualization probably maybe should I mean but euro because of your style and because of NIC style you guys are both really well loved like if something like that happened with you you could do seminars and make a few grand every week and maybe maybe not in Dublin if you and Connor fought and and duked it out had an epic contest then you could do it you know I'm just a big stick in the more if you you beat them a couple times decisively you'd have to beat them to where they have to just give in they'd have to say all right yet beat them you beat them but if you're fucking cut down to 145 you torch him fucking Connor look man I appreciate the fuck out of what that guys doing he's getting eyes on the sport yeah in the fucking president but I wanted to rip him so bad of course I wanna kill my leg you know a car you can blow me like a cup of hot soup you son of a bitch below me or like a cup of hot soup how's that work you blow on a cup of hot soup is that what it is okay I don't but if you just blows that's why it's confusing the vernacular is really odd like blowjobs I don't understand blow me like a cup of hot soup first time first time there you go I've never heard that one fucking around this is uphill battle because the way it's being treated presently if you look at the literature from 2012 four hundred and ten thousand servicemen came back as veterans and who were diagnosed with PTSD now post-traumatic stress disorder is usually perceived as being a psychological psychologically precipitated event where they witnessed something that was horrifying to them death of a friend loss of a limb or whatever this situation might have been to stimulate it and that immediately opened him up to simple treatment here take this packet of antidepressants and you'll get better well they didn't get better so they didn't get better because they were having what's called treatment resistant depression which now we find is due to a hormonal deficiency if you look at the civilian population people with hormones with treatment resistant depression you check them out in the testosterone deficient or estrogen overdose or a low progesterone or low pregnenolone other chemicals that are in our brain and these individuals have been the foundation of what I do in trying to find a simple way to replenish them what you have to do is test them and that's not being done it's so much easier just to hand the packet and say you have PTSD when the majority of them are traumatic brain injury and I was on dr. Drew show with one of our patients who was a army corpsman and he didn't have a single scratch on his body but within two years of leaving separating from the service he started developing depression mood swings explosive personality he ends up coming into our program and we find out he has two and a half hormone deficiencies and the pattern is indicative of having had head trauma well turned out he would walk behind a versum tanks as they were discharging their shells and he said man my body would shudder and he was around javelin missiles he was around a repetitive gunfire he personally didn't have a scratch on him that's incredible that just the recoil just a boom Chris does the sonic boom the impact that that you know shocking his body can do that [Music]
