II - uh uh hello P Tomic hi buddy hey Jill Rob you see man good to see you psyched to be here besides being California aside to be sitting across from you psyched to have you you're you're a free man now I'm escaped yourself from the shackles of satellite radio the shackles of corporate media man this see that's the thing about dedicating so much time do a company like that they can just get rid of you and then you don't have a connection to all those fans you have to re-establish a connection it's been an amazing experience in the last what four weeks and to happen to try to first of all I watch my funeral play out publicly cuz I had a huge community listeners for 12 years that I created and I was trying to respond to all them and I you know you can't say I still can't share it like certain details right how much time did they give you before the show's ended the the show basically they told me after the show that that was a last show and then they let me have like a yeah they said I could do a last show but instead I was like let me just record a message I don't wanna oh you didn't know until the day of I had a pretty good idea I had a pretty good idea so they have ratings well I don't think so if they did I think I'd probably be in pretty good shape I mean like it's a long story but the show I was doing was pretty special like it's really helping people and we were enlightening is kind of like what you do here I mean that's why I love what you do here you people learn they they get enlightened they get entertained that you make people better better people through this show the contribution that you make that's what I was doing we were three hours every day talking about issues talking about struggles that people are having and it was rewarding and challenging and satisfying and I had total editorial control so you know I can't I really can't complain twelve years is they know though how many people are listening to any given show not that I ever know not that I ever not that it was ever shown to me and it has a weird thing that's the thing that you have with Netflix as well you know like if you do a special with Netflix yeah and they go we really like it it's great but they don't share with it yeah you go well how are the ratings they go we're really happy what does that mean we're really really happy that's like that's like when you first started doing comedy and you came upstage and your friends like you looked confident now it's worse than that because you don't you like business decisions can be made based on what kind of downloads you're getting right if you is people if Netflix says hey you know four million people downloaded you're right shut your comedy special they've really loved it we're really happy let's do another make any sense for the company to have the information in the hosts not to have the information why wouldn't you share it so that everybody has they don't want you to bargain with them well it doesn't want you to negotiate ya know that I mean the best thing about being fired is you don't have to worry about being fired yes and so you can do your own thing and increasingly I think people are taking advantage of that like you if you're a network you have to have a million people listening or watching to keep the ratings up to sell advertising you're only making just so much money if you launch your own thing the way you have and so many other people have you're gambling with everything which is what I'm doing now with with podcasting which is really an original thing to do and a very difficult way to make money but if you do if you're good then you control it all yeah you can do it it's like if you've done a serious show and you developed an audience and that's something you definitely did do three hours live every day you can you can definitely do the same thing on a podcast you just have to write no you can it's like my family you have comedy - yeah but it's you absolutely can do it and it's just one of those things where I see people doing the corporate route and I'm like man I get how you needed to do that 15 years ago you don't need to do that now that's that's a bad decision now where was it good to say okay you got a serious gig 15 years ago wow that's awesome I think you're absolutely right it's just it's terrifying you know it's always there's always pros and cons you work for a company no matter what you do you're working for some you have a place to go they control all of the in our case in media's case the the promotion the marketing the legal they hire producers to work for you and so on and so there's a certain level of comfort there but at the same time you've got to answer to these people you got to deal with these people and frankly you know you're more talented than a lot of the people that you're working with and you have all these ideas and these inspirations and you know they're either gonna say yes or no to them and when you're your own you just put the wheels on him and go yeah well I remember last time I went to serious offices went to the you know the the studios I was upstairs and I was like there's too much money here this is dis cost too much money like there's too many people here there's you see these fucking people wearing suits like what does that guy do I guarantee you he doesn't do fuck off God doesn't have anything to do with whether or not this shows any good and all you have to do is press a button and get it out there so there's all these people making decisions about well we got marketing this one that I'm gonna make sure we're hit the right demographic like that's the way I've worked at CNN and worked at MSNBC I worked at Fox I feel like that's corporate media or corporate America where you have to wonder how much work and how much value each person is bringing to whatever their job is it's I always want to know but it's they're goofy serious is very goofy they offered me a great deal zero money really zero I feel like you might have told me that before I don't know zero money so the most hilarious deal ever will put your show on the air and we'll give you a zero like oh that sounds good I don't even know I don't even when was that I mean at that fucking recently really yeah yeah yeah they're hilarious how did you what did you do I didn't do anything I don't talk to anybody I mean I'm going through managers and I say no to everything so I was like it was easy to say no no I always did everything directly myself never I I could never allow somebody I never felt like anybody could sell me the way I could sell myself dude then you have to think about selling yourself you can't it takes any the what this is I mean for people listening to this podcast regularly I'm sorry I apologize for repeating myself but the way I look at everything and this is something I've done over the last really cultivated over the last 10 years but really specifically focused on over the last couple is a look at thinking is bandwidth I only have to say if you have a hundred units of thinking whatever the fuck you have to do what you're involved in to have this negotiation or sell yourself to this and sell yourself to that and talk about this and you know and pitch your ideas to this person in that person that's taken away time that you could be working on your other shit creating oh yeah I don't have any time for that of zero time I allocate zero band for selling myself zero bandwidth for doing other but fu all we have you always done that that you we you that way at the start because I mean you're so big now I can and anybody can understand that you can do that I never had sold myself I always had an agent and a manager really I've had the same manager since I was an open my car really yeah who Jeff Sussman oh wow I know Jeff Sussman yeah Wow ha that's awesome that's but you're a loyal guy - well he's awesome and you know he's family we've been together since yeah I feel that way about my agent too but I just like Conan Smith he's like one of the few guys I met in this business that I really always liked and he didn't seem like he's part of this business but he'd always been like what's next and I'd always say tomorrow's show cuz every three hour live show we talked about everything from tax policy the depression to environmental isn't anything politics parenting and so it was really challenging to do that and to prepare for all these interviews with these smart people and then I wanted to go home be with my girls like I had an amazing work-life balance and I feel like so most people never find that they never understand it I found it and I kept it for a really long time which is what's scary did not have that I've been working without my ass off since the day I left Sirius XM and went right into a meeting and have been on the phone ever since reached out to you and everybody I know I said hey you know what what can I do but it's not it's not balance you know I haven't seen my girls I haven't seen my garden so I'm excited to hopefully get back to that to some semblance of that but most people don't have that and I think I think finding because you get you get so ambitious especially as a guy feel like you for your breadwinner especially it's just work work work support your family got a family there's ego there's money and you just keep going but then you realize there's got to be there's got to be enough you have to in my opinion you have to have an idea of enough and I got there and that's when I you know I just would work and then I would shut that down I would still do in as much comedy as I could but that that definitely fell by the wayside cuz the show it was up at 4:30 in the morning I was you know done by 2:00 and then it was I turned it off well the good news is you can do your show if you do a podcast you could do it from wherever you live right you knew it close by you can either rent an office space or you could do it in your fucking garage do it anywhere especially doing now your kids are at school you could do it yeah you do it on your terms you know you could bank a couple of them do two or three in a day yeah and then take days off yeah but the most important thing I think is that you stay independent we were just talking about that out there because there's going to be a bunch of bozos I want you to join their net they're calling John I don't know what what the offers are I don't know what the deals are but it's like why why I have I just started doing this podcast I've already been through what that is I've got a like a great community of listeners or like family to me they're all they've all been so supportive you like let me just try to test that out definitely test out how active are you on social media I'm trying to be as at as I can I'm not great at it I know that you have some sort of engagement so you could tell where you're going yeah definitely doing that but I mean you don't want to be too wrapped up in because again bandwidth it's gonna suck up a lot of your time and right you know for a lot of people it's a giant distraction yeah I don't I don't that's why I when I say I'm not that good at it it's because I feel like it's a distraction it seems like the very as a creative person it's interesting it's an interest you know letting a lot of creative people who are great on Twitter but I don't think in terms of what's a great tweet or I should tweet right now or put this up on Facebook you know comics artists do this because they love to create they love to perform they don't love to promote what they're doing nobody really likes that some people do and some people are great at it but it's usually not why you get into it at the same time if you don't do it I mean there's a lot of great comics who don't promote themselves and there's a lot of bad comics if we're talking about comedians what about any performer who are great at promoting themselves right I saw somewhere between yeah yeah he'll that are really good at promoting usually but not that good because they spend so much time promoting and they're trying to get famous and trying to get successful as opposed to work doing the work right and just conscious of how they appear to people you know they're super conscious and and like they're they're trying to cultivate an image they're trying very hard can't be bothered with that it's not good for you I know it works but I can't to go back to like what your deal was it serious like when you were there like so they don't yeah they don't give you any indication what kind of numbers you're pulling up mm-hmm not really the indication of how many people are listening to your show it was hard to know and did you see the phone volume you see the phones lock up you see you know social media is not really a good measurement because the vast majority would sing on the show hey follow me on Twitter yeah but what's interesting I don't want to disparage Sirius XM not because they gave me a good you know exit deal I guess but because it almost seems inauthentic because they they gave me five contracts which created an amazing life and amazing community like I'm so grateful to what I had there but yes certainly the the problem I suppose is you're you're behind this firewall like this morning one of my best friends lives in Australia and he's like yeah I listen to Joe Rogan I listen to Rachel Maddow's podcast like they don't have MSNBC there they can't get sirius XM necessarily you can't I guess online the point is if you're behind that you're you're mostly in the car and I think what I'm trying to say is it's skewed to like 50 60 year-old affluent men who are in cars which I psyched to have every one of them but I would love to have a lot of young people you know I'm staying out here with my cousin and his son is 18 and he found out it's doing the Joe Rogan show and he's flipping out but he didn't know what I did at Sirius XM I hate to say this because I'm thankful that Sirius put on Howard and Opie and Anthony and all these comics they had on over the years but you're better off without it it's not it's not where the future is the future is not in satellite radio it's just not it sucks you go under tunnels it cuts out it cuts I mean it's just it's dumb it's a fucking dump you know way I mean you could download an entire three-hour show in seconds yep via podcast you want get it on Spotify or whatever you download the whole fucking thing right before a plane ride in the airport you're in the airport and you go oh hey there's new Artie Lange podcast beep yep download it you buy you're fucking waiting for your your gate to be called you you got the podcast you get on the three-hour flight you listen to the whole goddamn thing it's easy what's interesting is going really curious to see what you think but going from live radio and constant interaction with callers which I love you know I mean that I'm a you to podcasting and just being there alone with the mic and you know against no you can do that you cannot told I can I'm told I can go live I haven't figured it out yet I don't know you got a great group of people that are working with me amazing people of commodity craft the greatest thing has been how people have shown up like people from my life like 15 years you got 20 years yeah phone just ringing Texas coming and no I haven't talked to you and saying kind of just what you're saying you're better off your you know one door closes but more importantly just people talking about how you change their life and how they can't wait to see what you do next is an amazing amazing feeling like if you if you do that with one person your cup is full to have an audience of people doing that for 12 years it's overwhelming joy and satisfaction to be able to look at my daughter's and be like no matter what happens next what I what I got to do there and what I did do there on so many tough issues and help so many people that's it man I could I could I could diet right now oh yeah don't die it would be good for me to get on the show though nice you you have a nice past which is wonderful but the thing about scary things and the thing about this is that it's an opportunity for growth there's an opportunity to do something there's an opportunity to stretch your wings to really take a chance and that's how you grow and I appreciate you saying that and I'm on the same wavelength and I'm a guy who who thrives in these situations like I've taken advantage of every room I've been in I've never been the best comic the best I've never been the best at anything but I've always been gritty I've always worked as hard if not harder than anybody and now it's interesting because I've never been in this type of situation with a family you know it's different when you're single and you're young but I was working that hard and making no excuses and back then doing no drugs not drinking everything was just about my career and being a good person I thought if I was a good person that mattered and come to find out being a good person was the best form of currency everybody competing and trying to kill other people and our business or in any other business to me I have no interest in that and no attraction of those people all I want to do is help people not just for purposes of altruism not to be virtuous - because same reason you are being kind is is the way to be not putting a knife in someone's back and when the show ended it was amazing because people started tweeting things that I had done that I never was thought would become public they were private things they weren't for and it was just like days and days of people you know I did it used to do a segment every week called stand-up with a veteran for veterans and like this veterans community came out strong they're like what they let you go you did so much for us I was like I think it's a dying company I don't think you should dwell on all this I mean it's just a dying company now you have an opportunity and it's great that you did all these good things it's great I hope I don't mean to sound negative I don't mean to sound like I'm dwelling on it I mean to say it was an amazing experience that was afforded to me I leveraged it I took advantage of it I'm really excited every day I wake up now just ideas ideas ideas hammering well the show while you were doing the show will you under any sort of exclusive thing where you couldn't do anything on the internet right yeah yeah I mean yeah pretty much you couldn't do a podcast it was direct now that was dread competition yeah cuz do you remember when Anthony from Opie and Anthony Anthony ku Mia had live from the compound course he was doing was it overlapping with serious oh yeah that's why I started my podcast because they were silent because because he had a studio in his basement where he's doing karaoke holding a machine gun he was drunk I was like what was that oh yeah he's fucking crazy I know I was I always had a great relationship with him that I love that guy yeah he's one of the funniest guys our pilot he liked me because we agreed on nothing but I you know we got along but he's a genius I mean he really really is like he's a pretty smart dad but the way he thinks and talks about things gree with him I don't agree with him he's a very entertaining guy I'd loved doing radio with him and he had this basement setup where he had a green screen and he yes I remember that like a real production table and production mics and he spent all this money on like really high-end stuff and he and I had a conversation I'm like what are you doing he's like I'm just fucking around I'm having fun I was like I remember thinking about it going I need to do something like that and when me and my friend red BAM when we started it we just used a laptop but I remember thinking about what it would he had set up so we were just doing like answering questions and talking to people on you know I forget what it was I guess it was Twitter 2009 there'll be 10 years next month it's awesome man letitia's the but the the inspiration was Opie and Anthony first because they their show was like just a hang they just there was not no structure to it it was just having conversations to the people but then when I saw Anthony have that set up in his basement I was like oh I could do something like this and by the way having a studio and you're always thought that was weird cuz he's all the way on Long Island I was like is that gonna work how's gonna get people out there and I'm hard in the bird wired to when he got fired it was hard to get people out there yeah I'd imagine but like him I had a you know got a big a vast network in technology has gotten so much better in terms of getting guests but I mean I just you got a wonder how it's how it's all going to work and how do you if you're gonna go live there's just so many things it seems to be thinking about how it's gonna what's gonna work like what works and but do you know anybody that has a studio that yeah yeah do it yeah as long as you'd say that commute that's what the commute that the fact that he has a studio and when I got a studio in my house Sirius XM had me do it early like 6a 9:00 a.m. slot for two years and I was like you did it in your house yeah negotiated I was like you want me to do 6a 9:00 a.m. you got to build me a nice studio and they did and that was the richest I could ever be friend of Mines wife works at a college and walks five minutes that's our community I think a commute is almost a definition of your wealth my body turned to mush when I had to drive into the city an hour each way like everything about about a long commute made me feel weaker and less then and the idea that you can have a studio in your house it's or work from home no matter what your job is is a pretty sweet deal yeah I think the commute can definitely grind on you but it also is an opportunity to listen to books on tape for sure yes whatever you can t productive positive yet and you can go two hours early and get an hour workout in before you get there did that there's a lot of good stuff that can come from everything if you look at things correctly I I I share your outlook I think that one of the things I've been listening to your podcast for years but like you know not every episode not religiously but since I lost my job I was like let me let me just start listening in a row again and what's really interesting about you in my opinion is your you are the perfect example of somebody that everybody wants to put into a box and you can't it's what's wrong with everything in our country in our conversation it's whatever people think that you are there everybody that I tell that I'm doing this show they set they have an opinion of you and then I listened to your show and here's the the main takeaway I get from your conversations is that you try to find the positivity in everything you're like the most positive guy whatever you think about any issue or any idea in the opinion you have you're always being so positive and so helpful and it has been honestly in this like trying time the other thing my dad just had my guy get fired my dad had a heart attack and then a week later he's on blood thinners and he faints and bounces his face off a counter rips his eye open goes into surgery now he can't see out of his eye and he's a ski instructor and a cyclist and he's a race car driving instructor and so I'm dealing with that dealing with my job dealing with my family listening to you and every a handful of other people just bringing as much positivity to every scenario in situation and that's my nature too but it's somedays doesn't matter who you are you got to peel yourself off the ground but you know you can't I can't let my daughter see me sweat either yeah well I'll let them see me vulnerable but they're not gonna see me sweat well you don't have to sweat you just have to grind just have to hustle listen you're a respected guy you're a very good host of a show you just have to find a new venue that's all it is this is a good opportunity you're healthy yeah you have anything wrong with you mentally and physically I've always thought mentally that I was the happiest healthiest guy so it's it's been a weird thing to not be able to spells that on people and physically I'm yeah I'm back to I'm back to training well that's all that's good shit man it's like you just need to find a place the thing about doing it in the city and I know you don't want to live in the city but doing it in the city you can get guests in studio for sure and that is so much better it's so much better why do you think I like why do you think that is the way we're talking right great but you can't look on a camera at somebody there's a weird way look when I was doing it with Snowden yeah there's a weird day he wasn't even Russia or something like that yeah but it doesn't matter it was real time I mean that the actual lag was very minimal wouldn't we think like the the lag was the Russian ace time nothing but even face time like when I'm on the road I'm face time with my family it's weird like what did you say huh okay right you know so there's a weird thing I agree I always preferred having people in studio personal it's it's 50% better I feel I'd be more I just made up that number I feel like one cool opportunity is to travel to different places and find the most interesting people and do gigs there do stand-up at night spent a couple days there interviewing the most interesting people in whatever town that you're in Oh 100% and so that's kind of what I'm the feeling about that is you're gonna need someone to film if you want to do a video element of it here's the thing about a video element oh yeah when you when you talk about some people don't listen to this podcast they don't watch it right it's a lot of people right when we first did it the video aspect of it was just an aside we just we did it with a webcam and then we started putting it on iTunes and the iTunes was way more popular than the video which was on Ustream which was it's not I mean I don't even know if it exists anymore does Ustream exist it does now it's YouTube and now it's YouTube more you have a it's a built in platform right right so there's millions and millions of people are on it just look at yeah I definitely want to do that I definitely want to do that but I'm thinking you make it obviously a lot of good points about where it can be done and what you know what the best ways to do it and I've been talking to so many smart people obviously every day I mean my network is is unlucky to have this network of amazing people that are just so kind and generous to give me this advice and still you know they know you don't be an idiot don't put enough don't do that you know it's a as a comic you I think that's that's the way that you think you want people to be as brutal as they can't be with criticism you don't take it personally just like okay yep I'll take that advice I'll apply that and change that and tweak that yeah well it's nothing wrong with getting some constructive or even destructive criticism like you did you have to you know you have to have feedback I mean there's not always it's not always accurate or correct but feedback is important and that's one of the good things about having like one of those talk shows where people call in you know it's one of the good things so they get to give you some free but I love that one of the bad things is they get to give you some feedback fine of the bad things yeah it's always entertaining like if they shit on me yeah it was always very entertaining as a comic like I love Echols I love anybody yelling out I live for it those are my favorite moments what I like best is one-on-one conversations with people that's what I like me to and that's what I like best to listen to as well yeah and you know like when you know I listen to Stern and then when someone would call and I was like why I let somebody callin and some guy would yell Baba Booey are talking about sniffing Robins farts or something but they would just be born and you don't want to be rude but you have to be like I can I'm doing a show here man you're dessaline odd that he would just go to callers in the middle of a conversation you know with some lady who's an actress or something it's just yeah I mean that's the chaos that he sort of cultivated well I think that's what's the great the great thing about this show is the people that you get and the interaction the conversation that you have and I was trying to do the same thing for you know at Sirius well you doing it you just were doing it in this walled garden yeah a bunch of assholes that are running the ship and doing it for like twenty twenty five minutes apiece I'm always amazed that you and you know handful of other people can sustain like a two-hour conversation I love that I thought he can you can do it too I know I think I can but that was never allowed to that was okay those rules were always like not to commercial yeah yeah yeah you had hard breaks I'm doing a podcast in the other day and I'm like thanks for tuning in we're almost out of time I'm like you didn't tune in and we're not almost out of time I can do whatever the hell I want those such thing I could just keep talking we can just keep talking well worse things Presidential Debates yah there's a horrible taking the person who's gonna run the free world and you have to stop because there's a Palmolive commercial this Palmolive even thing or I'm such an old man pulling out fucking Palmolive reference I think they're usually pharmaceutical companies at this point Pfizer yeah but donor pill the irony of them talking about the pharmaceutical companies and then they advertise during the break but you're absolutely yeah it's not real but I mean the presidential debates are so not real and all those networks mean my friends produce those things and it's just like it's a show it's it's like when you get burnt like when I had Bernie Sanders in here and you get to talk to them like a real human yes you go oh you're a human being it cares about people and you have a different perspective on what these people are saying your your idea of democratic socialism is not this wacky social and a soundbite yeah that's not this thing where people think you just gotta steal money from hard-working folks and give it to lazy people that's the worst case you know scenario it's none of that no it's not we're gonna we're not gonna privatize stores and the thoughtful person and I was talking his because since I told you I'm thinking very seriously now but also running for Congress and I was talking to his I think deputy chief of staff got named Ari Rabin off great guy and I was I was telling him I was doing your show and he told me that after Bernie Sanders did your show he everybody was recognizing him I'm like really like he reached a whole different demographic talking to you than he ever had before because he's mostly on those cable news shows he's mostly on terrestrial or you know radio but when you do these and it would he even call this now a non-traditional alternative media it might as well be mainstream but the point is when you have a long conversation with Bernie Sanders and he's not like up there you know booed you know all that shit is is annoying you've heard it before he sits down and has a real conversation with you in a Pacific oh man that guy's make it a lot of good points yeah well you got to think of like what is annoying to people and one of the things it's annoying to people is that fucking rapid-fire not education is not my thing like people like hey hey hey fuckface I just got off work yeah why are you yelling at my annoying and he wants to take my money fuck him and you just press stop right and that's you would have to be able to change your cadence your diction and your commentary and you have to be able to get questions that are more thoughtfully that's the thing about all these cable news interviewers and network like they always want to get some headline and that's everything you know about corporate media - they want you so I've been in that belly of that beast Joe for the last 15 years corporate you know political media and it's so manufactured I can tell you so many stories they call you up and they say you know how do you feel about anything we want to make sure that you're a completely the opposite of the other panelists and so that you have a really robust argument and it's like not everything is binary most things aren't there's a ton of nuance a ton of gradation we don't have to hate each other that that that's how they get ratings that's how they sell advertising I blame most of the problems in our country on corporate media terrestrial radio just doing that format all day it works really well for conservatives not as well for liberals but it still works and they sell ads and if a few people make a lot of money but the country suffers this the idea that we're so divided is such bullshit I talked to people from all over the country travel all over the place I understand the issues really intimately and I don't care what you think about anything there's something you have to offer me there's something you have to make my life to enrich me I don't care what you believe on abortion or guns or certainty because if you could teach me how to fix this engine I'm into it I'm gonna learn how that if you can teach me how to exercise better but you don't like our trade policies I don't give a shit what you think about our trade policies let's just not even talk about it let's talk about the things and it's trying to get to the but the the root of somebody's soul is what we should all be trying to do that every day we should do right what what happened to you that made you think this way what is the experience what is your journey to me that's the fascinating shit about human beings well one of the things about something like cable talk-show or you know new shows or any of these political arenas is that there's a lack of real interaction with the general public in terms of like real real conversations with people you have a host who's wearing makeup who's got spotlights on them and there's a microphone in front of him and he's talking to his other people and there's cameras pointed at them and no one really feels like this is this is not an or a but it's not a normal way of people talk no nobody talks like that and rarely you see someone sit down and they're like every now and then they have those shows where like it's a one-on-one like Trump will sit across from fucking what's his name what's that dude's name which network it's a fox guy Hannity no other Dobbs that guy yeah who's Larry it's a funny Washington two of them together I mean Dobbs is lost his mind he's just he is all he is digging way but it works he's making I used to know I used to be on with that guy the most pleasant guy in the world but what he's doing he is it's so much he's a North Korean situation lou dobbs it's like state media every night it doesn't matter you know he shall not be questioned kind of guy worship the president's like what are you doing that's not even but but that's the it's I once got into this long drawn-out argument with Chris Cuomo who I like a lot but I was talking to him about you know this Ament the difference between TV and radio it's simple it's on radio and you got a long form you have a 20-minute two two-hour conversation and it's real and you get a lot done on TV you can have a five-minute conversation I go there's so many guests that you have on your show that I have on my show but they're way more they have a the ability to be thoughtful and nuanced yeah and make points they can't do that on cable and now you know he's doing a radio show so good for him well that's what I was getting at is that this separation between the people and then the just unnatural environment that they're in no one can relate to it what they can relate to is two people just talking to each other they can't relate to it Joe but they also think because they're conditioned to that if it's on a network this person must be an authority it must be intelligent but I'm here to tell everybody I was talking about credit default swaps in the financial industry I have an associates degree and came up in the New York City comedy clubs like I really didn't have any business talking about that but the thing is I could sound really smart for three and a half minutes on anything give me a minute five I can't go that deep on certain issues and I shouldn't be an authority on it but just because I'm on cable news with a jacket and a shirt and I'm this guy people like okay well I believe this guy I know it's not real no not really diem - I don't think twenty thirty years from now that's gonna exist in the same breath short er than that yeah and then the whole also the interjection of commercials every seven minutes the things they're doing on debates is the same thing they're doing on these other cable talk shows where they're trying to encapsulate these things into these very quick five-minute sound bites and have you ever heard of intelligence squared debate yes my friend John Donvan is the moderator he should be moderating the presidential debates he's the greatest guy they have these really well informed panelists to have a motion and they do like two hours and you can come in thinking so often one idea about the issue and you leave thinking something completely different because you have these very smart people debating with an excellent moderator it doesn't let any bullshit and you really learn a lot no commercial breaks and you can you know listen even three people there's too many people probably yeah it is it's like if you want to get to know someone it's a one-on-one because even with three people you're there's moments where you have something to say and then somebody interject something else and then you lose your point and then you don't express it and then the other person is talking and you don't know when to talk and then you find yourself being a little bit more assertive in the way you're talking to try to be you feel like I'm gonna alienate talking enough and then if there's four people you're fucked like the most ridiculous thing they ever do is when they have those seven people panels and one person just starts fucking chiming in screaming out loud and they talk over people and but they're also talking about because I had one foot in cable news for a long time still do I mean I still go on and then I had my long-form radio show where I would talk to policy experts it was very like the tight like right now when they're talking about the polls for the presidential race is anybody that's paying attention to that is wasting their time it's a complete waste of time to talk about who's leading and what Paul a year away it's a year away you have a terrorist attack you'd have the economy crash like it for a game it's not a game okay but it is a game if you're watching basketball do you not pay attention to the first minute of the game because it doesn't really matter what's really important is how many points are scored over the four quarters those are four quarters of a basketball game is I think there might be to have with collagen collagen Pro but the point is it's this is a weird game going on like Kamala Harris was a head now she's fucked like this is fun it's fun for people this is half of what it is I don't know I know it's serious I know it's significant I know there's grave consequences to picking the wrong leader but this is a game right but it's a bullshit game because as you said earlier the reason why Camilla Harris or anybody else takes a step backwards is because one stupid moment and how we possibly taking somebody on why Mel Harris is there's a bunch of different short yeah never gets old never ever but it is weird that it is weird that this day and age that that crashed him well given everything that candidates have done and said yeah but honestly there's probably something else it's how he responded to that as well it's like he showed a lack of humility or understanding of what it was like yeah it's how it's stupid that's not what's important ladies and gentlemen yeah I screamed out like we've got a microphone on me and I get excited I go yeah I mean you can also talk just about the ego of the people who are running for these offices and they don't seem to have an understanding of the idea of ego and what it means and how they should try to separate from it while using it like once you get into politics much less entertainment and you get really well-known if they mean you start believing things about yourself that aren't even remotely true they're not that right huh there's certainly some of that alive I'll have acting yourself right you you have an image you're protecting yourself yeah it's it's a delicate dance that I am completely turned off by I mean that's why it's it's hard to think about like I was seriously considering running because were or are I it's hard right now because I learned some crazy shit what'd you learn don't don't first of all drum roll please the the corruption I live in New York State wait a minute New York State's not corrupt it's in New York State stop the fucking stop this show all of all of you know politics there's levels of corruption but then in the New York state Democratic Party there's always been all kinds of issues so I bet I met with a whole bunch of really smart people about running for New York 17 which is the district that I live in like the day after I lost my gig at Sirius the woman had been representing that district for 33 years announced that she was retiring and I was like well I got I got nothing going on and I've always thought about running for office and let me you know seriously consider it I reached out to a whole bunch of people from all different walks of life congressmen that were in office that had been out of office campaign coordinators I thought - Chris Cuomo I thought the whole bunch of people but there's one person told me that if you want to if you want to win regardless of your party affiliation you have to there's a certain special interest group that you had to promise you wouldn't interfere with and make sure they got an envelope of cash and I'm like well I'm not doing that I will tell everybody and everywhere I go about that what is it I can't because I don't have a second source so I wouldn't say it but well I'm trying to get one true what is it rhyme with the special interest group yes won't do it because it was just that brutal now that real now and it's it's dangerous but the point is the point is what's it what's the opposite of that special interest group maybe the private sector but will would be like what they're opposed to what did that be that they're opposed to you interfering with you interfering with the way that they run their show but I'm saying like what what group that we know would be a pose well yeah I could tell you it could be a religious group a private sector a union or a comp you know corporate interest it could be any one of the the point Lu the point now the point is that all of those types of organizations pressure that you have to I'm an honest guy I can't I can't lie I've never said anything into a microphone that I don't I don't believe and that's been both to my detriment and to my benefit I think I'm authentic so when I was talking about running for office my brother's like you can't you can't lie you can't be dishonest to people how are you gonna do that you'll have to sell out at least a little bit that was the other thing and then I realized I'm not sure that this district or you know the country is ready for someone like me I'm a comic I've set a billion things on TV and a microphone and on stage and we're in a humorless country right now number one I smoked pot like are they ready for for the are we there yet I don't think we're humorous I disagree I think there's a lot of criticism going on but that's because there's a lot of policies do you think I agree with you overall but I mean for politicians for me to run for office and you see some stand-up bit I did or something and then my opponents playing that out of context dude I got five words for you grab them by the pussy that guy's the president I think he is an aberration I do I don't think there's anything else that can get away with that kind of stuff I think you probably right he's definitely an aberration but Al Franken one is the senator as a comedian but he was a writer like there wasn't a ton and he got in trouble when there was a photo of him I've sent out more than a photo there was actually all the allegations but that let the photo you know perception politics is perception and and whatever people see it's different than what they hear and what they believe and so that's the point that photo was harmless but it looked bad just like any joke I said or anything that I've said out of context so I just feel like and then I thought that it you know I they could destroy me in any future earning potential that I could have I just the second episode of my podcast that interviewed Tim Ryan you know he is he was running for a president because I was asking what does it take and it's four so you got a run you had a raise a million dollars from people and individuals you don't like you don't want to be affiliated with but you have to you got to make compromises that that the whole system is so filled and corrupted with money in almost every district in every state regardless of the office and how do you how does a person I'm a fairly affluent guy I'm a white straight guy whatever but I couldn't if I don't know how I can afford to apply for a job for a year and pay my mortgage so I want to do it if it looks feasible and if I don't have to take care of my family my parents not to mention you know pay my bills but it's you have to be an independently wealthy person which sucks because wreck it makes it much harder for regular people there's plenty of exceptions to run for for office now when you say that you had to give them an envelope and that you had to what did you have to do to Jeff to support them intermediaries you have to say basically you have to basically say I'm not going to interfere with your business we'll just look the other way to say that that's what I'm told that was what I was told by Iran how are you told this you told this like hey if you ever want to be congressman no you have to do this don't make you do but if you but if you don't want to win it's you're far more likely to win a few if you follow likely it's not impossible but they'll they'll try to destroy you if you don't really yeah I can't it's like Joe will just go after you can destroy if it's just making you say who this is because I don't know it's positively true I need another source I try to act like a journalist and someone who's the intermediary like what kind of person is this he managed campaigns in that district he knows everything about the politics of and the special interest in that history could potentially be that he's hoeing you out absolutely which is why I won't tell you because and once he's saying that so that he's he's like sort of playing both sides and he wants I'm sure he did but he might also want to maintain his relations possible with whatever group this is so he says hey I've got an assurance knowing this guy I don't think he he's affiliated with that group but it's possible and and so I try to but you don't have journalistic ethics before I would say something I'll tell you off the mic okay but I but I wouldn't wait for the show to be over but I wouldn't say without having a second source like that's what's responsible about so much of our media right like when when Trump or anybody says fake news it's like listen it's not it you can't if you have to have two sources you go to your editor with those two sources and then you can print it you can't make them up if you make up a source you're you're you're like Mencia that's it you're done you can't that's like stealing a joke you can't make up a source you'll never work again it would be worse when you make up a joke I mean if you make up a source I mean you didn't work when C is still working fair enough people do journalism and comedians are a lot different I mean this the worst if you if someone finds that you making up a source yet nobody does it in in the few in the few instances where someone did make up a source or even plagiarize that which of the two worst things you can do is journalists they never work again or they don't work for a very long time you know Johann Hari he's been on your show he's been on my show he was accused of some like I think it was plagiarism yeah and it took him a really long time to win his integrity back I didn't find that out actually until after he'd been on the second time yeah but like what great guy he's a great guy what was he accused of I don't remember it was I feel like it might have been plagiarism though and and that kind of thing the point is that kind of thing ruins you and so I wouldn't come here and do that even though I don't I wouldn't call myself a journalist but I would want because of what you're saying cuz you're smart yeah I'm very skeptical too of people and their source of what their interests are and a lot of people really want me to run for Congress for a lot of different reasons but mainly because they think I can tap my network of wealthy people and you know they can make money love Trump or hate Trump that is precisely what he was talking about when he said drain the swamp now this is the swamp this sort of this sort of convoluted world of influence well yes and now the swamp yeah but it's also money and all the other things that he didn't drain and he actually brought in people that were he made the swamp swampy er way it's filled with malaria in crocodiles like like I always we don't even define things unfortunately we don't the same baseline unfortunately in this country of what what words mean but I've always thought what that meant was is government corruption that the private sector is influencing government because in the way that they obviously do it the system that we have is you have to get money from wealthy people and wealthy interests and then you have to advocate for them whatever the interest is you have to or they won't give you more money and so that's what's beautiful bot Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders they are not allowing any donations from any super PACs from any wealthy individuals it's it's grassroots and then Chelsea's doing that as well yeah a handful of more of the whole Democratic Party mostly committed to it I don't think Biden's doing it but the if Biden was doing it I don't think he remembers I totally agree with that by the way he's out I'll listen I don't think you should be running for president oh if you're 75 I think the same about Bernie and Biden all three of them are all my dad some people are 75 and they're very lucid my dad is in the best shape of any man I know do just had a heart attack Bernie Sanders just had a heart attack yeah like it when you get older especially has a man get breakdown yeah but it's like who has the energy plus I just think younger people like just have more of an actual interest and understanding of what's happening that's why Andrew Yang is so attractive yes yeah I know I agree with that but I think that there's I mean it depends entirely in the individual there's 75 year olds that are healthy and there's 75 year olds I disagree because you could be the healthiest 75 year old in the world did everything right and then she can just shut down because you're 75 your body's just old it's possible but it's it's not the the actuary you know possibilities are just far higher but you're you're balancing things out right you also have wisdom and experience or education so person maybe I mean Bernie Sanders is one of my heroes but I want him to just you know not endorse Elizabeth Warren and get it over with well first of all being a president is a ridiculous proposition period yeah and it's an antiquated idea ain't great to have one alpha absolutely runs this whole cycle show yes it's a great idea when there's 50 people in a try yeah yes chief yeah but not a president of 330 million people that is an outsized influence and a bully pulpit and then and then has this that we have this reverence for them and this defense of them or this attacking of their their every move their every character and it's just such an easy thing to dunk on them and it's just tiresome to me oh yeah it's unhealthy for the country too it's unhealthy for all of us it's unhealthy for our souls every single day especially like like the thing that you miss about pre Trump well whoever it was Republican or Democrat like I remember when you used up weekends like you could no policy that's internet though let's see alright there's a lot of that have you seen Trump's religious advisor yes how wonderful is that she the woman who says if you if you don't support Trump you're going against God yes yes can we play any of that it's it I mean I don't think so it's not that vit that video I don't think we can play okay that's too bad I can do what I think you don't support President Trump then you are going against God and it's like yeah I'm not going against God those people those people are so effective as like I think comics can really relate to them they're so good at performing what's so convincing yeah if you and if you know kinnison was one of those right right he was a preacher right he's one of the yeah who could turn into a comic he had that skill set it Trump is the same way the way he stalks the stage and works the audience I mean it's very very effective but it's also for to say that if you don't support a certain politician like to me that stuff is so it's very boring come on there's a binary bullshit but she's a horseshit artist no matter what I mean yeah that's what she does she's trying to get low frequency people she catches these nine-volt brains Paul away now just reached new advisor ratchets of rhetoric denounces demonic networks opposing president's calling Demond she's wonderful I bet that lady does coke and I bet she likes it right in the booty I think that every time you see parties every time you see one of these people I just have a knee-jerk reaction when I see a Catholic priests I'm like oh yeah when I see one of these people I'm like they're completely contradicting you know these are gay conversion that have come out away yeah they're banging guys oh hi all the time remember Ted Haggard do I owe a massage I'll bet you just well paid math or no smooth-skinned yeah of course I would know sighs Ted Haggard without met really black men accolade see he's forget what he said he said something like you know after Sunday service you know what should we do and I said how about meth and blow jobs and that was it boom that's actually what they do it's a joke but it's also for obably what you know he seemed like such a nice guy - but it's so sad - not really though did you ever see the thing with him and Dawkins when he got really nasty with you Wow yeah yeah that was before he actually got in trouble - this was wrong I was when he was Serina filled with back to ego yeah when you have when you think so much of you and your ideas and you come up in that case and Haggard versus Richard Dawkins is like Mike Tyson versus a baby is something lower yeah something much lower that's as a fetus and there's no match and so you're gonna lose your shit you know I love those debates on super frustrated but I'm so he's frustrated that you know Dawkins had Dawkins has an arrogance about him you know this yes scientist tender yeah but he does pretty specifics particularly well I had him in here recently we was talking about life after death that he thinks the lights just go out and I'm like well maybe but we know we don't know I don't think I don't have any experience with what happens when you die I really have no idea it would be very interesting if there was some sort of dimensional travel thing that happens to the spirit of the soul or whatever this concept of consciousness is how much have do you think about your mortality sure on a regular I try not to it doesn't do any good right but when it comes in what do you do you know try to be nice to the people I know try to try to be kind to the people that I care about that's an interesting answer when I said to you is that when you think about your own death what do you do I just try to be a good person I love that smell of that do any what while here I want as little bad feelings as possible it's impossible to have no bad feelings right so whatever I can do to mitigate that I try how have you worked on your anger and had that dissipate like what's the best thing exercise Fraser says the big one yeah because I think a lot of my anger is just caveman genetics so and then a fucked-up childhood too so up in a violent household and being around a lot of violence like I also had to deal with them I grew up essentially all throughout high school and toils 22 fighting so I was always invasive as an ally for your emotions yeah wells also developed my human potential his martial arts was competition but but it's also there's a downside of that that I grew up like being praised for explosive violence mmm that's wrong yeah yeah I mean it was in competition it was it was agreed upon I was doing it with other trained killers but it's still that's that's a weird thing to get past I yeah I have an example of I mean you I'm sure you have a billion of money mean to cut you off but when my daughter was like three years old you were visiting family and people I don't really know my wife's family and his five-year-old son goes over my daughter's just looking up at the TV this little three-year-old girl and he comes over and he just clocks her knocks her over and we're all like oh my god what what and the dad comes over and just starts beating the shit out of his five-year-old and I just started giving I'm like that's why he did it that's why he did it he you learn what you live you know and children learn what they live and so when your so when you're but what you're saying when you when you train when you exercise are their feelings are their emotions coming out or is it energy that you just expend energy yes it's thinking them down when you're not like angry at my child or anything when I'm hitting the bag no I'm just exercising I also when I'm running or doing yoga or anything I'm doing a strenuous I just had this conversation with Ben Westhoff who was on here before you the way I described it as I think that a human body has a certain amount of physical requirements I think there's but your body's a system and this system is designed through nature natural selection and hundreds of thousands of years of being human beings to have issues that come up and to be physically prepared to to deal with those issues whether it's a neighboring tribe invades you and animals trying to attack you or you're just trying to hunt and gather food all those things are built into our system it takes tens of thousands of years for that DNA to shift and change become something different so we have a certain amount of physical requirements that were just born with and it's different with every person some people have less some people have more I tend to be on the high side and I'm a different person when I exercise I'm a different person when I when I get time to sleep correctly and eat correctly and exercise I'm different and I like that balance better that's a nicer person I like that guy better so I try to be that guy as much as I can but I have a million different people living inside my brain all the time bouncing around fighting for dominance really oh yeah this is like it is a director they try to keep them all in order which is like the the consciousness like is it but he's got a strong lot all right then Oh everybody has it there's always things like you're a better person when you're well-rested life is going well for sure fit you you had great interactions with your family great interaction with your friends and then you run into someone on the street versus you just got fired from your job you walked in and your wife's sucking the plumber off you you have all these things now anime just now all those things can have a live my job I go home there's my wife leave the plumber or a different person now I ended upon what what you encounter in your life I completely agree with that but it's it's it's a practice I like that way yeah and you have to practice it every day and you find out you're not gonna fix right right you know you can't better you're just gonna get better at forming the good habits we're about therapy I don't do that never did no but I do get an isolation tank what I've done a lot of psychedelics I was gonna ask you about that I'm thinking about trying that you should I feel like that's gonna do it right now part of your life yeah yeah right now shrooms you ever done mushrooms now like no I can't I mean I would like to if I do it I want to deal with you for sure okay but I got a long night ahead of me I think Oh what are you doing tonight like family oh I haven't seen a lot of time that gave me different balls I probably don't want to microdose microdose is not a bad way to get through a day can you drive with it oh I wouldn't recommend it yeah okay I don't know where I am I'm gonna rent the car yeah I really want to do it I'm ready for it but I feel nothing huh you've done nothing no I mean we every day yeah that's been my saving grace mmm yeah you got any of those Kevin Smith's no no I don't want to smoke a little weed on on the show because I feel like it makes me for both well you're already verbose you talk for a living something wrong with that but it makes me even worse and I want to crusty and broken don't worry about it we can do it towards the end whatever I love ya but for me that I didn't my brother was in rehab when I was 16 he was 18 I love that you're scanning the room Kevin Smith joints we own the table okay so uh what's that right there double tube right there Jamie that's hilarious there's just stuff everywhere what's that oh there's one what is this this ashtray filled with treasures mm-hmm but I didn't touch any alcohol or drugs so I was like 25 my brother was in rehab with do an intervention it was nuts and I was like I knew I wanted to be a comic and I thought that if I did anything it would affect me it would distract me you loser no no it would just make me pursue that and not my dreams this is the other thing like it you see if I if I take a hit off this and I still want to run for Congress like it shouldn't matter this is how I deal like well it's as Eagle you know told you I know but ranked yep of course it's preposterous to judge but people do yeah but I think the generation that's coming up will judge less the generation after then will judge less and it's just where we're living with the echoes of reefer madness right we're living with Harry Anslinger and William Randolph Hearst work in the 1930 lot a lot of acting people look them up yeah no doubt but I think that you say they're the echoes and I think they're pretty loud sir they pretty loud in certain parts of the country yeah hmm and it's it's hard to measuring about being a congressman it's here representing a district one of the guys is I become really good friends that he was a Republican congressman name is Trey Radel and he's the guy who got named he got from Florida he got ready Radel he got kicked out of Congress for buying that cocaine from a Fed you remember that no I don't it was like three years again I don't pay that much attention to politics I think politics is like baseball like some people just watch the World Series and some people watch College and the look at fuckin first-round draft picks and oh I'm addicted to it yeah I was that's another nice thing and not having to be live every day and not having to know every single step of everything of going on because you realize that you're a very small minority of people when you found out that thing when you were told that thing by that guy sure this does not always do look there's plenty of it when you were told that thing about the guy who was that you know the congressman job you know that you would you're gonna have to bribe play ball was that well did you feel like letdown yeah like almost like okay I've been promoting a rigged game because now I know how well I know intimately how rigged the game is it's just that you don't always know where and who the players are now I mean I've done enough right but isn't it you're an honest person you're not you're not a bullshit artist I hope isn't I do but so if you're a part of a bullshit system right it's almost like you can't to be who you are you almost like can't be a congressperson you just no system what you just said almost made me want to cry don't because well I get very emotional when it when someone pings a truth mmm that's what happens to me I'm like Jesus I can't believe he just said that my brother who's my moral compass my older brother is radical like ridiculous radically different person he's like said just what you said right before I came over here because the problem with you running is that do you really buy in to this corrupt system and I think because I'm such an optimist and such a positive thinking person I've convinced myself and that I do know a lot of people in Congress know them personally and intimately and I know a lot of people that work in government that I really admire but the system it's not the people as much as the system but I also think that the way I don't want to talk about it in a way that that exonerates the public like we have to not be apathetic that's what my show has always been about it wasn't always a confusing title stand up because I'm a comic but it meant stand up for something it meant care about something you should be don't be apathetic the united states of apathy we can't sit here and blame the systems that we are complicit and watch you watch these you watch this fucking every weekend in Hong Kong every weekend they stand up for their democracy in four months right that's the biggest story that'll be the biggest story of the of 2019 and maybe the decade because they are fighting off China it's unbelievable meanwhile I just feel like we're just so come we're just so comfortable and Hong Kong used to be a part of Great Britain right yeah and until like what 90 something when they had to give it back after it like it was a 100-year agreement or something like this is so crazy by trying to deal with China's like listen we're not gonna bother you you could keep doing what you're doing and then they started bothering them and they said no we're gonna you're ours now now behave because that's so much more power and leverage and then human being stood up now they're doing it in Chile and now they're doing it in Iraq people are protesting and they're getting shot the the the greatest thing that I was ever a part of in media was probably well there was a lot of good things but CNN and Sirius XM's coverage of the Egyptian revolution it was a fucking amazing and that was some of those organized by social medias actually exactly the same thing in Iran and the Green Revolution of 2009 and what's interesting to me about this whole Hong Kong thing is that they they're being introduced to the government of China over the last few it's that this was something they were they were separated from and then all of a sudden they become property of China again essentially right and so then you're seeing this this thing where they become accustomed to the British way of things and near the Hong Kong original Hong Kong way of doing things and then things shift over it's a really unique moment of protest because it's very rare that you see the the actual government of a country shift the way it has in Hong Kong where I mean correct me if I'm wrong well I don't I don't profess to be an expert in revolution but this is what the conversation is about right now it's watching people in other parts of the world going out in the streets risking their lives literally and meanwhile in America why don't we what is it that will get us unified and and out in the streets what is that issue and who thinks things get us unified that's particularly disaster yeah of course 9/11 I was in New York what I'm saying about that yeah that was a big one I was a Chilean Tory communicate a billion story what I'm saying though is like we've never seen like in our time we've never seen a government shift over right you've never seen that kind of a shift where a free democratic sort of Western way of running things all sudden shifts over and because of that I think the the the resistance to it is very unique I think if you studied the British colonization of the world there would be a lot of that that's what we're talking about literally because it was Britain yeah and then I can't speak to the specifics of the history of that but it's what you're bringing up is a fascinating question that I'd love to get to the bottom of and maybe a billion people would be so good on it well you it's so important people stand up for something in care yeah but I think even with our limited understanding of the history of it this is one thing we know for sure they're what they used to be under Britain and now they're not and now they're under China and we're watching this resistance and we're seeing these people hundreds and hundreds of thousands of them in the streets yeah you know what my favorite part of it all was there was one time where an ambulance how to get through and all the people from Hong Kong's just stolen less than the right and they let the ambulance go through and I'm like whoa good luck with that in Boston this fucking not gonna have a bro look at this look at this video man I mean this is incredible look this is this is what my brother and a lot of people who I respect and admire but maybe I'm not courageous enough to challenge our system or want to see here no for something but what's it for well right now I can't beat climate well the hustle is the right versus left right right that's the that's not in the real hustle is the fact that people get ideologically driven and they pick a side and they believe you know the problem is these fucking liberals these fucking pussy liberals and then you know it's a problem as these racists these white racist assholes like yes I love your liberal man morally man more more I want that this is a character that should definitely break ass shit man I should bring him out every now and then man it's like fucking heteronormative bullshit right but these characters but the problem is these are patterns of behavior that people slide into and that's why you know we were talking about putting people in boxes people love to be able to put you in that pattern I want to find out who you are who are you are you a liberal well you're a libertarian are you a mean person are you a nice person who are you my trick for my mom when she would be telling whoever what her son does well he hosts the radio he's a comedian and he hosts a radio show Oh what's his radio show about oh he talks about all kinds of news and issues and politics Oh is he a liberal or conservative they immediately want to know that and what is a shit racist or a cuck cuck please my mom the answer it really is it's it's really under racial I hope they keep it I hope no it doesn't become racist or something you know it's one of those words where it's like I hope it doesn't slip away from us but we have it right now we can enjoy it I think it's silenced a lot of nonsense by calling somebody a kook you really can't it's like whoo and it's been overused for sure but it's because it's the not in text message is recent and so effective it's just got such a pop to it when someone calls someone a cock especially if there's a ring of truth to it you know I like it most use when you say something endearing I'll text my brother he's the kind of person who will use it maybe to me stop being such a kook I'll be like I love you bro you saving me my brother's like my hero I'm like he's always there for me he wrote my first stand-up material in high school when I was hosting a talent show and he was getting kicked out of the house I had no material and I was doing Dana Carvey impressions hosting the talent show and I had no material and I walked out and I see a whole script that my brother had written Wow then let me down that's even though he's high and drunk didn't let me down but it's the guy's the best writing for you I'll say something endearing to him like that loving and then you get back a cock like that kind of response like when you don't yeah perfect I'm not even actually now don't even know if he is actually using that or if I'm just high I'm sure used it it's a good word back to revolution like why can't it and what you're saying the hustle I love that discussion because everything is about defining so my answer my mom would give excuse me getting back to that was well he talks about issues so you know that's what he talks about but they want to pin you into something so they can know how to feel about you to like or to hate you are you on my team are you not and that is destroys it is so destructive it is and the other thing is the resistance to what you're saying the resistance is toxic to because people think no it's it's important that you take aside it's important that we deep platform Nazis they say things like that you're like well fucking Nazi stop look they're real Nazis and the problem is you start calling everybody a Nazi and then one day you meet a real one and you ran out of words you fucking cried wolf this is a different Nazis and you when people feel like you're treating them unfairly or talking shit about them and this is a problem we have both in the right yeah and the left yeah they fucking double down they dig their heels in and they go fuck that other group it's team red all the way fuck you it's team blue is so destructive and watching it is so sad and being a part of it when we are is the problem and trying to the answer to that the solution to that is to try to listen to each other and to try to understand because I completely agree with you that they medon't feel respected you've lost them completely on we can't people enjoy it like a team like when the Celtics win people get pumped when the Republicans win people get pumped you know it's it's like when the Democrats win people get pumped it's their team I had a friend of mine the comic who said you know we got to win the house because if we win the house we win the White House I'm like what are you talking about what is we what is we are we in this are you running for something don't know about like they have to I do feel that way about sports by the way bro I think when we say we've you're not on the team it's the Giants you're not a giant you're out here it's not exercising and it's the same thinking it's the same thinking people attach themselves I remember when I was a kid I was a big fan of this guy named Donald Curry he was this badass boxer this world champion welterweight champion he was a fucking beast and then one day he got knocked out and by this guy Mike McCallum the Body Snatcher he was a he was another world champion a bad motherfucker and he hit him with a left hook to the body and a left hook to the head and knocked him out cold flat on his back I couldn't believe it he was my favorite boxer and he just got knocked out and I felt so bad I couldn't take it I put my running shoes on and I ran out of the house and I ran for like a fucking mile and I was just so worked up I was probably like 17 I think somewhere around then 16 17 don't remember um maybe a little later 18th the latest I turned around and went walked home I ran like a mile and a half a mile whatever I turned around I just walked home I'm never gonna get upset about someone I don't even know losing like that but that was a team thing Rick I was on Team curry and like people really literally do that with fighters I feel like I have a litmus test that I feel like I fall victim to the criticism that you're you're laying out on the planet on environmental stuff like I feel so panicky and so anxious about that and I care so much about and for me it's it is religion like it's a spiritual connection to nature that it brings me so much joy to be in it and around it and professing it and to see us destroy it by the way we're we're living like I feeI I'm one of those people that feels guilty about I rail against single-use plastic which is why I want to advocate for you guys to get a budget you know bigger yeah we should tank and everybody about that because if you if you do that today if you made that choice just get a big thing and a glass or mugs and Salim and raise money or something then re would come by and dose the bucket you can't have a bottled water around with Ari Ari Shaffir gave gave at like a plate of pot cookies years ago at Stan County club my wife does not did she did she didn't didn't now went to take it took a sniff of it and she's like oh no and Ari said I'm sorry she is no good with the weed the edibles especially when animals are rough on you she once had like a whole KitKat because she was hungry then went to the sink and was washing her hands and just said this water is so wet that's some headphones on yeah when you look at that Hong Kong thing right yeah you know I don't think we need a revolution I think we need a resolution like I think we need to click relax and come to this understanding like most of stuff we fight about is because we're tricked into this tribal way of thinking I don't mean tricked by some overlords I mean tricked by your own biology we have a natural inclination to form teams and we have a natural in because there's only two real ones I mean you could be one of them fucking dudes there's only independent music and you you always vote Green Party but for the most part there's two parties right when it comes to like national politics and when we think about whoever the fuck's gonna win whether we think about what the real important thing is the economy or protecting our borders or you think the real important thing is the environment and stopping global warming we've got to do something to engineer like biodegradable plastics and make the mandatory and whatever it whatever thing becomes your side and you know but make arguments for both sides the problem is people then subscribe to whatever ideas are in that party you know they see you could almost pick two a person if you're pro-life you're probably pro but when you said you know we're doing well or you know relax we're doing well I react to that with working with and advocating for all these anti-poverty organizations what do you mean relax we're doing well I felt like you were saying like when everybody is getting fired up I misunderstood you it was like I don't think we need a revolution but I think instead of thinking about it like a competition between two teams greed we should think about it as a resolution we should resolve our issues and what our issues is being tribal absolutely agree that's the entire problem and I'll do anything to work with you or anybody else on furthering that conversation because that's all bullshit a theatrical manufacturer shit that you're / your neighbor because of any number of stupid and that we're not talking because of that I believe that our species can do a lot better that's normal that's the thing it's like normal to not like people that you know you look at the source conservative it's normal if you're a liberal to not like them if you're a conservative it's normal to think these fucking silly liberals they're gonna ruin everything don't put them in that box what kind of a man is he what kind of a father that's that's how I evaluate men or women what kind of a partner what kind of a parent that's I just watch them behave with their kids Brian I don't think about what they think about guns right if I find that stuff out later than we talk about it but how what kind of a role model are you for your children is how I evaluate another man yeah I don't know if that's a good measure home that's what I do I don't wanna think about what showy watches or what kind of car he drives or what his job is how it what kind of a man is he what kind of a father a role model a contributor to society does he care about other people and other things what is he what is his morality not not perfect yeah I mean I don't know but that's not that why is that is that is that abnormal isn't that how we all should be isn't how LR to some extent I think this resonates with a lot of people that are listening there's a lot of people that try very hard to do that there's a lot of people that also escape the grips of tribal thinking as they get older and wiser sure I think I'm one of those and a lot of people one of those I am till I hope and I think one of the ways that you help it is by having these conversations so people listen and then it resonates with them and maybe it only resonates to a certain degree and maybe it's they slip away from it a week later when they're drinking and hanging out with their friends or or their dings those two the ideas you know very often and when they do it's it's not as effective as it would be if they're around people that were like-minded but that's just having these conversations you know you're affecting like right now we're affecting a lot of different people's thinking right they're listening to this and then go a lot of interactions could have been different on both sides depending upon what you did like sometimes you run into someone in their douchey but if you just turned around a little bit so it's alright brother yes and then they've relaxed and they go oh he's okay but if you've ramped it up and they ramped it up more you can go that guy's a piece of shit well yeah he acted like a piece of shit but maybe part of the way he act like a piece of shit was the way you dealt with his initial weirdness because sometimes people are just fucking weird and sometimes people come off douchey people are complex people are so complex and so rooted in someone I mean I I just go straight to interviewing I've interviewed murderers and rapists who feel hungry that's murder I sang gory I think his last name is Shakti Singh Gore he wrote a book he changed my life he killed a guy when he's 18 with the prison served 19 years and got out and wrote a book and he redemption like he felt like how did he get there to murdering somebody and how did he become the man that he was that's the way to measure a man and so he did the worst thing so when you say you have this idea about any number of issues from race 2 to energy issues to guns to abortion to feminism to all the stuff it's like well where is where did he start mmm who were his role models you know there's so much data about the zip code that you're born into in this gun three determines where you'll be when you're 18 and it's so accurate it's so hard to get out of certain places I heard you and someone talking about that it was Dakota Meyer who was amazing that was a love that whole interview was fascinating really interesting guy and nothing but respect for that guy but talking about America as like this place where it's the greatest place to get a head like it's not it's so hard to get ahead here in some spots and some spots own and way too many spots if there's so many reasons to you if you're talking about impoverished neighborhoods that have a history of crime and violence because they don't fix that and it doesn't change and it's really hard to get ahead if you're in that well i but in other places if you're doing what if you're in a nice city and you're in a nice neighborhood it is difficult but it's compared to the rest of the world it's I'm just talking about social mobility Morgan what's up in terms of being able to move up a rung in the ladder okay I feel like that's only true in impoverished areas they're riddled with crime and drugs but that's not how its measured but I mean but I'm thinking if you're talking about places where things are doing well right yeah and you're comparing them to the rest of the world this is one of the easiest places to get ahead ever that's ever existed because there's only if you start in a certain spot if you start at the bottom in America it's almost impossible why the media loves to focus and Americans love to focus on it even their stem cell so many people say you listen I started with nothing and and now I'm a major success and so they don't then have sympathy for somebody else I'm like that's your story to tell what would your last una tease you were your role models what did you have did you up healthcare did you have universal pre-k that's like that's the bottom line if you have universal pre-k all over this country this whole country would be so much more intelligent that's what all the education data says that's what every other country does we don't have it but what we do have is just so many fucked up budget priorities the budget is a moral document it means where your values lie and you spend what on health care what on defense what on anti poverty what on nutrition what on edge occasion yes that's how I determined by the way in a thoughtful conversation not only are you a liberal not argue a liberal or conservative and you know pro or anti-government it's how do you think we should spend our tax money where should we spend it around the world and domestically and in terms of India it's like we have this huge defense budget with these weapons that will never be used and Russia beat us with Facebook and North Korea hacked into Sony it's like that's where the threat is right let me ask you this when it comes to defense because that's always an interesting subject there's two arguments right there's this pro-military argument that is you have to have a certain amount of military might all over the world we have to be the world's policemen because if we're not someone else will and we are protecting America by doing this and we fight them over there so that we can be free over here right that's the pro argument the anti argument would be you could do everything that you need to do to protect us with less money and you could take that money and inject it into these inner cities that are impoverished and crime ridden and you could in my words that's why I always like to say if you want to make America greater what's the best way to do that well have less losers have less people that are losing the game opportunity hards when they were young give people health care and education give them an opportunity to succeed it's not that hard most of us got it but the pro-military argument would be okay that is not gonna work that we will get fucked over by another country and then no one will have an advantage like we have to maintain a certain amount of power worldwide well I'm not this is not my argument okay I'm just no it's but I would reject the binary on its face because it's a thoughtful binary and I'd love to answer it but it's so much more geopolitical and filled in history and then technology and so now I think if I am going to answer the question it's like the threat the threats that were fake the threat matrix this is a way to look at it like what are the you know existential threats nuclear war and any kind of geopolitical what kind of conventional war it's everything's online in terms of the the way that we countries are fighting you so it's all going on locks all transparent well I don't know if it's transparent it is some worse but the point I would like to say like how is the department of defense not only focused on saving the planet that's it that's it just do that everybody wins I think it's complicated man well I think it's way more complicated than we would ever understand I think to be a military leader in 2019 to be making decisions one way or another why not you attack people who good luck with all that good luck with trying to figure out how to kill terrorists and do it live on television while the president's watching from the fucking Oval Office or whatever really happened and they gave us golf anything was golfing yeah that was a whole weird situation how would the picture afterwards like I know what a posed picture looks like every single one of those pictures it does it does look bad when every one of those pictures are coming all the Oval Office is a bunch of white dudes well God wants you to wear makeup and God wants you to sit right there that's right God wants that right oh we don't people don't talk enough man there's too many of us that's a lot of what you're leading I think that one of the reasons why you're doing so well is because they can't you're you're leading the conversation about how the conversation should be yeah I hope as evidence from what we're saying well so - I'm just happy people enjoy it but the the conversations that we're not having we're not having enough of his face-to-face one-on-one like this everyone's distracted you can't get to know people over sound bites you definitely can't get to know them through text messages or little tiny snippets of a conversation that they're gonna have for the commercial they get to know a person is very easy you just look at their internet history you find out what kind of porn they like oh my god they're like great as bit I mean it's the idea that you know Facebook your social media is what you want people think you're doing here's my family and the Bahamas like if you had a video of me melting down just smoking weed and feeling my heart thumping and sweating because I'm having a panic attack it's like that's your internet history like you're looking up every lump that you find mm-hmm right and you go down weird rabbit holes you find out about strange diseases okay very unhealthy all day today about minor things was what I saw your tweet about that I was like now don't put it out don't put it out there it's interesting as hell it's terrifying because the idea like I always get so worried especially that one because it's like rot trail running is my favorite way to run I love it too and this way then you got eyeball worms man but kids are terrified to go outside there's some amazing organization children and nature Network everybody should discover and support and and look up the work of Richard Louv who's just written a new book about relationships you'll love it with animals and humans and he wrote a book her last child in woods is my Bible changed my life and kids are afraid to go outside because there's ticks there's Lyme disease there's parents afraid that there's kidnapping no there isn't that is definitely Lyme disease well yeah but you just be vigilant yeah but Lyme disease is really it's a horrible pressing several people I live in Rockland County me too horrible don't get me wrong but we can't not send our kids outside no I agree cut your lawn and check your kids for ticks right yeah you gotta be vigilant but the kids have to stay out they have to be outside to appreciate you know dried ya know the connection to nature that's what it's all about it so it all works together the idea that we're drinking out of bottles that are made of petroleum and that's what plastic is this is gonna be here for 700 years unless we melt it and make cool shit out of it let's take some ideas well go to the calls do you know boy onslaught is he's that guy oh yeah the guy collecting the plastic yeah that's kid I was going to make everybody else look he's like accomplished like 19 he's like I am 18 and I'm going to take all of the plastic out of the ocean like what as I do and I was bashing mailboxes the first one didn't work it was like he didn't know shit he's like yeah that one is a prototype we're trying to make it work look the next one works he's still only twenty shear fur hanging now people are hating on why all we have why are we tribal on getting plastic getting rid of this horrible single-use plastic wood because it's connected to ego because someone who's 19 years old figured out how to do some shit that you've never figured out how to do he's a better person in you fine no it's fine it's a game I'm no you're not that's why you're happy when his machine breaks like haha never I don't know that mentality I don't understand that mentality that that that one roost and if I understand it but I don't feel it I'm not rooting for your pain if I don't like your opinions I don't want you to get sick I don't want you to even get your finger crunch in the garage door I don't want you to have pain I think it's the same sort because of your valise it's the same thing that leads people to be tribal it's also leads people to be jealous it's the same kind of thing it's like a pattern of thinking that's easy to slide into it's like a a well-oiled shoot you just you can break you can ignite you can name that and acknowledge it for your kids that's what you're doing that's what I'm doing hopefully like that's what that is don't fit all into those veins people I think by the way are mostly good all day yes all day most of my interactions I'm walking out the door with this lady out of the bank and we both work at the same time we're both like oh sorry both our faults have a good one little smiles like that's most interactions that I have at least but us I'm very attractive you're a handsome man I agree with you though I think that's that is the case and and also it has to do with how you interact with those people and we've all been guilty of being loaded up in one way or another interacting with someone and it doesn't go as well as it could have gone if you were in a better place when you met that person it's all about reactions it's the second time you you mentioned that and that's the most important thing I've learned in therapy and with my wife it's if you choose how to react to a situation or a comment and everything rides in that reaction potentially your life mm-hmm I figure which book it is whether it's it's one of those ancient philosophy books but I've never forgot this term nothing has any meaning other than the meaning that you give it yeah it's whatever it is tragedy or positive thing look Fisher it's a tragedy it's very difficult it's not what we see is how we see it yes but talk regular moments in your life like the worst case scenario for a person is approaching any moment in their life and being like woe is me goddammit why is it always happen to happen to me why the instead of having a perspective like look how lucky I am that my real concern to someone keep my car the reason and I look at that and I say why is that person always saying blow is me why I yeah but why where's it come from the natural pattern it's like it's a role modeling that's why you have to give people an opportunity to break out of that we are so evolved we are so far probably too evolved that we've created plastic bottle that we're killing ourselves you know but we're killing ourselves with plastic balls we're seven billion people there's just too many people that's a lot do you buy into the argument that the more westernized or the more advanced society gets the population actually starts to decrease because there there are certain cities that they point to where that's on the trend I think Japan I think Tokyo is one of them but the idea is that as people as a civilization advances people decide to pursue careers before having children and less and less people have children and that there's some sort of a direct correlation with the amount of children people have versus the amount of technological advancement is around them and the amount of Education and yeah the level of the city like if you're an around a place like me it's generally education yes yeah education base because it's - I think affluence has something to do it is well affluence usually comes with education sometimes usually you could be any nut you could have examples of people who came from absolutely nothing in general art the fact that overcame and to become you know a CEO of McDonald's and then have to step down because their own business isn't sure you know yeah I mean a lot of it and nothing but certainly I have nothing but I look at someone who's started a business and ran a business from a dry-cleaning store to it whatever they're doing my dad owned a an insurance agency in Syracuse New York that's what my dad did and my mom was a public schoolteacher and it's like so I saw the public and private sector that was my role model that's a good combination to to grow up with and I had health care and I had nursery school my mom was a early childhood at she had an associate's degree my dad didn't go to college shout-out to my pop by the way I just had a heart attack and ruined his eye how bad the Czar can't see how it's not surgery number three dude just wrapped up forty four years as a ski instructor oh and he's a competitive sight list ripped up broke every bonus body's fucking man steal what is the damage to the eye that doesn't want him to see I can't explain it but it's a laceration he was on his you know blood centers he fainted and bounced his face off the table mmm lacerated his eye has a big impact on whether or not he heals quick right oh yeah and he's all filled blood so he can't see out of it and my dad is like oh my dad is a very physically healthy guy so it's at aging man it's tough I mean that's where my situation is my mom and dad married 48 years but that's you know my dad I look at my dad and I he's a great story in America he didn't go to college he started his own insurance agency did well supported us we live in the suburbs Marsalis New York it was crazy about America it's only 300 years old and the idea of a new America is out of the fucking question right the idea of someone coming along the millions of years of life on this planet and the hundreds of thousands of years of being humans and that 300 whatever almost years of the United States if someone said we're gonna start a new country now and some we found a new spot in New Zealand or Greenland or something you like fuck you you can't do that you can't do that today will say do you think I think everything's changing everything is changing but if first of all anyone who people would be super suspicious well yeah if you were gonna start a new country there you go that guy's just gonna fall all the women ah well there's a lot of that I mean that's that's a lot of the world right now yeah well that's a lot of why you would start your own country yeah but that's why that has almost probably always been this is a reason that's been leader right there would have to be someone who says listen this is how we're gonna do this we're gonna we're gonna have like an open-ended Constitution we could amend it whenever we see fit instead of having a present well have a counsel I'm not I'm all for a blown up system and redoing it to make it more equitable however you describe I'm gonna need nukes okay cuz the North Koreans are fucking around the Russians are always shifting those Chinese man they're plotting things I think they're gonna try to cancel our internet a fact that we haven't Chancellor you made it sound like through the cable company record the fact that we haven't had an accident who is it schlosser Eric Schlosser wrote this book and documentary is fascinating history of accidents and close calls is nuts and we got it we got to get rid of all nukes yeah like all thinking people believe that it's so crazy that was a horrible statement what I just said by the way long that's by the way a great example of a condescending thing for a person to say into a microphone well thinking people think blank stop it but it's also one of those things where it doesn't help to say it even if it is correct it is true all thinking people agree with me no one is gonna go wow I didn't I don't want to be considered a nun exactly that's why Pete yeah that's why I nailed it's like but it's like people yelling into a microphone what is wrong with you you must be an unthinking personally I don't want to be yelled at a day this girl once when I was 21 and she'd get upset about shit she was older than me and she was smarter than me too but uh she would she got upset once and I said we just please just please relax she goes no one who's upset ever wants to hear you saying relax then doesn't work hmm I thought about that I was like damn she's right that doesn't work someone says relax relax doesn't work it just doesn't work like dude you don't go thank you I mean sometimes you do but you have to be not very wound up and you have to really love the person who's telling you to relax no it's a it's an absolute condescension yeah I've done that a hundred times to my wife she nails me every time mm-hmm every time I remember thinking that's a 21 year old Savage going on Carl sheesh uh okay she's right that makes sense yeah I don't wanna have that either that's varies but that's called being open mind and being vulnerable being able to check your in with yourself as opposed to being this kind of authoritarian beast of don't you tell me this is my castle like I don't understand that kind of whatever you want to call it I don't I don't want to even name it it's just an attitude that we have to our generation of men is so much more vulnerable I think yeah yeah first in our parents and so much more open mind and sensitive and it has nothing to do necessarily with sexuality as I do with human growth and evolution and realizing that's your actually week to pretend that you're strong absolutely yeah they that somehow you don't feel too dressed in your PTSD as a combat veteran is somehow seen as weak it's like no that's if you're taking on your worst nightmares that strength and by the way how do we measure strength I mean it's always about what you can lift not the pain you can endure which is why I think if you're measuring strength by gender women can endure more pain so that's one measure of strength but more importantly that's whatever you overcame in life that's the measurement of strength not how you can force yourself I mean I'm a small guy so that's a small guy mentality before I taught on my way out of every you know my dad's like just when you walk into that class you make friends with the biggest kid in the class and I've done that my whole life so that's I just talked my way out but well whatever works but not that an authoritarian way in a way that you're saying and way that you think to say when you say any thinking person agrees with that that is a version of saying relax oh yeah it's the same for sure is it perfect no no as a perfect analogy absolutely it's we could do a whole long story about condescending remarks especially in marriages or any relationship in this conversation if I've put you down and the way that you're thinking it's like the whole conversation then changes to respect my yeah my intellect my experience and it's like the conversation gets gross yeah and ineffectual and damaging which that's the easy way that's how you sell ads that's how you create ratings so crazy this show does pretty good we don't do that you you know exactly exactly the the thing about like online conversations is that you don't have this interaction like we're having like this is probably more intimate than a regular conversation because we're in each other's ears right we're wearing I prefer headphones yeah I wish all of life was this way I don't want this to stop - all the time it's - it's too narrow focus but it's good for company what I want I will sit here and put anybody in those head relaxed contacts everybody just common would agree with me relax calm down Joe would you calm down Joe Rhodes my favorite thing to say when someone's not worked up you're working with the person in a corporate yeah you know it's serious a CNN oh and they're not at all worked up they're like hey do you want me to send them over calm down okay like I was what he talking that wasn't totally normal um what percentage of people that you worked with run at all oh my god I wish I know I thought everybody around me was on something what do you think antidepressants I thought would you think it would be a high number had a role I don't know I don't know anything about adderall I know a lot about and I hear a lot about xanax and antidepressants anti-anxiety 'z yeah none of which I've ever put in my body those are spooky I think some people need them I think for some people they have a bad chemical makeup I mean this is just a fact just like some people have thyroid cancer right some people have there's a missing link there's something wrong with the way their brains firing and this is just a biological issue because we're you know we're not you know situational depression sure invite yo n hari writes about that in this new book and there's been a lot of really great work written about academic research on and the academic research on neuro psychology my understanding is that it's like we know so little about the brain we're very early and trying to understand if so these medications like right now dealing with like career like that much career transition right and think about running for Congress didn't with my dad that to me is not a reason to take an antidepressant that's that's no you work well now you just hit it hard and you do what you do and you don't make excuses and you just we just work my friend Jordan Peterson had an issue where his wife was she developed liver cancer was very idea yeah very scary I did not know that about him I know of him and his work but I didn't I know that I'd she was very very sick and he you know they've been together since high school who loves her dearly I started freaking out so he got on something what was it called colon open oh yeah yeah I'm familiar and I've heard of it no she had a miraculous recovery everybody's happy about that but they're really really yeah that's amazing shit surgery oh wow but he'll get a transplant I don't know but he had a really difficult issue with the klonopin really oh he used it to deal with that situations and what was the issue well he was going through severe withdrawals and he turned himself into a rehab oh yeah that's a night here that's a very I have a family member who did everything including heroin and it's so great to hear already on the show because I I called up Artie when he was doing heroin to ask him how serious it was he goes let me ask you two questions all right he goes is you have like a good life either a job or kids or anything I was like now he's just a single guy and he goes is he shooting it or snorting it he's shooting it he goes I can't help you like that the worst that's true that I have so many already stories yeah on the road with him for so long but so nice to see him doing why yeah yeah he's doing great I mean really yeah he certainly seems so already Colin he was one of my closest friends my wife and I spent a lot of time with him and I loved him to death and I'm his story is the most remarkable stories one of the most remarkable stories and comedies one of the funnies he's one of the kings of comedy and I he's a close brother of mine for a long time so watching him with you I can't wait to see him yeah this guy got 17 numbers for him I'll give you the real one for you let's be no greater storyteller alive he's up there he's no no greater Yogi Berra was good his fucking stories dick Cavett's pretty good jazz fingers to like movement with his fingers like he's like he's got a little show he's doing there's a lot happening he's a performer he gets it he gets it all oh yeah I was waiting in the wings he's gone out I opened for him I come back they play the who which song that he came out to and he just at his heaviest just falls back into me and I had a brace you know I'm a tiny muscular guy I like push him back up and literally push him onstage he's like zoning off like falling asleep out there that's hilarious I mean there's just so much to see him and his recovery should give everybody hope it should give everybody hope it's interesting to cuz I like that it's running yeah yeah he but Artie is that tapas game and really excited to see him and one of the funniest guys and one of the most generous guys man you helped everybody it was too much I would tell him like you can't he was subdued that guy supported so many comics in ways that were like beyond generous the way that you do by the way by the way that you do I want to see his stand-up I'm gonna see it I wonder where he's at because no I know he's doing only gigs around the New York area but I'm thinking about if I have to go to the East Coast I'm thinking about taking a trip I just wanted to see you there yeah because like see him now it's like all the years that I've known him he was always fucked up yeah I was on a road and I'm a lot of that time I witnessed a lot of stuff it was just be hanging out he'd be gone all day like we're we're in Vegas by the pool at his Cabana and he wasn't with us like where's the king man he's never gonna come down did you see the hooker maybe I mean yeah I wouldn't hung out with us either don't get me wrong but it was a nice day we wanted a hand with him he's got through on the other side I just hope he could stay on this side yeah but the point is Artie is a is not he's an aberration he is an exception for any number of reasons he have to be one of the most talented late funny people that he just can't fail cuz everyone's to be around him to be with him but and see him perform but drugs in this country whether they be antidepressants of the opiates like that's something we should come together around as well and we're medicating you know I think far too much I love for you to talk to my friend dr. Aaron Carroll who's written so many H for the New York Times he's got a amazing YouTube channel beg you to have him on the show because he tucks just so he's a research expert and there's so much to talk with him about in terms of all the stuff supplements fasting and nutrition and you absolutely love him I want everybody to know buddy's work is he a doctor yeah he's a pediatrician at Indiana University School of Medicine he contributes in New York Times he's got this YouTube channel like it's called healthcare triage she's really smart guy and he does all he's just really great at explaining research is his thought that people are over medicating I'm not sure I don't wanna speak for him you know it's a tricky one right I think it's a those words no I mean let people get very resentful about that number one don't tell me I'm a bad parent or a bad person this helps works for me ya know I mean we gotta be careful gotta be very easy on the judgment with all that whatever I kind of feel whatever gets you through the day well I don't know how your brain works like to pretend to pretend that your brain works like my brain and I know for sure that if I was inside your head I would be thinking the way I think in there impossible amen I don't know what it feels like like I know I have a baseline right when I'm healthy well I Know Who I am I'm that guy right but if could you imagine being someone else other than who you you what you know and what you're comfortable with you can't that's the chemical makeup of a different person you can't know what anybody's going through in their day imagine if you were a woman you were on your period I have feels like often I thought about that quite I thought about it all I never thought about to just know I don't you have daughters yes what I never thought yourself having a period or having premenstrual syndrome yeah that's a sounds like very little fun PMS sounds like a real bummer yeah once you get to become a cut the whole situation let everybody know in advance I want to take calcium tablets I'm gonna do my best but when the storm comes imagine I try to just be aware of that but my wife and I are not usually the same baseline regardless of what's going on it doesn't affect everyone I don't know if maybe it does but it's something to be sensitive about because something and we don't have to deal with you know what I hated is I got a vasectomy and this idea that any guy would ever not do that is bizarre to me it's the greatest thing I highly recommend it population control and no more condoms in your wife should never have to put a drug in her body or cut you know iron tube that's horrific las' I guess you're just giving birth maybe but I'm very Pro vasectomy do you think that we're gonna come with time there's gonna come a time in America where there's too many people when we have like a delhi india types it i think that is the case in too many communities right now and impoverished communities that there's too many people for the resources that's how you measure it it's not I mean how do you measure too many people congestion overabundance of traffic like look right now in LA when I come home from the 405 or get home from the airport I'm driving home on the 405 I'm like wow yeah this is my first experience on it there's it's ten o'clock and it's bumper-to-bumper off for miles and miles and miles asked where's everybody going if that's another way to define poverty well there's a lesson in two a great conversation like ours but even then it's not worth it how dare you it's not worth it being stuck in that if you will see one thing is being stuck in it the other thing is being stuck in it every day I mean it's horrible for your body to sit there will do when I stopped commuting at this driving neck pain every day 43 and like a knife every day I stopped community gone gone gone absolutely sitting in a car yeah you got to try to offset that if that to someone do something you have to deal with because it's really hard but it's a that's I I think that having right now in America in many communities there are not enough resources for the people that are living there in terms of healthy food and access to education and health care that's Joe that's how I define like morality of a society how we take care of each other sure and we all don't have the same access in this country I urge people to study poverty and not get caught up in the tribalism of the argument of why people are in poverty know there's a long really interesting and important field of study and there's a whole bunch of anti-poverty people that I love talking to and it wouldn't be by anti-poverty people they're just working to you know to poverty on with using private-public any number of different resources you know solving the problem yeah that's one thing that I think morally we we fucked up with with not having health care available to everybody readily easily and if you're going to pay for things we're going to decide that we're a community right we're basically a community of 300 whatever million people who got it two things got to educate people and you got to take care of the sick and you should have food figured out right but we don't have yeah those things now one of them was terrible the education system in inner cities is often terrible right the the food thing is a fucking mess food stamps is a mess right education system you know in tribal communities we nobody ever talks about tribal communities I've done a lot of work with them and I keep saying that by the way I'm no no but like just like advocating you know the type of stuff that I know that you do and just trying to understand what they do and write and advocate for the solutions and tribal communities and impoverished communities are all over this country in rural areas and obviously in urban areas we have a lot of it and we can solve those problems but being divided the way we are on not understanding the root of poverty Michelle Alexander's the new Jim Crow takes on racial injustice and mass incarceration you just read that book you'll be a completely different person understanding history well the things that we need to drive along order to establish the average over for sure I mean that is when is that gonna happen where are we our generation has agreement about that and that and that shit legalize all of it all of it legalize it regulate it anything anybody wants to do what we all have been doing what's going on in Mexico right now is nuts it's crazy and that's because of our demand for it we're directly connected to their problems that's just basic economics and commerce legalize it it's not gonna solve it they're gonna end a drug cartel if they're always gonna be there yeah but don't simplify this problem and don't demonize it name it and solve it we've just been so much loss and pain it's got to end yeah it's a Chan whoever gets elected as present has to stop with this punitive justice bullshit where you punish people for their behavior I just heard about this kid who got caught with weed in this car in high school it's principal threw him off the golf team and his dad was like why would you do that why would you not let him do the thing that he loves that's not that you know I'm just gonna get sit around all day he's doing a great thing don't did this idea of punishment is changing your behavior like we can get beyond that I think we can get beyond them we certainly can especially weed for a kid nobody's consequences for kids like spanking your kids it's pretty story historic but I mean what you're talking about when it comes to this kid with weed is it's completely absurd do you think you would either kicked off we got caught having shot of Jack Daniels would have gotten kicked off a team for life if you know something happened at a party and he wound up having a shot of vodka with his friends well so I should say had a bucket of grenades and passenger seat as well Joe and a pat buchanan's love grenades now that's what it was it was your absolute that's all that's all it was decision is an asshole well yes of course whether well hold on their judgment is clearly wrong yes but minimizing them as an asshole it is an asshole no man so moving but as you're taking a kid and you're ruining is lunch right I don't want to be an asshole or try to understand why that person made that decision in administration why the system has that kind of punitive component to it I mean it's you know whole incarceration the capital punishment only in America if all the civilized that's so horrific it's stupid and expensive and now even you know most conservatives now agree that that is the case and when hopefully I'm drumming it out well but it's praising the penalty for mass murderers doesn't matter gain it doesn't matter what they did Joe because I can't prove if you give 1% if the numbers are like 4% of people who are killed were innocent that percentage everybody agrees is way too high some people like if it was only 1% in the in the community it debates these issues but as long as it's four percent of people are innocent you can't have that system for that reason regardless the penalty a and B no one's thinking when they're murdering someone about what the penalty for murder is gonna be that's not why they're doing it doesn't it does not work as a deterrent there's a ton of research on that it's silly it's silly then you think well if I'm I'm not gonna murder this person because I'm gonna go to jail for like that's not why you don't murder somebody no nobody wants to murder another person but what do you do with that person do you just put them in a cage for the rest of their life no you rehabilitate them Wayne Gacy yes or you take no Fox kids and kills them now if you can't hole in his basement and leaves the kids there if you can't rehabilitate him you put him in a humane cage you don't kill him that's what I mean but you're killing him you're just killing him real slow with life you're separating him from freedom and you lock him up in a cage you have to separate him from freedom if he's raping kids I agree with that right yeah but if you know for that you can rehabilitate but hold on you're killing them either way you're either killing them with nature and time or you're gonna kill them so if you're gonna leave him in this in this cage it is innocent that's almost worse than killing them if you kill him it's quick if you're gonna leave him in that cage and he's actually one of the four percent that sounds or letting him kill himself okay you're not gonna let him kill himself yeah give him a gift it's like here's a rope if you can you can make a rope swing and I'll give you a swing and you can swing on it if you want that's what I get that I mean I don't but the problem is you're trying to find a binary answer to a messy question no I don't think it's a messy question my answer is no I don't I don't believe in the state by the way if you're the state execute that's the state executing people yeah by John Wayne Gacy maybe I found your kid in the basement of John Wayne Gacy's house you wouldn't want him dead I can't deal with that hypothetical I can't either I'm not I'm not I'm not doing that for someone else and I'll say yes John Wayne Gacy definitely killed a lot of people's kid I don't think the people this is worst-case scenario right we're playing no no yeah absolutely it's a great part it's a thought experiment it's a hypothetical and I just wouldn't if someone was in that situation if you know they're of a parent in Newtown I think a lot of those parents I mean this guy who was killed in the Charleston Church shooting I don't say these maniacs names into microphones because but the Charleston shooting premises want to start civil war shut all those black people it's Obama went down there and sang Amazing Grace it's lovely remember that when we were to recover from horrible disasters with the president singing Amazing Grace you know well you remember those people forgave that shooter they forgave him for killing all those black people forgave that white man and we're you know the greatest role models of actual you know Christians behaving Christian by the way and I think that you can forgive I think that that doesn't have to be a religious tenant I think that you can forgive and you can rehabilitate but I won't buy you know the hypothetical situation obviously I would by the way I would defend my I would kill anybody who ever threatened my family I would have no problem with that I'm not morally against that yeah it's a different thing yeah I mean someone that you've got detained I'm deciding that their life is over yeah I don't think I don't think the state should be responsible for that and the idea that we would give the well state the trust the most horrific shit is when you find out that the DA withheld information that would lead to the exoneration of someone or that they're unjustly incarcerated than one of the houses that's one of the most horrific and justices in this country and obviously it's got a racial component to it and it's horrible yeah and the justice system is obviously that's a really interesting thing to talk about in constitutional law is a fascinating thing for people studying this idea that we argue about the Second Amendment like let's let constitutional lawyers I think discuss a lot of those things and we should all understand that and be curious about it but I would the our Constitution is also silly like let's remake everything like let's have that conversation it's so much better that we can do have a serious conversation about what kind of guns and bullets people can have not to thinking I have more that they can't have like that's the conversation that's where we should be right now everything gets regulated everything there are trade-offs in health care there are trade-offs and everything but Americans now are so divided they want everything that they want that compromise is something that we don't do as Americans much less in in government that's it's preposterous that the Democrats that demand purity or or anybody that is doing that you don't agree with me you're wrong hold on that's not no you're really you have any relationships with people in your real life like that like my wife and I don't agree on about a lot of stuff but I love her he's my door her beau that's what we talked about before they're on teams and you want your team to win so you state why why do you want your team to win is a natural thing with human beings all right what I'm saying about the gun thing the most fucked up part about the messiness of the gun thing is that even if you made guns illegal even if you said you can't have any bullets you all go to jail there's so many guns you're not getting them all it's not possible because more guns and there are people which means there's more than 300 and what thirty million guns there our country alone it's absolutely great most important point in the discussion that's a nutty number man you really stop and think about that number you're like what is that real but you don't really stop the behavior by necessarily creating certain laws about why someone might behave a certain way and shoot people that's not going to necessarily change what you do is you do limit the access to certain types of weapons and rounds of ammunition right yeah well the real question is why would someone do that right that's the number one question like women it's a harder question to answer the easier question answer is make them less accessible yes if the people who have problems we can't solve if you could make them less success it's the president gonna blame like I mean to get political but like that there's no data on the video game argument that there's no data on that well the video game argument is interesting because I've had soldiers bring it up to me including Dakota Meyer yeah I heard that conversation I'm willing to have it I mean I don't I don't think it necessarily makes sense that people would act out in a certain way that's horrific because of video game but if they were already inclined to violence to begin with maybe they already had a fucking short-circuit and then they get desensitized to violence in movies and violence in video games does that have an impact on them I'm not the guy to answer that question whether or not has an impact on its variable its variable that I think merits discussion I don't know if you truly know I don't think it is because I don't figured merits discussion well let me make this point then you decide if you think a merits discussion okay the violent video games have played at far higher rate in Japan and they don't have the gun violence we have it's a good point they have a very different culture though the way you don't have access to guns that's true that's it that they don't also have a lot of they've had a few months it's the access I did I've shot guns I shoot guns I get the I I have nothing but respect for hunters I grew up in a hunting community but I mean I don't know I don't think that there's much past the conversation about access accessibility to guns that can fire that many rounds that quickly killing that many people I don't think we have to get rid of those somehow but I agree how do you do it yeah you're that's the most important point is already three hundred and thirty there's more guns and there are people so what do you do so by the way I think you buy as many as you can back for sure you spend a whole bunch of taxpayer money just helped by the way there's a ton of people in a bind right now that have a rifle like oh my god I'm not gonna be a live forward my insulin let me get rid of this ak-47 to live another month you buy some guns back it's a good expenditure of money and then melt them down and turned them into furniture for people so if you wanted to do that without changing the Second Amendment like you just have a buyback where you just offer people the opportunity to make some money by giving their guns up well the Second Amendment has been interpreted wrong by the Supreme Court in my opinion I mean it doesn't say that people should have until 2008 it didn't say that nobody thought that that people should have a personal right to guns till the Heller case but so I don't think you even need to talk about the Second Amendment I think just people just need to agree that these guns shouldn't be sold the ammunition to talk about the Second Amendment I mean it's it's a big Commerce know because people can have guns you can have guns you just can't have these guns any more no more those ones you know all these guns no restrictions anywhere right and they work city you can have a handgun yeah they work you can even I don't think you can have a you can have a switchblade in New York City yeah Cyrus Vance the the DA there is like terrified that they're changing the federal government's changed in law because he knows that those gun laws in New York work really well and by the way people always make the argument well they have those gun laws in Chicago there's a ton of violence that's because Chicago's in the board of Indiana it doesn't have them guns go across the border just fine that's the the gun laws work they work well Chicago is also in the middle of a bitter drug war well yeah I mean that's where the fines is coming from but we should people should have less accessibility to those types of guns like every other civil society in the world come on this is like but it goes back to what you were talking about before like that drugs if they were legal you wouldn't have that sort of a drug war right for sure it's the root of most of the violence in the inner cities and in obviously in Mexico yeah it's black markets it's de licit drug yeah they're making tons of money on that what is the second amendment exactly as it's written the right to bear arms shall not be infringed so how do you think that the Supreme Court misinterpreted that that in the que in the 2008 alle case everybody should just I would plug the work of Erich Segal who said well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State come right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed yeah those commas get argued by constitutional scholars for a day yeah the Supreme Court didn't decide until 2008 that Americans had a right to have their own weapon that's such a crazy statement like when you read it it's so interesting because you we're going back in time trying to figure out how people in 1776 thought about guns and whether or not that applies to us because if it doesn't apply to us we have to think on 1789 we if it doesn't apply to us we have to think well then who gets to decide like one of the reasons we decide as a society on on any one of the reasons why it's so interesting I want to believe one of the reasons why it's so interesting to read these things is like we have for whatever reason when things get written written into stone or carved into a stone or written onto a document like the First Amendment like the freedom of expression we that is that we we have it so we all agree on it we don't want to change it free yeah freedom of speech freedom of expression whatever we don't want to we want to hold on to that we want to keep sure I deserve all humans doing the Second Amendment the right to have a gun that's our law we got it written down look look it's written there so they'll study these ancient words like scrolls like to go over these zeroes and look at the commas and look at the words yeah shall not be infringed upon what did they mean that's fascinating it is it is fascinating but I think that they didn't mean this Joe I think that they say they didn't and the the whole gun thing is a racket to make money that's what that is it's it's a way you sell fear like are you I mean home invasion is any family's worst fear but it doesn't happen very much nor does kidnapping nor do a lot of these crimes at all my halaqaat our generation of parents is helicopter parents terrified of everything not that's true that's not letting their kids go outside you're right come on thinking that your kids gonna get kidnapped you don't know anybody okay who had their kid kidnapped your but you're generalizing cuz whole of Asians do happen sometimes right but that's not how we should make laws we don't have to exist like everybody's gonna kidnap your kid or everyone's gonna break in your home but not saying those islands is that sometimes it's real that's why people want to be able to have guns because sometimes someone can break in your house and people have defended their house and their property with guns short but it's a it's is it a way is it a realistic threat or is it something that that the gun industry creates these amazing ads and scares the shit out of people oh come on man crime is real whether the crime is certainly still real I think the the clear point is the reason why we have so many guns in America is because there's so much money to be made off of them I think we could absolutely limit them and regulate them and have a thoughtful conversation that's where most most people are at although I hate that generalization there's something to that but there's also something to the reason why we have so many cars people are I'll have that conversation rid of all the cars okay well I mean we're not that's wrong that to us why should we get rid of all the cars do you not like freedom or do you want you have a better solution you know I don't have a better solution but if there there should be one or I think that we are killing ourselves with all the cars the pollution is table you can make them electric yeah then that's fine I think I would be fine if there I have a Chevy Volt since 2012 I have solar panels I'm trying to be the change I want to see in the world if I'm coming off as act I'm a complete hypocrite and all of it I eat meat and I do all kinds of things I think have a thoughtful conversation about guns and why they're each part of our culture and not the culture the way that other cultures and countries regulate their weapons that the problems that they have our problem sure we should talk about mental health but the problem with that conversation that people don't want to have is everything costs money that's why you have to pay taxes paying taxes is the price of civilization what does it have to do with mental health you have to pay for people to help people run can't advocate in government Republican or Democrat for the this is what unfortunately Trump and Republicans have advocated let's get mental health solutions to the violence let's do that in everybody's behind that except they cut the Obamacare programs that funded mental health it's just you can't do you have to spend the money providing mental health it is a problem it should be addressed but it's not the main issue is definitely the guns and the bullets in them well the main issue is the person that's capable of shooting people with the guns of the bullets now it's 3,000 the bullet bullet are inanimate objects without a person pulling the trigger we're talking nonsense here they're not going to just shoot themselves the main problem is the main problem is some issue it will unlock the gun it shoot people right we agreed we both agree there's problems with having no but don't you think the main problem is the person who actually shoots me I think that in every other country in the world they don't have this problem because they don't have the gun that's my where I start an end on the argument okay why is that they might they might that might be the case that they don't have the guns but there are places that do have guns and they don't have a lot of mass shootings Canada is one of them right okay I don't know they don't have the type of guns we have up there have a lot of guns they do but they don't have a K 47s with unlimited rounds they don't have that that's crazy guns they're awesome I get it do you think there are more or less limitations to what firearms are allowed to have I believe the Canada I believe the Canada Canadian gun laws are far stronger more regulated just tried something some some really recently Trudeau announced something that was going to severely limit this is very recent new severely limit the type of firearms you could have including things that can have multiple rounds and chambers and certain types of guns that are used right now as hunting rifles and so it was a big pushback about that this was really obviously there's always gonna find that the conversation about like like the the freedom like the the Second Amendment to me is it's just your interpretation fine whatever your interpretation is is that's what's interesting it's a health care issue and they and they it's so extreme it's really if you want to know the answer to health care is you should talk to public health experts they have those answers they have the research but but we hold on what research on one well they don't have research on they don't have enough research on gun violence unfortunately about then I'm talking about if you want to know the solutions for what is impacting and creating death by any measure accidental death but we're talking about gun violence right health care professionals have the solutions to gun violence I think a lot of healthcare solution I think I think certainly surgeons have argued for why certain ammunition has destroyed the inside of the the body and unsurvivable I think public health officials have argued certainly pediatricians all argued this idea that you can't ask a parent if they have a gun in the house because the gun lobby is against that because they're building this conspiracy that the government is going to track your gun that's terrible your pediatrician has to ask you do you have a pool where do you keep the poison where are the guns because god forbid you you're not responsible not for educated enough to know that that kid might accidentally get that gun and it happens all the time there's a rule against that yeah public health officials and doctors and physicians are pretty much on the same case with this issue these guns and mental health I think experts too I I don't know maybe there's a large disagreement and if there is I'm happy to be wrong about this or any dumb shit I've said well what you're saying is that these public health officials would be able to make these guns less lethal by banning certain types of ammunition because it's destroying people and checking to see if the parents know if they have a gun or where the gun is or how its treated how it's locked up like that they shouldn't I mean how do you feel like public officials public health officials yeah could have any impact on that well public health experts are you know their entire responsibility people safe from right say isn't that my baby look someday he'll it's if you have any bullets at all they're lethal right so do you want to have bullets that are less lethal I think that could be a law for sure what is lethal yeah it's a to human bodies yeah we shouldn't be killing each other with bullets all time a bullet will stop anybody a blunt or but whatever it is I don't understand the arguments about ammunition but the point about well you shut up that's why I brought it a fine public health experts will look at what is creating sickness and death okay car accidents what I'm saying to you is that I think it's disingenuous to say that public health officials have an answer to why we're having so much mass violence I don't think anybody has an answer I think we're terrified and I think we could say it's if they didn't have guns he wouldn't be able to do it and you're right and I could say if we do these people weren't mentally handicapped or filled with a handicap mentally compromised filled with all kinds of demons all offensive demons also different medications that are fucking with their judgment maybe yeah abuse all sorts of spirits in childhood there's a lot of factors sure no one no one has any idea why someone who is abused and who's fucked up is capable of making that leap we have some thoughts on it that's all we have some thoughts on it and we talk about it endlessly and yeah yeah you're right if no one had a gun there would be no issue with that you wouldn't be able to mass shoot people but would we still have fucked up people that are lashing out trying to hurt people I think we always will but we have misaligned mental health we have to fun no one's research yeah a lot of people are no I'm not I think you should I think we should not only should become people the way we thank mental health we it should be a top priority yeah I think we should think about having four hour work days being mandatory done I think we should help people I think you know they just didn't experiment Microsoft did in Japan in fact and they found that a four hour a four-day workweek rather increased productivity by 40% yeah I think a lot of people I don't know maybe this is their culture or maybe this is a specific instance the type of people that would get a job at Microsoft but you know what what you're dealing with from most people is beaten down shells that are touched by all that together go back to the gun argument argue for the 4-hour workweek and any other type of benef it's civilized nations around the world especially in Scandinavia have studying that culture is really interesting in what they do yeah and and you realize that there's any number of things that you can do to help people and how do you you have to be able to fund those solutions and people don't want to do it right people don't pay more taxes but they also have a distrust and the way the government spends their money so but I met catch-22 I'm sorry even if they wanted things to be better they don't trust the government to spend their money like if you work hard and you make X amount of dollars the government it's always a fair argument but there's not a bet necessarily a better way fine I give you that argument but that we have to come together as a society angry this is how we're gonna spend money on the fire department on schools and so on yeah well no one's arguing yeah but the rest of the world why is so many other places Scandinavia happier than us one of the reasons is we have to worry about getting shot we should not have to worry about that we have to worry about health insurance we should not have to worry about that we have to worry about getting paying for our education those are things that and other people in other countries don't have to be as concern about that they're happier they're more relaxed well they're also way smaller it's like versus the entire United States of America and you're all are you right but that's not how you study you know socioeconomic says something different about the size of the country insurers but it's a huge factor it's affecting the way people behave I mean they've done studies where they've taken cameras and they put them on opposite ends of the street and they can tell by how fast people walk and they can tell by how many syllables they say in a minute exactly the number of people that are in that city yeah there's a direct correlation between large groups of people yeah and hostile behavior fast thinking moving quickly talking quickly being impatient all those things contribute to a less healthy society sure when you deal with a small country that has less people you have less of that but it but it's it still doesn't change the idea even if we disagreed on that that looking at how other nations societies neighborhoods by the way forget about that now don't make about America what's this city over here doing what's this community doing over here with mayors are working together really effectively to solve problems cities they have these these unions all the time he's coming together and they're doing a lot of good where communities can copy other commune but if you look if we so often talk about our national system and that's generally what we're talking about with many of these issues here you look at skin and eve people are happier they're why I don't know if that's true why is that there's so much research that they're happier what does that mean because if you don't have to worry big big giant generalization there's got to be some depressed people it's candy there are of course don't give me your on to it their society they have all kinds of problems there's places in the United States they're happier than other states yes to educational health care you can't also environment it's also or the beauty of their surroundings whether or not it's a small town or a large city yep yeah I mean this place is like Boulder Colorado super healthy happy places yeah but there's 100,000 people there right that's how it's gorgeous weenie I think that's we had to radically change the way that we live in our communities and I think there's so much interesting conversation we had about sharing everything you know the car the car comes pick you up whenever you need it and all that you can still have your own car whatever but just the idea of ride-sharing home sharing communities having something that you could have you could through technology you could just have no your gonna share your house with somebody but a community look at the butts of the future surrounded by there's a place called Serenbe down south it's got Biophilia design and everything is like renewable the way they live everybody has just how you describe is like a small - every is always on foot walking communicating surrounded by nature exercising is definitely better when you can get that if you can get that this is hard to sustain large groups I mean they're absolutely there's no getting away from the number of people we have here you know and then I call so like you're the group the less Minds you have that you interact you were talking with somebody that scientist who lives in a van it was a fascinating question and I feel like he's my boy point about he's gray it was great I was stealing my parents basement listening that show and he talked about or you did maybe Moore's Law is that wasn't he talked about us well that was pretty interesting I never heard anything like that but about it's only you have to have a certain amount of people before kind of chaos no no corruption no notice it oh that's that was Dunbar's number Dunbar's number is a hundred and fifty people Moore's law is the law that pertains to technological technological improvement yeah yeah the Dunbar's know the rate of improvement of how technology and that's going straight up and that's fascinating and Andrew yang understands that and Joe Biden doesn't that's a huge issue Dunbar's numbers the amount of people that you can keep semi intimate relationships with and it seems to have a direct correlation between ancient tribal structures and the fashion about that they think it's about 150 people and more or less I'm sure people very like the very and everything else intelligence height people varying and everything but but a the this number seems to be fairly consistent that you can't really have more than 150 people in your life don't you think Thanos was right in a way with them yeah ya know if that's the problem with that movies Thanos had a point right yeah he's a piece of shit but he had a point the way he went about it was wrong yeah he's a dickhead he killed a lot of people he snapped that everybody died and then he wanted to live on his own Island like an asshole planet and his son would always set in his face fuck and James Brolin oh I was glad when Thor fuck tomorrow or my daughter got to interview the co-directors as part of male chose my favorite Josh Brolin by the way what did I say James they're both handsome they are but yeah Santos and but the idea that's a bit the idea of balance do you think about that like all this stuff that we use and we consume the way that we live I'm all about that a lot yeah I do and I'm happy when someone like boy onslaught comes around that has like a real legitimate solution that could be implemented at large-scale and could eventually be a gigantic solution not only that but a source of resources so what about just elastic and it's plastic instead of being a detriment can be used to work at certain things maybe the money could be used from the sale of that plastic and it would go to charitable causes maybe it could actually be a positive net benefit to the earth what if someone comes along with some technology they do that why do we have in this country an argument about the future of energy in the way that we live and how to create a better renewable future like I have no idea why we are everybody wins we can't load of money the argument is that if you invest in a green new deal that that is a socialist idea that's a bad idea in any way no everybody will get rich or we're all gonna die I don't think that's what the pony think of that sly nari everybody it's like we're gonna die either I think fear monger he's not helping anybody either I think you're right about he's gonna get shittier I mean I think that's probably what Trump wanted to buy Greenland he's like I got an idea that was let's get up there and watch him move see but it would've been amazing if he pulled it off however much time that spent corner it was brilliant because came out of nowhere - well because he really knows how to play the media he's like having a bad days I got by Green and I know does that sound okay and then good then we talked about it all day on the radio and on TV and it's like well we just lost everything that you and I just discussed all these really important issues not really I think we're gonna people are gonna solve a lot of the problems it's gonna be thoughtful people that are geniuses they're gonna figure out a lot of our problems are going to solve them doesn't mean we should give up I think there's going to be a way that they're gonna track carbon from the atmosphere they have many different prototypes and many different theories that they're working on right yeah yeah I don't mean it's about sound negative I'm on board with solving the problem I just don't want to argue I don't want to argue about the problem I want to have really thoughtful discussions about the solutions and how we can do it but you know fossil fuels have to go rapidly the problem is also that on how you do this but they have to go rapidly it's hard the problem is also that the conversation has become ideologically driven yeah right if you're on the left you think climate changes of the utmost importance if you're on the right you're supposed to at least slightly dismiss it as I think we that's a that's a bizarre binary of course it's the most important thing but it's whatever we do with everything what we do with abortion what we do with murder it's the planet I understand that's all I always put it like people will be sensitive about sexism or racism Oh easy for you to say white guy no I'm not dismissing what's most important directly to you I'm looking at it in the aggregate of our species it's the planet the emergency bells are ringing we have to stop burning fossil fuels we have to do it it burns here every couple months like crazy horrific attack you eight think up a hellscape should look like on film with you guys are living through it dude I've been here for 20 plus years twenty five I think 25 years it's never been like this where every four or five months of fire erupts and there's a feeling that you have when a fire erupts that's real weird and explain it because I think it's important I'm been evacuated three different times and there's a feeling that comes over you like first of all there's in my case I can only speak for myself there's a releasing of any but like you don't know importance is attached to anything other than your kids and your wife and your and you know just get the fuck out of yeah the dog whatever you got to do get the fuck out of there and realize look you're a human who's doing well living in the United States of America you already got 4 aces just get the fuck out of there stay alive don't worry about your house don't worry about your car just get out go that's number 1 and 2 is the the intense fury of nature and when I saw the last ones when I got evacuated last year our fucking neighbors three of the houses burnt down right across the street from my house so here's my house this house this house this house are gone and there's hundreds of houses all throughout Malibu there was like 600 houses burnt to the ground man and it's a fucking terrifying scene there was a woman we played a video there's a woman who was trying to drive to go get her horses and she was drying through driving through a firestorm screaming and filming it at the same time in the fucking what she didn't film I think she had one of those diam things on what uh well I mean you have those so you're talking about a community one community out here and you talk about really affluent people so they should care there yeah but Reena yeah and like it's hurricanes it's wildfires in the impoverished nations are suffering the most because they're burning the most fossil fuels and have the least resources and we meanwhile are having everything we want and I think that that's like also kind of just a holistic spirit we should have we should use less it's a philosophical debate for sure but we should have it we can use less and be happy or even in so many different ways I'm not sure I don't think that's gonna stop the fires though I don't know what you're saying fires are coming because it's getting warmer no its climate change is the issue I'm talking about and it's in its pH but using less it's like maybe yeah sustainability you're using the problem is gigantic the problem needs to be addressed on a global scale green new deal it's the whole thing it's not addressed on a global scale China and India and all these other countries that are still polluting at a fucking rapid rate they're not contributing to this every one of those countries is in the Paris climate every one of them only we aren't yeah and we just made it official and it's a dagger to the planet but do not give up and fight every day to create solutions and care about it that's what we should be in the streets for read Bill McKibben read no I don't know if we need to be in the streets for this but I think you're right y'all think see how in the streets do you think that's really gonna stop people from burning coal do you think that's gonna stop people yeah I think it's working I think the divestment movement has worked really really effectively 350.org is a very effective organization to get the fuck you're talking like I'm arguing with you I'm sorry I'm not dude on this together so that's my tone I'm sorry no it's okay no like whenever I say something you talk like what we're talking about here is there's forgiving of different solutions yeah no one's arguing with you saying don't do that one or don't do this one what I'm saying is we got a real gigantic problem globally yes to just do less it's not gonna stop these fires do let we're already in it it's already happening like we have to figure out a way about ourselves you absolutely right that's actually probably the smartest thing that either of us has said in this conversation it's my issue obviously yeah we have to adapt we have to find solutions to adapt and a ways to live and that's what I'm talking about in terms of sustainability and Biophilia design and architecture and just infrastructure in general like we have to to do that I feel like there's our responsibility our kids we have to be mobile you know one of the things that always freaks nomads I study a lot of ancient history and I'm really interested in these civilizations that they find like when you know like they for some reason like a storm takes away some water and moves to a different place think find some structure underneath the water they didn't know existed before and you realize oh Jesus there was a city here one point right that's happened several times on a factory yeah that's a good one that's a volcano yeah there's a bunch of these places that used to be like during the time of the Bering Land Bridge right there was the the water was much lower and that was only like what was that I don't know thousand years ago I think there was a continent North people don't know that that was a goddamn country there was a country that the way we describe it today we there's a serial living no they called it the Bering Land Bridge was a place called Beringia like I didn't even know this I was I'm listening to this book on tape on my friend Steve Rinella about it's called the American Buffalo I think it's called American Buffalo sounds awesome what it is it's an amazing book but it's about the history of wildlife and Native Americans and what changed and the like that these people who migrated here from Siberia how long it took them to do it and that it wasn't even migration we think of it as migration but it wasn't they were just following food and it was a slow process over thousands of years but we think of it as like they're going across a bridge it wasn't a bridge man it was a fucking country well that's what it was so little look how big it was there was so little water because of the Ice Age right that there you could walk through this Beringia area it was fucking thousands of miles wide seven was huge one of the issues in Central America is just what you're describing its climate change right now in Central America the coffee growers can't grow the coffee the can't grow drugs by the way and they can't grow their coffee so what are they doing what you just described they're walking up through Mexico and they're being demonized the only thing they're guilty of is they can't grow their crop well we we have this thing that like dancing but that's because of climate change forgive me that that's because the the soil down there is dry enough that's what that's gonna happen and it's forced migration and talking about adaption to me that's the most interesting thing about what your point was but how do we adapt to people migrating away from these areas that are and how do we live in America on the coasts and in California like that's really you're gonna have to move all those assholes that have house just a New York baby in those those pokey things it's sticking to the grass built the giant yeah hilarious yeah what is this house is like ten million bucks might feel that way by to somebody sent by even going up in like a skyrise at Sirius XM 37th floor I'm like this is silliness silliness why am i all the way up in the sky I don't want to work that brought me a sense of of unhappiness and an income I don't want to live I want to work or live in the sky these people live way up I don't like that we have them you though that view it's sick yeah but I can really give you a little brain tingle make excited about writing look at that look all those people I'm so high up here dance everywhere ideas yeah yeah yeah like anytime sure yet some sort of surge of ideas it can be translated into some sort of a push of creativity always yeah and so it's lovely when it happens a kicker keep kicks you in the balls how long I think like what's your best one views I'm I've had one knows I'm person I love mountains I fucking love it man fuck paintings paintings can suck it dick is that right looking at mountain is that right you won't I mean paintings are cool I like people with artwork yeah I'm saying is that to me there's no comparison like a mountain view of the lake in the background that to me is like whatever it is about my DNA that to me just just where's the bit which draws me where's the place you were in nature that you felt the most just happy connected I've felt it a lot of different great and so first a big fan of Colorado's mountains I'm a big fan of the mountains of Utah I just I love mountains and island in Vancouver was for me park invent we have you ever been of that that big Park it's like part city shame could you look up that I'm so so sorry eager then like Central Park yeah I think it's bigger I think the same guy might have designed it but it's got Beach doesn't how can move Lakes that's one of the best moves about New York City they've got a giant park in the middle of it that was a brilliant the guy who design is a fascinating guy is so smart it changes everything yeah when you're in that park you look I know this is bullshit it's not really nature on my cell eat you're trapped but it's good enough it's good enough well described nature trap I feel that way it's by the way why I feel in resorts when I go to Resorts I'm like this isn't it this is not Turks and Caicos right yeah I'm nature is only nature when it's connected to bears and shit like if you just keep going the woods something can eat you if it's not then it's nonsense yeah and what you're in and well dere's one thing though they do have coyotes now in Central Park which is really amazing what is the concern about them we got coyotes wolves what are they doing people are like yeah we get alerts no but your kids where they really forgive my ignorance folks if you just lost your dog to a coyote you know I feel like a douche well people's kids didn't well and I mean they will they will take people out upon occasion but when it was 19 years old and Vancouver in fact was killed by Stanley pack of man pack of coyotes shit happens that's why you worry about him and your shitty you don't want to meeting your kids fair enough you know you actually answer to that fucking Park man that Park is where I had an experience I mean I agree with you the mountains and the Rockies in general Colorado has got to be yeah these are close that's close cuz it's kind of like attached to the water you know the oceans there and you got all the trees and man we don't deal the plainy though is like when you're out and real ya wilderness and you run into real wild animals no human creations is where is Maya my Lewton I want to see no and nothing that's created by him and that's my full heaven yeah that's what I'm most at peace there's something about like a campfire and you know you're staring up at the night sky and you're cooking dinner with your friends and just no one around for miles man it's just just rolling down the Allagash and a-rollin Thurlow canvas kayak so i fishing away not catching anything did you see stars yes yeah what you know want to catch anything no that's what happened to me I was the the the the place that I went in Maine that were describing way out and we went to fly fishing trip where I learned how to fly fish and cut zero Maine's tricky there's a reason why Stephen King's from Maine and every one of his books is horrific what is that Horeb what is it I guess it's arm and I split my finger there there's no people man there's no people right like a bunch of comedians me included had a joke we would do bits about how you drive from Boston and there's this one stretch before you get to Bangor where Stephen King lived where they gave this pus in college yeah no radio there was no radio yeah you would hit the Scan button and it would never find a signal you're like what and there was a full hour I think it was 60 miles or so 55 miles or so where there was no gas stations so you get gas and then you're on your fucking own for an hour of Drive Levitt and it was weird man but there was something about the people that you would run into along the way they would it was disturbing they didn't have enough contact with people you know how about people get rickets and they get scurvy when they don't get vitamin C well people get some weird shit when they don't meet enough people when you're just out there in the woods with your uncle and your cousin and that's it for your whole life and then also do 24 listen to me that ain't a good combination either that's that is a really great idea for a bit I mean that guy his social problems when he comes into Fifth Avenue he's got some weird interactive or a lack of social yeah but he didn't get the right diet but that being said now the measurement isn't you can you get a radio connection as does your phone still work and I think everybody should I mean it's very dangerous so not everybody should but if you can go a guide like that's real to me that's real human connection that's where we're we're supposed to be and you should have that expected or screens that's I feel like that's got to be bad but the research is not connected or screens it's an open conversation no the research is pretty solid is that from yeah you've read Jonathan heights work about it I've read only the American mind you should read it Julie Wang E it's really interesting because yeah discussing John Hay yeah wait okay but it shows the consequences of these young kids they're getting involved in these screens you think that's any different with us as adults to be indoctrinated into this world of social media and constantly on our screens there is showing a direct correlation particularly with young girls are very vulnerable yes the pressures of social media people talking shed about each other stay in isolation love your own bullying and you're seeing an big uptick and self-harm big up to suicide these are measurable I think I think that that is pretty good on it I'm not I'm not quite sure you mentioned the doesn't change it's as good as it gets the data shows a cloud like that I think it shows a clear line from the invention of the iPhone yeah to message us be a correlation or something else what a coincidence that smartphones who every fucking kid who's 11 years old and up now has a smartphone I wouldn't in every kid that you're looking at from before had a giant decrease in giant E and maybe read on that it's stronger than climate it's pretty fuckin strong okay yeah I think you're probably right I certainly want to do something about it and I think it's a really important issue that's why the you know connecting to nature is the answer to that and I mean my kids have their phones in their faces all the time I think it's terrible for so many different reasons but I'm just not sure exactly number one our our generation of parents really struggling with how to solve that I mean what do you do well now we're admitting it's real okay so admitting it's a problem so there is I mean it's a problem and I do think don't know I'm just not sure about it I don't know if going to the woods is gonna help it it's gonna make you feel a little bit better while you're in the woods but I don't think it's gonna you're now there's a problem having these goddamn devices we're constantly addicted and checking it you're getting this little dopamine hit yep yep Jonathan hate world that would I think he wrote a book about that with Lenore scan Daisy who also advocated that this is the problem with you know parents being worried about their kids too much sure helicopter parenting yeah he talks about that too letting his own kid walk his way home and yeah yeah it's real his kid was really young and he got lost and it was terrifying for a short amount of time for them but he built a life scale probably yeah and I you know it's um it's all an interesting conversation about who we are now versus who we used to be and is it better I think our yeah I don't know it's a fascinating conversation I do think that our generation like our kids have we have more of a disconnection to what their experiences than any generation before us that's my argument I don't know if that's true but like what did our parents have TVs what do we have upgraded TVs more channels you know microwaves but you know it's nothing it was a gradual change telecommunications gradually change from beepers to phones but then BAM back to Moore's law and it's just and how do we react all this how do we parent in this how do we live in this people are dying looking at the phones in their cars a lot of really serious consequences about them I kind of like wish we didn't have him in a while I don't know um but there's no going back Moore's law specifically deals with problem processors honestly I think I don't think it's specific I don't think no no but the argument is that they like it only connects to processors because I don't think they could really they could really measure innovation that well because things come along like splitting the atom like you know there's things that come along they're just fucking throw a monkey wrench okay yeah I don't I just I don't know if there's a benefit that we're not quite aware of because I think one of the things happening is people are way more aware of virtually everything we can complain all day that we have less freedom in terms of our ability to joke around about things and people are more restrictive with language and all these things are true but isn't it interesting that this is something that's happening right so there's a there's a push back so we're feeling this rejection of certain types of words that we always like to use we're feeling this rejection with certain behaviors that a lot of specifically men took advantage of we're seeing this this giant chain well why we seen this thing this giant shift is because of social media and these technologies are you talking about the create problems so the question is will this ship write itself like are these Corrections eventually going to delete live lead to a better society are we going to be more understanding of each other once we get over these initial growing pains which is what we're going through right now as a culture as a society yeah getting accustomed to these devices and these devices and the connectivity that they have are we going to get more responsible with them are we going to be nicer to each other through it we're gonna recognize as we get older that hey you know being shitty to someone on social media is just like being shitty someone in person yeah and we shouldn't support either thing and anymore and then we develop this sort of ethic yeah it's a really important set of questions you just asked about social medias effect on us I would pinpoint one just for people to watch this intelligence squared debate that you would love I'm given your conversation that you have with people is I think it was the most one is Twitter's good for democracy or does it create democracy and I was on the side of yeah it does getting out with set examples like Egypt and even China and different places where people and I Ron where people use Twitter to rise up but the the argument was it's worse because on Twitter a lie travels so fast so rapidly and it's so believable that it creates more damage about things that didn't happen and and conspiracy theory then it also you know it's a little of both obviously in terms of it creating democracy you would think more speech on Twitter it's equal creates more democracy how could you argue with that until you hear the other argument which is fascinating about how much disinformation travels and how effective it is well my answer I think would be the same as my answer about technology that I'm not necessarily sure it's all bad and I think we're going through some growing pains but I think we go through some growing pains with virtually every new changing thing that's the argument that economists make I don't you're talking about how it affects us but the economic argument is interesting in terms of is it Andrew Yang's argument is it is the rapid technological transformation in this planet and only the jobless decide income right I don't know but jobless society and economists are if always argue what you're saying did the cotton gin but the farmer at the the horse put the car all that but the new argument that I hear from a lot of people who are a billion times I'm not smart all these people are you know experts they study this stuff is mostly yeah this is way different the rapid change and it's absolutely automation is gonna kill economies around the world the numbers are crazy now stop and think about you right you're a smart guy who's gotten had a successful radio show you do stasis not hurt in the end know you now are in this position where you have to adjust because you've been released from your job yeah right yeah but you have options now imagine you're a truck driver and imagine that's all you've ever been and you're 60 years old and all of a sudden they come along and say hey man we have these self-driving luxury trucks that never crash into anything we don't need you anymore and you don't have any skills well I was any other way to make a living you the ank's that you feel right now imagine that squared I could not agree more with you my perspective is mine alone we see things as we are not as they are and and and thinking about as I always talk to this about my daughter yeah my wife painted that let's go put it up on our wall and so my experience for it's only relative to me but you have to widen your perspective to understand some people are struggling to just get toilet paper and understanding that and your point though about the the truck driver his skill set is narrow and maybe his education his grit maybe does not a network he's not to use the internet is right but he did a valuable job and if he's gonna lose his job at 63 I don't want to live in a society that worked hard guy worked hard his whole life and by the way he's paying more as a percentage of taxes as a truck driver than most these guys in financial industry which is a complete injustice right you know texts on your work how much work you doing but this guy should not have to go struggle and learn in a job e63 let him ride into the sunset give him a life right now I'd pay for that that sounds you get out of your job of Technology credit system government where we take care of those people it sounds romantic yeah it sounds wonderful but here's the problem with that it doesn't make people feel good to just get a check people absolutely you want to absolutely get depressed I see you saying ride off in the sunset they use of euphemism for death you're gonna die I mean you know go for me it's my end of on Golden Pond it's not shit himself and die no no let him and honey that's creeping is not gonna be able to do that he's gonna be scratching and clawing to get through life if you're getting a thousand dollars a month that's not enough to exist by the way how do you feel like it yeah like the idealistic open-minded I don't know I don't know what's gonna happen but I think we should have all possible options on the table because what's happened in our lifetime from 1994 with you know give or take a few years which is the invention of the the commercial version of the Internet right with all those the AOL and all those things that people used it basically all started sort of blossoming around 1994 with malloc you jazz hands but we here we are in 2019 so that's not that long that's 25 fucking years in the world is an unrecognizable place people have devices in their pockets all the time you're recording everything think all the shit that Snowden figured out that they're recording every goddamn phone call you make every photo you take every email you send everything's being recorded in a database to use against you someday in the future we have no idea what 25 years from now it's going to look great we really believe that we don't need universal income and then it turns out we do we fucked up oh no we have to think we have I should look at all that's on the table I don't know if it's the right option yeah and I think humanists people that understand human nature they need a sense of purpose people needs great argument I completely agree well made and by the way when you say you know I'm open-minded about it like that's the conversation yeah it has to keep being the conversation you and I have gotten into a couple of like arguments about little things and that's it was awesome and I learned like your point of view that's the conversation and the idea that somehow you know there's got to be a beat down and one person to win it has to be competition yeah it's I mean it's entertaining but that's the problem but it's gets class and likes and it's valuable but what do you think about the idea that the the automation is the main driving force putting people out of work not this idea of immigration I think some of it is true and some of that mindless work is also soul sucking so you're saving someone to have some assembly line job that makes them want to fucking shoot themselves I think both those things are true yeah I mean I think we're looking again for a binary answer here when it's a very nuanced issue filled with complexities and a lot of issues and people like to have something to do but the problem is sometimes people get beaten down by life and again there's 60x whatever it is years old and they don't know what to do and then they can't live the same lifestyle that they had when they we had a job because when they had a job they were making a thousand dollars a week yeah you know they're making this grand a year and now all of a sudden they're making a thousand dollars a month so you can kind of live but what how do you live and that's why I got to plug my podcast what's that you got to work riding off into the sunset yeah I mean like so I can work out you know you want to work you want to do work I completely agree with that arson I don't have three jobs because it's healthy I have three jobs because I'm crazy and cuz I need to stay busy and also because I don't trust any one of these things to stick around and are you really not know you know I've never had whatever come on that's rational never have never lon no never have never will what do you need we just don't need anything I don't think that way I think now I'm doing it do while I can do it do it do it and do the best you can it's gonna vary some days are suck some days I'm better it's gonna vary you know do the best I can and keep doing it but don't think it's gonna last forever and don't think it's gonna go away either don't think about it at all but it could go away what are you giving it could go away everything go well yeah people get pulled off a YouTube all the time you get banned from things right things happen weird shifts take place some of them are logical you know people get banned for saying the most ridiculous things what weird shifts are that area logical I'm not following you what do my internet bannings sure I don't know would you know who Megan what is her name Megan Murphy she's a woman who's a turf I've talked about her too many times it's a trans exclusionary radical feminist and she doesn't think that trans women are women and they should I hope I'm not paraphrasing paraphrasing here she don't think she doesn't think that they should vote and speak on women's issues and that real that women are women who are biologically women and then you have a trans woman who dominates women's issues she thinks it's fucked up and her her this is her perspective she wrote on Twitter a man is never a woman they told her you have to take it down so she took a photo later did they told her she has to take it down so she took a photo of it and reposted that photo she took a screenshot reposted the screenshot then they banned it for life so that to me I have no patience for that and I had not heard about it but that's crazy that's great thought talk about aggressive nonsense ideology well you can label it immediately that's what this is it's ideology yeah but I think everybody that has these I don't want to hear that I want to shut down speech I don't like things right but there are some people that are really consistent but I like to think I am but only social media companies have the power to decide whether or not gets to express whether or not a person gets to express themselves to an unlimited amount of people it's interesting and if you tell them that based on your ideology with most people don't agree with who it's on your ideology they have said enough that something that merits you taking away their ability to express themselves then I think you open up a real discussion much like the Second Amendment discussion among the First Amendment to what are we doing here what is this and what is free speech and is this a Town Hall and Jack Dorsey from Twitter believes it's a Town Hall he thinks everyone should have the ability to express themselves but that like everything else fucking complicated a mess it certainly is nadine strossen who i think used to be something at the ECL you wrote a book about speech and about how in Germany you're not allowed to fly the swastika and they have censorship on speech and that it's not effective for any of the outcomes that it's intended for they also make a lot of shit porn is that right German the Germans could use anyone the plugger I don't think I know any names but for whatever reason a lot of shit the thing shit porn it's not a thing I try to be very open-minded but I don't I don't understand I'm not gonna don't have to understand you know I don't some people you allow people to do it right I would never allow people to think about of course yeah that's a weird one right a weird it's yeah people want shit in people's mouths and oh and some other themselves and shit that's at each other my instant reaction is what went on what's that about oh hell where's that I want to I want that story I want that script how do you get to to that that sounds very abusive and it sounds like it's it's a tough thing but no but no the idea of censoring speech backfires it's just not healthy i but i think people should be generally sensitive and not assholes at the same time it's also the thing about someone saying something in print that you read on twitter it's like you can't even say anything back to them you make your own comment but you're like fuck this is such a shitty way to talk it's poison yeah it's a shitty way okay yeah I don't engage in it anymore I post things up that I think are interesting how did you evolve on it just decided it's not these arguments or not they make you riled up they're not healthy they're not they don't they're not I told my daughter hold on I'm arguing with someone on Twitter said it out loud and I was like oh I'm the shittiest that's the shittiest thing that I could be doing I just think right now so it was unmanageable when you get to a certain number of hours can't because there's no way you can and it's also people just like they're fucking in their cubicle they're just trying to get a rise out of people they're angry they're shit they're bored if you can't expect that everybody's existing in the same vibration that you walk up to a tweet that said you're a pitiful person I was like I don't know good morning bro you're not guys are no no I'm not even oh yeah it doesn't faze me at all but it shouldn't if it doesn't it's it is fascinating that someone would write such a thing it is but it's not click on him and be like I wonder what his deal is clearly he's projecting and I'm worried about I wonder what happened in that guy you look at their weight you look at their picture and then you decide everything about their life did you ever look like there's nothing reason I can't run for Congress I think like I want to keep doing stand-up and I want to talk about things like you ever look at a guy like the guy I run in the car from yesterday at LAX I thought about how much he jerks off for a little while and never think about that I I will sometimes like I got a bike I bet that guy isn't good for him and whatever but that kind of I know I brought that up I'll think about that now it really is right Shane in the mouth but the I watch the video once no ID now it's always Drive it was really in she's gonna do it guys shitting in her mouth and she was she was speaking in German and there was translating it to English and she was talking about all of her experiences and when the first time a guy did it and what what kind of diet she likes a guy to follow when he shits in her mouth and I'm like okay this is not pleasant I'm not enjoying this but honestly and this is like it's a kind of a dumb thing to talk about right but here's why it's not human psychology that yeah it's a person that was a baby yes yes yes that was a big try not to fuck up all the sudden this baby's 50 and she likes guys shitting in her mouth and she wears like rawr for parenting should be somewhere you know round no shitting on other people like then you know you succeeded by the way get a lot of money for it like Robert dudes named Robert Redford Indecent Proposal do me more Oh million dollars I want to put myself out there right now yeah shit ah yes for a million bucks please tweet please not that long I've got a knife in the guy's shit I've got a number what's your number that's a what is your number of the get shit on slowly every day as a clerk at Dunkin Donuts or one giant load on your chest that is like a really rough afternoon not even an afternoon it's like an hour hit me with a giant Lowe's shower up I think everybody says it are rounds on me boys it just became a millionaire god you shouldn't you just well thank you your impending Eric it's like saying that it's solid what if it was like a diary yet you do whatever let him shit all obvious why don't water as long as you have goggles on and you you get to close your mouth there's a lot of lot of things stained windows thought experiments come up I'm always like you wouldn't like you wouldn't kiss a guy never tell my dad this for how much money I was like that a million bucks what if he goes no I got dead that's preposterous that's ridiculous you got a problem and then he goes no I wouldn't do it he calls back and he goes he tells me who he names a guy and all the Italian he's like I did I who's a he goes Paul Sorvino okay that's my answer million bucks he'd make it a pulse everybody would because the what would you do with that money you could save other people's lives you gotta buy a fur coat and start balling either way it's a million bucks yeah no matter what that's not until the money runs out well go everywhere horrified do that well I wouldn't either but I will same button make out with Paul Sorvino we're living in this fantasy world why does everything have to be ethical and moral just have a good goddamn time white fur like Snow Leopard or some shit something exotic what when you say that like what do you mean why is everything you have to be ethical/moral like you have your moral code yeah man but I'm talking about making out with Paul Sorvino for a million bucks that's free money Oh wrong oh yeah right everybody should want whoever you want if Paul says listen you want to make it three oh shit take a big meaty meatball shit it's exactly imagine right in your fucking head extra two three million bucks you got a bad memory of making out with Paul Sorvino on your head but the end of the day the guy kept his promise and now you're rich did you put me in the best mood I've been in in four weeks man that's good let's end it with this then when you gonna start your podcast we're people gonna be able to see it like what do you think podcast is up it's up now yeah and say it's great I hope you give me a chance I'm just figuring it out and put up one with that guest doctor and Carolyn I talked to congressman Tim Ryan about running for Congress how many have you done so far I'm gonna have a third one hopefully in the can tomorrow Emily Atkin who writes the heated newsletter about climate change excellent but I'm taping a special if I'm gonna plug anything my hometown I'm taping a very special special stand-up special special stand-ups very special I'm do a very special thing what's it gonna be for do you have a buyer for it no no no I learned on this show what Andrew Schultz did and I thought it was brilliant oh yeah yeah he's he's nailed it he's nailed it I was like dude he's the master I admire what you did we don't agree on like political but that's the kind of thing I'm like dude you know he knows we don't agree I'm like I love that's brilliant good job what do you not agree with I don't know but I mean we he was on the show we just argue but I buy politics I don't even remember argue with everybody yeah you're a little argumentative yeah it's not a good quality I'm so did at today I was i agitating no no you didn't agitate me I like you but you definitely were like you're you you have an argument mode do you fall into it's bad spike it's my flaw I hate it taking it out of that I'm working on it yeah can I think that you could see the chains are mountable today yeah but I mean it goes back it goes back before I you know I don't want to defend it I don't wanna be defensive but I feel really I guess I'm very sensitive about a lot of things so I get passionate and I get that tone and it's the worst thing in the relationship oh yeah I mean like it's not you don't want to be annoying it's like what I said about podcasts you know that's a thing like people hearing your voice it's not just your thoughts right right you're the way you express your thoughts yeah it it changes if you express them well in a nice way it changes how people absorb those it sounds so simplistic but it's true I think we need to talk about how to communicate on your podcast it's often one of the best things you do I've learned a lot from it I've been listening to you talk about trying to understand people and listen people you don't disagree with and I'm just sitting there beating myself up I'm like I gotta be better at that and the idea that I would get you know that I was too argumentative today it's like oh man I'm sorry I don't want to never want to communicate that way I don't think it's effective I thought I completely agree with you thoughts on it it's completely ineffective well we get bad around I wonder how the pot affected me probably got your little jabber John what do you think that something's changed right got a little Jabberjaw in the pocket I started getting four bows yeah I knew I shouldn't touch this yeah you maybe shouldn't have the second hit that was I only had one mmm I knew I knew and this one you got a surfboard good role model no dude it's fine it's all good it's like but I think that if I've learned anything from doing this podcast it's how to be better at talking to people I've learned from listening to this podcast how to be better yeah yeah it's like there's an art to it there's a Dan I completely agree with someone you dance with someone in a conversation they do condition you to be argumentative in rare live radio all the people who think they know all the producers and show the program I never had a job yeah but I mean it's it's toxic and I don't you know it's a tie I agree it's a toxic way to communicate it's not effective if you're trying to convince someone don't do it like that no I imagine I mean imagine trying to go from being a cable news broadcaster on fox TV like Shepard Smith yeah and then have him try to do a podcast he's in that fake voice no matter what that fake voice is coming out I mean they're all doing it it's like this this is absolutely right you're very right about that and that's why I think your podcast by the way is very I did it's not the sexiest thing to talk about but it's a huge part of why this discussion is so popular because people like a thoughtful open-minded discussion I mean what do you really think yeah whether they grade that some people pretend they don't but it's really cuz they're bored with what they have to do all day so they don't want to think but if you're if you have some time and you're a curious person you like to hear other people thinking too and you would like to hear someone who's thinking either in a way like oh I would I would think about that too or in a way like you hadn't considered like oh this guy's making me think or this woman's got an idea that I never considered or this guy see I think a solution that I never thought was possible that yeah may I try to measure P I think measuring intelligence is one great definition I've heard is by how good the questions are like you're Kara are you curious I've tried to instill and engender my daughters curiosity but everything rather than saying you're gonna do it because I'm your father and I said so but like only explaining to you why that's try to you know create critical thinking skills and that's how I measure intelligence how good are your questions you're really curious you really I mean that's why the art of the interview learning something which is what I'm definitely trying to that's what I did for 12 years in serious exam that's what I want to do with the podcast getting people who are a billion times smarter than me I don't know anything but anything I think it's definitely get changes made free of people's influence some production people and executives just our innocent activity good things but I'm so wondering when the day is gonna come like it did where they drop the fucking hatchet I don't need that worried about that have it over your head mmm-hmm yeah it's done so what's the name of your podcast stand up with Pete down oh it's the same as your show you fuck my grandma do you don't you own that yeah they let me a serious Kent yeah they're writing very gracious talking a lot of shit about them get it in writing I did not talk any shop talked a lot of shit I did not I think what they did for me was really great but I think corporate media in general is the conversation they're all kind of in the same system I've worked and made money out of all of them I'm excited to be independent but I can't deny that they created a a platform for a really thoughtful conversation for 12 years I can't its it don't have to yeah so I I'm I'm in that you know I it was a good life for me and now it's on to you know the next thing now it's on like Donkey Kong the Syracuse funny about November 29th and 3000 Dominic calm rights epidemic taco stand up with Pete Dominic calm Twitter Instagram Joe Rogan's I love you love you too buddy I really admire you and what you've done here Jamie thank you you guys are awesome bye everybody shouldn't take in a second hit
