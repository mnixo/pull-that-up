the girag and experience well the reason yuki i and shout is to create a trip nominal pressure so you can stabilize the system maybe you not me you sound like magic bro when i'm ki i in a magic throw fireballs the shrine in my mind so the third thing is that we create we screw the feet into the ground right this torsion of kind of creating grip through the through the like the same grip to go towards no externally rotate right so that's right wax on wax off was teaching what steven seagal always throws in the same position screwing a lightbulb and look at the way you run son look at the runs you ever see him run that's a perfect example pull up steven seagal running let's see it's a perfect example see if Kelly can fix the way Steven Seagal runs and this is no just disgusting Seagal is an excellent martial artist he's very good at Aikido I mean he was one of the first Japanese Americans rather to teach in Japan this right had a legitimate respected dojo so now Kido is has they figured out to throw people you're winding the shoulder up into what position this extra - yeah and then you have to tremendous amount of power with that with Wells with Judah same position I think that's roll getting getting yourself in a position look at him running tell me tell me what's wrong here everything is wrong it's a lot wrong there and she taught him how to run lose okay look at this look at how he's running actually you know it's not bad he's running on the ball of his foot there's not I've seen why she's worried let's back this guy's getting older he's getting overextended oh yeah not this is a different different move this is old this this is this guy started get stiff and fly around play a little too much music everybody talks shit about him but the dude he's about a legitimate martial artist he knows a lot about martial I want to be a Navy SEAL cook after I saw her miss lyoto machida legitimately takes advice from that guy everybody thinks it's bullshit I think I'm just trolling Lube lyoto machida respects that guy enough to take instruction from him and to listen to him talk why wouldn't I mean he figured a lot things out the key is a lot of us don't have sort of the meta cognition matter I want to see if he runs on his toes though I need to see that ball the foot so let's let's tie a couple conversations all the foot is good ball yeah so there let's be clear let's see how he's run there is either running no we're not running he'll first man he this guy's breasts oh he's hidden he'll first no way no it's not that running off you look at that crazy that guy is flat-footed when he's landing he's running terrible razy flat-footed is okay what's not okay ball the foot strikes first that's not okay that's okay oh that's sort of some variations not what he's doing it's hard to tell I'm talking she's hard to tell it's he's moving really fast I'm talking shit I mean it might have been all the flip here's here's what I would think arms or that's less efficient what's going on there what's all that about unstable unstable unstable and that's what he's looking for he's all right that's how he uses his Aikido though he's all he's like whipped like oh so you mean practice makes permanent is that what this is that a whole bunch and it was the way so even when he runs he's got that sort of whipping motion going on with his arms it kind of makes sense so teach people to run we say hey pretend like you're grabbing two chips right put your shoulders in this position this external wrote a position makes your shoulder stable it creates stability in the head what you'll see is like wearing your chips man just like you have two potato chips don't crush the chips two of them imagine you're grabbing something else and you don't you want to be gentle right right can you say why would you say my name I don't understand like huh put your elbows tight now this is this I should be running you just you just hold like hold it under the ships this is how you'd run to protect those chests so whereas hens go hands going across his body so how much force is he giving away all that so my hands coming across I got to stop it it's right every load I want to minimize that when you see kids running with their elbows out mm-hmm right like r2d2 you're right that's a test that c-3po runs with his arms up yeah what is the arch adichie doesn't have arms I'm just letting you talk - all right I'll try to test me see if you know what's in your hair I'm fine um so rewinding you were talking about squeezing the butt we're coming back okay
