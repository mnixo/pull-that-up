the girag an experience my daughter loves Bible stories really i'm i'm an atheist do you say once upon a time before you tell them oh i know she knows their stories okay yeah we call him the big invisible guy you go old school old testament or do you we do the whole thing oh yeah I'm just told to the story of you know did the guy who's gonna kill his son because the big invisible guy I say man and ice cream like bake him in a pie with whipped cream because you know it's a terrific I don't know knife to the throat I mean she was four but she loves the big invisible guy story sir she loves the NOAA one she loves the Adam and Eve one with the snake and the Apple it's all I mean these stories that they've stood the test of time there's really some of the best stories around who was guy killed his son was Cain and Abel no no Cain and Abel were the son of Adam and Eve they were brothers yeah and they killed each other right I said Isaac and Abraham I think I know Isaac and not you know okay do we have a wagon baby yeah Abraham is going to the Sun right yeah so thank God who's asking him to kill the Sun for him yeah that you know as a love test yeah just because you know that's how you know yeah if someone really loves you like you know this is why you know you give this you get this to your wife you know like I would I would murder our offspring for you and that's the whole marquardt that really helps your wife understand how much you love arms or an ex-boyfriend if you're a marine exporter I would find that way to ex-boyfriend the beat you up I'll murder him and so I love you but and I'm trying to tell the stories in a neutral way right like it's I again I my opinions on all these stories and all that but she really likes the stories and she's a huge fan of Lucifer whoa I mean Lucifer is the guy he is like her superhero you know like he is her mighty morphin power rangers she thinks he is just the coolest because he's always standing up to big invisible guy right and right because she for her prayer is you know everyone standing around say oh you're the best oh you're the best oh you're the greatest I love you so much oh you're the best you know and so you know Lucifer gets kind of tired of that and leads the rebellion and all that because you know I said you know just keep saying it she's on getting tired of it's like but not gonna keep saying it because it's an eternity of saying that to the guy right and she's like oh man i'm really tired i want to sit down it's like now you know how Lucifer finding things that night of it anyway so she's got this great she's this great song yeah which goes basically Lucifer was Raul fo was right you know and why songs and I'm just waiting because you know in Canada that's some home schooling which is kind of all are in schooling what we were doing but a lot of them are Christians right so we can at some point be around a bunch of Christian kids she's gonna break into this song and I'm looking forward to that moment of trying to explain that maybe she's referring to a Beatles song I don't know I completely bail on her at that point I don't know why she gets it well now when you structure your stories do you use a software program to use index cards on a bulletin board like how do you set up where you're moving all your pieces in your Tetris game I used to things we do use I got a magnetic whiteboard in the office and right on the index cards and put them all up with that and sometimes you know strings between the cards that kind of thing that's the general getting it all down the flow and then I use a program called Scrivener which people can use for mac or pc and it's basically the same thing its little index nards in the computer and there's an index card that represents a document each document is a chapter but it's great it's better than Microsoft Word because Microsoft Word once you get a bit past 100 pages 200 pages you're copying big chunks and moving around and it becomes a nightmare cuz you're going to screw something up but scribner you just grab this icon and drag it before this icon it rearranges everything so I've gotten pretty adept using that I highly recommend it it's great for scatterbrain to keep everything flowing and then a lot of times it'll just be you know I get overwhelmed with the screen and everything going on and I'll just pull out the three by five index cards and start writing everything down again bullet points on those put them up on the board and go through it that way so you like to do it digitally you like to do it manually you like to just mix it up and constantly keep doing it in a different way that keeps your brain moving yeah if what I find is when you get stuck there there's a couple different things number one if you just staring at that screen you're stuck just getting your hands involved in a pen and you know like just an ink pen and paper is a tactile experience as different experience it activates different parts your brain sometimes can like oh now I get it now I see what I was stuck on so that's part of it and other parts of it is there's only so much screen real estate so you can only see so many things at one time you really stuck you pull back right all these index cards you put up in this you know four foot by 5 foot whiteboard you kind of look at everything that can spring your free at times too so it's largely it's grabbing whatever if I get stuck in one area I'll start going to other areas and when I get really overwhelmed and frustrated I am more comfortable slipping back into you know the eight year old version of me which is a little piece of paper and some notes or an index card and go back and just write it out till it all kind of flows out of the page I think Colorado Washington and eventually Arizona will be great test theories to disprove all that bullshit that's being said about marijuana you know what they're doing though it's really sneaky thing the Colorado dispensaries they have dispensaries that they've had for a long time they had them back when I lived there but they have actual retail stores but they're not allowed to have bank accounts so they have massive amounts of cash and the government literally will not let them put it in a federal bank they can't put in a state bank they can't put it they can't put it in a bank they don't allow them to put their business to take the so they gotta have a safe somewhere and put stacks of fucking paper money is this that you gotta remember to count it or like what are you talking about this is a stupidest idea ever you you can make money but you can't put it in a bank here's even worse you've probably heard about in Denver where they have outlets for picking up marijuana but you there's no place legally designated to smoke it that's hilarious too yeah they even have these sniff machines have you ever seen them they put out they've developed these things to pick out nano particles in the air and they put it over there knows like you're watching a fucking movie they're sniffing to smell if they could smell marijuana from your home outside your home and if they can they will give you a ticket it's a new way to make money with a giant electric it looks like a cartoon knows this guy's got like a space nose on have you seen it no I haven't seen it there's the there's the thing and when they made it illegal half the people in Congress didn't even realize that they had made marijuana illegal look at that knows the electronic nose it's gonna compass on the end of it in shape to tell you where the smokes comin from this is so stupid look at that that's a giant electric piggy that's a pig with a bit electric piggy that's what that is and by the way you're a pig if that's what you do if you stand in front of people's houses with a fucking electronic sniffer not even your own nose you're a pig you trying to arrest them because they're smoking something that's now inside their house but they left a window open you're a pig that's a pig ausa disgusting I love taking electronic fucking fake nose the guy who made that must have been laughing like a motherfuck owned it was probably so high when he was so standard that patent he didn't realize he fucked us me and he's one of us and he fucked us with his stupid electric robot knows but he made lots of money so he can go to Colorado have his own condo and smoke called imagine the irony imagine if he just started his own pot selling business after he sold those things imagine if he was like the bank's betting against themselves hey we all need a cash cow that's the move that's what you do you develop you should develop shit to help the cops while while profiting off weed and it all eats itself it yeah it is legal to smoke marijuana on your front porch and David last month 1003 good yeah you can smoke on your front porch now powerful Denver fuck yeah Denver you
