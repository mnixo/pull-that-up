four three two one David so first of all thanks for doing this on my pleasure it excited how much trouble are we in legitimately I mean it's pretty bad already and it's gonna get I think a lot lot worse so it's not bad right now right here it's raining it seems nice out the hill I mean how long ago where the fires right I got a cue ated this is October yeah it was rough but in all fairness I've been evacuated three times over the past 20 years yeah I know the fires California's fires are kind of interesting in that they both seem like it's like the future the apocalypse they're here but also it's so familiar from like decades of wildfires but you know their scientific estimates that say that they're gonna get by the end of the century sixty-four times worse what yeah I think that numbers a little high cuz that would mean more than half of California burning every year but I mean it's gonna get yeah it'll get it'll get crazy and there's no way to avoid any of this wildfire stuff well I mean you know if we don't raise the temperature of the planet then but is is that the only thing that's causing Wow I mean like obviously if the temperature raises there's more Brown dry leaves and grass and stuff like that but yeah there's a lot of preventative stuff you can do I mean not building in certain areas like I mean it used to be you know the Indians who lived here before the white people came did a lot of controlled burning they like lived among fires and I think that's like a probably more responsible way to be but we've now built up the whole state so that they're all these homes that we don't want to burn they're all these you know properties we don't want to burn and when you um when you like restrict the ability of natural wildfires to burn that means that like more tinder gets built over time and then you know at some point something lights the match and it all burns so that I mean you could you could do more controlled fire you could take more aggressive action in terms of you know like spraying foam and that kind of thing um you could have a lot more firefighters but I was just talking to a guy yesterday I'm out here actually doing some reporting on wildfires and who was saying that no Santa Ana powered wildfire has ever been stopped by firefighters and he's like a environmental historian wow it's like you can hope that the winds redirect them but like the action of firefighters is basically just spitting in the wind so the action is not the stop it's kind of contain it yeah it's best they can yeah and minimize property damage yeah but you know it's hard because you you have a lot more it's a lot easier to do that when you know if the land was totally raw you'd be like all list we'll just like try to direct the fire in this direction but if the land is like full of homes you're like what we can't you have you ever seen it live not a precious one yeah one time we were filming Fear Factor and we were way up on the five like probably I would say maybe 75 miles from here and for a full hour driving about 50 miles an hour there was fire on the right-hand side of the road for a full hour I mean like Lord of the Rings end of the world yeah like you're waiting for Satan to come riding on a burning Phoenix over the top of the hill it was crazy I've never seen anything like it in my life that was the worst one I've ever seen but I think that was just because of placement I think that this past one was actually worse in terms of physical damage and size it's just I didn't see it the way I saw this one well last year there were there were flames like hopping over the 405 I mean yeah and that's that's really like crazy to me because you know I'm a New Yorker I've lived my whole life in New York and I just feel in my bones I now know it's sort of not true but like my inner emotional perspective on the world is that I live in a fortress I don't live in nature right like I walk down on concrete streets I look up at steel buildings nature can't come for me when you see like fire straddling the 405 that's you know this is a major metropolis here and we're not safe we're certainly not totally safe and that's like for me that's a major like a major revelation I've had is that wherever you live no matter how defended against nature you are climate change is teaching us that you know you still live within climate and when it gets fucked up it will fuck you up it will affect you in some way yeah there was the both sides of the 405 were in fire last year last year the year before last one of those but it was insane it was it's it was Hank bel-air and people are like well this is this we've never seen this before I talked to a firefighter once this was years ago and he told me with the right wind it's a matter of time for a fire hits the top of LA and burns all the way to the ocean and heals and there's not gonna be anything we could do about it is if the right wind catches and the fire starts at the top of Los Angeles it'll just go straight through la look at this what is that from Jamie or a five fire yeah okay oh that's it that's the crazy video so this is Bel Air on the left-hand side yeah and so these are people driving down the 405 looking at you know the most insane site for a place that has 30 million people or whatever la has to see the entire hillside on fire and Bel Air up to me Bel Air is really interesting because it's you know most climate impacts they hit the world's poorest first and like the wildfires are they work in the reverse because it's like people living in the hills yeah those are the rich people but it just shows you like no matter how rich you are no matter how comforted by that wealth you are like you know you might get hit well the best example was Point Dume yeah and we were flying over it my friend bill has a helicopter license and so we went around the peak of Point Dume it's crazy because you know these are like 20 million dollar states these massive Bluffs ID homes they thought they were living in the peak of luxury over viewing the ocean and like wow we're on top of the world and the fire just scorched it to the ground like that's what it looks like now yeah well it's really crazy cuz you're like they couldn't even because people voice at all well they'll protect the rich folks they didn't protect these ones yeah I think they can't protect anybody when it gets this crazy the I think they lost more than six hundred homes in Malibu alone yeah I mean and that's I mean yeah and you think about Miami Beach going underwater and right and it's well Miami Beach is a weird one right because the the ground is porous yeah yeah so it's inevitable I'm gonna get out of there there's basically a sandbar that some developers and xx decided that was oh we can make this into a fake paradise oh really yeah I mean there was yeah I was um I mean la is kind of the same way like nobody looking at la in 1850 would have said like here's a great place to build a city right but we did it anyway like America and it's like Imperial swagger was like no we can create some paradise out of this completely inhospitable land in both places and then you know it's just a lesson that like you know it's just a matter of time well the most cocky people are the people that have those houses on stilts on the water yeah in Malibu yeah how long is this gonna work out for you yeah like this thing moves back and forth over time and it has forever I mean if you think about like the long long sweep of human history most human settlements didn't happen on the coast right like people lived in maybe they live on a river maybe you have like a little community on the river but the you know the last like 50 years we were a hundred years we've built up so especially in America so much more on the coast and that's like you know really inviting disaster I mean all of Houston like all of that is like that was flood plain that like nature was like you know a swampland it was and now it's you know new suburban developments made out of concrete and that just means more more flooding yeah I've been to Houston right after floods and it's Houston is a crazy one they we lot there was a hotel lobbies to stay at whenever I used to do gigs in Houston it's gone now because though the floodwaters just filled up the hotel so crazy I actually really love that city it's kind of like a this great food oh yeah Houston's super underrated exit to it gets lumped into this weird sort of San Antonio vibe I don't know why but I'm a big fan of Houston I'm a big fan of Texas in general they're fun people yeah but yeah if it gets hotter they're fucked too cuz it's just like in the summertime in Houston you know when you're dealing with 100 percent humidity and it's 115 degrees outside you can't even explain to people what that feels like I mean even cooked there's their places in the world that are gonna be they're gonna literally cook you by 2050 so cities in India and the Middle East you won't be able to go outside during the summer without ever being a risk of dying by 2050 by 2050 like what kind of temperature we're talking about well it's a combination of heat and humidity so but you know usually the heat will be like up in the up around 130 combined with some bad humidity but you know they've already been we've already broken that threshold like they're been temperature records set every year but last year broke 113 OMA on I think but like the scarier parts are not some of these crazy desert places that have gotten really hot it's that the cities like Calcutta has like 12 million people in it and you may not be able to you may not be able to live there in the summer in just 30 years mm-hmm and then you think about where all those people are going and how much that's going to destabilize everything you know I've talked to people who are terrified about this and I've talked to people who are nonchalant where where do you sit are you terrified you thinking that you're going to be physically in trouble yourself or do you think that with proper planning and just not being tied to one spot you can move to another area I mean I have I have different feelings about it at different times a day because it's that big a story it's like gonna affect everything I think you know I think civilization is not going to collapse I think like there'll be people around even living like kind of rewarding prosperous lives forever and the question is like what shape those lives take and where they're where they are so me personally you know unlike a relatively well-off person who lives in America in you know New York I think I'll be able to do ok I think my children will be able to do okay and when I imagine their future I think it's a reflection of all of our kind of like cognitive biases and emotional reflexes that when I imagine like my daughter's future I'm imagining a world that seems a lot like the one that we live in today mm-hmm but when I look at the science it paints a really really bleak picture so you know the question of like optimism and alarm I think it's really all a matter of perspective right so we're at one point one degree Celsius right now I think there's basically no way that we avoid two degrees of warming which is like this UN calls catastrophic warming the island nations of the world call genocide and that's when we would be making these cities in the Middle East unlivable it would mean like some ice sheets would start a permanent collapse which could all of the melted eventually bring 260 feet of sea-level rise and we're on track for four degrees of warming so that would mean hundred trillion dollars and climate damages by the end of the century that's twice as much wealth as exist in the world today it would mean there be parts of the world scientists say where you could be hit by six simultaneous climate disasters at once there be at least a few hundred climate refugees the UN says the low-end estimate is 200 million the high-end estimate is a billion which as many people as live in North and South America comprised opulence yes six simultaneous natural disasters at once yeah what does that mean like flooding hurricane famine you know some public health issue um like malaria it's like every every category of modern life can be affected by this and there aren't that many that could be hit by six but like already right now in Australia there is a crazy heatwave it's like over 120 and lots of Australia they're also dealing with like epic floods in other parts of the country and that's kind of the problem actually with wildfires in California it's not just that it's getting hotter is that it's also getting wetter so the more rain means more growth means when it gets hot again that growth gets baked and then becomes you know firestarter mmm and that's the you know it's not just it's not just a temperature it's like higher temperatures mean crazier extremes in all directions and you know that's why I think sort of looking big-picture there's not a life on Earth that's gonna be untouched by this force like over the decades ahead but that's not to say that we're all be destroyed by it either I think like we will find ways to live and adapt and mitigate it's just a question of how much it's gonna screw up our politics how much it's gonna change the way we think of history you know like I'm an end of I'm a 90s kid I grew up end of history thinking the world was gonna get better the world was gonna get richer globalization was progress etc what does it mean if like climate change completely eliminates the possibility of economic growth which probably won't be the case for the u.s. but there are huge parts of the world where that is going to be the case if we don't change course now so like at the end of the century if we don't change course the economist studying this say global GDP could be at least 20 possibly 30 percent smaller than it would be without climate change 30 percent is twice as big an impact as the Great Depression how did you get involved in this how'd you get involved studying this and what was your perception before you got involved and how did it shift so I'm a journalist I'm an editor mostly actually at New York Magazine and you know I'm interested in the near future like as a result read a lot of scientific papers read a lot of like obscure subreddits and that kind of thing and um just in 2016 started seeing a lot more of that a lot more of the news from science was about climate and a lot more of that climate news was really scary and when I looked around at the other places that like we think of as our competitors you know newspapers TV shows I just felt like the scarier end of the spectrum was just not at all being talked about so most scientists talked about this two degree threshold is like the threshold of catastrophe and I think most laypeople think that that means that that's kind of a ceiling for warming like that'll be the worst that could get but actually it's functionally the best case scenario and yet we hadn't had any storytelling any discussion around what the world would look like north of two degrees and I just felt as a journalist I was like holy shit there's a huge story here like the way that this world could be completely transformed by these forces is not something that anybody's writing about in parkas it's a long story but scientists and science journalists were really they were really focused on making sure that their messaging was hopeful and optimistic and they were reluctant to talk about them scariest findings and so I was terrified by the science I looked at it and I was like nobody's talking about this as scary gotta like spread the word and I wrote a big piece in 2017 that was very focused on worst-case scenarios so I mentioned before I think 2 degrees is about our best-case scenario 4 degrees is where we're on track 4 now this piece was looking at five six eight degrees of warming so things were not likely to get this century at least and it was a huge phenomenon it was read by a bunch of million people the biggest story that New York magazine had ever published and I just thought man I guess there are a lot of people like me out there who had intuitions about climate suffering and terror but aren't seeing it in the way people are writing about the story so I decided you know there's there's more to say and even beyond like telling the the bleak storytelling that really dark talking about the really dark possibilities I just thought there are all these categories of life that we haven't even thought about how they'll impact so we we know about sea level rise but that's like as I mentioned before that makes you think if you live off the coast you'll be okay but the whole planet is gonna be touched by this some places are going to be hip harder than others India is gonna be hit by like 29% of uh global climate impacts of the century but everyone's gonna be affected in some way and the way that changes our politics the way it changes our pop culture the way it changes our psychology our mood our relationship to history how we think about the future how we think about the past what we expect from capitalism what we blame capitalism for what we expect from technology what we think technology can do can technology save us can technology entertain us while the BIRT world is burning these are all these kind of like humanities questions that I felt really what really had not been talked about and so the book does like it's a tour through what the world would look like between two and four degrees but it's also which is a kind of hellscape but it is also you know about half of it is about we're gonna live here we're gonna survive in what form what will it mean you know myth at the mythological level what will it mean at the personal level what will it mean the way we think about our kids and their futures and all that stuff and you know my my my big-picture thinking about it is yeah it's really bleak and I think there are some possible ways that we could avert some of these worst-case scenarios I mean there is technology that can suck carbon out of the atmosphere already it hasn't been tested at scale it's really expensive but if we really if we can over that you know the next decade or two really like build it like global plantations of these carbon capture machines then not only can we like stop the problem from moving forward we could actually reverse it a little bit um you have seen those before I've seen the designs for those where they have these enormous like apartment building sized air filter things yeah I mean it's basically like only in theory they're they do exist in in the real world but only that I kind of like it in laboratories they don't exist at anything like the scale they need to but there's a guy at Harvard named David Keith who has tested his machines they're able to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere at a cost of $100 a ton which would mean we could totally neutralize the entire the entire carbon footprint of the global economy we wouldn't have to change anything we could suck out all the extra carbon were putting into the atmosphere for cost of three trillion dollars a year there's a lot of money but their estimates for how much we're subsidizing the fossil fuel business that are as high as five trillion dollars a year so if we just redirected those subsidies to this technology in theory we could literally solve the problem immediately there are other complications it's like in order to store the carbon you need an industry that's two or three times the size of our present oil and gas industry which and where that goes and next to whose homes and all that stuff it's complicated but we have the tools we need it's just a matter of deciding to put them into practice and and we're pretty like that you know recent history shows that we're not doing that fast enough so one of the big you know points that I'd like I'm making the book in its six in my head so strongly is you know we think of climate changes this thing that started an industrial revolution like centuries ago but half of all the carbon that we've put into the atmosphere in the history of humanity from the burning of fossil fuels has come in 30 years the last 30 years that since Al Gore published his first book on warming it's since the UN established their climate change panel it's since the premiere of Seinfeld so the you and I have lived through the lion's share of all of the damage done to the climate in all of human history whoa yeah and the next 30 years are going to be just as consequential so we brought the world from the basically a stable climate to the brink of total climate catastrophe in 30 years one generation we have about one generation to save it to me that's like it makes me uncomfortable to use this language but it's basically a theological story we have the entire fate of the planet in the hands of these two generations what happens 50 years from now a hundred years from now will entirely be up to the way we act now and what we do and the timescale is so crazy because you have this really compressed we must act now to avert these worst-case scenarios timescale but also the impacts will unfold if we don't do anything over millennia so like we could have you know if we really bring into being a total melt of all ice sheets that means that eight centuries from now twelve centuries from now people will be dealing with the shit that were fucking up today we will be engineering problems for them to be solving 800 1200 1500 years from now and that damage will be done if it is done in the next 30 or 50 years so we are I mean we are really writing this epic story about earth humanity and our future on this planet in the time of a single lifetime a single generation and that is on the on the one hand it's sort of like overwhelming but it's also empowering you know like all the climate impacts that I talk about all the climate horrors that are really terrifying if we make them happen we will be making them happen the main input in the system is how much carbon we put into the atmosphere there are feedback loops that people are worried about there are things about climate that we can't control but at least at this point the main driver of future warming is what we do and so we could if we get to a four degree hellscape with hundreds of millions or a billion climate refugees that will be because of what we're doing it's not some system outside of our control even though we're often kind of we find it kind of comforting to think that it's outside of our control because that means we don't have to change it well one of the problems with climate change is that human beings like to react to things that are immediate and right in front of them and I think for us it's very difficult to see the future especially if it's inconvenient especially if it does something to inconvenience or get in the way of our day to day routine and that seems to be what's happening here and that seems to me that seems to me to be why people are so willing to dismiss it so flippantly because in front of them right now it's not an issue in front of them right now this very second is very day I'm gonna go to Starbucks it's right there it's open look I'm outside it's 65 degrees out warming's not a problem yeah no I think that's I mean totally true and I feel it in my own life like I I mean I've been living I've been working in this material so long I know it so deeply and yet when I look out the window I'm like you know things are fine yeah and I think that has a really powerful anchoring effect like we expect the world of the future to look like the world as it does today but all the science says that's totally naive yeah and we're gonna have at least twice as much warming as we've had to this point and I think we need to think about the future of the world in those terms like what it will be at 2 degrees at 3 degrees at 4 degrees but it's not just like the immediacy I think we have so many biases that make like we want to be optimistic about the future we have a status quo bias we we don't want to change things we think that'll be complicated and expensive we have a hard time holding big ideas in our head like that the entire planet is like subject to these forces I mean the list goes on and on in the book I have a little riff where I say you know there's this new not so new now 3040 year um discipline in economics behavioral economics which is about all of our cognitive biases how we can't really see the world every single one makes it harder to see climate there's this he's actually an english professor named timothy Morton who wrote a book about climate he calls it a hyper object which is like it's a it's a phenomenon that's so big that we can't actually hold it in our heads at once we can only see it it's like if you imagine seeing a four dimensional object in three-dimensional space it's that kind of thing where you can only see it at an angle only partially climate change is so all-encompassing that we can't comprehend it properly but I think that's all of those things are reasons that we need to be listening to the scientists and what they're projecting not to say that everything they're saying is going to come true will come true exactly as they predict it obviously that's not how science works it gets revised some things or alarmist some things are extreme something's just wrong but you know I've been really working on this stuff for a couple years and the number of papers I've read that show that make me have a more optimistic idea about the future of climate I could count on two hands and the number of papers I've read that make me have a view of the future it's in the thousands and when you look at the totality of that whether the six climate driven natural disasters prediction is gonna pan out exactly as those authors say who knows but when you see you know so many so many terrifying studies that you could fill like I did a 300 page book with them you realize that like there's a huge margin for error and it would like we would still be really in bad shape you know is there a I mean I'm sure there have been some studies that made mistakes in terms of like past studies that projected that by now we'd all be dead are those a those seem to be a problem with this whole concept we have of wrapping our head around it and if we find anything that we could point to that say oddly back in the eighties they said we all be dead by now and we're fine we're gonna be fine that kind of thing is that that is an issue correct totally yeah there was um there was a really famous book in the middle of the 20th century called the Population Bomb so this is a guy named Paul Ehrlich Ehrlich um who he was like you know the world just cannot support this many people like if we get to eight billion people there just won't be enough food there won't be you know that the planet can't sustain that and he's often pointed to is this sort of like prophet of doomsday that and his prophecy totally didn't work out because we had this thing that's called the Green Revolution basically we figured out ways to make crops way way way more productive and that's encouraging human civilization does that a lot we figure our way out of foxholes all the time yeah but that revolution was literally like one dude Norman Borlaug who figured out how to grow crops differently in one guy one set of innovations and he completely transformed the whole fate of the planet what did he do he just basically did like genetically modified crops before like the you know before the name it was like um he's the Golden Rice guy yeah okay yeah and and you know the whole developing world benefitted enormously and you're still seeing that today like we see all these charts that you know so much less poverty so much less infant mortality and in developing world and that's great that's like incredible progress but a lot of that has was powered by the industrialization of those countries so that bill is gonna come due going forward and you know I think like when you look at climate change you know if it was just one threat like let's take our culture since we're talking about agriculture estimates say that if we continue on the path we're on by the end of the century grain yields would be half as productive as they are today just by the temperature effect so we'd have just as much land just as much grain crops as we have now but the food we get from it we'd only get half as much as we get today what's the cause of that it's just the temperature affects play us the temperature alone yeah Wow I mean there are other impacts too on food like insects there's you know hydro temperatures means more insects which is bad for crops the carbon has a complicated relationship to crop growth like in some plants grow bread better with more carbon but actually they're like the weeds and the ones that we like to eat don't grow better with more carbon and you know by the end of the century so we could have half as much grain and we could have 50% more people than we have right now now there's a way you could imagine oh well like maybe there'll be another Norman Borlaug maybe he'll figure out our way through that but when you look across the spectrum it's like agriculture it's you know conflict for every 1/2 degree of warming you need to get between 10 and 20 percent more war so if we get to the end of the century we're gonna have more than twice as much war as we have to and this is projected because the battles over resources mainly that famines droughts weather you know weather impacts basically everything about unstable societies get stressed by temperature rise the Syrian civil war was you know wasn't singly caused by climate change but it was that's one of the causes there was a drought and that produced it and that conflict it's not just at the level of nation states or even civil war it's also at the level of individuals so if you look at crime statistics when temperatures go up there's more murder there's more rape people get admitted to mental hospitals more when there's when it's warmer out babies developed less well in the womb when it's hotter out if there's for every day over ninety degrees that a babies in the womb you can see those days in that baby's lifetime earnings and we're living we're gonna be living on a planet that's considerably warmer that's gonna have real dramatic effects on everything air pollution there's a big study that I write about in the book that's totally alarming and eye-opening just between 1.5 degrees in two degrees of warming just through the effects of air pollution would cause that 1/2 degree of warming would cause an additional 153 million deaths which is 25 Halla costs that's just air pollution just between 1.5 and 2 degrees and 2 degrees for me is our best-case scenario so our best case scenario is 25 Holocaust swerd of death from air pollution and that sounds terrifying people when I say that to them they're like holy shit how could we possibly that's unconscionable but already 9 million people are dying every year from air pollution and we don't pay attention to it so I think the likeliest outcome even as we enter into this like climate hellscape is that we find ways to turn away and not look at like the real pain of people especially in the developing world but to end to answer your earlier question you know like you can imagine agriculture getting figured out but when you see just how many impacts there are it's like it's everywhere everything will be changed and it just makes the challenge that much bigger and more complicated because how you get you know how are you gonna solve the conflict problem how are you gonna solve the the problem of having 30% less economic growth you know like I said that's an impact that's twice as big as the Great Depression and it would be permanent six hundred trillion dollars in in climate damages twice as much wealth as exists in the world today and that's just you know then you deal with the right you refugees food I mean it's it's it's so all-encompassing and I think that's another reason why we don't want to look at it closely because it's terrifying well there's also a matter of how it's being projected to the public right like in in certain circles particularly right-wing circles there there are people that are trying to paint this with rose-colored glasses right they're trying to maximize short-term profits and sort of dismiss the risks of climate change and dismiss the risks of or rather the impact of our what we've done in terms of raising the carbon in the end yes here there's some people that point to that like this this is nonsense science this has been disproven there's a few people like that but it's overwhelming the overwhelming consensus of scientists have studied this or terrified yeah I would say there was some recent report that said it now passed the standard of physics that like climate science is now more reliable than physics vais hilarious yeah but you know the to the deniers who say things like you know the planet was hotter than this before that's true yeah dinosaurs lived here humans were not here I mean if we were four degrees warmer for the last time the planet was four degrees warmer there were palm trees in the Arctic what's yeah really we've already exited the entire window of temperature that enclosed all of human history so the planet is now warmer than it ever has been when humans were around to walk on it which means to me it's an open question whether humans would have ever evolved in the first place this is all from the Industrial Revolution from then on yeah and yeah and like and to that question it's like there are people who say there's some natural warming going on I don't think that's true I think most scientists would say it isn't but I also think if what we're seeing is natural warming that should terrify us even more because it would mean that it's outside of our control and if we're really heading down the path that we're heading down and we have no control over it that's even more scary it should be a comfort that we're doing it because that means we can stop doing it right well it should be a comfort that there's people smarter than the people that don't think that we're doing it that there are people that can possibly consider some sort of way to mitigate this yeah and what what are the what are the ways of being proposed and how seriously are they're being taken other than this the idea of building these machines to extract carbon in the atmosphere I'm sure you're probably aware of there's some of the programs that they've talked about were suspending reflective particles in the atmosphere to minimize the amount of solar radiation we receive yeah so it's interesting this guy who I mentioned earlier who's done the most the sort of most innovative carbon capture machine I talked to him a few weeks ago and he was like no no no but we shouldn't be using carbon capture we should be doing solar geoengineering which is what you're talking about and that means probably suspending sulfur is like the most useful thing in the atmosphere I'm great we're gonna smell like sulfur no this not the sky would get red out Jesus there are all of these aesthetic effects to which nobody talks about so like trees are gonna just turn immediately Brown I'm not gonna turn color there was a study a couple weeks ago that the oceans are gonna change color there this is if we do that we suspend no no this is just your warming just from warming the oceans gonna change power to what yeah I think just from more green to more blue but be nice yeah but yes the sulfur thing is I so we could you know we could suspend these basically an umbrella of sulfur around in the atmosphere which would mean that it would some of the sunlight coming to the earth would be reflected back into the atmosphere and that would mean that the Sun would absorb less sunlight I mean there would absorb less on sunlight which would make it a little bit cooler the problem is that would have some crippling impacts on agriculture and we basically don't know other side effects that would have and how would you take that stuff out well you could just stop doing it it has a shelf life of I don't know what it is ten years so you could just stop doing it and that's a big concern actually because if we did that just to mask the amount of global warming that we were doing then whatever program was responsible for it would be really vulnerable to terrorism to war because if we if we were if the planet were functionally warmed say five degrees but we were suspending enough sulfur that it was actually only two degrees warmer then if we just for instance like somebody bombed the facility that was doing it the planet would be immediately tripped into a much much hotter State and that would be completely catastrophic even more catastrophic than a more slow approach to five degrees because we would just do it we over a century or several centuries we met in ways we'd be able to adjust to sort of was it with you in immediate you know why sulfur I think it's just something about the particular characteristic of it I don't know wouldn't it smell her I mean would literally be like hell like that's what you yeah always hear about with the horror movies right the devil smells like sulfur yeah and I mean it's the it's what farts smell like yeah and the reason that we were the reason we're able to smell farts is because sulfur is also I mean some related compounds hydrogen sulfide are are really toxic and so that brings me to methane that's another issue as well right yeah the cows producing methane gas yeah a large-scale agricultural yeah wait let me just say one more thing about the solar geoengineering so the thing about that that's real this sounds horrifying this program people are excited about it is really cheap it's way cheaper than carbon capture and but so there's a positive for it but it's also we are basically already doing this so we have what's called small particulate pollution that's or aerosol pollution um stuff to spend the name in the atmosphere that's why like Delhi is really hard to breathe in because we have a lot of particulate in the atmosphere that is already suppressing global temperatures by as much as a half degree or maybe one degree which means and that's the reason that those 9 million people are dying every year from air pollution so if we solve that problem if we solve the air pollution problem save those 9 million lives we every year we would immediately make the planet at least a half a degree warmer and possibly one degree warmer which would put us at the threshold of catastrophe or above it so we're sort of already doing this program just not in a systematic way we're doing it in a haphazard way the methane you mentioned they're basically two big issues with methane the first is cows so yeah cows produced a ton of methane which is depending on how you count about 35 or maybe eighty five times stronger a greenhouse gas than carbon whoa yeah it's really intense but they're also these like small-scale studies that show if we feed cattle just a little bit of seaweed they're methane emissions could fall by 95 or 99 percent so we could if if that was scaleable which is not clear it is but if it was we could immediately eliminate the entire carbon footprint of beef which people talk about a lot now that's incredible yeah just it's a reminder to me that like you know you get told all you should eat less hamburgers or whatever but obviously this is like a problem that's too big to be solved with like individual choices we need some kind of global policy or national policy about it but the scarier methane issue is um there's all this carbon stored in frozen permafrost in the northern latitudes that permafrost is melting and when it melts that carbon will be released into the atmosphere we don't know the proportion that it will be released as carbon dioxide versus methane but there is in that permafrost twice as much carbon as now exists in the atmosphere which means if it were all released possibly in a relatively sudden way it could make our carbon problem immediately three times worse and it could be even the effect could even be more dramatic than that if it was released mostly as methane because methane is a stronger greenhouse gas most scientists think that that's not something that we need to freak out about in the short term but it's there it is melting and methane is being released at some rate so craziest solution that I ever heard for that one was to bring back the woolly mammoth yeah yeah they're trying to do that yeah and the idea that the woolly mammoth is gonna save us all by releasing them throughout Siberia yeah that's crazy right I mean I think that we're gonna have a whole a century of shit like that and shit like cows eating seaweed that everything you know we'll have our global politics will be reoriented around climate change so that you'll start to see sanctions put against nations that are behaving badly MBS the guy who's you know that like kind of thug who's running Saudi Arabia now says he needs Saudi Arabia's economy to be totally off oil by 2050 and I think that's because he knows that you know the global community will not tolerate someone producing more oil and as recently as it you know as soon as a few decades from now but the impacts are you know everywhere so that like yeah like in California now you can you know during wildfire season you can buy masks to you know to shield yourself from the smoke which is really really damaging its effects on cognitive performance are really dramatic can lower cognitive performance by like 10 to 15 percent its effect on the development of kids is really dramatic there was an incredible study a few years ago where if you looked at places where they Institute it easy but you have easy pass out here in California no we don't we don't have tolls all right it's so amazing yeah I think one or two places yeah but like depending on where you lived you'd have to take that every day dude in New York the river right now I know to me I like that okay so it used to be the case that cars had to like slow down and pay a toll yeah and because they were slowing down they're producing more exhaust when they instituted EZ Pass cars could just drive through right and that meant they produce less exhaust and the effect on the unpremeditated these new easy passed toll plazas it reduced them by like 15% each that's how dramatic just the exhaust effect is on development of babies how much is an effect of electric cars yeah that can I mean that that will be right now it hasn't had enough of an effect because there's not enough of them yeah and but yeah I mean the that problem on that unlike the technological level has been solved we know how to replace cars with electric cars we can make them even pretty affordable not quite as affordable as they need to be but the new Tesla's are like 35 grand I think if you get it down to 15 grands that'll be you know that'll be a huge solution but then there are a lot of other problems that are more difficult like air travel yeah we don't have electric planes around the corner you can't fly planes is there anything like that on the horizon there are some people who are trying to develop it but it seems like probably it's at least like a decade away and you know one cross-country flight in the u.s. is the equivalent one seat on one Costco cross-country flight is the equivalent of eight months of driving every time you fly from New York to London and back you melt 9 3 square meters of ice every single seat on every flight from New York to London melts 3 square meters of ice of Arctic assets yeah that's insane that's real yeah yeah I think it's hairy at the time you fly across the country it's like eight months of driving yeah whoa so globally air travel is only 2% of the carbon footprint so it's relatively small but for people in especially rich people in rich countries it's a much bigger part of the focus they fly around all yes but yeah I know the average American I think the stat is the average American every year Amit enough carbon to melt 10,000 tons of ice Jesus Christ that's just the average American and if you're a person like me who flies like every other weekend it's way worse way worse yeah oh so holy shit you put in that perspective it's how much fuckin eyes is there I mean there's a lot of ice yeah but it's gonna melt well that's how you get you know the out the outside projections the high-end projections for sea level rise are 260 feet no the the plus sign is it's way better to get hotter than it is to get colder right like I say just kill everything well the you know the each of the so they've been five mass extinctions in planetary history in the Earth's history before one of them was killed was caused by an asteroid but the other four were were produced by global warming related to greenhouse gas and one of them the Ice Age well the ice age doesn't count it didn't didn't kill as many no really the the biggest mass extinction the end-permian extinction which is 252 million years ago 90 to 95 percent of all life on Earth died when was that 252 million years so each of these mass extinctions basically is like a complete slate wiping of the evolutionary record it's like we're starting over from scratch so we want to think that the the asteroid that hit the Yucatan did the most damage in terms of the fossil record is that not true is the one that was the the global warming was that more well there's so they're five and four of them were from global warming and the worst the worst one was just from from greenhouse gas warming but yeah the one that killed the dinosaurs was also really bad it was something like 70% of all life on but it's less than the one where there was a temperature rise yeah Wow there was a volcano this is a little bit sketchy science but there was a volcano explosion something like thirty thousand years ago or something I don't remember the exact dates but that volcanoes can cool a global temperature for the same reason we're talking about with suspending particles because it basically clouds the atmosphere with and it dropped global temperatures I think it was two degrees and the human popular at the time then shrunk to 7,000 there's a bunch of times that's less people didn't live on Nantucket and it just it just makes you see like everything about the way that we live on this planet is dependent on climate conditions yeah like we'll figure a way to like have a civilization but it will be transformed it will be very different if the world is four degrees warmer um and you know everything about the way that we take for everything we take for granted today is like a permanent feature of the modern world I think we're going to learn is much more precarious much more unstable and yeah like I said earlier you know climates were stable for all of human history that's how we were able to evolve it's how we were able to invent agriculture the part of the world where we did invent agriculture the Middle East it's now getting almost too hot to grow crops it's also gonna be too hot to go to Mecca for a pilgrimage in just a couple decades weather like we're entirely outside of that window of temperatures which means we're functionally now living on an entirely different planet than humans ever lived on before and it's going to keep changing so by the time we get to two or three or four degrees we'll be living in a climate that's you know two or three or four times as much different as the one that we're is now from the one before the Industrial Revolution and yet it's like those impacts could be totally overwhelming and catastrophic now the Al Gore film is something that scared a lot of people but it was also very widely dismissed by a lot of other people as well how accurate was that movie I think it proved to be too sanguine it like it didn't deal with a lot of extreme weather I thought that stuff was far away and I think this is one of the one of the big shortcomings of most writing about climate most kind of communication about climate for 25 years is that we were told it was slow we were told it was going to be coming maybe at the scale of centuries something we'd have to worry about for our grandchildren but when you realize that half of all the damage we've done has been done in the last 30 years and you see already the whether we had a global heatwave last summer totally unprecedented people died in Canada they died in Russia they died in the Middle East the same season three million people were evacuated in China from a typhoon unprecedented rains in Japan we had multiple hurricanes in the Caribbean all at once there was an island in Hawaii East island small island not one that most people have gone to but got literally wiped off the map by a hurricane they're thinking about inventing a new category of hurricane category six all of these impacts were are coming much faster than scientists predicted even a decade or two ago and so I think the first thing can mean in truth is a little too complacent but Al Gore is also you know I know him a little bit I've talked to him a few times he's um temperamentally he's a technocrat he's an optimist he thinks market forces can solve all this stuff and I don't even totally disagree with him I think the market force is really powerful we've had a huge green energy revolution in the u.s. that's you know and had spillover effects elsewhere in the world so solar power is now cheaper than anybody expected it would be a decade or two ago although it's also the case that we haven't replaced any of our dirty energy with it we've just added to our capacity so the ratio of renewable energy to dirty energy is now the same as it was 40 years ago so we made no progress why is that because we just if we're like rather than saying oh let's retire this coal plant and replace it with it you know a wind farm we think oh we'll have the coal plant and the wind farm will have more energy mmm you know we just grow the pie of energy and this is unnecessary it's not because there's just a massive demand is it just because they don't want to end that industry yeah I mean there is a demand people like energy Trump was talking about clean coal yeah and everybody was like what the fuck are you talking about yeah clean coal I mean I think on some level American policy is a red herring the u.s. is 15 percent of global emissions and we're falling the future climate of the world will be determined by China by India by sub-saharan Africa those are carbon footprints that are growing China is now almost twice as big a carbon footprint as the US and they're building all this infrastructure outside chyna that doesn't even count in Asia and Africa you know the Belton roads you know this no project so basically taking the model that the US had with like the Suez Canal and the Panama Canal and they're building the infrastructure of the developing world so recently they loaned Kenya a huge amount of money to build a new rail line which was being built with Chinese workers they built the rail line then that can you couldn't pay back the debt so China is threatening to take over the entire port of Mombasa as debt repayment and this is like going on all around the world highways across Africa across Asia are being built by Chinese workers as an in an effort to build a new Imperial infrastructure for themselves and is the thought that they're doing this in terms of setting up the debt in a way that's unpayable so that they could take over that's one motive I think that the Kenya example but they'd be happy if the deck out repaid I think it's there they're stitching together an alternative to the Western infrastructure of trade and transit they're basically stitching together an entire second system of how the world will work how the economy will work and it will be conducted through their own infrastructure and through their own ports and through their own airports and that's being done by their own standards so China is now pouring more concrete every three years than the entire than the u.s. poured in the entire 20th century she was crying if concrete were a country it would be the world's third biggest carbon emitter so the the path of development of these other countries China India and sub-saharan Africa are really what's going to be writing the story of the future America has a kind of I think like a moral obligation to lead because historically we had the biggest carbon footprint but at the moment were a relatively small part of the problem and within the US market forces are doing a lot of or making a lot of progress for us so the real issue is how do we figure out a new geopolitics that forces countries like China to act better and one answer may be as as it is to say that um you know Xi Jinping is basically a dictator if he wants to impose new standards if he wants to invest aggressively in green energy he doesn't have any of the opt political obstacles that we have in the US and so there's this sort of weird sympathy among American climate people for that authoritarianism and he has especially since Trump has been elected being a lot more aggressive up talking about climate because he sees if America is not going to be leading this is an opportunity for China to be like the real face of climate and that means they've paid it you know they've invested a ton in solar and wind they've done a lot with air pollution so Beijing used to be really awful in 2013 they more than a million Chinese people died of air pollution and now that's much better what have they done just imposing stricter standards on on pollution emissions coal plants things like that kind of stuff you know and but you know we think about we think about carbon and the whole problem I think a little too much in terms of energy energy is just 30% of the global carbon footprint and it's the easiest one to solve because wind and solar is actually really cheap now most parts of the world is cheaper than dirty energy what's the majority of the footprint well it's all nothing's a majority but so there's energy there's infrastructure there's transportation and agriculture is like a huge underappreciated part of it it's something like you know 30 percent of the global footprint is it because of tractors or everything everything everything that you need to do to run the farm I mean really everything you need to do to live in the world has some kind of carbon footprint but you know if we were able to like feed all our cattle seaweed that would have like a big that would have a big impact but all kinds of crops have have carbon footprints and they but they would still have to do something to get the seaweeds and have the seaweed travel the seaweed yeah deliver it to these farms well you could also do it you know you can imagine lab-grown meat having a much smaller carbon footprint I mean it should if it like proceeds as we expect it will and like I said before like when you look at each particular threat there's like you can see reasons for off you can see like oh we'll figure it out in this way we'll figure it out in that way but the UN says we need to have all of our global emissions by 2030 to have a chance of averting 2 degrees of warming which they call catastrophic warming and the projects that we need to put into place in those 11 years are just much bigger than I think we're capable of pulling off they say the UN says what is necessary is a global mobilization at the level of world war 2 against climate starting this year 2019 and there's just no chance we're gonna do that anytime soon I mean maybe 10 years from now we'll get there that may even be optimistic but the the total decarbonisation that's required is we need to totally zero out on carbon by 2050 they say and I just think you know a lot of these sectors are much trickier we could maybe zero out on energy zero out on carbon when it comes to energy in 15 years if we wanted to but again that's just 30% of the total problem which is why I think there's the negative emissions stuff the carbon capture is so important because it will allow us to move more slowly than the UN says we need to and still if it works out you know keep the planet relatively stable relatively livable but that's you know those technologies have been called magical magical thinking by like the journal Nature which is like the biggest scientific journal writing about this stuff so it's sort of a leap of faith to think that they could solve that problem do you think that we're dealing with like shifts and degrees of perception that it it's things like your book things like Al Gore's movie things like you know anytime there's a new story that's written in the New York Times or in any any periodical we need more of this he needs to be hammered home to people it needs to be something that's a global discussion that accelerates totally and I think that that's happening you know I think there was this big report the UN did in October that spurred a lot of conversation about and I think that in a grotesque way the best teacher is just extreme weather you know when you see every year these California wildfires every year they're burning and that is really dramatic people I talked to in Europe are focused on the California fires even though they have wildfires over there they're something with the California fires that they're really worried about when you see these global heat waves when you see unprecedented hurricane seasons we just had a typhoon in the Pacific in February first time in recorded history you know when every day on the news there's some there's some you know dramatic extreme weather and when they come one after the other I think that's a really powerful teaching tool so you know there's this term it's now outdated but five hundred year storm you hear a lot about five hundred year storm means you know hurricane that would hit a particular area once every five centuries right that means five centuries ago there were no white people in America so that means we're talking about a storm that would help come once as colonists came to America as they you know committed genocide hence the Native Americans as they built their own empire stay built an empire of slaves and cotton as they fought a civil war they fought World War one as they fought World War two everything that we've done would expect one one storm of that kind in that time hurricane Harvey was the third 500 year storm to hit Houston in three years we are living in such unprecedented climate that it's impossible to look at the news and not learn that despite all of our inclinations all of our reflexes to look away I think it is seeping in I think people are beginning to be more alarmed about it and I think alarm is really useful there are people in the climate community who think you know it's it's dangerous to scare people it turns them off but I'm somebody who's awakened to this out of fear and when I look at the history of environmental activism when I look at activism generally like we don't try to get people to stop smoking cigarettes by like messaging through optimism we try to get them to stop because we tell them how bad it's gonna be for them drunk driving nuclear proliferation same thing Rachel Carson you know wrote Silent Spring about pesticides it was called hyperbolic alarmist it led to the creation of the EPA and you know when you think about that UN directive that we should be mobilizing the scale of World War two to combat climate we didn't fight World War two out of hope we fought World War two out of panic and I think that that should be part of how we think about this story obviously I think you know when I look around the world when I talk to anyone when I talk to my family when I watch TV when I watch moot whatever read stuff it just seems obvious to me that there are many more people who are still too complacent about this issue even if they're concerned about it a little bit even if they're aware of it they don't think of it as like the overarching all-encompassing story of our time that requires an existential response and even saying those words make me uncomfortable because I like it's hard it's hard for me to believe that this skit the threat is that big but that is what the science says and like I said before some of that science is not gonna get borne out but when you look at the full scope of it and just how just how large just how bleak the impacts will be you realize like we really need to wake up to just how dangerous a world we're heading into and do everything we can to avoid it in addition to probably planning to adapt now you live in New York were you living in New York when Tribeca flooded a few years ago yeah what was that like well I mean I think in a situation like that most people emerge from a particular disaster and think my god since this is so awful it must be an anomaly and you know I think New York was really horrified as a city by Sandy but there's gonna be Sandy's I remember the exact stat like once every five years but this category storm was sandy I think it made landfall as a category three so it's not even a five yeah so if a five hitting is it possible for a five to hit New York is it too far north no it's possible totally possible I was talking to a really prominent climate scientist a few months ago who is like one of the he was one of the lead author on the UN report lives in New York does a lot of consulting with the city and I said so we're gonna build a seawall to protect New York from flooding and he was like oh absolutely you know Manhattan real estate it's way too expensive to let flood so we'll definitely build a seawall but an infrastructure project like that takes at least 30 years to build and if we started right now we wouldn't be able to finish in time to save Howard Beach in parts of Brooklyn and Queens if we started right now he said he said the city knows this and you'll see in the next few years they'll stop doing repairs on infrastructure they'll stop attending to the subway lines in those neighborhoods and even a few years after that they'll start staying explicitly to the people who live there you might be able to continue living in these homes for a couple decades but you're not going to be able to live them leave them to your kids whoa this is in New York City it's like the richest country in the world and yeah huge parts of huge parts of southern Brooklyn and Queens are going to be underwater so for the people that live there right now what parts are you talking about well the one that the one that he mentioned most explicitly was Howard Beach but which is its kind of an inch it's like a mob neighborhood and you know it's still yeah really well yeah yeah see because that was like the gaudy neighborhood right yeah that's where they buried all about dead bodies Wow I didn't know that was still a mob neighborhood well you know to the extent that there is a mob yeah and yeah I mean that's true everywhere on the coast everywhere it's not just New York New York is not exceptional right you know their projections that like 30 billion dollars of New Jersey real estate could be underwater by 2030 2035 is alarming I was born in New Jersey yeah it's not as alarming and then you know Miami Beach is you know Miami Beach is done for yeah Miami Beach is almost inevitable correct yeah yeah I mean you know they could they could build a seawall but that doesn't help because of the ground right and and it's just so expensive so you really have to you really have to pick your poison and then when you look around the world you know it's like Bangladesh that country is gonna be almost entirely underwater that's hundreds of millions of people if we want it to build a seawall they can't afford that who's gonna afford who's gonna pay for that and this is all because of the raising sea level because of the melting ice because of the temperature and all this is happening and I think you know we think of sea level is really a thing that happens on the coastline which it is primarily but it also increases flooding on rivers because the water is all connected of course so flooding in the UK is expected to grow 50 fold by the end of the century what well that life default London is already like under water a couple times a year I mean not the whole city but is this Jamie this is Bangladesh I just went 200 that's under watch jeez oh my god these people are fucked yes there's 18 million residents live here that's a swamp yeah that looks crazy like it look if you are a real estate projector and you're flying over that yeah yeah yeah we can't build here yeah Jakarta will be totally underwater those apartment buildings like you could see the water level look back up a little bit this is just a running little oh but if you see look at like doesn't that look like a water level and the apartment buildings on the right-hand side and your where your cursor is yeah like like that's gonna go up to where that orange level is fuckin Christ well I mean over millenia we're gonna rise hundreds of feet Oh God I mean it's gonna take a long time so you can adjust that a little bit but but that's always been the case right the the the I mean they're still fine they find these artifacts and things in the middle of the ocean yeah areas where people used to be able to live and now they can't live anymore yeah I think that'll be we have to move people have to move so what's a good spot Alberta anyway anywhere anywhere off the Benton yes the spot now I mean I think I would like that all the time and I say you know honestly the place that I would move to is somewhere in Scandinavia really because um you know I talked about the impacts of economic growth before but they're gonna be parts of the world that benefit economically from this anywhere in the north so Canada Russia and Scandinavia will benefit because why don't go to Scandinavia go to candidates right there well that's look prettier to me yeah skins Navy is nice but Candace like our neighbors although they also yeah they have wildfires there to Canada and that's the end to in the Arctic Circle in Finland bears yeah and outlines but so you know these guys the economists who study this stuff say that there is actually an optimal temperature for human productivity it's 13 degrees Celsius which is the historical median temperature of the US it's also the historical median temperature of Germany what is 13 Celsius was about sixty degrees or something now yeah I think it's like in the high 50s all right whenever I'm in Canada always like I don't know what you're saying yeah it's 22 degrees 55 point one and so for every degree north of that you lose about a percentage point of GDP so the u.s. is now at about 13 and a half degrees Celsius at our median temperature that means that we're losing about a half percentage point of GDP every year from it but there are parts of the US that were cooler than 13 and are now brought up to this optimal level Silicon Valley is like exactly at 13 degrees right now which is you know notable because they're like super productive yeah and that's gonna be so that'll be true for Scandinavian generally and it may be part of the explanation why there's been so much economic productivity in Scandinavia over the last generation is that they have already started doing better with temperature crops are gonna be more bountiful in Russia like Russia will have better agriculture because of global warming which is why they they make such a you know they're such a complicated figure in the geopolitical story about climate so they are a Petro state they have almost all their economic tivity activity has to do with burning oil but they're also poised to benefit from warming so they're doubly motivated to produce more global warming Wow and they have such a fuck that we're at rest of the world perspective that they're not going to stop whereas Canada probably they're like likely to even though they'd benefit from more warming they'll probably get on board with any program to avert warming but that is a that's a dilemma that faces every nation you know like Justin Trudeau gets you know talks a lot of shit about Donald Trump in his climate policy but he Justin Trudeau is also approving new pipelines Angela Merkel does the same but she's retiring nuclear so quickly in Germany that they're having to use dirty energy and even though they've had this incredible green energy revolution there their emissions are going up and every country in the world is it's a collective action problem every country in the world is incentivized to behave badly and let the rest of the world clean up the mess so I was talking this guy yesterday about wildfires and he was like you know California is doing so great you know with all of the emission standards they're basically you know holding themselves to the Paris Accords even though the country as a whole isn't but that impact isn't local its global so it's dissipated the temperature impact on California wildfires will be determined by it like I said earlier basically what China does so in terms of you know what any individual area what any any individual nation is doing the motivations are really really complicated there and in California in particular this is a bit of a tangent but you know you the state has done incredible stuff with emission standards fuel efficiency green energy and yet all of those gains now are wiped out every year by the fires because fires are trees trees are burning trees are basically coal in the sense that they are stored carbon when they burn they release carbon into the atmosphere so every time there are wildfires like there were last year in California it literally wipes out all of the progress that the state made in all of its green initiatives that year yeah and you know about in in in in Brazil that the president Brazil wants to like basically DeForest the Amazon the Amazon is responsible for something like 30 percent of the world's oxygen and is a huge sub all plants obviously absorb carbon and produce oxygen so plant life is really good for fighting climate change when you say he wants a DeForest yeah the Amazon at what scale what does he what is he talking about doing so the scientist who studies his proposal say that his plans would be the equivalent of adding over a 10-year period adding a second China to the world's global footprint Jesus Christ yeah and this is just a pump up Brazil's economy yeah well he has a kind of a Trump be like I'm gonna fuck that environmentalists perspective too so he's just like a little bit like you know whatever flipping a bird to people who care about it and that just makes you think that like it seems crazy now but it really won't be crazy I think a generation from now for another country to threaten at least sanctions and maybe military action to deal with that you know after World War two we built a whole liberal international order around the principle of human rights that would have been unthinkable in the 20s and yet it led to a series of military invent interventions over the next half century because people were behaving badly towards their own citizens if we could do that it doesn't seem all that crazy to me that say thirty years from now a an empowered Imperial China looking at someone like Boston ro and Brazil would just be like no you can't do that I'm just gonna we're just gonna go in and like take you out yeah and this is what I mean when I say it's a kind of all encompassing all impacting threat our politics will be shaped by it our geopolitics will be shaped by it our you know our everything will be shaped by it we could have climate wars like in the not-too-distant future Jesus Christ how is this being received the book yeah are people people resisting it is there anybody that wants to debate you on this so I you know I wrote this article a couple years ago that produced I mean it was a huge sort of viral phenomenon but it produced also some scientific criticism and you know we published a fully annotated version where every single lot we showed where every single line came from but there were still scientists who were arguing about whether the messaging was precisely calibrated whether it was too bleak too dark the book has had none of that I mean it's first of all it's been the best at first week it was on The Times bestseller list number six bestseller in England it's been in the Amazon top ten and all of the reviews have been really kind I think this goes to what you were saying before I think like the conversation is changing people are actually really interested in talking seriously about just how big a deal this is in a way that they might not have been just a year ago where is the resistance though is there any resistance to it right now to the bus well not just the book but just the concept in general 73 percent of Americans believe climate change is real 70 percent of Americans are concerned about it those numbers are up 15 percent since 2015 who are the 27 that don't I mean I think it's you know it's aren't right-wingers yeah yeah but you know those numbers are we live in a we live in a culture now where like most people's worldview passes through a prism of partisan politics so like you know there's amazing studies that show that in the night in the early 90s there was no partisan divide between on the question of whether OJ Simpson was guilty when you control for race Republicans and Democrats had the same idea about OJ Simpson's guilt that is totally unthinkable today and there's now a huge partisan split on whether 12 years of slave deserves an Oscar partisanship has like totally taken over our minds such that the fact that we have 73 percent of Americans who believe global warming is real and happening to me that's a really fucking high number actually because one of the two parts I don't think that the Republican Party is really any more a denier party I think they're just a party of skeptics and self-interest they want to like look out for business interests which actually the calculus there is changing which I'll talk about in a second but people don't want to believe that horrifying things are real because who would it's terrifying but 73 percent of the country that's a lot I mean that's you know that's more support than there is for just about anything so I'm like basically and the speed at which that those numbers have grown is really dramatic I said 15 points since 2015 8 points just since March has moved out that's incredible and I do think that the economic logic is really powerful here so it used to be the case that there was economic conventional wisdom that action on climate was going to be really expensive because you require massive upfront investment and it would also foregoing economic growth but all of the new research the last couple years reverses that logic totally so there was a big report 2018 that said that we could add twenty six trillion dollars to the global economy through rapid decarbonisation by just 2030 we could avoid all of these horrible six hundred trillion dollar impacts that we're talking about if we decarbonize rapidly and there are also obviously business opportunities there they're whole solar empires to build their whole new electric grid to build so if the economic conventional wisdom is now that fast action on climate is better for the economy than slow action on climate that hasn't yet totally taken over the perspective of our policymakers globally but I think it will soon and when it does I think that we'll see like a real sea change in in their perspective because I think for a long time even people who cared about climate thought well I want to do something but if I have to like cost some people some jobs and cost like a percentage point of economic growth that's not worth it let me just kick the can down the road this is a slow-moving phenomenon well invent our way out of it we'll grow our way out of it but all the new research says like let's get started right now and we'll see how that plays out I mean if we really have to have global emissions by 2030 it means really really aggressive action which I don't think is possible but I do think that we'll see much more aggressive action in the decade ahead than we've had in the decades in the past so you think that once there's financial incentive for people to either some sort of an industry that reduces carbon or something along those lines industries that are working to mitigate global warming that once there's a financial sort of benefit for those people to innovate and to move forward with this that that's we're going to see real change yeah well also that um I mean direct investment of particular companies but also you know government leaders who look around and say if the economic picture is going to be better ten years from now if we make massive investments in green energy then it would be and and even like past laws you know regulating say fuel efficiency or even banning internal combustion engines which i think will happen within a couple decades if that's gonna be if the economic picture taking that path is much rosier than the economic picture of inaction I think they'll go down the path of action right and you know again the question is how aggressively how quickly and in what form but I do think that you know I do think the incentives will be different five years from now than they looked five years ago and that'll be that'll be huge so that that you think would be a great motivator for people to shift their perceptions and particularly right-wing folks may be amongst the 27% that are in denial yeah well I mean if you look around the world denial is not really a problem anywhere but the u.s. there's a little bit of an in the UK but it's a totally American phenomenon and when you understand that the u.s. is only 15 percent of all global emissions is that's just typical American arrogance like what do you think is the the root of that uh I think it's it's basically bad behavior by the oil companies I mean they've like put out really aggressive disinformation and denial you ever see the movie merchants of doubt' yeah yeah perfect example that right yeah totally yeah and I know that the people who wrote the book - who are really really great and you know it's especially horrifying because in the 60s and 70s that the oil companies were like doing some of the most ambitious research on climate so they're you know then they ended up suppressing that going forward but they knew shit about how the planet was going to change before any of the rest of us really yes no alternatives back then and there was no real emission standard so like this that's when catalytic converters started being enacted yeah well you know somewhere around then if we had started decarbonization in 2000 which is just coincidentally was the year that Al Gore won the popular vote for president we would have had to globally cut emissions by about three percent per year to get below two degrees we're now at a spot where we have to cut them by about 10 percent per year and if we wait another decade we're gonna have to cut them by 30 percent per year which is like an unthinkable rate so we wouldn't have had to take such aggressive action if we had started early we would have had to just be doing kind of on the margins changes but we're now in a situation where the problem is way too big for that and there are people who want to talk about the solutions that could have been useful 20 years ago now talking about the carbon tax is like one quite popular thing to talk about the UN says that in order to be effective the carbon a global carbon tax would need to be perhaps as high as fifty five hundred dollars a tonne and there's nowhere else in the world there's nowhere in the world where there's tax that's even 1/100 as high as that right now and the places in the world where they do have carbon tax is everybody's emissions are still grow up going up so there there was a time when like the kind of like you don't have to change anything we'll just like fiddle on the margins here could have worked if we had taken if we had really been focused on it but we're sort of past that point now unfortunately but it's interesting you know that the talking about the oil companies I think they you know I think they're responsible for denial but I also think that denial is not all that important in American politics because when you look around the world you see many countries which very with very different politics even quite universally focused on climate issues who are not behaving any better when it comes to carbon than we are and so you think well what is the sickness here is that the Republican Party and their climate denial or is it the fact that all of us just want you know more better cheaper stuff and we have a really hard time conceiving of different paths that don't push us for towards more consumption and you know more more of the modern amenities that we sort of assume will keep accumulating over time I mean people say financial capitalism is the problem I have some sympathy for that view but I also look around the world I see social democracies who are behaving really poorly when it comes to carbon I see socialist countries who are behaving really poorly when it comes to carbon it seems on some level like it's even deeper than the systems that we have to organize and manage our cultural priorities and there are now you know getting back to the villany of the oil companies there now all these lawsuits that are being brought against them for basically on the model of the the cigarette companies like that for climate damages and that may be they may be victorious they may put some of these companies out of business I think it's not that but it's possible there are also other lawsuits that are happening that are really interesting there's one in the Netherlands that some people held the Dutch government it basically the Dutch government was not honoring the Paris Accords and citizens sued to hold them to that and were won the case so the Dutch government is now obligated legally to do better on climate than they were doing on their own and in the US there's this amazing Court case called Juliana first the United States which is a lawsuit being brought by kids using this kind of ingenious use of the Equal Protection Clause they're arguing that their generation has been exposed to climate damages that they're the previous generation their parents generation were protected from and so they're saying this climate policy is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause you're not protecting us in the same way that you protected our parents that's at the district court in Oregon which is just one level below the Supreme Court I think it'll win in the district court almost certainly won't win at the Supreme Court but if it did win in the Supreme Court it would immediately obligate the u.s. to a totally maximalist climate policy because it's literally impossible to protect the next generation from climate damages as fully as the previous generation was but they'd be obligated to do everything they could which would mean sort of suddenly something like the the world war two scale mobilization that the UN calls for which would be really kind of dramatic and credible and I think that's one path forward is through litigation because so many places in the world it's not just politics are inert like American politics are inert it's just there's a lot of slow-moving bureaucracy and slow-moving public opinion and in the same way that a lot of civil rights victories were fought and won in the courts I think we might be able to make some progress in the courts on climate to we'll see if you had a magic wand if they made you the king of the world mm-hmm and they said you you can decide what we do what would the first step be the first step is just ending fossil fuel subsidies I mean there's no reason why these companies should be receiving public money and why are they just incumbency advantages they're well-connected companies a lot of them are really big and powerful and any government in the world is not going to a major industry to like completely collapse but you know if we're really subsidizing them five trillion dollars a year that's a ton of money that could be poured into green it like 2 rd of new technology it could be poured into carbon capture like we talked about before that's just unbelievable resource and it would accelerate the decline of coal in particular and and other oil other fossil fuel businesses which would be great is there any discussion about that in individual countries yeah but it's slow-moving you know there's stuff about people are taking action in all different ways at all different levels which i think is basically necessary so there are cities in Europe where cars are now being banned cars yeah in the city yeah just like riding around yeah you've been living in LA too long you can do that in Amsterdam you can do that it just seems ridiculous yeah well I mean I think maybe maybe it'll just be you can only have an electric car hmm you know maybe 10 years from now like it'll be illegal in the u.s. to build like a you know a gas guzzling car I got an electric car recently and it's amazing the blowback from my friends what is missing well first of all it's always homophobic or or or feminine yeah they're always going after you about your estrogen levels and your manhood it's like it's weird it's kind of like a space I mean Tesla's are kind of like they're kind of like spaceships though they feel I mean that there's what have you been in one yeah you driven one I haven't driven one everyone yeah I drove in one years ago and I wasn't that impressed I want to say like maybe five or six years ago but now I have one of the new ones that's crazy fast yeah it doesn't even make sense regular cars are stupid yeah they're stupid and you spend all that money on gas what would you want to do yeah but I mean they're stupid like they don't work as good like that thing is way better than any car I've ever driven yeah it's only gonna get better there they don't even make sense how fast they are and they drive themselves yeah like you hit this little thing go do do and it just fucking steers it takes over yeah like it drives yeah and it's it stays within the speed limit and you could just kind of half-ass spaced out cuz keep your hand on the steer well and it uh it breaks when his cars in front of you and slow it's very strange it will even change lanes for you amazing it's fucked it's weird it's weird it's very difficult to let go and to give in like that but the strange thing that I felt was the the blowback from my friends yeah like and they're joking around obviously most of my friends are comedians but it's it's hilarious have heckled me about yeah well I feel it like I just at the aesthetic level I understand that mocking of like the Prius but I feel like the Tesla is actually a little macho you know yeah well the piece is a piece of shit it's like a cheese way yeah wheels yeah but I mean it's like you know yeah we live in a sick culture we're like being like we're healthy and responsible it's like it was like cigarettes and whiskey yeah mock someone eating a salad yeah it's very weird it is very weird but I was that is an American problem like other parts in the world data they're not as attached yeah their trucks and gross yeah we're gross but but there's something particularly strange about being on that side of it because I was I want to I don't want to say I was pessimistic about electric cars but when Elon did the podcast I told my Bob one of his cars yeah he was telling me how the great theremin yeah yeah yeah I'm PI one of your cars but I really did not expect to like it as much as I do and then once I got it I was like okay now I get it yeah but then I was thinking about my own resistance to it because I like cars I have you know muscle cars I have a couple of an older Porsche I love them yeah they're fun I like those kind of cars but they're stupid they really are dumb that's a dumb way to get around the Tesla is a way better way to get around yeah and you know he's got one that's coming out in 2020 that's gonna have a six hundred and sixty mile range which is insane I mean he drive all the way to San Francisco and back with you now I mean he's incredible I think you know I like there there are reasons why he gets the shit that he gets but I also think like Tesla and SolarCity are incredibly important and I'm actually I don't understand why there aren't more people in Silicon Valley who are focused on climate in this way like obviously like these are people who see themselves as gods who want to be world historical figures they're there literally do that who do you think is doing that well like like Jeff you think he thinks himself as a god yeah really yeah really you don't know I read those text messages he said to that chick I don't think God would say that but you know God would say you should be lucky to get this dick all the space exploration stuff though it's like you know all like people are obsessed resent the life extension extension but don't you think that that's just a side effect of having 150 billion dollars so you could do so much good with that yes so Bezos is pouring a billion dollars a year into his into his space exploration project which is like I mean I'm excited by space too I think it'd be cool to go up there but there's some pressing problems here which we could really benefit you know that money could really benefit and I agree but long-term I think the philosophy is that we're gonna have to get off this planet if the human race is going to succeed but as of not just the threat of global warming but of tax yeah minutes factors it's an asteroid thing I think I mean for Novas yeah there's a lot of factors mark on the particular question of climate there's just no way that the earth is gonna get as inhospitable as Mars is so the idea of building a colony there as a hedge against global warming it's just crazy we could it is ridiculous why I'm a good on the positive note if we could fix that shithole yeah like imagine what we could do here yeah paradise yeah well the idea is terraforming right they go there with some kind of massive machine that's gonna create oxygen and the environment and yeah well it's a good place to practice cuz no one lives there so you could do all kinds of goofy shit and go well good news and bad news the good news is we figured out a way to terraform the bad news is we already fucked up Mars so we're gonna try another spot we're gonna go to you know we're gonna move on Uranus yeah yeah well you know Venus used to be actually quite earth-like yeah they went through a really rapid global warming yeah that made it now it's like a total hellhole right and that's like this sort of worst case worst case for Earth is the Venus scenario well ultimately the sun's gonna burn out right look at what that's many millions of years sure but if we really do look into the future something something has to be done you know this is the on the grandest of grand scales the the concept of some sort of interstellar arcs I mean I believe that I'm and I'm I'm with it I just think the timescale of the threat that work that we need to avert by space exploration that's a timescale of millennia yes we have a lot of new technology to develop over the next thousand years that will allow us to do it better and more efficiently but climate change the time scale is like the next 30 years right so we need to focus on it now know to give ourselves the opportunity to do the other show why do you think it's sexier to go to space is that what it is like rockets and I mean I think for these dudes yeah yeah it's a big metal dick yeah I didn't often the atmosphere that's what we're doing I've had a fuck space I actually made that argument about Mars yeah it's like they're shaped like dicks yeah something to that yeah well also in this generation of people really grew up in the in the age of like the space race yeah I mean it's um and the aftermath of landing on the moon and I think there is like Peter Thiel talks about this there's this kind of unfulfilled sense of future that we all like anybody who grew up in the post-war years in the 67th they were like you know whatever his famous line we're promised flying cars and all we got was 140 characters or whatever and I think that applies to the space exploration stuff is like well the government is no longer doing the really ambitious shit right but we can do it privately on the other hand there is a government in the world that is doing that shit in China they just land it on the far side of the Moon they're doing really aggressive space exploration and I haven't been there in 20 years but the people I know who lived there say there is so much faith in the future they're they just believe in a very inherent deep down way that like the future will be better and sci-fi II in an exciting way and that's so far and from the way that Americans think about the future is that part of the benefit of having a dictator run things I think it's just like they're on a huge upswing right so like there's no debate about how things get done yeah yeah totally I mean that's what I was saying before it's like it gives you some hope for climate if like Xi Jinping is just like okay immediately no more coal mm-hmm they'll all stop you know but he's also throwing two million Muslims and concentration camps right umm this Bezos thing I mean I'm not criticizing you because I think it's a very common thought but why is it that we look at these super-rich billion billionaire characters that are on the top of the heap why do we think of them as like having these tremendous egos and looking like gods isn't it sort of just that's just how you're always gonna look at someone who lives in a 100 million dollar house and it's possible I think when you look at I mean not to get to like armchair psychology I think that Bezos but when you look at the physical transformation that he's put himself through when you think about like the life extension what has he done physically he's just like I mean if you if you look at photos of him when he's like a young man he's you know just kind of like dweeby right and now he's like um an action hero is he really yeah I mean maybe not like you but he's like he's yeah he's pretty this is Bezos jacked am I missing something let me show ya it looks different Google pull up pull up some marriages of Jeff Bezos jacked I didn't know but he got a trainer I mean no I'm not blaming him but that's only one part of it I would say bigger than that is you know the the high just how thin-skinned on the worlds okay let me say zoom in oh I guess he's got some arms yeah there is oh wow that's a big difference he's also got a vest on I guess his arms do look pretty big yeah I mean I'm not I'm in most ways I'm not a business hater I think Amazon has been actually really pretty great I'm a fan yeah I like will listen to the guy talk and I loved his letter to the National Enquirer there he is right there yeah so he looks fit yeah in front of the King Kong rampage movie yeah that him yeah he looks pretty good okay I guess physical transformation but that's yeah probably life extension like you're uploading your brain to the computer it's somebody busy into that ship he is actually I think not as into it to some other people but that is so sci-fi you know I I interviewed Kurzweil a while back when I was doing the sci-fi show and I went to this 2045 conference that they had in Manhattan and it was these guys are they're talking about something that they think will be invented and they're acting as if it's been invented inevitable yeah yeah totally I mean Eric Schmidt has said about climate change that the solution is already here in the sense that AI will just solve it like that what no that's that's a weird thing that we do though right we always looked like Oh someone's gonna handle this yeah well the brain upload stuff is interesting to me with regard to climate just because it's like a portal through which we can escape environmental degradation so if the world is on fire and full of suffering maybe we can just upload our minds to some machines and not not live in the real world anymore right and when I think about even my relationship to my phone like tech addiction generally we're sort of being taught to think of the world on our screens as more real than the world that's around us and that sounds in a lot of ways like decline a stand or whatever but I also think it may be a kind of coping mechanism for a world that we're about to head into where there is that much more suffering and when I when I see for instance like the whole wellness movement I think their intuitions they are about like the toxicity of the world and how we have to avoid it I think the way that it'll reshape our own sense of self and relationship to the world and idea of our place in nature and history all of these things are really up in the air and we'll be affected by climate change I think in you know in ways that we don't yet appreciate or understand so the to wave the wand yeah what would be step number one step number one is ending fossil fuel subsidies and fossil fuel subsidies number two step number two just massive R&D investment a massive investment in R&D and new infrastructure this would be great for the economy right totally so all these things taking a positive or taking a negative and looking at positive aspects of mitigating the problem yeah and yeah new energy sources I mean that you know you there really there are already new business empires that were are from the climate change era there are new solar empires there wind empires but that can happen globally that needs to happen globally and you know that's you know then we have to we have to deal with agriculture which maybe about seaweed and maybe about lab-grown meat I don't know but you know it's it's like the big picture it's all carbon it's all just how much carbon we put into the atmosphere so I think it will come to be the case that in the decades ahead everything about the way that we interact with the world will be described and understood in terms of carbon so that for instance you walk down the aisle in the supermarket see organic food you see non-gmo food you'll also see like carbon free food and that'll be a big part of the way that we consume everything that things will be advertised that way promote it that way but globally we just need to really focus on reducing carbon it's a like and wherever it is which is almost everywhere we need to figure out new ways to do whatever it is we're doing that's that's causing that problem we need to make it trendy in LA I do have some organic gluten-free carbon free food I feel like that's already kind of a should be yeah that would be as long as that kicks in and people realize there's some street cred to being carbon free yeah I mean I think in different parts of the world people will relate differently to it so like yeah in China they're scheduled to have this huge boom in beef consumption and dairy consumption because it's expected that as that country gets richer the people will adopt a more Western diet hmm but it's also possible that they won't that like the new Chinese middle class will be still really interested in you know tofu less interested in beef less interested in milk they are they you know and it might be it might be easier to have them follow that path and it will be to make the American average American eat less beef but you know it's it's everywhere it's like everywhere you look there's some there's some problem little problem to solve but then when you pull back it really is just carbon it's like absolutely everything if you think about everything you do in terms of the carbon impact it has then you know the solutions to suggest themselves and I do think that in the coming decades if even if you and I don't start to think in those terms our policymakers well that like everything will be we're entering into a new trade agreement with Japan what's the carbon budget here like what caused their carbon behavior oh we're like you know this we're providing some public subsidies for this Factory over here what's there like a mission situation like can we ask them to bring along some carbon capture plants so that they reduce their footprint you know every at every level the level of the individual like talking about buying a Tesla or buying a you know buying a Range Rover or whatever I think we'll start to think in in the term in terms of carbon and that'll be a sign of just how total climate change will have how totally climate change will have conquered the world so that there won't be an aspect of modern life that will be not just untouched but in a certain way kind of uncovered by it yeah what about is there a way to educate people in a way that's not preachy that sort of moves the needle in that direction I think conversations like this are important I think your books very important and I think you know interviews that I'm sure you're doing right now on all these different shows are important and everything kind of like ups the needle or are just the perception of it a little bit but is there anything else it can be done that can educate people in a way that's it's not preachy or it's not it's not aggressive in a way that annoys people because yeah it's a horrible thing to say but anyway we're like we need sugar in the medicine you know like yeah the song from Mary Poppins yeah I mean I think in general like climate message and climate communication has really suffered for a long time because it was so preachy and because it was so holier than now and because the people that get involved and it part of the reason why they get involved in it's for virtue signal totally and I've been asked like you know as I've been permanent promoting the book by a lot of people like what have you done to in your life to change and it's like well I'm flying a little bit less the flying really makes me feel guilty but otherwise I basically haven't changed anything because I do think that politics and policy are the most important impact you can have and I'm like spreading the word whether I either like a couple fewer hamburgers a year it just doesn't really matter that much but the idea that you would ask a newcomer to the movement to demonstrate their commitment by making themselves the most optimally committed that they possibly could be that's just gonna alienate so many people and this is obviously a issue where we need more people engaged in a more direct profound way so I think for me it's like anyone who wants to care about climate who wants to vote about climate like come on like you know and I think that you know Hollywood can be really important here I mean since I've been out here I've been have a couple meetings about shows and stuff and I do think that we've had really corny storytelling about climate change and that there are actually opportunities for like really incredible new kinds of storytelling I mean in the book I write about this story that happened a couple years ago where you know anthrax that was had killed a reindeer in Russia in the early 20th century the reindeer was frozen in permafrost for the entire 20th century permafrost melted the reindeer thawed the anthrax was released and killed at least one boy in a number of other reindeer in Russia Wow and that is true so in the ice in the Arctic ice our you know we know of rock is like a record of geological history ice is also record of geological history so they're like the bubonic plague is trapped in ice that the Spanish flew in from 1918 that killed hundreds of millions of people is trapped in ice there are diseases trapped in the Arctic ice from before humans were around which means that humans immune system have no experience with them there's so many horror movies you can make about this subject holy shit I don't even think of that I didn't know that the Spanish flu is trapped in ice yeah I mean and there have been instances where like in lab conditions anyway they've revived bacteria that are millions of years old one Russian doctor literally injected a bacteria that he had revived from like 35,000 years ago had been frozen for 35,000 years he brought it back to life and injected it into himself why would he do that just to see what would have thats a fucking Marvel comic book that's how you become like the Red Skull or some shit yeah well that's what I mean about this this story is so big it's like the world that we live in in the next couple of decades will be completely transformed like we will be reading about diseases coming out of the Arctic ice we will be reading about tropical diseases arriving in Copenhagen because now mosquitoes are there because the temperature allows them to live there in a way that they never lived before we will be reading about climate conflict we'll be reading about you know I mean all this shit it's it's it's everywhere it you know air pollution increases the rates of autism and ADHD it changes the development of babies in utero it's like it's all-encompassing Wow the disease and the ice thing is really freaking me out I never even considered that yeah but that is something to think about along with the methane and carbon it's gonna be emitted into the atmosphere as it melts well let me tell you the story so there we now so there was there this species of antelope called a Saiga antelope they they're mostly in Siberia they're kind of dwarf antelopes and they've been around for millions of years and all of a sudden in 2016 or 2015 they literally all died it's called a Megadeth the entire species died they're extinct they're now extinct Jesus and that happened because a bacteria that had been living inside their guts was changed by temperature conditions it was none usually hot unusually humid summer and this bacteria that had been living inside them presumably for millions of years comfortably as a kind of peaceful cooperator became a killer and killed the entire species now we have inside us countless bacteria and viruses scientists believe millions in air human so our guts are full of bacteria that do our digestion for us they monitor our moods they're there you know there are some scientists who think it's really misleading to even think of the human as a unitary animal rather than a kind of composite creature little system yeah and most of those bacteria and viruses are not going to be dramatically transformed by a degree or two degrees of warming but there's so many of them the chances that one could it's hard to dismiss that and whether that would mean we'd all immediately go extinct probably not but what if that means suddenly schizophrenia increases by 15% because schizophrenia is related to a bacterial infection called Toxoplasma Guidance bacteria Toxoplasma gondii well that's that cat parasite yeah exactly schizophrenia is related to that yeah really yeah it's like triples your chances of getting six different Wow yeah and our bodies are so complex such intricate ecosystems like you say that if one little thing gets disturbed it could have really catastrophic impacts on us and that's true of the planet as a whole I think that's big that's one of the big lessons of my book is that this is such a delicate system it's been stable for all of human history and now it's not stable what that means for how we live we don't know yet but the changes will be significant will be profound but it's also true of the individual you know our bodies will be living differently in a world that's two degrees warmer than they are today we can't really predict what those impacts will be but it could be quite dramatic and they could be things that we can't even imagine today because they're you know by some counts millions of bacteria inside us that we haven't even identified yet Jesus Christ you're freaking me out David goddamnit it's a crazy world out there well it not just crazy but it seems like when you're talking about things like this we talking about climate change affecting our actual gut parasites or gut biome and that this literally could change the way human beings behave I mean these are all things that I've never heard discussed and it it just it's really terrifying really is you know I mean and part of the problem is people here like I'll relax everything's fine this is this constant thing that we do where if it's not affecting us currently right now in the moment there's not a fire in front of us we don't worry about it it's a weird compartment compartmentalization thing that human beings do yeah and it's you know we you think that evolution would have trained us differently you think that evolution would have trained us over time to have at least some long-term capacity and I guess we do have some long-term planning capacity but it's we choose to think in really short term ways just about all the time now you've already freaked me out how's your book and it freaked me out more I mean it's every page every page is more of this yeah Jesus man how do you sleep at night you okay I mean I sleep through compartmentalization and denial - I'm not I'm not you know I mentioned earlier like that and I think it's been a problem for environmentalism for a long time that's kind of holier than a thing that's not who I am I'm not an environmentalist until a couple years ago when I started really worrying about this stuff I had the same disinclination to take it seriously than that most people do you know I thought climate change was real I thought it was something that we need to worry about and deal with but I thought it was like a small problem that could be dealt with without much change to my life and I still basically feel that way I mean I you know I'd like going on vacations in nature but I'm not someone who's like spends months hiking that trail or whatever I've never even had a pet I don't love animals you know but my the more I looked at the science the more I just realized this isn't about affecting some part of nature over there it's about affecting all of human life every aspect of human life as it's lived on this planet and that really terrified me but even knowing that even staring at it straight in the face I mean I still get up in the morning and you know whatever do the same shit go to the gym watch basketball go to my day job and I don't think that we should be ashamed of that I think all of us have are gonna have different reactions to this story different perspectives on the crisis and that's good that's human but spreading the word generally making people a little more alarmed is gonna make people take some more action and that's what we need but you know the psychological article biases are so strong that like when I imagine my daughter's life I'm not imagining a hellscape I'm imagining the life the world that I grew up in right and again that's not like that's how everybody that's how everybody reads relates to the world and it's just a reminder of how important it is to look really directly at the science because the world as it exists today is not a good guide to the world that we will be living in in a decade or two there's no way that the climate system as it exists today will be stabilized forever it will get hotter all of these things will get worse every tick upward of temperature will make will create more climate suffering somewhere in the world and if we get to really dramatic levels of warming that suffering will be basically everywhere we can't continue orienting our perspective on the future on the world as it is today we have to take seriously this range of temperature temperatures two degrees to four degrees that were on track for the century as a way of generating sufficient activity and response and adapting as we need to if we keep looking out the window and thinking the world as it is now will continue we're not going to do anything and that's what we've done over the last thirty years which has been catastrophic I think that message is really important and I think that also the message of that we need to change and evolve as a civilization but as a human being you need to still enjoy your life and that you know it's just it's it's a it's not oh my god I need to drop everything I'm doing that leaves any sort of a carbon footprint it's we need to address it as a civilization yeah I mean you know the if the average American had the carbon footprint of the average European America's carbon emissions would fall by like thirty five percent now I don't think of Lights the difference what do they do differently they drive less they it's weird because they make the best cars yeah it's like it's less territory yeah I mean there aren't many people in Europe who like commute an hour and a half to work every day and that's like not so uncommon in America their diet is better Carbon wise and they have more you know they have some more of green energy stuff going on how is their diet better carbon was they just they waste less food basically so like a third of all American food I think it's a third is wasted mmm that's just wasted carbon yeah and you know I think I think the number of electricity is like 70% of American electricity is wasted because how bad the grid is like it just is so bad at delivering from one source to net this is one reason why it Solar City is so important because the battery can be a much more efficient transporter of electricity well there's no excuse for California I mean other than this thought this winter it's sunny every day yeah but so if 70% of American electricity is wasted it's like we're just throwing all that carbon to whatnot you know that's giant yeah and if we were less wasteful we'd have you know less of a problem on our hands but we still like order twice as much food as we wanted then throw it out I mean I knew that you know yeah um so you can understand why someone would say to you like what are you doing but it's that sentiment behind it that's kind of gross right yeah it's like they're looking for you to be a hypocrite they're trying to catch you well when I look at hypocrisy what I see is like you know you want the world to be a better place than you yourself are doing yes it's like that to me there's a way of it's like we think of hypocrisy is like a negative quality I think it's kind of a positive it can be a positive quality you believe we should be behaving in the way collective right yeah yeah and incise need to adjust like you're saying not just what everybody needs to do what you need to do as well yeah conscious of this need to change and like you know if someone believes in say like better health care we don't ask them to donate all of their money to hospitals that's what taxation is for like policy directs our cultural energy towards targets that we want to reach so again as a civilization we need to adjust yeah and as an individual we need to be aware so that we promote and support this idea of a civilization shifting yeah yeah listen man thank you thanks for scaring the shit out of me thanks for coming down here tell people with the name of your book one more time please it's called the uninhabitable earth the subtitle is life after warm it's on my Instagram and we'll put a link to it on Amazon on Twitter and thank you David oh man great man it's great to meet you too good luck with your book round and really I think it's gonna make a big impact thank you you
