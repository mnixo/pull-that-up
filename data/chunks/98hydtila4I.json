hello freak bitches on the weekends if I'm off the road I go to coffee place and sit and write for hours and work on book manuscripts and I'll buy the small coffee like this one and three and a half hours later I'll leave and I just drop it in the trash because it's still about three-quarters full so I don't drink a lot of coffee in the winter time I'll drink a cup of tea in the morning and have a cup a part of a cup of coffee I'll drink all of the tea what would make what what fuels you to be so prolific you know you're saying you write an article a month for the LA Weekly there was a week sound the words a week yeah which is not do that you write for Rolling Stone Australia want your mom and then I write I try and write a thousand words a day for myself and I have right now five different books in various states of completion and that's not some college guy saying my manuscript these are they're done and I'm by day I edit I'm editing the next journal book travel book and then that night I'm writing another journal book and working on one of two different music books III do a series of music books called fanatic why you know rare records and labels like music geek stuff and so I work on those at night and you also host a radio show and I have the weekly radio show I just filled in Oh tomorrow in England BBC Radio 6 I'm filling in for Iggy Pop he took a vacation from his show so I filled in for him last week and this week as well so I did those shows so I'm always busy and so stimulants would get in my way what powers me it's not money it's not ambition it's anger I'm one of those people I I wish there was a better way to say it but it's it's vengeance you laughed at me in high school man he said I was going to be anything really watch this like that still pushing your 50 say I hate to say it all wrong 40 40 years late oh yeah all of it like you know my dad you know here's a big money guy and like okay you love money so much watch me out gross you and your whole damn family too combined and I don't even care about I just like achieving it and it's one of the reasons when the agent goes okay five shows on one off I'm like ah no no man no that's a day off you put a show in there like why because like screw that man watch me dude put two shows on that night what you think I can't I I'm just like I said I setup adversarial relationships I'm not against you or anything I'm just saying I I have to have something to push against like a schedule that is like the schedule of like Godzilla like you can't finish this all it really man I'm going to serve you up and eat you everyday like a steak and I just have to have that and so I'm getting back and it's I think of all the people I was in bands with I have to crush them everyone I grew up with I have to catalyze them why that such a weird motivation is it sucks it's immature it's like it's eleven-year-old sandbox Wow like you're aware of it yeah that which makes it even stranger because it's not something that you're just operating under well you know you have it's it's controlling you and you don't understand why quite enjoy it you can hear it yeah like if I yeah I'm not an actor but I go for acting parts on by basically going in there and winging it and I get you know I get to go for a really big part there's a little bit of trepidation knowing I'm going in there but then I think like oh yeah Sony whatever man line it up and I almost like run out of my car on you know where you at man and I'm not trying to impress you it on the tough guys I'm not I just need it just needs to be trying to tell me I can and I it that informs that everything I do like instead of just dialing my radio show and I work on that sucker for like five hours it has to be all hand-picked know that song not that one this one they make like three drafts of it it's intense one of the reasons why I live alone and like I work all the time like hey come out on this weekend on it's 7 p.m. on a Friday I'm working like I'm not I'm not here as constant yeah no I'm not fun to hang out without you vacation ever where you just channel I can't intellectually and existentially I can't understand the idea of a vacation I make a joke on the stage' so I want to come back 10 pounds lighter with an internal parasite come back with like a scar where the spear kind of grazed me and eight great stories and a dangerous insect in my bag I don't want to sit on the beach and soak in the Rays I want to get sunburned by you know being in the desert and like you know figuring out how the Sun won't try and kill me by noon that's the Sahara and so that's how I go about it so part of your motivation is actually the perception by other people of what you're doing like understanding that what you're doing is so undeniable the volume that you're putting out in the intensity yeah the identity so undeniable like I'll show you motherfuckers yeah absolutely Wow yeah we're even with people who like me like yeah Henry's here like yeah I'm here check it out there check this out yeah here's a place you won't go and it's not that I have any aggression towards these people I just I just want to burn brightly yeah it's not about money if it's not about I'm better than you because I I don't think I'm better than anybody I just want to explode as much as possible and I think to my audience it's to their benefit he's like that dudes going to go up there a place I don't want to go he's going to come back with ten great photos and a story about how I nearly lost his foot it's great and like put me in coach that's the game I want to play that's what I go for [Music]
