hello Lex you might be wondering why what I'm wearing on my face I'm not wondering no no it's coronavirus time everybody out there is wearing a mask so I'm assuming that's what you're wearing on your face yeah so this is a homemade mess takes 30 seconds to make 30 seconds did you time yourself I don't know yeah Brock can you like cut a cup and like strap tied on that would work but there's no yes probably but it probably there as far as I'm aware there's no scientific study of how effective bras are at filtering how effective is that thing so there it's I'm glad you asked you this is some part of this and I'll take this off in a few minutes I just want to 1 I want to talk about some of the science into I want to remove some of the stigma that's around us so I'm part of this group of scientists that have put together a survey paper showing that masks work and it started as a movement called masks fall hashtag in the Czech Republic that essentially one of the critical components of stopping the spread of coroner viruses everybody has to wear masks and the science is twofold so I mean I need to break this apart but you're gonna take the mask off eventually right yeah so let's just take notice I can hear you cuz there's an audio it's you can hear that's so much better oh yeah nice so like taking a condom off that before and after so you probably shouldn't be wearing a mask when you're doing podcasts definitely not but everywhere else yes so when you're going out to the grocery store each wear a mask everywhere and that's okay so some some questions do homemade masks work so there's a currently a shortage of n95 respirator masks which should be exclusively used s PPE personal protective equipment by health care workers okay there's also a shortage of surgical masks which are these non Vohland fabric masks that work very well for the thing I'm talking about because there's a shortage of them we should not be buying them it should be saving them for health care workers and then the open question was whether homemade masks like the one I just described work to stop as a filtration mechanism this is the confusing thing for the individual centric society that we live in masks are the most what are they actually effective for what they're effective for is to prevent me if I'm infected asymptomatic from spreading the infection to you so that's where the movement of masks for all started which is your mask protects me my mask protects you and the idea there is is not I'm not protecting I'm not creating a wall from the rest of society I am contributing to the sort of the bigger aggregate picture of it by not allowing the infection to spread so the masks is masks allow you to reduce that transmission rate to one to below one so allowing you to decrease the transmission rate while also long people to be in public so how much of how much we've been studying this disease and the the potential remedies and all the different things around it a lot a lot yeah what do you what is your thoughts on hydroxychloroquine and zinc and zi packs this is something that's been thought of as a potential remedy yeah as a potential remedy so on that side I haven't studied the actual so there's not nothing clearly published yet the biggest problem so yeah when I say I know a lot what I and others have been doing is reading a lot of papers they're coming out in the hundreds every single day so people doing really strong studies across the board this is pretty unprecedented right we're something a new disease comes out and everyone's scrambling to try to figure out what if anything can help it yeah there's a lot of aspects here that are precedented the scientific community has stepped up in a way that I've never seen I couldn't imagine it was possible to do like everybody stop what they're doing and from whatever walks of life so artificial intelligence community is really working on a lot of aspects of this which I can talk about every it the virologists bioinformatics folks so everybody is working on this looking at different angles and obviously people who are developing vaccines and any viral drugs are working on this the thing is when to your question we're all waiting for actual studies so you can't really answer it you can't say something is promising or not so what's happening now is there's incredible candidates for vaccines for any vile dogs but in order to say anything at all there has to be at least a little sign a little signal that there is that this is something that can work mm-hmm for this particular so one of the things is if you look at the biology of it just the protein structure of a Kournikova 19 virus there's a lot of elements to it they're different from even its other family member of SARS within the corona virus family so it's a totally open question whether things that form asks what kind of things work for coronavirus versus SARS versus influenza or says Rhino virus which is behind the common flu and then what what works on the corona virus so that's true for masks that's true for drugs that's that's true for epidemiological study models and so on so there's a lot of uncertainty here and you have to actually do the test on the mask side I'm really paying attention there's a guy named Jeremy Howard who brought a lot of us together from all kind of expertise and we're putting together this giant paper showing that masks are effective and the same thing is happening in in other domains with masks the powerful thing about masks is it something we can do that us individuals right now a lot of our us individuals are stuck trapped in our homes unable to do anything your only tasks is to remain to practice physical distancing social distancing to maintain a health immune system to maintaining health immune system seems to me to be the most important thing because there's so many people that are asymptomatic we don't know why whether its genetic we don't know what what is causing some people to have virtually no symptoms whatsoever but I would think that maintaining a healthy immune system eating healthy foods in particular supplementing with vitamins but for me particularly I've ramped up my vitamin C in a big way vitamin D 4,000 IU's a day exercise exercise these on if you have access to a sauna and I know most people don't but if you don't have access to a sauna and you do have a bathtub take yourself a hot bath you know which what you're looking for is heat shock proteins one of the things that happens when you have a flu or when you have a fever right your body is your body when it's when you when your body has a fever one of the things that's trying to do it's trying to kill that virus it's trying to overheat it and that that production of those heat shock proteins is very important there was a study written on flus and viruses and regular sauna use and it showed a significant decrease in infection with regular sauna use so it might not help you if you have it now but it will help you to keep a strong and healthy immune system heat and cold those two things shocking yourself with cold baths and shocking yourself with hot baths if you don't have access to a sauna if you do have access to a sauna I would recommend ice ice baths and and in sauna it's just it's very very important for your immune system it's so it's a way that you can only you're giving yourself a drug that your body makes really yeah I read a couple studies actually on the use of I don't know about sauna but heat instead of hot water then switching to cold mhm for increasing the cytokines know what the efficacy of natural killer I think they'll call on Kate and natural killer immune cells hmm that that are essential for when so there's this moment when you get the disease and you progress a coronavirus you progress from just being having mild symptoms to having to go to the hospital to having to then go into a critical condition so that transition the natural killer cells are essential for that and the variation from heat to cold and water helps so how strange is that that's one of the strangest aspects of this disease that people seem to have mild symptoms and then almost overnight it turns on them yeah it's and it's so strange and it depends on the you know and we don't understand for some people that doesn't happen for some people it does yeah that mean it's gonna be a long time before they sort this out and the real problem with that is in the meantime all these fucking nut jobs that want to blame this on 5g or you know or whatever fill in the blank with whatever crazy conspiracy theory people have one that is interesting is that Wuhan apparently had some sort of bio weapons lab there that's interesting to me because if that's the case it's not outside of the realm of possibility that something could be accidentally released or purposefully released like if they do have a weapons lab there I mean would it be why do they make weapons labs if they if you why is anyone making bio weapons you're making bio weapons too the idea is you're making a disease you can inflict on the enemy right well if you have a disease that can be inflicted on the enemy that's just human beings if that stuff gets out it would be the the biggest shock of all time if it turns out that this was actually a man-made disease that was leaked from a lab I'm not saying it was again I'm a moron I'm not the guy to come to when it comes to bio weapons or viruses or any of these things but I'm just speculating as a human being that if there is a bio weapons lab in Wuhan Google that was it ii know i mean i've heard that a few times to this well when I googled bio weapon lab and one French I was talking about history that comes up it says experts no it is not a bio weapon no corona virus is not bioengineered how did the outbreak start it did not come from that how they know right that so first of all bioengineering let's break that apart fascinating topic I mean what one of the things that coronavirus is making us realize is holy crap there's things out there that can kill us yes on a scale that we've never before imagined and nothing like that hopefully will be happening here but this is the dress rehearsal right right if it was something like something that has like Spanish flu or that kind of potential for death yeah influence of Spanish flu influenza I don't think we've seen the worst of the flu is it yet no I don't think so either that was the scariest thing about talking to the guys at the CDC when Duncan Trussell an idea show down there they were saying we're not worried about some man-made stuff we're worried about natural stuff and that natural viruses that mutate and jump from animals to humans like they believe this kovat 19 is they don't like that's the scariest thing and you can't stop it and it happens all the time yeah if viruses weren't so terrifying they would always be beautiful the the so so what is a virus it's uh some genetic code RNA DNA wrapped in some protein so it's a it's a piece of computer code that goes into a human body or any kind of living organism and has them run that code in order to print stuff and it's able to mutate so there's there's millions of viruses out there most of them infecting living organisms that are not human and they're able to spread in these insane ways and in fact infecting billions of organisms I mean that is a what in terms of weapon in terms of a natural pandemic is terrifying yeah because they can you know a lot of people are worried about what's happening now with the corona virus the deadliest part of the Spanish flu was the second wave well no it was this was the second wave connected to the First World War to the First World War is there was a mutation which made it a lot deadlier so a single mutation that then begins to propagate through the for society can can completely change the way we experience this virus it was particularly deadly because it was really devastating to young healthy people with strong immune systems it was devastating to everybody which is surprising usually it's a compromised immune systems was nice as devastating to well this one's weird in that it's so rare that it affects children it's very strange that this virus has a small impact on children you know but goddamnit there was a story that I saw a video about this article that was written that was talking about a one day old baby that died from corona virus but when you go when you go into the actual story itself the doctor who is furious about this was reading his paper was saying that the article rather he was saying the baby was twenty two weeks premature so like that's probably what killed the baby and that is so premature and he was like the idea that someone is using clickbait and and fear-mongering at that scale during this crazy time when people are starving for information and terrified and running around trying to find around especially people with newborns to read that um I gotta kill the newborn and then you go and realize what no it's a complication and we don't you meet the baby tested positive for corona virus but it's also 22 weeks early I mean if that's the first baby that's dying from this like we're very very fortunate that it doesn't attack young people it doesn't attack babies yeah and that's the source of terror for people so I've interacted with folks with families mm-hmm I mean that seems to be one of the biggest things that people are afraid of weather's bad for the flu well what's bad for the children yes they're it's devastating for children yeah and and and to think so both sides of it one children getting sick and two parents getting sick and thereby not being able to take care of their children yeah it's good point yeah so the that's and that that can spread that's we're so sensitive now in terms of just on the verge of of giving in to the fear out of mass scale and that's where information and sort of inspiring words the silly old word love is important like community and compassion so on to sort of fight that fear the silly old word love silly old word is a silly old word you're so Russian old it's silly Russian John wick says silly old world love yeah so there you go that's clickbait title the Joe Rogan experience no I just mean that there is a danger here of people beginning to panic when when the economic impact hits so there's a 13 percent unemployment I believe in the United States so the the Great Depression was 23% so we have something like that which we're starting to creep towards that number so that's 16 million people out of a job currently I don't think we have any idea when the economics right now we're we're in limbo we really are in limbo because how many businesses are going to close because this how many people don't know they're unemployed but are how many businesses are barely hanging on and they might not make it to the end of the year and if the economy takes a downturn because of all these people out of Joe many businesses that we're barely hanging on before and they're still open now we're gonna be gone a couple of weeks and we really don't know and it's so I mean how long do you think it's gonna take before businesses are up and running again I know Wuhan is back up in business again but there's a lot of criticism about that and they're they're also saying they're seeing new cases I think the question I think it can be sooner than we think if we do the following things so one I'd hate to linger on this I'd love to talk to you you talk about masters yeah well it's funny but you're yeah I know for a fact you're gonna make fun of me just like I'll make fun of you right back for loving fanny packs but just like fanny packs are exceptionally functional to carry on the things you need masks will be masks are required yes low the spread of this infection listen I'm not an anti mask person and would like one of the things that to do is you have to start getting governors so politicians to wear them our President Trump to wear them well this is the Boris Johnson question right because that guy not only was he not wearing mass with you shaking hands and he was talking about it pretty openly and now he's in intensive care if he dies that will be the biggest wake-up call for everyone yeah I mean I hope he doesn't die but goddamn people are so mean over there I don't know his policies I don't know I don't I haven't been in England in a long time I don't know how they feel about him but fuck people some people hate him does she like saying things like they would they're hoping he dies they hope he suffers and dies I've read Twitter Andrew Doyle angel Boyle rather the guy who wrote woke Tatiana McGrath yeah his he but it was actually his own personal account he published some of the tweets that people have written about we don't have to put it up there I don't want to up these people signal but it's just so heartless so yeah that's masks but testing really one is yeah but there's three things masks besides like washing hands and social distancing all that stuff masks testing and contact tracing so contact tracing contests so this is great let's talk about this first of all I'm gonna keep would we get it masks well you don't get it we don't get it have you ever even wearing masks you know how weird it is like societally for us it's a weird stuff to take I don't know what it's like an open question what does it take to do that yeah you know it's weird it's really weird so you can't see the emotional expression of the people you can't it like that there's a strange effect to it and then the other effect is as a as an individualistic society you're wearing the mask not to protect yourself but but to protect others and that's a weird thing for us to do we don't I don't think people are thinking that I think they think they're protecting themselves well you can sort of delude them or you can tell them the truth that no the that this I mean there's a nice positive aspect to this is me wearing a mask says I care about not getting you sick yeah it's a really powerful social signal for when you're hanging hanging out with people I think there's so much ignorance going on though I don't think people weren't there's a large percentage of people is my assumption that are wearing that mass that are not wearing it because they think they're going to protect other people they're worried about getting it yeah and right I don't think I mean this is what the whu-oh and the CDC this is where I I hate what they're doing with which is sort of there's truth and that there is ideas of how the truth will be misinterpreted by the public and so you shouldn't tell people the truth so there's a kind of sense like the whh oh and CDC have said that masks don't work for example or they said that we shouldn't be wearing masks but you see them for the health care workers well we have to be honest about what the timeline the WHL what they've said they're wrong about so much of it they were initially saying that you couldn't transfer it from person to person I mean this was just in the beginning of the year I mean Dan Crenshaw I went over the timeline of all the things that were wrong about what the World Health Organization said on the podcast yesterday it's terrifying stuff and you know and obviously newspapers were going off of that information and they were printing misleading stuff as well and the president didn't know no one know that the whole thing is very weird if you're if you're going based on what they were saying it didn't look like it was gonna be nearly as bad as it is and then everyone has had to make adjustments I'm actually the one I like I'm I'm so I'm I'm so freaked out about the loss of life and the loss of jobs and how people are getting SIDS it's it's really weird that everything about it is weird it's weird in our lifetime to be a part of something that's just affecting the entire world like this but I've gotten a lot of messages from friends that are cored and teamed with their families and like we've never been closer and that we realized that we're in this together because we realized that you know during these crazy times you you realize what is important love that silly little word you were talking about love and community and friendship like my neighbors everyone's so nice everyone's waving now and everyone's like saying hi and you know talking from over the side of the yard and how's everything you guys alright need anything we're right here there's a lot of this like comfort and warmth that you know think experienced a little bit of that post 9/11 where people get shocked they get shook up and then they realize what matters you know yeah that's one of the things I don't like about masks is uh it feels like you're protecting yourself from like you're removing yourself yes see there's that look and what get away from me dirty beeping yeah get away from me so the germaphobe kind of idea that's not what they are supposed to represent but that I'm sitting here on the science that says we have to all wear them and then thinking like how is that going to change interactions it's it I don't know what to do with that you're an MMA fan yeah what do you think about the UFC's decision to have fights next weekend on an island I don't know what we don't know where it is I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing if I'm going to it or not I don't know we're dating yeah I don't know where it is I don't even know if it's in America but I literally right now as of right now I don't know shit I have no information okay so first off it's in on the island like I saw like it's it's fight island it's literally a storyline of enter the I mean this yes Enter the Dragon this is like I don't know who the Bruce Lee is or the Chuck Norris should I get a Chinese kung fu outfit and do commentary with a kung fu Alvin are 100% be culturally appropriating at this no you know what I'll do I went on there Bruce Lee tracksuits that wouldn't be culturally appropriating well they'd just be fandom and in time of coronavirus you get a cultural appropriation pass okay I heard yeah I I to me I think that's great because if it's messaged correctly to show that we are while maintaining sort of social distancing all those kinds of things we're trying to fight to bring our society back a little pause right there there's no social distancing in a fucking cage fight yeah okay they're on top of each other sweating each other's mouths there's not gonna be there's gonna be if Tony Ferguson's fighting there's gonna be blood for sure everybody fights tourney first it looks like they fell off a train so there's gonna be blood the cisco distancing you want to avoid is large crowds right one on one one on one so do wood if everybody gets tested yeah that's accessible how accessible are tests right now so in America 0.7 percent of the population have been tested that in terms of testing everybody that's not accessible but in terms of testing special like events special events yet so that's possible what do you think they would do if like there's a lot of good fights in this car by the way jazzy no roses strike his fight and friend is frightening Connor yeah I mean come on gah no and Rosen strike that is that is a fucking crazy fight what if one of those guys test positive what if you know would have just engag taste test positive the guys supposed to be fighting first and do you go ahead or not they could obviously have to ask the opponent if they want to yeah I I'm a little bit Russian I I would I would go ahead I'll go ahead and I don't know so my main concern is how was the general public interpret it because you want to do everything you do now should be done in a way that is one is positive like inspires us for towards the community and to gets us to do the right thing scientifically I don't know if AK Ovid infected person fighting would inspire others to say oh well it's okay if they're doing it it's okay from well I don't think they would allow it I have a feeling that if someone did test positive they would kick him off the card yeah probably should say kick them off the card I should say remove them from the card I take it back that's probably their I think they do I would imagine it has to be the right thing to do and then you would also have to quarantine the people that worked with him in training camp and you enough to test everybody yeah that's by the way what contact tracing is yeah once you find somebody honest and there's a technology for I mean that that's the really interesting infrastructure there but I still I love the idea that they're pushing forward and doing the fights there's a lot of people that are very upset with it it's um it's very it's very controversial the whole thing's contra why do you think this because they don't want anybody to do anything out of the norm of social distancing and of quarantine and you know what we're on lockdown right now and for them look even Nevada which relies almost entirely on casino money I mean not Vegas at least Vegas relies almost entirely on casino money right all the other businesses are so supported by the casinos those casinos are all shut the fuck down cannot have the fights in Vegas but those are large crowds and physical spaces I think now I understand that we're going to be this is gonna be a long this is not gonna be a month this is not gonna be two months how many months you think this is gonna be I I think before we're back to normal I think it will be a year and in terms of when it's going to reopen the economy I think it's summer some possibly late summer unless there's some sort of an effective remedy oh yeah we know for sure definitely definite antiviral drugs or vaccine mm-hmm well vaccine is gonna take a long time there is some really impressive work on vaccines they're accelerating the crap of I yeah it's supposed to take 10-15 years for vaccine and then they're saying 18 months obviously but that's still a long time that's the really long time but they're I mean they're they do some impressive fast testing of vaccines obviously mass-scale vaccines it's something going to be exceptionally careful I wonder what they're gonna do with the u.s. election mailing oh no no I have an idea we'll just postpone it until uh I'm just kidding postponed it's not a bad idea no it's it's a terrible idea oh one thing I do have to say cuz I can't believe this is still going on because there's a big dust-up recently because I said that I wouldn't vote for Biden that I'd vote for Trump before I voted for Biden I just want people to know first of all folks I'm barely paying attention okay if you're getting your political advice from me I'm a moron okay I am a comedian slash Cagefighting commentator you know how you have friends that don't know much about fighting and they'll say something like I think Bruce Lee could kick John Jones ass yeah that's me with politics okay don't listen to me for political advice you want to listen to people what for political advice listen to people that are actually paying attention listen to guys who that's their living guys like Kyle kolinsky listen to Jimmy door he does a fantastic job breaking down politics he understands it right listen to the people that wrote the hill watch that show it's fantastic it's on YouTube there's a lot of people David Pakman he understands politics I'm not that guy okay but what I am saying is I don't want to vote for someone that has a mental problem he's got dementia that's all I'm saying my parents called me my mom's like I heard you're a trump supporter now I'm like I would never vote for a person who obviously has dementia I said I would vote for Trump before I'd vote for a Biden that's what that means you know and there's been fucking dozens of articles written about this I'm like Jesus Christ tweeted he tweeted that like he tweeted a clip of you saying the air Trump supporter no we didn't yeah when did this happen like shortly after get the fuck out of here pretty sure I reach retweet or tweeted I'm not sure that's hilarious yeah I'm one of those fake E Donald Trump accounts no I'm pretty sure maybe was Trump jr. I am Donald Jr I have a programmatic way of following Twitter and I follow Trump okay either way I just want everybody know this is all I'm saying is I think the Democrats are making a horrible mistake by putting in a he just had another huge stumble yesterday the man is ill I wish him no no ill will I'm not I'm not a Biden hater what do you think I just think it's wrong to take a guy that you clearly can tell is struggling he's an older guy who's got some sort of a mental breakdown issue he's he's got what appears to be according to some experts who have analyzed what he's doing it's some form of dementia he has a problem maintaining conversations that's all the time yeah that's all I'm saying folks just and also do you I'm a fucking comedians / Cagefighting commentator you don't need to come to me for that what is this Donald J Trump retweeted beautiful hair of Eric Weinstein this is what again this is what I said this is what I said you shouldn't have that guy I would vote for any of the other ones any of them bring them back Amy Klobuchar bring her back I vote for her before I'd vote for her Biden great I bought for Buddha jej ID for sure vote for Tulsi I love Tulsi Gabbard I would for sure vote for Bernie that's all I'm saying folks is you shouldn't have someone who's clearly got something really wrong and just prop them up and weekend at Bernie's style and fucking bring them up to the podium it's crazy bring back Andrew yang fuck you actually know I love Andrea trying to figure out if it's possible to bring back people at this stage so much has changed and kovat changed everything yes you should be able to run justice back well what I should be able to do is someone should I don't know I think they're just hoping and praying that Biden can hang in there long enough and people's hatred for Trump will get it to the to the finish line and that they could they could win and they can keep him from having these conversations where he stumbles a lot but it's not fair to him as a human being it's not it's not fair to us that this is their only choice they're giving us I mean there's so many people that were involved in those debates Kamala Harris bring her back bring them all back bring any of them back they they're they would be way better a spokesperson for the Democratic Party this is just a terrible idea that's all that's all I'm saying that's all I did say but it's like I just can't believe that someone like me has any impact at all in people's political choices it doesn't make any sense don't do that why rely on people that are paying attention rely on people where it's that's their job let me hear the new one let's hear the new one no no it's what we cannot let this we've never allowed any crisis from the civil war straight through to that pandemic is 17 all the way sixteen we have never never let our democracy sakes second fiddle way that we can both have a democracy and the elections and at the same time correct the public health the case week well that's not too bad it's just kind of stumbling for his words there's been some real bad ones but you know you got to think he's probably medicated they're probably juicing them up to get them to that state of health anyway look these people are not stupid these people that are involved in running his campaign they're probably giving them IV vitamin drips and doing everything they can to try to get him as healthy as possible to bring him to that state it's just not good it's not fair it's not fair for us it's not fair for him so to try to play cuz I kind of agree with you it's so I cringe every time it's sad but I was uh I think was it 2016 when Hillary Clinton ran I was I liked Biden until I hear him talk there's something there that he's just not good at it he'd you would keep seeing things like this that just a little bit off and to me the question is so I am obviously I'm awkward at speaking and you also speak Russian no I think that there's a brain thing there like I well you might be too smart for us it was yet a regular conversation it's a very nice way of putting it but that and he used to stutter so one do we need our presidential candidates to be eloquent is it to me and an open question that's a good point because he might just be like I would vote for Biden if he just never talked so back in the you know especially in 2016 and so on just every time because he's like he's kind of like a blue colleague he has a story with this with a son a vet dying I mean there's so much depth of to him as a human being to his story he obvious is you've mentioned he's done quite a few shady things like lying and and plagiarizing speeches and back in 88 when he was running for president yeah I mean but in terms of his like long track record of just being as part of the system whatever the whatever you think about the system he just knows like at a time like this we need government to work well no matter who you are yeah the government needs to work well now so you have to ask yourself who is the person who will make government work Wow right hey I don't know if it's him you know I don't know I don't know who it is I don't think it's a good idea to have one person have the kind of power that a president has I mean just imagine you're Donald Trump right you're not just responsible for dealing with international relations with North Korea you're also responsible for the environment you're also responsible for this kovat 19 outbreak you're also responsible with me you can keep going it's crazy to think that one person should have responsibility for all the things that happen to the United States of America it's nuts yeah it's totally crazy but I think they don't have to be responsible so and to me the best for president is to inspire the entire population just to be a sort of talking head that inspires the world and the United States and to hires the best people to take care of each of those things you know so attract so inspired the best in the world to come more for him whether that's military whether that's the environments on the science side and that's how you to me that's how you should elect the presidents who inspires the best people in the world I think you're right yeah I just think that it's it's an impossible task for an individual I don't know I don't think I think we should rethink it but good luck with that I mean the crazy thing about the United States is really I mean I had a bit about it that the United States was founded in 1776 people lived to be a hundred that's three people ago three people yeah I'm like this is how recently this is and this is a bit about President Trump about him being elected about how crazy and the bit was about we went from Obama I went from this really intelligent very articulate person and it's like we were involved in a relationship with a really and now we're dating a whore the yeah it was this is crazy bit that I had about it's like we're on the rebound and we're just in a nutty relationship now but I just I don't think anybody should be president I just I don't think it's a good position for human beings I think it was a great idea when we're tribes when we're a tribe of a few hundred people or a mayor of you know a town that's great yeah mayor's make sense it makes sense that one person it's a very stressful job very difficult but it seems tenable it seems like a mayor can be you know a mayor can really control City and do a good job I just think when you get to the scale of the United States of America it just seems nuts it just seems nuts to have one person run the whole show and and then also clearly not because you know you have this gigantic organization behind it that requires all the money from the donors and special interest groups and lobbyists and all these moving pieces are involved to make sure that the people that get in place are gonna suit your interests and and and fulfill your needs and oh and it's all going on right now while the fucking pandemic virus is sweeping the entire globe it's really weird it's a really weird time and yeah and I mean I wish we could just rerun the whole thing because some of the ideas like Andrew Yang's ideas of universal basic income yes that's obviously he's right you know look at what he said about automation now applies to this virus virus people that need money yeah and this is this is where it's really weird and I wish I'd brought this up with Dan Crenshaw yesterday but um a lot of Republicans want smaller government right they want less government but this is a time where big government is necessary were you dealing with something like a pandemic virus we're dealing with the situation where you have to look out for the welfare of all these people you have to restate the economy the government has to pour money into it this is a time where big government is necessary and this is a great argument for balance right this is a great argument for for big government well the goal I think for both Republicans and Democrats is effective government yeah then Republicans would say that big big government is actually you're increasing the bureaucracy not the effectiveness so this is the question now we're testing how do you how do you get at a large scale we're at 0.7% we need to test half the population yeah I don't know obviously I don't know but I would imagine if tests exists right we have a test so what we need to do is figure out a way to ramp that up and I'm sure that's being done right now we're just not aware of it I'm sure that they're trying to figure out a way to get it to everybody I mean some of that is just mass production of testing kits so the main tests they're usually nas and molecular based tests there's other ideas like in the artificial intelligence side there's ideas of how to use CT scan chest scans and try to detect the early onset of kovat versus just regular pneumonia because there's a lot of sort of neighboring conditions here - yeah yeah that's the thing I was gonna say that some enormous percentage like 85 percent of people that come in that are sick are not infected with this because this is flu season and the flu so far has killed an extraordinary number of people which is really weird like while this is going on and this is not to diminish the deaths of the people that have died from kovat because it's all horrible right anyone that loses a loved one I you know my heart reaches my egg for all of you I feel for terrible for anybody who loses someone that they care for whether it's an old person or a young person to a disease it's horrible but why is it that we're so terrified of kovat clearly because it's new but when the flu is killing more people right now than Cove it is and we're not worried about that at all I mean we should clearly be worried about both things and this is against a great advertisement for strengthening your immune system this is a great wake-up call for a lot of people that are unhealthy that are eating unhealthy living unhealthy please like if you value life and you it's like it's so easy to just assume you're always going to be okay if you're okay now you know what this is this sort of mentality that a lot of us go through life with that everything's fine now it'll be fine and this is where Preppers go off the rail the other way right they like fucked us guys following it's talking fall apart and those people I'm fascinated to see how they're gonna freak out like now that this is real and that like it's probably a good idea to have stored food it's probably a good idea to have a small supply of water that's gonna last you a few weeks this is all a good idea like how are those motherfuckers gonna react to this well they're they're ready what do you mean well they're gonna go they're gonna ramp it up even further because now they're gonna be justified like they were right so what you might very well see especially in the south a lot of people have guns right and with with coronavirus there's a like you don't want to infected people in your town so you could very easily see people barricading roads and saying you're not allowed to enter the town yeah well you're seeing that in some places where people have vacation homes and they're leaving the big city and going to the vacation homes and the people that live in these small communities are freaking out because they don't want these infected people coming into their communities and infecting them and they're trying to keep them out of their homes out of their second homes which is like look you can't keep someone out of a fucking house that they own okay you can't just decide that you're gonna throw the Constitution out the window and these people don't own their own property anymore but it gets to this weird state where everybody's in a panic so this to me is where the president is essential is to when people are in a panic well there's so much uncertainties to inspire the world and sort of take us back to reminding Americans reminding the world what everyone did in World War two yeah sort of the huge things we've overcome as a civilization that this is one of yes those cases and sort of as opposed to trying to defend your little corner of this land seeing us as all together as a community and sort of inspire that I think and trying to remove I think in terms of winning elections like if Donald Trump wants to win the election it's just do that because in these times difficult times presidents are popular if you just forget the stupid red-blue divide yeah and just inspire the whole country he'll run away with it it's true but you know it's hard right now to even have that you know he's kind of a he's a guy that when someone comes at him he comes at them harder you know he describes seeing himself as a counter-puncher right someone hits him he had some vacuum and harder and the media just can't let him go like that they there's a lot of there's a lot of currency in attacking him and coming up with a great gotcha moment that gets captured in video and then gets released online and so you get all these reporters that have this rare opportunity to talk to him and we talked about this one lady who just kept being upset that someone in the administration apparently she said it referred to it as the cum flew and he's like what did you say and and she said kung fu he said say that again the Kong flu so she said that and he goes who said that she didn't have she didn't know who he was like someone said it like you heard someone said it like is this really your question like is this really what's what we're worried about is a joke someone might have made in the middle of a horrendous crisis that they call it the Congo flu oh Jesus let's stop the presses first of all kung fu is awesome okay there's nothing wrong with Kong flu yeah is there anything wrong with saying that I mean look the flu it's not a flu it's a virus it's horrible that it's it's devastating all these people but is it more horrible if you call it Kong flu is it so much more horrible that we have to mean is it that racist well to me that's a beautiful moment to say let's put our shallow shit aside let's put this bullshit aside unfortunately he always he was almost there yeah and instead he made it more like about himself and just didn't well so much conversation with that lady I don't think he did I think that conversation with that lady he was like who's had this you know and then but that lady represents a large percent of the population full of ridiculous ideas such as that yeah and he gets a chance to speak to though like inspire that part of the population say let's put this social justice warriors stuff aside yeah a brief moment as we fight I think that threatens the economic well-being of our nation well you hear very little about transgender people using restrooms right now you know you know you know there's a lot of things that you don't hear about you know you don't hear about gender pronouns and a lot of stuff that was so some supposedly important just a small amount of time ago and it's not to diminish the rights and the values of transgender people it's just to say I think a lot of what people were complaining about and the reasons why people were up in arms about things it's not just because we have real issues with discrimination but more so that we don't have real problems so we look to amplify problems it might not be nearly as big as we as they are as we would like to think they are you know I mean when we're dealing with something that's a real life threatening a real huge issue no one gives a fuck about your gender pronouns you know no one gives a fuck of your of a them person are you they them okay congratulations I don't know what to tell you but we're in the middle of something that is a new disease it's killing people and some people it's not killing them at all and they're spreading it around and it's weird so we don't have time for nonsense and we're in a lot of ways because society is so I want to say this in the best way possible this is the greatest time ever to be alive even now even now with all this craziness if you compare the world today with the way we're connected to each other yeah there's problems there's always gonna be problems we're a bunch of fucking weird territorial monkeys living on a planet you know there's there's gonna be problems we're sorting through all these different things out and there's varying levels of economic disparity physical disparity mental disparity this is so much so much difference between all of us there's no no chance for complete total harmony it's not going to exist with these territorial Apes with thermonuclear weapons it's not gonna exist you know what's one of the first things that people did when when all this happened they went out and hoarded toilet paper and bought guns okay that's you know this is who people are all about the shit hits the fan they want guns and they want to be able to wipe their ass and this is what people panicked about this is still one of the best times ever to be alive and the the thing that gives me hope is the way I feel in my community and the way I feel with my friends I've had so many friends reach out and just say are you okay how's everything if you need anything I'm here that's beautiful I love that I love this feeling of community that we have real community it's this like especially in the stand-up comedy world there's an incredible sense of community right now people are reaching out to help people people are donating to people people are sending people money and people are really there they're checking in on each other and it's like we're appreciating each other appreciating each other in a way that I think I think is beautiful and I it makes me sad that it kind of has to coincide with the tragedy sometimes but we're humans sometimes we need a wake-up call we need we need a little something that lets us know hey you know this is a temporary situation this life in general everything about it is temporary we are finite life formed on a finite planet that's heated by a finite star none of this is gonna last it's gonna last for a long time but it's not gonna last enjoy this enjoy this and let's let's let's enforce and let's encourage good values healthy values community values we can get through this and be a better country I really believe this I really believe this I think the survivors of this can get through this as long as we can retain these lessons it's so easy once some something happens and then that thing normalizes and we get back to air quotes regular life it's so easy to forget the lessons but if we can reinforce those we can remind ourselves of this and we can have these moments you know like so many cultures do where they have these religious ceremonies you know I was talking to Eric Weinstein he was talking about Jews and they were talking what was the fucking was it Passover yes Passover and he was talking about how they tell the story every year and the reason why they tell the story I ever used to remind everybody to remind people that you're here because others went through some horrendous shit and let's let's let's thank them let's praise them and let's remind ourselves we're very very fortunate and remind ourselves that we're community and the scale of world war two did that from where I came from in Russia that's where that's why I have my guitar here you play a song well maybe how about right now okay well okay y'all spark up a joint I want to hear this but the reason I actually messaged Jamie and asked do you think it's okay if I play a song and Jerry come on man your poem that you read last time was the shit well but I am s agem without having a song you didn't have a song no no I was just I was thinking about so I've been reading a lot about World War two recently before the coroner virus and then I found out I learned about my grandfather who was at age 17 which actually tells you a lot you have to be 18 to be in the army and he's sort of faked his doctor that was that was what everybody did young kids wanted to fight for their country it's a interesting kind of story you're not they weren't they weren't dodging the draft they everybody wanted to fight for their country in Africa at that stage in 1941 when Germany invaded the the Soviet Union the order from Stalin was that if you get captured you have to kill yourself so there's no surrender so you have to I mean that's the spirit that you're fighting with and so the only way out is if you're a soldier is death or severe injury and in terms of being lucky I've been thinking about my grandfather a lot who was severely injured he was on a machine gun he fought actually alongside Mikhail Kalashnikov ak-47 event really yeah so that's that's gay k47 came from World War two that's a design from from there and so your your job is so Germany in the fall of 1941 is marching towards Moscow and your job is basically to be a human just a thing that slows them down long enough to wear it they don't reach Moscow until winter which would give an advantage which allow Moscow to defend easier so winter is very difficult to fight you even world war two in Russia so your basic job is to slow down the troops so you're sitting there with a machine gun which is exceptionally difficult to carry and you're just emptying all your bullets and so most people are dead and how heavy is that machine that was one of the huge criticisms there's a particular model I forget but most machine guns at the start of they were using basically World War 1 weapons in World War 2 and that the machine guns that they were using had this giant metal shield that you know that you hide behind as you're shooting and that shield would turn out to be exceptionally heavy so you it's not something you can carry easily so it's I would I would venture to say it's probably like 200 pounds that kind of thing fuck yeah so you're dragging it you know through the mud through all of that and while bullets are flying so yeah that's it right there I don't know the exact just yet pretty close probably yeah probably wow we have to look at Soviet Union where the equipment was not great so you're basically throwing human bodies and I mean the so I was thinking about how lucky because I'm alive because the bullets like he got hurt his leg he got hurt in his leg and I'm alive because he got hurt because uh severely where he couldn't continue because that's the only way out and sort of most of his most of his brothers are dead right and that's you're talking about 75 million people died in World War two most of them in Europe and 15 million of them 50 million is civilians so people without a gun 50 million 50 million died and it's different than the virus I mean it's different there's something particularly ruthless it's something ruthless about work well the stories they tell is of brotherhood as you've known from Jocko and everybody is that the kind of friendship the kind of connection that it's incredible there and this is our little a little bit a world war two moment because we're it's a global have you ever read a Sebastian youngers book tribe yeah it's a great book on that I highly recommend it to people try to understand why that tribal connection why the community connection of people that have gone through war is is so strong they actually prefer war in a lot of ways some of them do at least to being home they prefer prefer that that camaraderie what you when you tuning this up how are you doing this I never understood this there's a funny way that's funny you can do it by ear but I'm actually kind of scared she listening yeah I don't know what's going on so like this is a low E E okay that was out of a D and there's a little mechanism you just attached a guitar I think it's actually doesn't go by Auto but by vibration oh the death thing is telling you if it's correct was it doing I have to what does it look like like when you seen a reading on it or something yeah oh yeah oh that's electronic that looks like a little galaxy watch and when it hits blue that's on tune a D G B II oh that's dope you know terrifying this is okay come on bro come on bro you're bad motherfucker here's the lyrics this is yours yeah try sing along no don't please it's bad enough for me although I do want to play a silly song later on okay is it a weird al' yankovic Shawn no it's has to do with he's the best tweet about this you read that he goes we're all Howie Mandel now hi Mandela is right he's probably completely freaked out I probably get him in right after it's over what's the song about by my grandfather about the time we're in about love you write this home yeah okay oh the other thing is I'm a huge hendrix fan so I wanted to play like last time I chickened out I want to play Hendrix you know hey Joe or voodoo child or you know but your videos get taken down as I've learned now I don't get taken down it's revenue sharing well someone tries to steal your money with that with the music part yeah we did that with when Gary Clark jr. saying that Allman Brothers song with Susanne Santo which was great they sang Midnight Rider they did a version of it that's so different than the original but they like fuck you pay me yeah crazy so you can't even do your own thing mechanical licensing yeah and a lot of his automated actually oh I don't know you I've said this before one of the things I love about music because I have zero Talent I have none I don't how to play anything that's why like Jamie thinks it's funny I don't know what tuning is I love things that I don't know nothing about it and I know that there's a rabbit hole of learning music that like sure see the movie Groundhog Day yeah great movie great shot last night we have family night we're watching like old school like I say watching Adam Sandler I'm an Adam Sandler junkie right now I've watched them all dude these fucking movies are so overrated it's insane underrated it's a over yeah I'm saying that a lot it's underrated right at the movies yeah I got the names right that's how the Bert Kreischer thing excuse me his movies are so fucking underrated they're amazing look the fucking Zohan don't mess with the Zohan is one of the funniest movies ever ever seen yeah I was crying laughing in the movie he just goes for it these movies are so silly they're so good but his serious movies are really good like his latest one is real I heard it's amazing I haven't had a chance uncut gems but anyway in Groundhog Day which is Bill Murray movie different things but another old-school movie from like 90 something Bill Murray lives the same life over and over again and no matter what he does kills himself keeps waking up same guy over and over again but he learns how to play the piano because like fuck it I should just learn a bunch of things and so by the end of the movie spoiler alert it's fucking 30 year old movie but he knows how to play the piano he knows how to do a million different things and I remember thinking like that that is really almost what it takes to be an adult and learn how to play the piano you must you must have an unlimited amount of time because to to delve into music like to really learn how to play like if you're a Hendrix fan I'm a huge Hendrix fan right that's the reason why this podcast is named the Joe Rogan experience I stole the name from Hendrix but I the idea of me learning how to play guitar being a Hendrix fan trying to be as good as Hendrix or trying to mimic like what he does that's too much there's too that's too far like your walk into the Sun like that's too far you're never gonna get there there's that that's you much time that's how I look at it yeah it's an impossible time hog well let's see if you can comment on this because for me people ask me about guitar like how the hell do you cuz I do like you know I'm a scientist at doing you guys stuff like how do you have time for the guitar and the way I've learned guitar and I won't show off the things they could do today I'll just show off my televised is to practice every day for I would say about five years to practice like 30 minutes a day so you just have to you you shouldn't look I mean you know this you shouldn't look how far to go to learn Hendrix right because Hendrix particularly is exceptionally easy scales and chords you can learn in a day everything he uses and then just slowly practice he's used the basic blue scale he's a he's a basic blues musician and how dare you know Wow [Laughter] it's like a lot of comedians or basic comedians but they master the timing yeah I don't I think fundamentals is a word that doesn't offend people that means the same thing yeah well isn't in jujitsu your jiu-jitsu blackbelt you understand that's a thing that for whatever reason is it's bothered so many people that Vinnie Magali was talking about Minotauro they were on the The Ultimate Fighter together when Minotauro was one of the coaches and Vinnie Mac laughs was working with someone else and he was saying that Nogueira who's Minotauro Nogueira who's an a legend I mean just a fucking legend when he was in his prime man he's one of my all-time favorite fighters ever his fight with Bob Sapp was probably one of the most legendary fights in all of mixed martial arts and one of the best examples of technique over brawn I mean he and he's an unbelievably tough guy so Minotauro was just an all-time great but maggle Ashe who's a legit world champion Vinny Magalhaes talking about Minotauro jujitsu game and he said it's very basic but Minotauro got offended by that it was really upset at him but he tried to say like I didn't and I've talked to him about it personal he's like I didn't mean it that way he took it in a bad way but I was just saying it's the basics it's like he does arm bars triangles rear naked choke guillotines but it's like razor sharp Roger Gracie is a great example that chrome chrome Gracie is a great example of that fundamentals just sharp into a fucking razor's edge where they just have the perfect guard pass but standard guard passes right the perfect rear naked choke the perfect triangle choke they just know those fundamentals that you get taught when you're a blue belt and but they have them down to just the most refined way possible so that's that's basics in jiu-jitsu it gets discussed like that and some people for whatever reason they get sensitive about it and even the modern guys even Gordon Ryan and all the Danaher death squad people they have actually very fundamental jujitsu oh the unquestionably they have they have those techniques for sure the difference between the Danaher people is there's two differences one they have a phenomenally dedicated group of people that have come out of hen Zo's because hen zou is an amazing guy and he fostered an incredible sense of community also he's legacy I mean hens owes hens Oh Gracie he's one he's a legend right and he comes from the most famous family in the history of martial arts and he is easily one of the nicest and friendliest ones of those that that incredible family so he's got this gem that's just filled with all these people that are first of all honored to be there to train with a legend and allege in school and to they all have this incredible sense of community because of hens oh and because of the people that hen zou is taught there and then you have Danaher who's this wizard this new zealand fucking psychopathic she was the rash guard he's awesome finds the system behind everything which is amazing I mean listening to him talk is a modern-day philosopher wait he's a different thing man he's a different thing Danaher is a different thing and he's a he's a mean genius you know and he breaks jiu-jitsu down and I say mean geniuses only compliments only compliments I'm saying I mean he's like he you know knows how to teach you how to fuck people up man and he does it in like an incredibly scientific systematic way the way he he makes his system and how these guys can progress from being a beginner to just a few years later being able to tap really high level black belts is sensational and that's what people the reason I brought them up is people often don't think of foot locks or the lower half of the body as a part of the basic squat um oh but I think Danaher is one of the people who would Dean Lister and so on who helped discover the basics of foot locks yeah there's a famous quote from Lister why would you ignore 50% of the body yeah Danaher talked about it on my podcast he's like why would you you see that fucking genius brain spinning that's the greatest podcast ever I was like shit out who's correcting your flawed breakdown of different fights great I loved his breakdown also of Gordon Ryan vs. cyborg that was very very interesting very very interesting because that was a big moment when Gordon Ryan tapped cyborg everybody's like whoa holy shit like people knew he was for real wasn't like people were doubting he was an amazing grappler but when he pretty easily tapped cyborg it was a real wake-up call for a lot of folks yes and but on the point of basics it's interesting wood compared to music the this is what's mysterious to me about watching jujitsu watching Hadji Gracie is you watch him do basics and destroy some of the greatest black belts mm-hmm but I can't see I can't see what he's doing actually so when you roll I rolled with follow the barrel and shaji Harborough both guys another example of that style crushing pressure passes to their top game is just fucking that's horrendous but they're doing the same stuff I do mm-hmm but it feels different and and only by feeling it do I discover it the cool thing about music is that can actually it's more it reveals itself clearer by you can hear the difference between Hendrix like Stevie Ray Vaughan playing abend I got played comfortably numb' a cover of comfortably numb and I'll put up a video and a bunch of people were like your bends are not quite like David Gilmore right the way you bend this you know mm-hmm yeah did that sound that special sound Gary Clark jr. sounds very Vaughn song yes the Jimi Hendrix sound they're playing some basic shit I know how to play all of it and that I know like one of the first things I learned is Texas Flood by Stevie Ray Vaughan I know how to play it but there's got to be a soul in there that requires like decades of playing the same stupid bends and really and then also you know dating a few questionable women having an alcohol problem draw so on all of that's in there that's not interesting that it is in there yeah so that in the same with jiu-jitsu in order to do that X joke for mount that hogr does there's something in there like he's been through some wars in order to achieve that chor brilliant simplicity no doubt yeah it's um there's a thing about music to that it seems that there's a big difference between doing it and figuring you know like paint trying to keep track of what the chords are and what the notes are and someone who knows knows they know know they give they're deep in it so there's no wondering whether or not they can play it it's just simply an expression of mood in the midst of playing it that you get from like some a Stevie Ray Vaughan's shit is a good example that he had a very bluesy moody version of guitar playing you know like some of his stuff like you could you could you could feel like pain in it you know you could feel pain and some of some of his course along with his voice to write he had that live hard voice but it was a more of aggressive kind of pain if you look like a BB King that's more blues there's this like soulful like mellow pain and the thrill is gone yeah and all of its the same stupid bends it's all the same music but they yeah - eveing that I mean but the whole point of guitar is to discover music is to discover your own sound did you see that the I mean when you say your own song I'm gonna show you something do when you say your own sound but is it a combination of a bunch of other people's sounds that you've kind of put together and adopt as your own sound is it the classic sounds that you've reworked to become your own like what is your own sound as a musician I think it's your own son I think it's probably similar to comedy is your own sound is discovered only once you get technically just good enough to mimic others and then you can just put all the technical bullshit aside and be good enough to try to hear your own voice like what so when I play the David Gilmore solo for a comfortably numb' it doesn't feel like me to me does not feel like you to you because you feel like you're imitating somebody or you're you're just trying to do the music you're not feeling it like what do you know no I'm feeling it I'm feeling it but I feel like I'm visiting a good friend like I feel like it's not home and that's something you develop over time like that mmm like there is a home there is a something that's a great way of putting it visiting a good friend and and but I think the early days and I really want to make clear that because this is embarrassed I don't I'm not playing guitar enough these days to be impressive so I'm not get out of your own hook get out of your heart dude I love acoustic music did you sit when Bill Withers died I posted ain't no sunshine the acoustic version damn god damn that was good that fucking acoustic version you know I started it's it's so sad when someone dies you that's when you really get into him I've been on this crazy Bill Withers kick for the past couple days since he died that used me song god damn is that a good song I don't know that one oh I wish we could play it yeah I wish we could play it God after the show I'll play it for you fuck there's so much of his stuff you know just like it just makes you want to close your eyes and rock your head back and forth you know it's just and when when a guy dies you go oh yeah oh grandma's hands oh yeah Oh lean on me oh shit you know that's one of the things I did you know self-isolation now is for the first time in a long time so sound weird is I actually like laid in bed and listen to music for like just listen and maybe a lot of people do this I don't usually do it usually I'm doing something else I actually like laid there for the explicit purpose of just listening yeah it's kind of it's amazing it's an amazing experience yes there's there's some real value in that yeah we just put music on well do other shit like working out and stuff you know who's really into that just listening to music is Henry Rollins when I did the podcast with him he really improved did we do - we did - right was wrongs on twice anyway maybe I think he was I love him it's like giant speakers or something that yes he has these crazy fucking but yes he was thank you he's he's got speakers that are worth like a quarter of a million dollars or something preposterous he's dumped all of his money and his fears he said I fucking love him he's so unique and he he just picks out a record and he treats these records in the creation of these records with reverence right and it's really interesting to me because he's a guy who became famous as a musician and doesn't even do music anymore he basically does spoken word he does like his version of like kind of stand-up and he's always writing he's very inspirational in terms of his work ethic he's always writing he writes constantly for a bunch of different publications weekly and then he also puts together a radio show every week so he puts together a playlist and he puts it on the radio and he narrates it and talks through it and and guides people through his musical selections but he'll just sit there and that was like listening to him talk about that was one of the first times I've ever actually considered like oh yeah there's like real real value and just sitting down just listening to music and one of the things that worries me about Henry is so he's not I don't think married and doesn't it family so I'm while that life seems appealing I was because I'm in danger of going that direction how old you 36 come man you're fine no but I'm so loved so many things about this world just like Henry right right that it's easy to let life slip away and yeah uh it's a funny thing it's a because if taking on one way family and kids and wife is a kind of distraction and it's just one of just yet another passion in a sea of passions right that it can often just be a distraction but at the same time the ability to share that over a long life to share your passions seems to be like everything I've seen not only the experience right but everything I've seen it is a profound and additive it's a profound thing to be able to share your passions with others close to you I guess that isn't to be family it is it is that but there's something different on top of that that's my friend Ray Ray who goes by what is he rag enough I said right his name is Ray capo he said something to me once when he was really when we were both really young I'm about like more than more than ten years ago or probably like when I was training with him probably 2013 like 15 16 years ago sometimes maybe even 17 years ago somewhere around that range but we were younger and he was talked about children and having children and that for him it was there was part of it that was for his own personal edification like he thought of children as being important for his own like growth as a human and you know Ray's a deeply spiritual guy as a yoga teacher and he's like and I never thought of it that way I was like you look at it like figure your own and I'm like okay and I think as a man and in raising these little girls and seeing these daughters grow up and for sure I've learned a lot about human beings but also I learned a lot myself about my perception of humans of babies to people and I've talked I talked about this stage briefly but it's too weird to sort of articulate in that joke I used to always think of people as being a static thing like I'd see a guy and he's a 55 year old you know truck driver and I would think that guy has always been that guy and now I go oh you used to be a baby like I knew like if you asked me hey was this guy ever a baby I would say well of course he was a baby but I had never intellectualized it I never looked at it and it instantly gave me so much more compassion and so much more like acceptance of people work a relaxed acceptance like a forgiveness of a lot of stupid shit that people do and have done I I almost immediately and raising kids shifted that and thought how the guys who just got fucked over you need an asshole you like oh your dad's probably piece of shit and you probably grew up in a terrible neighborhood and you're probably you know ruined by your older brothers who are assholes and maybe you lived in a neighborhood where kids were stealing from you and beating you up fuck like that's how you get to be this guy you don't get to be this guy because you just choose to be a piece of shit you know that's not what happens to people you you become something from your circumstances your genetics there's so much involved in who you are and we don't think there's any there's not much value in being mad at someone for who they are you know you could kind of be mad at the impact that it has on your life their stupidity and and we're all you know justified in doing that but I think one of the things about having children of your own is you realize when you see someone who's a mess like okay I kind of I kind of see I understand how that can happen now it was before I would just be mad that it's there it's kind of amazing though that a lot of us I mean at least for me you're remain from the from the self from the ego perspective you remain the same person like there's a lot of parts of me that it's still like sometimes I feel like I'm the same 12 year old kid yeah yeah for sure yeah and it's something especially when there's trauma then that's the stuff it's stuck right like I had to Erik Weisz Tainan right couple days ago he just released this I'm plugging theoretical physics right his geometric unity lecture yeah and that's something he's been holding on for more than 30 years and there's been a lot of you know that's something that's been occupying his mind space he's just a 20 year old kid releasing this now that's why it's such a liberating step and for a lot of us it's I'm I'm the same probably this guitar is the same 12 12 year old 13 year old kid who fell in love with music and the same the same just goes to everything else like how old how old do you feel when I'm talking to my mom I feel like I'm like 15 15 yeah for real he sounded different no sound the same because I always sound like a 15 year old well played he had true just I feel like my mom's kid you know yes my turn now it's like um they're real worried about this stuff they're real worried about coronavirus how she's in the society white or just individual she's like literally she's worried about it physically no she's a woman in her 70s it's just you know I stepped out too it's like is their feelings are justified it's dangerous it's dangerous for them different than it is for us you know and even for us it's not universally gonna be okay there's there's people that are very young that have had serious complications and even have died guys in their early 30s dead so you know everybody's a little weirded out but when I talk to my mom it's um I always feel like I felt when I lived in the house you know I mean I'm you you if I don't know have you ever experienced this but one of the things that I experienced is when I went back home when I went back to Newton I grew up in Newton Upper Falls when I went back when I was a grown man with a television show I was on TV I fucked a loser still felt like a loser I'd go back to that town and I feels like I felt when I was in high school there I felt like an outcast and I felt like a weirdo and I felt like a loser and so I'd go back there and also I'm like I'm a loser there's like a part of you I mean I went back again with my family a few years back and I didn't have that feeling anymore you know and then you're the father that helped to but it's also a lot of thinking you know years and years and years of thinking and years of trying to appreciate all the things you've learned and process them correctly do your best to have the best most balanced perspective on what this all is so then when I was going back I was just really what I was tripping out more than anything is about the concept of memories you know because I have this weird database where I can go to this strange part of the planet Earth to this weird patch of land known as Newton up or Falls and I can go and it was surprisingly rural that was what was really weird like I kind of remembered it but then I didn't rent like my my wife grew up in a terrible neighborhood and when we went together and she would grew up on us really but just crime-ridden when she was really young and so when I was took her to where I grew up easy nothing like real laughing about it but it was a lot of fields a lot of like the Charles River was right behind my house I could go right across the street and hang out in the Charles River a lot of woods there was a lot of rural shit there that I kind of forgot about but it's a kind of time travel just going back there it is it's also like you're accessing files like I stood in front of my old house and I'm accessing these files I'm like wow I remember there's stairs that I always dizzy stairs that Leda I lived next to a place called echo bridge echo bridge is kind of a famous landmark because you can go under echo bridge and yell and echo bridge echoes and has this crazy like thing and so we'd get drunk and going to there and sing Billy Squier songs like only is night when you find yourself alone that was my you know 1980s style high school experience but going back there as a grown man you know and and then in a grown man who's at least gained some grasp of perspective you know I was in my forties at the time and wandering around this town it just was very interesting to to does the concept of memory was very stunning to me the concept of accessing all these different moments where I'm thinking about different times in my life I was in these different areas and different things happen and interacted with people and I can kind of pull those up and so it's a memory is such a strange thing man it's so strange because we all know it's flawed we all know it's filled with holes it's it's like a terrible representation of reality like if you bought memory and like if you said you know hey I'm gonna get a memory this guy was he fuckin won the Heisman in in college and I'm gonna download his memories it should be awesome get that guy's memories like this is nothing you barely remember anything you have a slideshow and a narrative you have a weird blurry slideshow that you can kind of play in the back your head and then you have a narrative of how it all went down but that narrative I mean it's it's terrible in terms of accuracy but in terms of its power and influence on your life yeah oh it's inaudible undeniable but you know pro and con right physical thing sex is about is rewriting narratives that there are the cons yeah exactly sure in perspectives about that too that's where psychedelic drugs coming Paseka Alex yeah yeah yeah and yeah I still feel like a loser when I go back to my parents I become a thirteen and I find my I find myself like defending like basically saying you know mom and dad I'm not a loser like in my head like I'm trying to justify well how about these poor people that have to move back in with their parents because they lose their house because of this fucking crisis and maybe lost that and lose their dream if they're doing a small business and yeah how many restaurants are going under right now I mean it's it might be a it might be more than 50% of small businesses goddamn and that and I don't think we've felt the pain like there's people suffering right now quietly and we haven't seen it's so weird it's such a crazy subject because I could feel the opportunities for people to get outraged at us even talking about it yeah in this sort of speculative way that we're doing like now how many people are gonna like it's almost like people could think that it's not it doesn't give enough respect to the enormity of the moment because it's so so scary for all of us but we're all in the middle of this shit right now man it's fucking crazy this is the craziest time I've ever experienced being alive driving down the streets in LA and there's no one on the road you know drive to a grocery store there's fucking no one out there these people get headed to hardware stores and grocery stores or gun stores well it just feels one of the unfortunate things is it feels like we're we don't know what's happening out there yeah it's new well but here's the good thing this is this is one thing that I want to crack home to people it is not good that all these people are out of work but look at how much compliance we have when we know we have to work together to save lives how many people are amazing yes it's not like all these bars like fuck you were open you know it's not like people just flood in the streets I mean you had a bunch of young people that are doing they're having Spring Break that we got in trouble and people are mad at them but you got to realize these are eighteen year old people they don't even have their fucking brains aren't even formed their brains are mush you know they this is you can't fault them you would be doing the exact same thing we would all be doing the exact same thing those are children but for the adults like a man it's kind of incredible they shut everything down they really did it's shut down everybody shut down you do a few things you go and everybody settles there's not this mass traveling and constant interaction with people this swarm of interactions that could lead to the spread of a virus instead there's pretty fucking incredible levels of compliance if you look at the United States overall you look at this human race it's stuck on this continent together overall there is a stunning level of compliance that I think is beautiful I think it's beautiful I think it's people realizing ok it's time to realize that some shit has actually happened and we got a band together and we got to figure this out and you got the usual suspects conspiracy theories and 5g and fucking they just pulled the David Icke interview David Icke did a interview with London real yeah Oh what he said I didn't watch it I watched a small clip of it somebody put up I want to see what kind of wackiness he was saying you know he's a guy thinks that uh all the elites are lizard people no no I I never fully investigated that he's a conspiracy guy like a heavy-duty kids but he's I don't know if he goes into the lizard people shit anymore but he used to think they were like literally like transformers like they were transforming the lizard people behind closed doors well YouTube took his video down which I found very interesting apparently that London real conversation yes they deleted it yeah YouTube pulled it so the question is like when when it comes to these kind of like there's so many wacky theories that are online right about everything it's craziness right about about virtually everything at what point in time do these media companies have a responsibility to pull that stuff down and how do they decide who how do they know who's right and who's wrong I'm not saying he's right I don't even know what he said but how do they make the distinction that what he's saying is incorrect and and there's so much incorrect shit that's online are you gonna pull all that to like is it just because it's kovat nineteen's because it's global pandemic and we need to make sure that the right information gets out there yeah so having talked to YouTube engineers and execs they kind of have this policies there's these quote-unquote policies right so you want to remain science-based fact-based you want to avoid conspiracy theories and so on which to me always feels the polisseni okay a lot of people agree with that policy even conspiracy theories agree with agree with it in a sense that let's remove lies and keep only the truth on our platform yeah but the point is how do you how open-minded are you to what the truth is right and let's get to something that's like a universally accepted story what not a universally acceptable universally recognized story the Kennedy assassination universally understood that University not mean what I mean is that's it's a story that everybody knows and it's the story is questioned almost universe okay here's a better one epsteen epsteen is killer that's one nobody thinks that that guy hung himself no one how about that guy so if you have various theories or various stories that people come out and talk about with that one yeah and I just actually yesterday listen to Eric Weinstein solo podcast and Jeffrey Epstein yeah I don't know if you've listened to caught it he talks about his kind of conspiracy view of it I wish I was there when he met him that would have been fascinating to see because Eric is too smart he's almost like too smart he's one of those guys you talk to him like oh you poor bastard you're burdened you're burdened trying to make sense of the world around apes you know and all the trauma of anything yet like we were talking about he's still also the thirteen the twenty year old kid mm-hmm so he's seeing he had a few run-ins with authority which makes it which makes them suspicious of authority and I think that our life experience defines that so you can see Epstein in a lot of different ways and how you've experienced yeah for sure like I mean but if you were there look I mean okay I can tell you very nice I can CBD kill quit fun yeah that's right I like it I know actually quite a lot of people that have met Epstein do you really yeah because you're in the scientific yeah yeah especially at MIT it was a big donor you've tainted a lot of people's reputations knowing him basically if you took a picture with him your reputation is tainted yeah yeah whether you knew him or not but I think I I do think that outside of conspiracy theories that he was an exceptionally charming person so he was good you know the charming people charming people yeah and I don't mean to make it sound yeah I know it's positive or negative it is what it is is the devil it's gonna be charming so right right and the other thing is he genuinely showed curiosity towards scientific ideas even out there big scientific especially do you think that was though have you ever thought about that do you think that it's possible that look I mean if you just look at it from a perspective of is the big theory the big theory right is that he's some sort of a intelligence operative right yes so he's an intelligence operative do you don't you think it's a part of his job to try to infiltrate these scientific communities I mean there must have been a directive if he really is an intelligence operative it's not like they're like hey go pursue your interest Haidee I hear you have a really big love of science just feel free to do that on the side no well what the fuck was he doing if he's an intelligence operative what is the intelligence that having sex with underage girls it can't be that well the idea of Eric that Eric pushes forward by the way I'm talking to him on the podcast I do tomorrow which is when I talk about him a lot so I've been preparing for like a three-hour conversation with Eric Weinstein which will kill have you met him before yeah yeah I did I did a podcast oh and I've met him and I hung out with him and you and at the college that's right that's right but it's always a overwhelmingly intense experience intellectually so in a podcast form you have to call people out in their bullshit which is very hard to do with their why's that yeah that that theory boy checked out ten minutes into that theory oh the GMAT yeah and I tried to go back to it and listen to it again I'm like while he was talking like okay I'm so far behind here of what he's I'm just gonna like try to keep up but recognize that I'm not going to and then go back and then listen to it again well he hates putting stuff into words simply yeah he's like allergic to saying simple stuff because it's not beautiful and witty so he always like drenches everything in humor and wit and this like beautiful language well he talks to the initiated he when when he's describing complex things he describes him to people that understand complex things know but it's also mean this is the criticism I had this what I'm gonna nail tomorrow and always tell him is he almost he hates explaining the basics of something he just skips ahead right even for the initiated it's nice to go to the basics to explain like what are the ground were standing on he skips right into the depth of things which is you know beautiful but sometimes requires you listening again he's too smart just hanging out with apes like me but he had an Epstein he thinks that yeah his arm you know it's possible that Epstein is sorry what was the term use but of the Intelligence Committee he's an operative operative of the intelligence community but the the pedophile thing is a mess up on the part of the intelligent so they didn't know they didn't miss that ya know so well it could it could also be that he felt like he'd get me remember when this was all started out when he started out doing that it was all before social media right so he probably thought that he had this incredible amount of power because the fact that he was connected and by the intelligence community if he was he probably thought he could get away with it makes you wonder of all the horrible things that happen in this world before social media before the spread of information was Bob craziness create just just sheer craziness you know but I know it's like look how about Catholic Church and they just still might be going on right hundred percent goin on down hey guys the fucking heats too hot let's stop fucking kids no they're still getting away with it somehow or another you know the Vatican is still its own country you know that right it's like it's sort of recognized as a country they have their own laws they don't extradite people so there's a bunch of sex criminals that live in the Vatican and there was a recent thing with Australia where they they acquitted some believe it was a cardinal that was accused of sex crimes with children it's awful man the idea that that one church is so connected to that like there's not another Church you go oh kid fuckers Catholic Church kid fuckers they like that they go hand in hand you don't there's nothing like that with like Mormons there's nothing like that with Presbyterians but the Catholic Church is like inexorably connected to child molesters that is fucking crazy and that we all know that they have shielded these people and move these people around there's been horrendous documentary so if you watch them your jaw drops you can't believe did you ever hear no evil your watch that documentary that's not the one where the Boston Globe I don't know one that won the Oscar I don't know if that was the documentary say yeah here's a document yeah yeah no it was all about this well there's a bunch of um you know I don't even want to get into depth about it because I get disgusted there's a quite a few documentaries about sex crimes in the Catholic Church and one of them one of the more horrendous crimes involved that guy Ratzinger that they had to kick out as a pope you know that guy was personally responsible for moving a priest who was molesting kids moved him to a new place where he molested a hundred deaf kids yeah just imagine just imagine that you you could be that that person can exist inside the structure of the Catholic religion or the Catholic Church and that doesn't mean they're all like that I mean I'm sure there's a large amount of beautiful people that are involved in the Catholic Church you know there's a probably mount of people that really only want to do the work of God and become a better person and that's why they're in it but you also can't deny that this is a thing that exists in even in 2020 this is still an issue that's crazy man and one of those issues just like influenza that we kind of we've accepted as a thing that yes because it's not new yes yes what is that that's so weird that's so true what you just said you just nailed it yeah it's just and there's all kinds of other types of suffering that we that's just in the background malaria yeah they dope all the problems that only Bill Gates worries well everybody apparently people that were at his when were you at his 2015 speech when you're talking about it um you listen to that speech no I have not he's he's like spot-on predicting everything really yeah I mean and he's still right forget coronavirus I mean basically the thing the the thing in this century that's likely to kill 500 million people is natural pandemics yeah I mean this is what we're going through now is nothing so if like World War two for example like the stories just thinking like learning more about my grandfather what was going through a Russia and Europe we take for granted now that we can go to the grocery store we still have food we're kind of talking about it but like imagine there's no food that's it no food that's it yeah that you're starving so millions of people gonna die from start they imagine what you're gonna do for your family if there's no food especially so the world war two had the nice the horrible but the nice property that there was an enemy but when with the coronavirus the enemies other people yeah yeah and that when things get really bad not coronaviruses shouldn't say that because that's not going to get bad but a natural pandemic its it can do it can wreak I mean he can destroy societies in ways we can't imagine Bill Gates was basically in his very polite nerd way saying that we should really be worried about we should really be investing in a huge infrastructure for vaccine development for testing all those kinds of things yeah I think because of his charities you know he's sort of looked into it a lot deeper than a lot of other folks have and because he has an infinite amount of time and money he's probably sitting around thinking like wow how come people are looking at that hey do you think they're done psychedelics find it yes yes I mean so many people of his era did you know it was a big part of Steve Jobs and his revelations although I think he probably should have done more of it Steve Jobs and Exim I wasn't a little bit nicer oh you're that intensity that passion is what fuels great engineers so it does that's the problem right it's like you get something that great you almost have to have that maniacal vision behind it what do you want a nice guy or an iPhone thank you I think that's a great meme that's a great meme Steve Jobs like looking looking angry she says what do you want a nice guy or an iPhone bill Gates once coyly defended LSD use by saying I never missed a day of work oh there you go yeah of course he did it yeah of course he did it theythey all tried it back then why wouldn't they you know yeah I think you guys know would beef with it was Ilan about about I think he said that the chest he said something bad about Tesla no no no no he was actually defending he was talking good about tie cans about Porsche tycoons and Elon said he was very unimpressed with him but as he reminded me with memes somebody replied with a meme of not a meme a real video Bill Gates jumping over a chair and they said I don't know I find him impressive and he Lana said yeah that's pretty impressive I love when uh tech CEOs of major companies that have the can be silly like that Elon is very silly he responds to people on Twitter he gets silly he's having fun having a good time this is Bill Gates jumping over a chair that's a pretty good jump for a nerd not bad what do you mean for a nerd I hate that word by the way I love nerd yeah too good word nobody you don't use it you don't mean I don't mean it in a positive way yeah yes okay well let me let me I do often you do often yeah yeah I mean a guy who like is wearing glasses with the fucking sweater with a collared shirt underneath it he looks like a nerd so you use it positively in that let me a silly kind of way but you don't think of a nerd as somebody as an ideal of a man or an a do it like wrong with nerds no I just like my perspective is never like that look I'm a nerd about a lot of things I mean see now you're saying that I'm a nerd about for sure no I I totally I guess when I was speaking to and that's relevant for our time is that science is not admired in ways because I've seen the alternative mission Soviet Union the way people admire scientists is the way they admire great athletes great great creators of all kinds and nerds sometimes diminishes that in in ways that it seems like a peculiar quirk of a human being is just like it's it connects it to like you know going to comic-con conventions kind of nerd verse that's different that's a dork the dork yeah so when you comic-con dork we've think we've gone over this recently dork is rarely positive Dorf is good if it's done self-deprecating Carr self a dork I'm such a fucking dork but it's very rare that dork is positive whereas nerd is often positive nerd is like guys a science heavy heavy science nerd like that's that's just a fun way of saying someone's really smart about a certain thing but I know what you're saying yeah there but I don't think the way around that is to eliminate words or even stop using certain words I think the way around that is just to appreciate people that are really great at science yeah that's the way around that it's not the words don't really matter it's perceptions that matter no I don't think necessarily that science has a bad perception it just doesn't have a glamorous enough perception how many people can name Oscar winners that are just really good at lying they're just really good pretenders and we can name them but how many people can name Nobel Prize winners in science it's very few right exactly and I guess the thing I was also speaking to and definitely keep using the word and it doesn't oh I'm gonna preventing words is uh I don't let nerds tell me what to do and see there you go no the the thing so that's actually the point I was trying to make it wasn't the his nerd is synonymous with weak that I always hated as a person who loves fighting like I like to appreciate like I like the fact that people are complimenting sort of the into the pursuit of your scientific curiosity that is great but I just never liked it it's the thing I've experienced in this country is nerd as an image is seen as weakness he's the kid that gets picked on and I was it always annoyed me because to me intelligence and it nerds annoyed me nerds annoy me because they like lean into it like most people I know are kind of like don't work out much yeah cornered in it and they kind of lean into that idea do you think they're leaning into that because they were bullied by people who work out a lot so they think of those people work out is like I don't want to get into their thing those people suck they were always mean to me yeah something like that and you kind of create a narrative where like jujitsu or fighting it's like a brute thing just like you talked about with just having small penises mm-hmm you say say all those barbarians with their big penises yeah that's why you telling me this is the the professor is giving us a tour was telling me I think you can be a noble person and have a big penis whoa you trying is it a humble brag an analogy let people know that's all right no I agree with you that's what people don't want right we don't want a guy with a bigger dick than you that's smart that's like the same thing you don't want a guy with a woman or a guy you don't want a woman who's hot and smart you know if that was like when people think of really beautiful women they automatically assumed that woman's dumb and oftentimes that is not the case sometimes people just have awesome bone structure and if they you know stimulated themselves in mentally if they pursued things if they had an interest in certain scientific or you know esoteric ideas and you underestimated them you would be you've feel really humiliated if a super smart but super hot girl put you in your place let you know not only am i hot but I'm fucking smarter than you stupid like that too men don't ever want to think that they almost always love to assume that someone who is pretty is dumb yeah I love it I love seeing like I love seeing women who dress up like like pretty like sexually they're not trying to and are also brilliant yeah no it's a it's like a nephew to society there yeah I can be both things listen man women like dressing like that we're different you know for us to try to imagine why they like doing it well they're trying to look sexually attractive yes for sure why they trying to do that they actually liked it too they liked dressing like that if we if for a while for wonder like if if women were into us dressing like women like how many how many people would do it if that became a new thing like girls really want to fuck guys or wear skirts isn't that a big deal in Scotland that's a kilt it's a different thing different you know like a miniskirt I'm like like fucking the hot little latex jammy like you know hugs your curves I think you see some dudes and use your legs to do that that would be like this maybe not a lot of people wouldn't maybe they would not know if you had to life they're like and you have to shave your legs maybe that would be the end but it depends right why do girls do it yeah they don't all yeah by the way how many people find out what their woman really looks like now they can't do their eyelashes they killed my brows they can't do their hair that can't do their nails whoo well your your haircut is the right haircut oh this is what everybody should get yeah wish I did it when I was younger it's liberating yes from the moment I did it I was like of course yeah god damn it especially for someone that's losing their hair like please just shave your fucking head and just accept it only if you got a weird-shaped ed that's you okay accept it and I'm gonna do any better with some weird hair hanging off the back of it I'm growing it out you should man got a beautiful head of hair look at it so thick it's like a brush yeah you use your hair to brush other people's hair thanks to the idea but sits yeah the the fact that their barber barbers are all closed I mean all of these little aspects of society just kind of yep it's kicking in mm-hmm it's like I'm hoping things restart and normalize you know I'm hoping the economists can figure out some sort of a stimulus package to get things rolling again I hope we have the resources it's I'm hopeful and I'm also hopeful that the positive aspects of it will stick this is my perspective the Kido guy is pretty good for this is I've been enjoying it I was not well I don't know I feel like I can not eat for long periods of yeah they're like fasting ice I guess you know and what it does me I like it you're not so you lack the discipline to just Ankit oh I just my Instagram post today well I was very rarely Kido i did carnivore though that was my favorite diet yeah that's all I'm still doing carnivore just eating but I just decided while this is all going on if there we might have an issue with food I'm not gonna be picky I'm just gonna eat for sure that's just my perspective during this thing once everything normalizes if and if and when that happens I'm gonna go back to carnivore I think like right now oh my I'm just gonna eat I'm gonna worry about that just gonna be thankful to have food yeah carnivore is amazing it's great for I've been running longer longer distances I did Devon gave a Goggins ID yeah it was I wanted to talk to you about that tell everybody what you did cuz it's crazy you ran four miles every day or every four hours every four hours yeah it's not it's not that crazy it's crazy for me I'm not a runner so it's 48 miles over a period of 48 hours for two days the mileage is not that crazy because I was doing like a 9 or 10 minute mile so it's not you know I'm just running old lady pays a lot of time that the time is in the mind the the thing that really pushed me to end okay I decided to do after each time to record myself saying something that I'm grateful for which is a stupid fucking idea why well no it's a beautiful idea but the recording part because I hated life and I hated everything like halfway through like so I had to be positive when I'm recording myself so you could only sleep for a couple hours at a time a couple hours at a time are you tired all the time I got that where I wasn't tired I was like hi I was like unsure what's happening delivery's because your body is exhausted in a way that's like like after a good workout mm-hmm but it continues going farther and farther into that direction everyone is hot right it was yeah it's a it's a high but there's an exhaustion too and it was I was carnivore I was hungry but also overeating like for some reason really wanted to full oven roasted chicken so I I'm one of the runs I ran by the grocery still picked up other roasted chicken and just ate the whole thing and then just the the whole just the whole experience just is a mind don't test your burning off an insane amount of calories running four miles every four hour or four miles or four hours not that insane I would say it's probably the whole thing is probably I don't know 10,000 calories so over two days it's not too crazy yeah but you're basically running a marathon a day yeah that's crazy for two days yeah that's crazy deal is why are you trying to downplay it no I was great I mean the whole thing was crazy but do you think Jamie I'm up wrong here right I understand what he's saying no so cuz you get a little break for four miles isn't the longest run that's like a 5k you can get it done in less than an hour it's 45 minutes it's that's given long if you're going at his pace is that what you're doing about 45 minutes 45 yeah sometimes I would stop like it's cool you get pretty far through an audio book but the sleep thing was I was crazy I think the only reason I did it which is a good lesson is I saw Goggins posted on Instagram and I announced on social media that I'm going to do it she's the only reason I did it I mean it's a good thing too it's nice it's nice to just announce you know because then you feel like such a accountable yeah so I mean I thought maybe I could just delete the tweet just just a walk but I was great about our sober October challenges you have to do it you know the first one was so easy the yoga one was just 15 hot yoga's in a month's is a yoga every other day not that big a deal but seemed like it it's hanging over your head but that's nothing compared to what you did well the the nice thing also David Goggins on his Instagram went live every four hours so every four hours beforehand I'm just like sitting here watching this crazy shirtless man like screaming yes of course he was making it seem like it's gonna be easy and let me kind of walk it back like the gratitude thing was the filming was hard and but it is actually a really cool experience so before the run I wrote down 12 things I'm really grateful for like family like family friends my childhood like a night and as I ran I thought about it like what I'm gonna say and that thinking it's weird it was all for doing like recording myself right but the result was like pretty profound for myself as an experience it's kind of similar with podcasts like you and I wouldn't have conversation without microphone right right especially would wouldn't have it this long this long sitting across from each other yeah but recording yourself was like I really have to now think that I'm thankful for my family and think of like really put that to my nose yeah that was big and and also just by the way if people are thinking about that for because there's a I had so many people message me about the challenge if you're thinking of doing it please don't do it bitch I don't listen to him i I think I think just running 48 miles is a better challenge because this was torture so if you okay just okay people are thinking of doing it realize that you're not doing a test of run it's not a running test it's not a marathon test it's a test of it's it's a mental test of how much you want to do something really stupid I guess that's that marathon test but like the you have so much more time to think about how stupid the thing you're doing is that makes it a really big mental challenge would you if you have the option halfway into it to just finish the run just keep going until it's over 100% yeah really so you think it might have been more torture to do it with those brakes and the rests and the food and relaxing for a little bit yeah yeah the Tory hangs over your head it hangs over your head the fact that you have to wake up in three hours and like oh so I never slept in my bed I just laid facedown on the carpeted floor did you substitute any those runs for jujitsu I was I substituted one of them for jujitsu but at the end I run eight miles because I thought it was a cop-out that's how I did jujitsu I felt so jujitsu I did shout out to Broadway Jets they're all closed now yeah jujitsu Jim's gonna be a while before they open up again right and I hope it doesn't they don't close like I know man it's just so many people gonna be freaked out by germs yeah but I it feels weird to talk about but yeah I felt really really good when did you do this pretty close to this whole log break maybe a month ago to a month and a half ago yeah it was like February then yeah end of February SHhhh yeah and I actually gave a big talk to a large audience in Philadelphia like a March 8th or something like that like I was in Vegas for the UFC that we can those are the last weekend I traveled so I guess it was March 7th that might be the last time isn't that weird like what was the last time you did a stand-up mMmmm that week I did I did some shows the improv and and then I was supposed to do some shows the Comedy Store and we were talking about it and they said it's too the rooms too big because they were limiting the crowds down to 200 people that was the first thing they did so they were gonna move the crowd they were gonna move my show to another date and then open up the original room which is a smaller room of 150 people and they were asking me if I wanted to go in there or if I'd wanted to just cancel and reschedule we were working all that out and then they contacted us and they were asking me and a bunch of other comics like what what do you think we should do here you know cuz there's part of us that thinks we should just shut down and they shut down before the order was given to shut down they decided this is you know the Comedy Store doesn't want anybody get sick and they were worried about people losing income but they were also saying like this is probably the right idea to just shut down and then The Improv shut down shortly after but they all shut down before they were required to they just shut down because it just seemed like the walls are closing in but did you realize at that time this might be the last time wait man because it might be I am I don't want to say anything but it might be a long time before you do stand-up comedy what do you think another six months I think it's okay here's what I think all right I think it would be longer than six months for sure really yeah why do you think that because gatherings of large group I'm hoping I'd there'll be a lot of interesting in of what gatherings or large groups will look like like I can see you're doing stand up to a small audience let's tuned in like people remotely turn in a larger scale what I get something like online you can't do it no not online only because you have online period because people record it and record it yeah working on your new stuff so you're always you know comedies are assholes they're very good which is one of the reasons why most sets don't get leaked you know they leak the louis c.k set it's like almost understandable especially just learn live yeah yeah I see it you can get it I've watched all of it I watched a half of it I'm weird too sorry to interrupt no okay it was weird to watch because it's good it's intense like his other specials right he talked about pedophilia everything but it feels weird to see a crowd to listen to it yet to see a crowd and to listen to a comedian in this time not mentioned come on a virus so like I think it made me realize that I have a hunger that's probably a lot of people to hear like a comedian talk about like we want to see stand-up comedy about the virus mm-hmm yeah I guess the podcast is a kind of replacement but like because we're we want some normalcy right we're all alone with our thoughts and our paranoia and then news media which in many cases is accelerating our anxiety because there's value in developing stories and writing stories that get people outraged or clickbait you know so there's that and we need people just talking just talking just just people that are just like you talking about stuff various walks of life that's that helps us this is a certain community that we're all part of you know and I feel very connected to that now you know because this podcast is it's kind of taking on a different form over the last few years which is one of the reasons why I actually have to address people talking about politics and me Mike you guys are out of your fucking if you listening to me but I have to accept that that this is part of the new form that this thing is taken and another form that's taken this this thing is taken is that it's sort of like an electronic campfire in a lot of ways you know there's there's a great value to people just sitting around shooting this shit and I know there's a lot of people at home that can't you're not chiming in you wish you would you want you probably have some things to say it's one of things one of the reasons why comments get so aggressive sometimes because people are listening they have something to say and they can't you just keep talking and like fuck and they're like but maybe you should focus your guests or maybe we should maybe we should it's really they they have a thing in them that they want to express to like you're talking they have some interesting shit to say too and a lot of them do yeah by the way at that point I know you don't check comments but I'm actually I kind of enjoy checking especially yours like I'm a fan there's a little one one I'm a fan of yours I like being a fan of cool people and I'll just go on your Instagram just comment and there'll be some there's always some percentage of people who are who are so shitty but most of them that's where I disagree with you guys I think most of them really cool yes I think so too no I think so too but also there's this chat I think most people know most but there's a big percentage of the population who just enjoy being shitty but they also enjoy being nice sometimes yeah cuz they're not being shitty for real - just shit posting yeah so as long as you're able to inspire them to be nice or at least more because because shitposting done well has a humor behind it their love and respect behind it that's kind of obvious yes look one person has to take the head they're saying something funny and one person takes the hit but a thousand people reading those comments go by that's so true hey man I get it I'm not trying to stop anybody from commenting you know there was a time where the comments were blocked off because the streaming didn't allow comments cuz we didn't have a chat in the streaming you have a chat and streaming it devolves into racial slurs and and ethnic slurs and anti-semitic slur but it's fucking chaos sometimes because people just want to see if you're reading that while you're talking they want you to react so they'll write some horrible shit just so that you react sometimes somebody can have that I'm not gonna read that so I'm like just shut off the chat let's just will stream the show live but then we were uploading it comments were shut off because of some sort of a flaw in the way it was processed so like you had to have the chat on for comments to be on or some playing time but they fixed that but I was I really wanted people to know like if you want to talk about what we're talking about I want you to be able to I can't read it because I don't have the time and it's I don't think it's healthy like it's not it's like it does something bad to your mind but I figure that's a technology problem cuz my dream would be for somebody like you to be able to read comments every once in a while in a way that is healthy no I could I could that's not the problem the problem is for me personally there is so little time to just process life that any time that I spend trying to rationalize or trying to accept or trying to process someone's comments like there's not enough time for that I wanna I would love to do I try very hard to do my best that's what I try to do with everything and with this podcast I try to do my best and I know sometimes I'm talk too much or I talk too much or um I stumble through my words or I'm overbearing or this or that or yeah this it's a balancing act like sometimes you stumble it's weird it's all live you know everything I'm doing is live with no script that millions of people get to see and listen to how do you get that signal though so one of the things I enjoy before I block them is people who criticize her truly rude but would enjoy that oh no I know and I don't enjoy it but III think it's constructive in the sense that it within the rudeness there's often like a opportunity to improve often not often there are you saying they're rude but they have a point because I find that rude people are more likely like I'm fortunate to be part of the community who are really nice to me and just in general nice I find that they're unable to tell me sort of constructive criticisms in following like and like if I mumble or if I'm not articulate with my ideas or if I'm if I use a certain word too much or if I'm too stuck in a certain kind of perspective you need the asshole to come along to call you like a liberal douche bag yes that's what friends are for you know friends are for busting balls I mean that's one of the things about comedians that a lot of people had a hard time when we started doing podcasts one of the things that a lot of people at a hard time with was how mean we are to each other like me and Bryan Callen and and Eddie Bravo and Brendan Schaub when we start goofing on each other or other comics that come in here and goof on each other well we goof into each other we goof on each other hard you know but but there's fun in that like we all enjoy it like comedians to each other some of the fucking meanest people ever like we're no one's around we say some of the fucking group chats I mean we're people shitting on each other it is hilarious it's so mean but really fucking funny and we also do that as an exercise because it cows is you to other people's insults and to that like there's it's a thing that men do to each other they shit on each other first of all to keep each other in check and they expect you to do that to them but also to kind of toughen you to people that don't love you think I talk shit yeah you're used to it you know look if you grow up in a place like you know that is filled with people that are always drunk and it's cold out like Boston people talk a lot of shit talk a lot of shit to each other that's one of the reasons why so many great comics came out of Boston it's cuz it's fucking cold and people don't have time for your bullshit and because of that because of that lack of attention span or short attention span like you you can learn how to come out of the gate fast and you learn how to appreciate people's time it's a way to show low isn't that weird for us but as it's funny because people like I love most I'm closest with you know talk a lot of shit but like you have to earn that right yes it's funny like people some people walk into my life talking like like most of my vault and it's like well we're not there yet we're not it's an interesting kind of well you have to know that they love you you know that has to get underlying it all by the way I do think you guys are too rough on calendar I'm just I'm just a fan who showed up the company loves it he he he brings it on himself but by the way he has the thickest skin of any fucking Union I've ever met in my life never in all my years of knowing that kind I've known Cal for 25 years 25 fucking years never have I seen him get upset at someone mocking him or insulting him getting legitimately and insulted by it I've never seen him never it just goes like this throwing bounces off like Rhino skin like literally loses zero enthusiasm I mean and it's not that he's not an introspective guy something's not an objective god he has a unique ability to handle insults and he'll even rebroadcast those like if his friends are shitting on him he'll be like can you believe these guys like openly disrespecting my age and my looks he it doesn't bother him he's got a great perspective he's a very unique guy Bryan Callen very very unique I don't know anyone like him so the the silly song I have is made by him actually it is yeah I'm not kind of I talked to I texted him back and forth but he uses words whatever I'll tell you things you want to do the silly song first let me do this alright calm ourselves so we relight some sage and I also have a question for you a big one you want to go to the question first no no jamón you leave me an anticipation now I gotta ask you something about Trump oh really yeah demons be gone see uh Duncan Trussell was speaking demons be gone with the mask thing he wore masks oh yeah it was really on that well he also wore a ghillie suit so let's not get carried away so my voice is terrible this is more like a poem don't get in your own head man let it go [Music] my granddad was a soldier on the Front's in 41 the bullets took his brothers but stubborn lock held on the sky was filled with fire millions lost and flame eight and love for all there in the world that were the same some days will sink in sadness and the way of them to talk don't lose yourself to madness the way out is love when the New York towers crumble we were all New Yorkers to for a moment all just human not the same old red blue the wicked I'll go on scheming for the power the pain but the heart that longs for freedom there's a fire they'll never tame some days will sink in sadness the way of them to enter don't lose yourself to madness the way out is love the virus took our comfort it was never ours to own when the enemy's inside of but together but alone this life is so damn fragile a leaf caught by the wind but every bet that's tragic ignites a hope within some days will sink and sadness the way of them to talk don't lose yourself to madness the way is lex friedman ladies and gentlemen when's the album coming out no album ever what made you decide to want to come in front of millions of people and sing a song I don't know I'm thinking about mess it up mix it up a challenge like that for every what's okay I'll tell you what hours it's kind of a challenge she scares the shit I'm he's the scariest thing ever but I also wanted to be it because I thinking about for one last time I came on I really wanted to play Hendrix and I actually had my guitar and I chickened out so I thought okay because it's actually technically really difficult to play in front of a lot of you know cuz you're not gonna let me like try a few times right right I have to do it like without any mistakes and what happens if you try to play Hendricks Hendricks on acoustic guitar is really tough to play because it's uh it doesn't have like it's easier to play voodoo child with distortion because you can mess up and you can it's also nice blue scale so you can let it ring you can just jam ah you can go Gary Clark jr. mode mm-hmm but with acoustic every mess-up has a like as like it's silence after so acoustic doesn't ring for a long time when you play individual notes it dies quickly so you can hear mess-ups really easily so so I knew if I mess up it's going to just solve and I knew all would freak out and so on so I just wanted I just thought to do I thought to uh to do something we can't where I just strum chords where I can't screw it up at all so and then the the virus thing just made me think like I was talking to my dad a lot about about my grandfather and just brought it it made it so real to me because I studied World War two a lot its especially the Holocaust and all that but like the the fact that just learning about my grandfather just made it so real to me it kind of connected everything together plus there's a book I recommend people read is um by Albert Camus called the plague that he wrote right after World War two is I don't know if you know if he is he's like an existentialist philosopher existentialists believed that you know you have to live like life is absurd life is life is suffering and there's no meaning to it all you just have to live the moment and take take each moment as it comes and live it to the fullest kind of kind of idea so he described his town that got overtaken by the plague in the book the plague and that kind of similar to bubonic plague basically similar characteristics and writes about how everybody reacts in different ways the main character is a doctor who basically sees the the absurdity of the suffering around him that there's no meaning to it all that's the thing about the virus like with the Nazis and with Wars there's an enemy you can kind of trace back and understand what was happening I mean the virus it just seems like it can't comes out of nowhere you know and it breaks the spine of the way we think of regular life like some people try to cling on to regular life as if nothing is happening which by the way it's kind of like what a lot of our society is doing right now we're not yet we haven't really felt the pain yet and and and hopefully we won't but there's this kind of dull the calm before the storm kind of period and then some people become like more religious they start to search for the bigger meaning of life outside of the material possessions and then the doctor represents the idea that no matter what he he gives themselves fully to his to his craft of helping other human beings and overall there's a story that this idea that suffering is just part of life and the only way there's a natural temptation when there's cruelty and suffering all around you to isolate yourself and to uh to withdraw from life as anything you do in life is going to lead to suffering you know dating like if you get married it's gonna lead to suffering because eventually you're going to lose the people you love so there's a natural desire to withdraw but in fact what he found the doctrine what he saw around him is that love and compassion like giving yourself fully to the love of other human beings into his community is the only way to deal with that kind of suffering that's a to me it's a really profound story about like about love being the right response in a time of crisis crisis and the crisis that hits everybody like you want to kind of hide from it but it actually were more suffering happens so it's a it's a kind of profound book that I recommend we got a I recommend people read most people have read like in him in high school for there's a book called the stranger but that one in particular seems so connected to us oh sorry he wrote in as an allegory for World War two so the plague in that case is the Nazis mm-hmm that it just hits out of nowhere and his book was really popular I think in 1947 he wrote it because you know as a kind of allegory of world war two a way to talk about these the virus that first infects the rats and then affects the weaker humans it affects everybody it was an a connection and an allegory an analogy to the the Nazis and so I saw the connection between now and and the Nazis of course the scale their world World War two was much more intense and and and finally just how like fragile this whole damn thing is like that my grandfather had probably single-digit percentage chance of living you know like most people died most soldiers died in the especially in those early years of 1941 when the Nazis I think basically Stalin was using Russian soldiers and just human beings as human shields but yeah just threw bodies at the problem so the fact that my dad my grandfather survived seems crazy like and I do all these things I'm here talking to you wearing a stupid tie like all of that is connected to like he somehow survived I think all those look real ripple effects me doing research you know I hope to impact like billions people one day you know those like a little ripple effects like how fortunate I am to be part of that I mean it just all seems to be connected to me so I wrote you have to go back before him right I mean he is here because someone want to fight with a rock you know some some time in history there's probably one of his ancestors that Club someone to death of the rock who was breaking into his his house and not that many humans ago as you put it not that many humans go yeah not that many you know if you go like let's think I mean they're they're constantly pushing back the age of the oldest human they recently pushed it back even further see what that study said the age of the oldest human they bump back look another half a million years or so I think it was I think they're talking about Australia Pittacus and another ancient human all lived together at the same time there's quite a few quite a few different styles of human that that lived together at that same time at that time sorry to interrupt but at that time along with humans lived millions of viruses oh yeah of course yeah so they they to not not to give any shoutouts to viruses but they they to survive because their grandparents have clubbed somebody over the head well Bill Hicks called people a virus with shoes you know he was joking around obviously but that's truth to that there's something to that in that what is what is if you stopped and think if you were a cow or a carrot or tomato plant or avocados or chickens or think of the things we fuckin consume and think of the living things that we pull out of the ground and shove into our bodies and consume now think of that with something else think of that was you know if there was a population of animals like tuna that just got wiped out by something the way we wiped them out you would go whoa like oh yeah there's a tuna virus and it's literally killed 80 percent of all the tuna in the ocean we're down to like 20 percent capacity and tuna like fuck man what happened yeah it's called sushi it's called people his there's this virus with boats literally goes hundreds of miles out into sea with these giant fucking fiber nets that it's created and it sucks these things into the Nets and pulls them out with giant cranes and dumped them into a refrigerated hull and then brings them back to shore to cut up and sold like fuck man but at the same time it's it's too much delicious well not that but else if you zoom out it's kind of beautiful to just the way that life propagates is just beautifully so I've been reading a lot on viruses and the way they work is incredible like it's uh I would say viruses now there's obviously debate on one of the living or not it's just definitional but they're like the simplest example of the beauty and power of the evolutionary process it's because like we humans are kind of complicated and tempers are killing - no there's it's like there's a lot of things going on in our bodies like viruses are the simplest possible I think they're living the thing it's the simplest possible life form that just shows that anything is possible like every all the damage that's being caused in all with the coronavirus now that was like one there's like one guy that mutated it jumped from a certain speed I mean we can trace the evolutionary path back there was a recent CNN article that was wondering how long it's been around they were saying see if you can find this was kovat 19 around in humans longer than is currently believed they think it might have existed for months if not years before it broke loose and became a pandemic oh did mutate because it I don't know I didn't read the article so what video not an article oh it's not yeah you say CNN it was you know fake news I think you heard me bitch yeah where'd you learn that CNN there's a news folks it's the news leading scientist tell CNN that it's what they listen CNN's trying to do their best but they they have perception that other people don't agree with just like everybody else leading scientists tell CNN that it's possible the virus didn't just come from bath in the past months but it may have existed in humans many months even years before it grew into a deadly temp pandemic CNN's NIC palton Walsh reports by the way CNN is not doing a good job I just I I think the entire what are they doing about the incentive like they're they're choking out the investigative deep investigative journalism it's is exactly you said the clickbait like like look at the title mm-hmm look at the I think they're trying to stay alive well yeah but that's that's a problem I think it is a problem but I think in the defense of particularly online journalism I think they're trying to stay alive I don't think it's good time for journalism now but what I've from what I understand the only thing that keeps New York Times functional is the podcast the podcast the podcast is huge and that that the podcast earns a lot of money but that's not that means they need to innovate that needs to be they need to because the podcast does it well we need the fucking New York Times though the problem is they need to figure out a way to make money off of it but we need we need the top of the food chain journalism right and that's what the Times is always represented we need them so when someone is someone's done something for The Times it's not so good or flawed yeah okay but still not there that one person that one article whatever it is is not the time the time stands for something right what the New York Times is supposed to stand for what it always did when I was a kid and does now to a lot of people still it's the cream of the crop it's the very best journalism it's the very best it's it's the the ones that have the deepest insight the ones that nail it and we'd like it free of bias but there it's run by humans you know this is the problem with CNN it's the problem with any new source but we still need news sources but it's run by humans they need high salaries and there's a huge amount of people involved in making that system that is a CNN so there's several mechanism with the of innovation required first like this podcast here podcast in general require very few people to run again now that there's an infrastructure to communicate with a lot of people and then there's the Wikipedia model yeah so like Wikipedia is thousands of contributors that create extremely strong factual information yeah and that's not like like this very little money required to run Wikipedia incredibly so so there are some journalists out there that are online though that are thriving because of the problems with legacy media it's an opportunity it represents for gods like Tim Poole my friend Tim pointed to the temples of fantastic journalists he's he's really objective you might disagree with him or you you might not find his perspective to be in the line with yours but that guy is he holds those journalistic ethics at the highest level I mean it's he the highest standard with him it's everything and when you read his take on or see him make it take on things he is giving you the most honest objective take on it possible and it's really hard to get that from a network first of all it's really hard to get what he does for a network because you're gonna get these giant chunks where he'll he'll he can talk about something for as long as it takes to describe what the issue is whereas CNN has a segment man that segment is fucking seven minutes long he'd better be done by seven minutes we're going to commercial and then we're coming back with Don Lemon and he's got a sassy take on things and then Andrew Cooper's got new glasses look at that handsome bastard and then they're all going to talk about shit and you got to listen and it's Trump is bad coronavirus deadly and holy shit Chris Cuomo is got it let's go to Chris he's in his basement and they see Chris in his basement with Sanjay Gupta and they're holding up chest x-rays you know they they have their segments man segments are bullshit yeah it's dumb you have these these standards that you've created a long fucking time ago and this is the biggest handicap that legacy media has other than their inability to be free electric guy like Tim Poole is there now he's an independent they can't be free like he is you have too many working pieces too many producers too many people that are telling you with Direction that say there's people that bring you the segment's you're a talking head there's a lot shit going on there man a lot of shit going on there wolf but you have to innovate and yes yeah make more I actually disagree about tempo I mean I think it's impossible to be perfectly objective of whatever just he's just one voice he tries to be perfectly absolute rise to be as objective as he can be no I know you need to aspire to it and not be polluted by other influences but I can see people like I think I'm objective but I have very different views than tempo on some things and not others well they're subjective objectivity isn't there I don't know what people can look at things like you have an idea a subjective idea of what something means when you're looking at it objectively so you're looking at a thing objectively you're being honest about what what it says but you also have preconceived notions of what each individual aspect of that certain thing means and what's good and what's bad that's where the subjective aspect of objectivity comes in when you look at certain things that happen there's certain ways you can look at something and not have a bias but look at something and you have a preconceived idea of what aspects of it should or should not be tolerated and maybe sometimes it takes someone else to come along and say okay well why do you hold these beliefs so yeah you're absolutely right but the problem is that based on your skill set and your momentum and history you might look at a very particular aspect objectively ya not see the bigger picture for sure like Tim Poole has revealed and has focused on certain aspects of problems in the system mm-hmm and he continues to focus on them maybe not seeing the bigger picture that's impossible for any one person to see the bigger picture I think like I tend to I tend to see in a lot of things the beauty of things and it focus on the positive now you talk about that even with viruses any viruses does you can but that is that not objective a like if I beauty is not an objective word but I just mean well this kind of is what we're just saying there's a subjective aspect to your objective view of a virus right but it's choosing on which parts I focus in on and also the other thing is choosing the ways you talk about it so the ways you reveal that objectivity Brian can be positive you could be negative you could be very cold and fact-based you can be very flamboyant and very kind of excited and you use a lot of visuals all those kinds of things and all of that changes the way the message is carried yeah that's why we should have thousands of Tim polls as opposed to sort of well I think they're gonna spring up out of the void that's been created by this distrust and legacy media especially now dude I don't know if you've been paying attention but like YouTube there's so many people like my brother is now like put the camera on themselves right and say their opinions yeah you know say like he's doing like a bunch of reviews of scientific papers right there they're all like they started a show mm-hmm there's so many just there's thousands of shows springing up dude there's 900,000 podcasts that's great well it's over a million now I think it's hit a million million last week I'm sure people start podcast right now it's a crazy number well especially now right while they're on lockdown people are doing like the lockdown Chronicles I think it's it's a symbol of where we're going right it's you're you're becoming look when I do this thing I'm doing this thing four or five days a week and I'm becoming more connected with people in some weird way that no one ever thought it was ever gonna happen before where there's people that are listening my voice right now in their ear while they're running right a lot not a small amount if you could see the actual number of people right now with earbuds in running listening to this podcast you'd be like whoa that's kind of crazy stay hard you're running stay hard motherfucker but run faster right now this kind of connection is is a it's a dip into the next dimension that's what this is and it seemed like it wasn't it seems like it's just a radio show you were doing on the internet but then somewhere along the line became this weird thing that's what it is now podcasts are a weird thing especially one that breeches them the numbers of people that this one reaches and for that to be in my hands is a weird position and I'm um you know while it's happening I'm like oh look how fucking strange this is huh I didn't anticipate this I always anticipated this being some weirdo fringe thing that very few people would connect with which is why I never tried to censor it at all I tried to do a vast majority of it completely high out of my mind and and hang out with fun fun people and just talk shit and have a good time and not have a different perspective some people have a public voice and a private voice I try to have the same voice just be me just just do that as I tell people and they say was Joe like behind the scenes that'd be awesome for your totally different but I just tell them is the same same guys just as awesome er wouldn't it be a bummer if someone was like a super dick behind the scenes yeah and I've yeah that'd be a bummer or like it what you don't have to be a super dick but just a totally different person like what put it on the next yeah you put on that miniskirt hug those curves baby but the point is I what I think this is is a step into the way humans are going and this is just one step that we didn't think was a step it's a podcast I thought it was just like a radio show that you do on the internet but it's it's not for some reason it's more involved and more and tangled and more intense and then and then also it has an impact right I can get guys like osterholm on to talk about stuff we can get an understanding of these things okay he was wrong about masks but he didn't know at that time yeah there was not that long ago isn't it interesting that they didn't know about masks and their example sure he wasn't correct about a few things but doesn't I'm not gonna point him out it doesn't matter because he was stating the best available knowledge at the time but he was also incorrect about CWD with chronic wasting disease not being in elk and some other ungulates he's wrong about that my friend Doug Doren corrected that to me sent a text to me about it that he listened to a few of the aspects of that podcast he was like he's incorrect about several things he was correct in the dangers of CWD which is chronic wasting disease which is a disease that they are absolutely terrified gonna make the jump from animals to people it's very similar to like a mad cow disease but it has its own prions and that he also sent me a text explaining that prions are not actually alive they're not a living thing that it's like a protein or a type of proteins that what it is prions not sure whatever the fuck it is you can't kill it it's it's almost impossible to kill they can sterilize it for three cycles of like medical stellar sterilization techniques and for three cycles of like insane temperatures and there's still trace elements of prions on the medical equipment so it's a crazy thing that gets into people we have a real huge problem so this is a real dress rehearsal have you seen all these people that are recovering from this there's nobody recovering from chronic wasting disease no one every deer that gets it dies they all die and they die in a horrible way their body rots away and they're walking around like a skeleton and they're vomiting all this goo and slime that comes out of them that's infected with CWD and then these animals come along and eat those leaves that they were eating and that they threw up on and then they get it too it's crazy and you this stuff even can get apparently into the DNA of some plants the one of the really interesting things that's amazing on a positive note is that it seems like we haven't seen a virus that's both or any kind of thing that jumps to humans that's both deadly and spreads easily so like there's viruses that ricky bola like Ebola like this that kills like crazy but doesn't spread too easily and there's viruses that spread easily but don't kill the there's no in terms of virology in terms of biology there's no good reason why that should be the fact but isn't that just how the world works in general and systems and look at humans we have a spectacular ability to control our environment we have the ability to use materials from the outside world and construct them into weapons that lets you kill at distance but we're made out of jelly donuts we're like this soft bag of shit like even a really hard person a knife goes right through them you know we're really mushy whereas like a water buffalos dumbest fuck what god damn are they tough you know there's a balance to this there is but that's the kind of romantic notion that I don't know if it applies I think the biology and the physics of it doesn't make sense it doesn't but when would it change when would it become something that does tip that scale and become something more catastrophic well if you were looking at it objectively outside the system you would say well when one part of the system becomes overbearingly powerful that's us that's humans we're worth we're that virus well we are on everything we are rats on a sinking ship we're on every little patch of land you find spots in an article you find people taking shits digging holes in the ground to bury it and hopefully soon on Mars and the rest of the if you do that yeah there's the numbers that we have right now are fucking credible we've propagated the whole globe well ants are still fire mass wise yeah Farhad yeah but they don't do shit viruses are really ahead of us like most viruses are running the show we're just like a little fun right but in terms of the impact on the planet I don't think you make like ants might have the same they've seen biomasses us right into a total volume yet yeah so there's the weight of ants is the same as the weight of all the people that's how many answer are which is pretty crazy we just have to think about it but they don't have the same impact in terms of what their impact on other creatures and turn like the tuna that were pulling out of see their impact on the pollution by viruses and the other hand viruses can they can ruin us a whole species a whole even you know certain like microorganisms they can just kill everything yeah and well plagues what is the the most devastating historical plague Black Death and how are you playing how many did that million two hundred million mostly in Europe numbers crazy what Spanish flu is is 50 million two hundred million makes you just stepping no social media though so we don't I mean its death that's forgotten well not only that death it was probably left to rot out in the streets and horrendous and smells and people didn't understand viruses and diseases back then smallpox I would say like when I talk to biologists they say smallpox is the scariest of them all until we developed a vaccine what's smart but you Native Americans you would I mean they decimated smallpox estimated probably I don't know what the number is but more than 50 million yeah the number supposed to be stunning in some places as many as 90% were killed by European diseases smallpox and the like ninety percent that's I mean imagine something that just comes to American wipes out ninety percent of us and then you understand what it must have been like for the Native Americans we may encounter the European diseases that the Europeans had already developed antibodies for just everyone around you is dying imagine that 90 percent you know I mean we're looking at something that's bright what is the global death rate I mean it's kind of throwing off because it Italy because Italy has a very high death rate and in terms of people that get in fact what we often confuse death rate so if you look at the deaths divided by the population that numbers I want to be careful saying small ever but it's a very small percent oh I understand what I'm saying those overall the number of people the percentage of people that have died from this and then compare that to the impact that smallpox had on Native Americans you'd be like whoa yeah the difference between ninety percent of the population gets killed and the high in Italy is what is what is the percentage of death I think it's ten percent of people who get it are dying right no that's that it's definitely lower than that and then I really I thought it was 10 percent I mean it's possible I don't I haven't been too close to following but usually Italy is an outlier and usually the way they get that number is dividing by the number of cases okay Italy CRO nope now this listen look it's right there man coronavirus cases 135,000 deaths 17,000 the problem is those cases or the reported cases you don't know right and right you're saying there's a lot of people that just weren't tested and the one test right but it's not kind like the Nielsen's like you kind of look at it you have to let's divide by and then no no no because I don't know how Bissell's works but this is not randomly sampled so if they randomly sample the population and then look at the deaths per that would be more statistically accurate this is just people who reported so that but don't you think that a bunch of people could have died from the corona virus and they didn't attribute to them yes that yes so it could be higher than that could be higher okay that's what I'm thinking too but that's what they're saying in America as well by the way yeah you're saying there's a bunch of people to die and they don't know what to do and they don't have the tests so they don't currently given the tests it's much more likely that the the number is lower meaning that it's just we're not testing we're not testing the only enough so if we randomly so Iceland did this random the test is lower I'm sorry for deaths or for infections for death so for infections as well all right oh yeah for infections yeah oh sorry yeah for infections but you need the infection number to calculate the percentage of the deaths right correctly so you have to test I don't know what the percentage is but it's a very large percentage of population probably twenty thirty percent of the population it's a sample randomly not not people who are showing symptoms not people who are like no just sample randomly you know again you get that no Brack really there's something about every apocalyptic movie is something happens where you realize that these people have accepted a new normal you know yeah whether it's Mad Max or a quiet place you ever see that scary movie that's what is that what it's called Jamie quiet place is a movie about aliens to come here and you got to be real quiet around them to fuck you up what do you think is the new normal here well how about social distancing I've been watching a lot of movies because we have movie night at home every night and you know watching movies where people are hugging and shaking hands it is weird it's weird like that that's the new normal like if that was in a movie or a dystopian version of the future on a Hulu show like the handmade tales that Handmaid's Tale Henry's tale I had to quit that one I was - I'm not gonna get anything good this is gonna bum me out too much touching no no it's just - the dystopian version of the future is too depressing it was too awful my great great show but I think we'll come back to hugging and I don't know I don't know but I'm saying if there was a movie or a television show where people behaved with social distancing and everyone was afraid of everyone's viruses like the reality that we're experiencing right now if there's a television show like that you book what kind of weird fucking show is this you think it's so strange that there's a virus that makes New York City quiet like drive down New York City you see a car there's the second car yeah there's a third car is there my friend John Joseph sent me some videos of him ride this bike around New York and he's like look how fucking crazy this is there's no one out here there's no one out here and you know turn his phone and showing all these empty streets it's weird it's weird see real weird yeah like like airports all that she flew here by yourself on a plane by myself there was no one else on the plane with you in the plane but they still fly and nobody behave like that's nobody treated me special Wow now as well the world surreal is that the airport's empty but they're fully staffed because you still want to give I think I think part of the stimulus package is giving money to the airline so you want to make sure people stay employed yeah make sure that planes are still running that's so crazy they're flying with one guy you got a private flight private flight across the country to lay back and take up all seats and switch seats in the middle of flight like no I just try not to get freaked out I watched what is the tiger King no yes yeah do you get any booze are they serving booze on the plane no no no liquids nothing they don't serve anything no I don't you right yeah I don't think they've interacted me at all no interaction with you you the one guy in the plane they don't even ask how you doing you all right no they were all wearing masks I was wearing a mask well it was but they're friendly I would say the least friendly and that was weird going to the airport is there's nobody everybody is working and it's just me and my stupid mask it was it was definitely it was surreal the but it seemed okay the thing that I don't like is how people behave a grocery store that's what the thing you've said actually is they like they they don't want to get close to you straight it's so strange there almost like afraid of this and I that really worries me because I had it has a potential just separating us damaging the sense of community there's long term ramifications if we keep this not hugging each other shit up and what they'll all be aware of that fact like this is a this has to be temporary well once they come up with the remedy a cure if you just know they all you have to do is go to the doctor and the doctor is going to give you a thing and you're gonna be fine a few like staff affections have you gotten staff from GGC yet no well it can fucking kill you you have to take care of it staff can kill you and there's a lot of people that don't even know what it is and you get infected and then it gets systemic gets in your blood and you know there's a lot of people that just don't know any better and they're not good at going to the doctor and they develop some sort of an infection and by the time they go somewhere and take care of it it's really bad and they're in trouble like they could die yeah but thank God they have fucking medicine for that at least they can give you a fighting chance so people aren't afraid of jiu-jitsu you still do just even though people get staph you know I know a bunch of people that have gotten staff from training a lot they could all be dead if it wasn't for remedies right if it wasn't for antibiotics if it wasn't for you know taking the proper care and in treating it apparently some people have treated staph organically and Rhonda Patrick was actually talking about I think she had MRSA at one point and as part of the treatment along with antibiotic she introduced garlic into into the actual wound itself and apparently that had a pretty profound effect man I'd love to see the studies I wish I remember what she said about that she usually comes with studies oh she's got a fuckload she says studies about everything she's one smartest people have ever talked if you haven't followed what she's saying now on the virus I'd be curious if she's talking about different nutrients that support your immune system particularly vitamin D she takes a lot of vitamin D but she's just talked about all the various forms whether it's through sauna or cold cold plunges she's one to turn me on to that all that stuff heat shock proteins called shock proteins and the impact of it and there's some videos that you could find online of her talking about it she's also written some articles about it and she's this is just a huge fan of that hormetic response and how important that is to your system keeps your system healthy dude I've been doing it seven days a week which I wasn't doing before sauna yeah seven days a week I do it now and you just do saw you jump in gives you the cold like no I haven't been doing cold I want to get a cold plunge thing here I think I'm gonna get something and replace one of my not in this room and bathroom out there what you mean like a like a tub full of ice water yeah like that big steel tubs and you throw bags of ice in there and I'm gonna get an ice machine and just turn that room into a freezer dick off room yeah that's that's awesome it's really hot for you right it's good for you yeah well I think that those making your body deal with those responses makes it stronger I'll tell you what man I've been working out a lot because of this lockdown I've been doing a lot of Muay Thai too a lot of hitting punching and kicking shit and that always makes me really sore makes my joints or and that fucking sauna every day it's kind of knocked all that out I feel great you know and I've been throwing a lot of power kicks and punches and all this shit and everything feels good everything feels real good I just think there's a the giant benefit to doing that at a regular basis well you can buy one and put in your backyard if you have that kind of scratch I say do it I'm telling you what's the temperature of water well saunas is dry dry sauna yeah bro those are probably good for you too but I'm and I thought it was like a wet one it was a steam room yeah the problem with that is you can't get as hot because you would cook you know okay like if you have 190 degree air you're okay if you get in 190 degree water you're gonna die out with a steam room you're essentially I mean you're in a liquid exactly you're gonna die you're gonna get cooked so you heat going dry up in the heat dry heat you can tolerate I mean I throw a little water on it there's actually a little scale in the sauna it's like the top of it is the degrees and the bottom of it is the humidity and you're supposed to calculate those and find out exact you know how hot it feels but either way you throw a little bit of water I throw three scoops three little spoonfuls of water on that bitch shit they're gonna sit there and fucking suffer and when you get out of there everything just feels looser and more relaxed as soon as your body comes back to a normal temperature you just feel so much better it's so valuable man what exercise right now I'd highly recommend what are you doing because you know you can't go to jujitsu and you were doing a lot of that so what are you doing for your exercise I'm a bodyweight I do have a cowbell but like it I kind of avoid it is it it's like hell it's so intense from here how much is away the 30 30 30 pounds yeah so it's hell I'm trying to remember if it's kilograms or pounds it's probably 35 pounds it's probably if it's thirty kilograms that's heaviest fuck yeah no it's not thirty nevermind thirty kilograms what 65 pounds yeah so what that is so it's something that kills me if I do like swings basic stuff for thirty minutes okay like probably 35 pounds yeah but I don't like cattle Keith Weber have you ever done his series he's been on the podcast before is extreme kettlebell cardio workout that uh we sell it on it and but I found out about it we sell it because I found out about it I found out about it I believe through a just found on the internet I got a DVD and it's brutal man and I was like one little 35 pound counter bellman it's bitch-ass a little weight at the fuck's that gonna do dude four minutes and I'm like how long is this 40 minutes there's some fucking way and is something the sorest that I had been in a long time was just 135 pound kettlebell doing this this extreme kettlebell cardio routine d put together it's got two of them two now I think I think he might have three he definitely has two of them there is fuck mostly swing bait like you're mostly noburo you're doing everything bitch okay you're doing you're doing windmills you're doing hot potatoes you're doing renegade rows you know you're doing everything man you're doing you're doing cleans overhead presses and squats and and it's just a non-stop sir it gives you these little breaks they like last like 10 or 15 seconds and then boom you're moving to the next exercise holy shit and you realize how much work you can get in with just a kettlebell just a little bit yeah yeah I got no room for a gym if you can afford a kettlebell please just buy okay on it they're probably out of stock we're out of stock people's real quick because there's no gyms are all closed so y'all know what to do so you know who else makes great shit rogue maybe rogue has them they make awesome kettlebells they make awesome everything here is this Keith whatever my man so this fucking workout goes on for and he's shredded look at my boy Keith look at them showing you how to get your fuck muscles going but he's this is him explaining the correct way to do kettlebell swings but I I don't I mean you can get a lot of his workouts online there's a lot of workouts online for people if you've got a youtube account just or a computer that gets online go to youtube and find these kettlebell workouts that people put online for free because they they'll put a great workout up there for free just so that you subscribe to their page you know they'll give you some value and what you're giving them is a large audience there's some fucking great workouts bodyweight workouts as well that are free free videos online follow along and you could do everything from your living room and you can get blasted I mean you can have a crazy workout from a lot of videos there's so many of them I do I do more chill kind of working outside run for longer distances hmm so I what I recommend if you're not as intense is a rut I got around about 60 miles every day and push-ups and bodyweight squats a lot of bodyweight squat by the way squat surprised are always surprising to me how little how much they can kill you like everyone who thinks they're badass even can squat a lot right even if you can squat like I don't know 400 500 600 pounds try try to do 50 bodyweight squats like something have what's the most you've ever done in a row I don't I know I usually start suffering at twenty and maybe I've done 40 before I don't know mmm but I have oh yeah why you can get up you can get up to really high numbers and it's a glorious form of torture and it's crazy how much it develops your legs particularly the quads like right above the knee you know these these little muscles that are on the side like that hurts from Hindu squats more than fucking anything I've done ever it targets those so uniquely because when you're at the bottom when your heel is up and you're on the ball of your foot and you rise up it's like all that muscle for the the whole beginning of the rise it's all that that part of the quad right by the knee it's a really unique way to target that muscle and guys who do it a lot like a lot of those dudes are really into catch wrestling they would you like 500 a day every day they all have these like preposterous legs and that was like a big part of the development of their strength was just doing ridiculous numbers of Hindu squats and you could also do it like I usually i used to do him a lot like especially when i competed in the ggs and wrestling i would do a lot of them and i'd also like jump for like you you explode into the school ass as opposed to sort of slow but that you know do you ever hear Karl Gotch yeah the couch resting I am yeah Karl Gotch was famous for his body weight conditioning programs he was a just a stickler for having his wrestlers be an insane physical condition it was a prerequisite for training with him like it's awesome ya know he had a preposterous workout I think he was really into clubs too was it like I think he was really into those club bells and a bunch of other those other kinds of workouts too but I actually competed in a couple of cat wrestling tournaments did you realize cool one of the rules keep being a pinned right yeah you can it was felt so weird because because I won a couple matches by pin and it felt like this is so stupid this is so stupid like I didn't even submit the guy it felt oh and I did a lot of interesting things so I would I pulled butterfly guard a few times so meaning you can get pinned but you don't get points for an almost pin okay so you can play guard as long as you don't get your bet you don't have to elevate you have to elevate off regularly so you I don't think you can get pinned if you didn't get past the legs okay no so as long as you're in the butterfly guard even if you're flat on your back you have him and your butterfly guard he's not pinning you now of course it was confusing the rest and stuff but oh it was just that it was cool because the the guys that did it it felt more like like like yo see back in like tank a bad days and it was more ghetto it was uh people were in wrestling shoes and they if you can't see him they just got off of there like wrestling shoes yeah so you he'll hook them yeah I think so I'm trying I think yeah everything's legal and is a weird choice to wear wrestling shoes someone can he'll hook you unless you're a heel hook Dean Lister Master one of those Gary tonin type dudes it knows how to do it from every angle like for them actually I would say like oh if pride was still around pride let you wear wrestling shoes there is a significant advantage from being able to wear wrestling shoes significant not just for your wrestling but also for your striking and cro cop war wrestling shoes for a little bit cro cop head kick somewhat wrestling shoes on I remember I don't remember who it was might have been Mark Hunt and I remember thinking fuck man he could kick people with shoes on that almost seems nuts because the the amount of traction that you can get from a rubber sole with texture on the bottom of it versus just your foot you're slippery ass bullshit foot that's slipping around on the canvas with you with your wrestling shoes on you get traction when it's wet you get traction everywhere you know like even if there's a puddle on the floor you get traction with a wrestling chute where you wouldn't get it with a bare foot but sometimes it's kind of weird that or bare feet it's kind of weird but it's not I think you should be bear eye well I should be naked I used to think yes she'd have a hard-on or they can't fight I used to think I used to think that you should have to have no gloves but then I've been watching this bare-knuckle boxing in people's faces get fucked up so bad you see Chris Leben you fought a Dakota Cochrane and his face looked like someone hit him with a machete it was crazy the most enormous carving were seen on a man's face in a fight so now I'm starting to rethink that like maybe those knuckle services yeah something about blood no it's not that it's about damage to your tissue not worry about the blood I'm worried about scarring people up for life what about Johanna her injury she crazy right now it was crazy you want ideally I didn't check in they she okay yeah she's fine now um her swelling has all gone down but she had black eyes for a couple weeks maybe she's all that fluid she had in her forehead she's so tough man she's so tough she's such a savage as a great force he's so admirable like watching the way she fought that fight both of them are but it was such a back-and-forth brawl of a fighter so perfectly matched there was a draw or I mean you can make the argument you wanna won you could make the argument Whaley won you can make the argument it was a draw you can make any of those arguments because that's how close the fight was it's all I got what you think about this well there's a lot of people that thought you want to want it but the most important thing is you wanna fought like a champion I mean they both fought like a champ like champions Whaley fought like a champion there's about as good of a fight as you're ever gonna get so evenly matched so perfect so much heart and conditioning and skill they had everything everything epic tacular fight actually forgot the other fight and the card that's how good that fight was the main fight was style bender versus y'all Romero's right it was forgetful it was it was a fight that was forgettable it seemed like huge huge beforehand by the way who you got and in terms of do you think Ferguson and could be will go down who knows man not a fuckin none of that something happens this weekend just engage he's a monster just engage he is a monster he's a monster he's a terrifying individual he is I mean in a sport that's violent it's an inherently violent sport he stands out as the most violent that's you know crazy I mean you watched his knockout of Edson Barboza you you watch how that motherfucker attacks people he there's a reckless abandon to his his calculated wildness that is it's terrifying he's something special and he's better all the time the question is how much has he been training he's taking a fight on very short notice he's taking the fighting essentially two weeks notice also it might be kind of weird to train now in these coronavirus times short training partners i don't know hmm well ray Longo who I respect very much said that fighters shouldn't be fighting because I've already said they shouldn't be fighting but he said he definitely felt like it wasn't fair of the fighters because they they don't have a full camp they're not gonna be able to show who they really are a good point it's a really good point man it's a really good point this is a you know a wild situation where there's a guy who's gonna fight for the interim title he gets the call let me look that's also how Nate Diaz beat Conor McGregor in their first fight remember that that was 11 days out they call Nate Diaz he's eating tacos fucking trigger tequila in Mexico and probably doing triathlons but you blow on the side and sure well he's never out of shape really like out a normal person out of shape like you or I would get but for just engage it really depends entirely on how much time he's been spending in the gym now he's a man with a plan right he's trying to be the UFC lightweight champion so he's probably not getting too out of shape and he probably knew that in this case there is a potential that one of those guys could drop out because they've already made that fight four fucking times and it fell apart so this is the fifth time it's falling apart which is nuts it's crazy so it might be the just engag knew that this was a possibility that he could be called in as a replacement he might be in full camp mode we really don't know we'd have to talk to him Conor McGregor knew all along knew he knew I called it he's uh he was another one that I'm sure was probably getting ready but I'd love to see him fight in 2020 but Conor McGregor vs. Tony Fergus it would be yeah oh why didn't that happen you have to be on standby for last-minute villains I think there are some people that they asked to be on standby they have definitely done that before and they've asked guys to make wait and there's a lot of guys that have been through a full camp and they're paid for a full camp and they're paid to make wait this is something that's happened several times in the UFC's history where guys show up because they're there to to fight and step in if something falls apart especially if you have a guy who maybe struggles with weight cutting and you might fall apart and get pulled from a fight or someone who's maybe injured or sick and they're like a little nervous with this fight we're getting super fights every week into the dragon Island you're gonna commentate right yeah on to the Dragon Island I don't know I don't know how we're gonna do it I don't know how it's gonna be done he's where the track suit please just like Bruce Lee yeah I didn't I didn't want to real quick ask you I did did you consider interviewing Trump on this well he's never asked to do it and I've never asked him would you do it oh no because uh well I said what makes you why do you ask I'm trying to stay out of politics bro it's to sketch do you think it's politics interviewing never really Trump no so our politics at all what no meaning well it's a political thing I mean just even having him on is oh it's a statement well okay it's you know it's he's the he's a politician he's a professional president I mean that's it is no but but the the the nature of long-form conversation is such that you're not doing talking points why do you ask ok so I I'd love to see him on the show first of all and actually was in the works of interviewing him la a year a year ago for what for the AI podcasts that I do really but it was more of a supposed to be about the AI initiative mm-hmm that that would be a short I mean I imagine would be a short thing about saying how were you gonna be in person in person yeah that would be an interesting conversation but very different like I was like this kind of conversation I just wanted to talk not wanted but I think what they wanted is to talk with the NSF and certain heads of the administrations and just saying this is a really it's important for us as a country to stay ahead on the innovation in terms of artificial intelligence so that that kind of conversation it's a little bit it's a little bit less about getting into the human story of a human being which I think trauma is one of the most interesting people has been in office but yeah as if you're studying humans humans definitely one of the most interesting the reason I bring that up is as I was thinking I had this kind of question of if there if there's a person I'd talked because that because I thought Trump would be incredible for there's a bunch of people in this world which are incredible for this podcast like only you can have that conversation so I started asking myself like what is the conversation I could have that only I can do not only but like I'm especially well equipped for yeah I would say it's well equipped better there I don't think there's anybody that only I can talk to right that it's an MS spoke but I know I said I know what you're saying though and for that that's why and now if I think it I think there's agreement now as I will interview Vladimir Putin holy shit I think he has not been interviewed well I have all the connections any speak Russian yeah so it would be a mix of Russian English yeah well that would be the big thing though was to talk to him in Russian and then relay it in a way that makes us understand it that's a actually interesting question I would probably talk in English with a translator why would you do that because the ultimate result has to be in English and that not has to be but we have to translate on the fly because the how do I put it translators won't do a good job of translating so I'll understand everything he's saying in Russian and he'll actually understand everything I'm saying in English he speaks pretty good English okay but he's not allowed I mean not not a lot so you think that would be better than subtitles yes I think it's more human it's more real it's like you would joy Diaz and you well you all yeah you didn't do subtitles no that was that speaks pretty good Joey's perfect and he's perfectly bilingual so that was a great situation you know and also Joey's from Cuba so burped together that was amazing so the the translator that Putin has is actually really good translator they're not some generic folks I'm sure there are friends like there not enough friends but they know each other they know each other well so that's it's almost it's a very similar situation except that person is not a Joey Diaz at all right but it's that creates that kind of atmosphere where you can when there's some uncertainty about the statements that you're making you could you can play with that but it's an interesting thing do you think he would do that mmm the interview yeah yeah well there's two parts I know I have all the right connections for it mm-hmm I think he would do it because he he will understand who I am and the second part is I have a little bit of a Conor McGregor situation going on where anything everything I've done in my life that I decided I'm gonna do always happens everything yeah everything hmm I think you got some mystic shit going on I don't know mr. Kleck they should call you mixed it mystic looks like mystic Matt no that's wrong is that yeah that's his thing let's take Matt dude we're three hours and 20 minutes in believe it or not it's a good place to end up putting okay I do this silly song yeah we'll end on silly song no pressure it's been an amazing podcast so far this song doesn't if it doesn't hold up we're just gonna cut the power I just cut and I'm Bryan Callen yeah well blame it on Callen good call the so I did this video where I'm I played the Joe Rogan experience theme okay so what what what many people think can hear the guitar by the way right what many people think is Brian Redman cut out the red band was the one who came up with that from like GarageBand but it turns out there's actually Awards to this song oh that Brian Cowen wrote Bryan Callen he's singing in a few episodes okay I know this stupid song yeah yeah we'll end with this Lex Friedman thank you for being here I appreciate the fuck out of you tell everybody your Instagram Friedman spelled weird like Friedman yeah Fri DMA N Lex Friedman Instagram to use the Twitter as well the Twitter's ya twit the same thing on Twitter same thing on Twitter listen to the artificial intelligence podcast yeah and it's been fun buddy if anyone wants to do any weddings or bar mitzvahs for musician he'll sing his ass off I'll come get some okay thanks for being here man I appreciate whether let's go [Music] this is the stupidest thing I've ever done so this is a story okay in a desert I met a man with an eagle perching on his hand and he asked me son what can I do for you definitely the stupidest father I said and I'm looking for the meaning I should be living for he put a finger to my lips but the old man speak they call me Brian Callaghan his cruel world there is a man he should listen to as he journey on to life his name is Joe Rogan Joe Rogan show this four days and a real ey bag Joe Rogan Joe Rogan barrel of snakes for back that he mounted his horse and he looked to the sky and he rode to the sunset with a tear in his eye and a legend goes the old man rides on singing the words to this terrible song Joe Rogan Joe Rogan show this for days and I really went back I already regret this Joe Rogan Joe Rogan barrel of snakes for a bag you fucked up you should never done that time it was terrible people gonna never forgive you for that thank you I regret nothing thank you brother thank you brother bye everybody stay safe [Music] [Music]
