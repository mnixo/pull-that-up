no don't jump down I might do a show with Diaz in New York boom live Jaime's giving me the nod sure look yes you and Joey Diaz talking about doing a show in in New York wait a minute no I got Joey Diaz story we're gonna do a show with me and Joey and Yoel motherfucking Romero and he's gonna talk to him if he gets confused in Spanish dude are you kidding me so Joey Diaz gonna translate he was Joe it's totally Joey's idea Joey says grow up and talking to him I love this fucking guy we have an amazing podcast you and me you thrown the questions at him if shit gets weird I'll come to him when Spanish we'll understand each other better it's a brilliant idea switch oh he said he said he goes tell him that I want to be on his podcast because he has love for Cuba ain't none that he understands Cuban love love it love that all that shit that he was doing a Luke Rockhold after he knocked him out like that tense up that's indeed give me a few minutes you just knocked me into frickin that's intense whatever here they give me a fucking second to get my wits about me and then kiss me on the lips where look like you want to do it his ability to just be calm and then explode it's very terrifying it's only helped by him telling you he loves you terrified than ever it's scary because he's such a nice guy outside dude he is the nicest car he's very friendly you know the champ though was like oh yeah that's what you do you Whitaker you know Whitakers a monster man you gotta go back to that Tim Kennedy fight though man don't know school gate yeah that Tim Kennedy fight was crazy there's like look I know what you're doing is very slick this is very smart I mean this is Angelo Dundee did that to Muhammad Ali when he fought Henry Cooper in London he got crack with a left hook Henry Cooper dropped him he was in real trouble they cut the glove baby so cut that glove baby we got to get the other pair oh it's out there in the dressing room be right back it's all fair in love and they go man yeah it ain't the right way to do it but you got a you got to realize that this guy had gone through the whole amateur wrestling system as a representative of tuba what the Matt Brown and I did a podcast last week and Matt Browns lament he's a great guy and fascinating dude man intense smart motherfucker pal died people get a chance to he did he he died and they brought him back yeah yeah you know we talked about that I'm just like you and Kourt Magee both have this white creepy thing to you because you both crossed over to the other side you don't give off fun how was it whoo both guys man you gotta beat them they don't beat each other literally have to take they don't beat themselves really yeah I mean Matt brownie beaten himself he's a human what's he doing now he is gonna fight Carlos Condit oh that's right he's coming back for what just he ended he ended on that dope ass knocked out of Diego with the elbow maybe behind the air but all's fair a little bit and then yeah I thought he's getting right after the Sun set and he's fighting curls countenance so he was explaining about his camp that he did in Cuba it's an amazing story amazing he spent like six weeks and cannot Brown yes his white ass was in Cuba his white ass was in Cuba with the wrestling team for six fucking weeks from one of the camps for one of his fights he boxed in Cuba against Cuban boxers and he wrestled it's a tough game they lived in a Cuban fighters house they had him there and they hung at him which fight was it that he said try to remember which fight if you pull up his record it was fairly recently it's fairly recently doing them he's a bad motherfucker dude a bad motherfucker it's not he's just trying to get better man he's just trying to get better and that's what he figured was the move but he has one more left oh yeah let's be really at least if he wants he's on the matter's tour he knows I love him he's on the Masters tour I think he said it was for the Tim means fight I'm pretty sure he said it was the Tim means fight well then after that let's get back to Cuba okay who is the constrictor of all constrictor if Danny and Maya can get you to the ground I don't think most people don't understand what that kind of jujitsu feels like you know I've rolled with a few guys that were my size that just went through me what I realize okay Jake Shields is we're talking all the time wrestling with him was like wrestling with a chimp Karo Parisyan same thing it's like holding on to a chimp like good luck bitch you might look like me tonight but you know it's like you see a guy like maybe just CrossFit like oh that guy looks fucking strong no there's a different there's like a Ben Askren strong where it doesn't even look strong just looks like a fit athletic guy and they grab you and you're like what and the fuck is going on here why can't I move and they twist you up it's different kind of strong they move different it's a different kind of strong Jaime and Mayas got that strong too strong guys true he does that shit the guy of like Carlos Condit correct I mean this is a he's the motherfucker of motherfuckers like Matt Brown that's a terrible fight what he did in Neil Magny he just can't close and close and close and it was like watching a goddamn snake it was like watching a snake take out a deer who's terrified slowly get to that Baptist tighter and tighter it every time he corrected it got tighter and tighter you see Neil Magny just drown yeah like fuck he looked like that zebra and the alligator's mouth just like yeah you know I tell you what was equally impressive man is ha failed dos Anjos in Neil Magny I was like holy fuck did I read that wrong me too I thought Neil Magny was gonna give him a real good fight nice cardio reach cardio reach footwork movement discipline stick to the game plan Neil Magny is a difficult guy to fight my glasses fight unless you get him down his jujitsu is Achilles heel well he I mean Danny Maya obviously got him but the way dos Anjos got him was like holy fuck at 170 dos Anjos is more aggressive among the stronger it seems to the fucker doesn't it seem he's strong he's way better he's weight he's healthy he moves his more power he's putting his combinations better together and he's just on the lighter side of being one of those big guys so it seems like he's got more speed he reminds me kind of like Robert Whittaker to me the people guys a little small he's almost perfect he's not huge he's not muscle-bound to do everything really well Whitaker stuffed Yoel Romero takedowns with a blown out knee he got his knee blown out in the first round and he's still stuffed takedowns Whitaker isn't there's a fuckin tab I'm all up on that Australian train right now I think it's another thing where the guy was cutting weight making 172 struggling man just struggling I really wish the the way that Ben Askren described how one Fc is doing it were there doing this hydration test if they're doing a hydration test when you weigh in they're doing a hydration test like leading up to the fight and everybody bumped up a weight class and he's now he's like it 185 because that's really what he weighs and not to change subjects but just I listen that Ben Askren I've always been a huge fan of been asked and I think such a shame he never fought in the UFC a I think he beats anyone in the world in the UFC I really do well we would like to see at the very least I mean if I had to bet and I'm a betting man I put some lot of dollars I've been asking being said he's very articulate he that man these dudes on podcast and you do something as far as entertainment he doesn't rest and podcasters I'm just saying like there's more he could do yeah I agree what I thought he was brilliant on this he's a brilliant guy and he's just smart and unique like as a person and you can either depreciate that or not not marketable well it is marketable in my opinion but it might not because I don't I'm just coming at it from a point of view from as a fan I mean I'm a fan which is why me want to hear listen for me I there's is a no-brainer you want to see the best versus the best and he has been able to do weird shit to people and hasn't been hit three years dude he said his last two fights he didn't get hit once didn't get he was I haven't been punched in the face in three years time when I hear that super articulate super smart well yeah smart dude good luck in court later yeah I Do's narrator he's a coach for godsakes wrestling kids I'm not a promoter I'm not a promoter I have no say and I don't want it I don't want it I'm can't your skin didn't spike you know let me holla let you die he's just listen I know you're stressed oh look he knows how to promote he's a promoter know jack-shit about promotion I could be wrong I might just be such a purist that I want the best to fight the best so much I don't give a fuck Manila support you know the sport don't sell yourself short I guarantee you we could sell been asking if you and I put on a promotion I guarantee you I could follow Oscar I guarantee I could into people's heads why this is important it's it's important if the art form is important if it's just important to put on a good show then you know you can always have guys just stand in the middle of the Octagon and throwing lead at each other and let's see what happens no there's no longevity in that but it's very entertaining and there have been moments like when Francisco Rivera and John lineker just fucking threw down to one guy broke that's I do not recommend anybody fighting like that but that shit is crazy to watch it's undeniable that's gonna get the people out of their seats that's gonna get people freaking out about it you sprinkle that kind of style in every now and then that's fun that's a sport we can't do that I think but every now and then when something like that happens like with Ricardo Lamas and max Holloway well that's how we pointed out the ground just like come on bitch a fight he was already weighed that shows you who max is bad I'm such a fan meet 2-inch a fan with it love this with this new Showtime show I'm doing that day I interviewed Frankie and it's tough for me because I'm so pile of Frankie but I'm such like a max Holloway fan it's tough for me not to show the favorite you know what man I might be I love both of them I might be don't Frankie longer yeah I'm I know Frankie way better I'm a giant max Holloway fan but I have to do this thing that I do where I don't want anybody to win I just want to see what the result is see I don't don't want anyone to lose I'm not good at that you're you're one of the best in the world it's just so hard that I'm not good at that like I don't want anyone to lose like I love yo Romero and I love Luke but I've been but I I know what those guys feel like when they lose and there's everything on the table I know what for Luke how I changed camps and sometimes that's just you're on a boat and then there's holes and then you think if you POW further away from the original camping you know fill these holes and it doesn't work like that I think I know why he didn't fresh look I mean it might have been a good move for him but he fought you all Romero I mean the reality is yellow Romero is fucking horrifying he's horrifying who can beat him who can beat him yeah he might be able to but he also might be able to get hit exactly I got hit in that fight every time they fight you don't know man no I'm saying I don't know I've seen I've seen a better beast I've seen a better version of Luton to me as far as skill wise besides Whitaker right now he's on another level but I look at the roster and to me Luke is the most complete middleweight in the world I can even seem being the light heavyweight champion yes fit make him some problems besides Jeff's in it there's gonna be some issues for those guys who knows maybe him going mean he's been talking about an inevitable climb to 205 he might be just like Whittaker and just like who else we're talking about Rafael dos Anjos yeah might be he might be the better fighter 205 he might be me so fucking lean but the prop the problem there is what made Luke so great was that swagger like it was like oh he's so cocky I get that I actually want my fighter like that I liked how you're so arrogant and cocky sometimes if you don't gravitate towards it but for a guy like Luke he just he thrived off that and now when I see him I you know I when I is Latin in the branch fight I didn't see it as much I thought that fight was a little suspect not not taking anything went from branch but that should be an easier for Luke and I see the yo Romero finally just that killer instinct was in theories very I know you have five rounds but he would let yo el explode and reset when he reset you got to go man you gotta go branch might not have the best results inside the Octagon but when you comes to technical skill he's a super high-level fighter his his skill level and his capabilities I don't think have matched up to all of his performances and you saw that when he's attacking Luke he's fucking good man he put him in real st. he's no he's real I'm not saying that it's not round games very good but it makes me lose win even more impressive for sure but branch's never went in world series of fighting he kind of you know became light heavyweight champion middleweight champion he's a monster yeah in the UFC he just he hasn't found his groove yet right and he never has right now I don't you know the law it's level of competition you know his first fight in UFC was you know boring and then he get Luke Rockhold which no walk in the park so I I do think Dave ranches at Monster hens with Gracie blocks is the second vert rammed the UFC correct fought Gerald Harris the decade with that crayon slam the good career I was like yeah man that was that was it crazy Joe Harris is a powerful man monster I'm just saying with Luke it was this swagger when he thought he was the best in the worms in Strikeforce is when to the UFC when he's champion we're and then in the Bisbing fight he gets clipped with that left hook and he has problems with the with left at the left side for him so you know Bisbing lands that knocks him out that short notice fight each I was gonna walk through him then he takes that long layoff and he's trying to be a male model and you know arguing with the UFC it's just it's somewhere along the lines that he'd lost a little bit of swagger when he gets that back we're in good for him well I'm curious to see what his journey with Henry hoofed where that comes up because they've been they about how long they've been together now like a year maybe yeah yeah you hear about their Henry is an interesting coach man he said fucking one of a kind he's a very powerful guy you know you know he doesn't have his DC and Cain Velasquez could be right and Josh Thompson and these monsters you're surrounded by just these monsters easy training with and has he addressed that left side where he keeps getting hit you know which what put him out you look left yeah the two left's two left's that uppercut was like a free-for-all like Marquart get a little closer you got to get a little closer that would absorb you know the old narrow just fucking think about it's hitting as hard as you can yeah you'll your male smash literally punching human as hard as they can I didn't think it was a bad stoppage because he had his head up when he went down and you got to give one guy chance to hit I'm now looking at it after the fact you go man I wish he didn't get hit with that uppercut the fight was already over but in the moment in real time if it doesn't happen I'm mark Goddard I hear you unless you ran up for 240 and Ike you know I think it's a perfect stoppage I mean I think the first one you don't really stop it yet you got to see what's going on let's go fucker you don't mind them you never know I hear you right that one you kinda know you kind of but after the fact we're saying that let's talk about Frank yet that fucking guy's a zombie he comes back from the dead he gets cracked by Gray Maynard in two fights to the point where it looks like it's like all of us up it's over he's been rocked into he comes back in the most incredible way when I sit down with him we're talking about that and were talking about concussions and CT cuz his kids and stuff I said like that great Maynard fight you know you can toss and came back heels which I don't want ruin the interview yes what's crazy about that brendan is I wasn't concussed no signs of violent imma stop yeah I must stop you who told you I Gus didn't even throw up on it so that's your sign for not concussed you didn't throw out what said that is such bro sign Frankie look at me when I tell you this you had brain throwing that fight man fucking tell me bro there's no way he didn't it's impossible I mean maybe 100 percent but the fucking heart that it took to come back from that and draw like one fight and then KO him in the second brother fucking crazy which crazy if you look at Frankie's record you know when they toss him the yo-yo Rodriguez as the you know these young cats he needs some up like kobayashi now by Ortega wants to fight holy shit does this to these young kids man Brian our tech is a totally different animal totally different animal if you get the whole unit cute cannot fuck around with that dude on the ground we're talking real high level GG epsilon sand basically twice let's say by the Bell and then got his neck again I don't think people who are watching him or yet 100% aware of what he's capable of he's a fucking killer on the ground dude he cinch his shit up at one of the highest levels I've ever seen in that you should see him in training in practice I mean I'm in forever and he's a guy where you know the one of the reasons why he got so good remember he teaches at the Gracie Academy in Torrance right non-stop right that's a big con see teaching helping everyone he's a great kid man monster dude his triangle is one of the best I've ever seen it's so quick he's so fucking nasty a million setups and the fucking dexterity of his legs man and when he sent his shit up it's a super high level and I've talked about it for a long time with with guys with that high level Jitsu you know I don't want to wrestle non-stop and they try at that but the wrestler hasn't caught up to their jujitsu with him he's not afraid to jump to guard it's not afraid to do flying triangles he's not afraid to jump to half guard he doesn't give a fuck yeah that's how he's raised into this where Hannah Gracie in here on Gracie just a man don't be scared off your back you're beaten dudes yeah it's a really interesting combination of boxing because now he's become a very good boxer so his hands which are he's very comfortable boxing and then guys are trying to take him down right and that was the fight before this last one right do try to take him down a guillotine yep and he was pulling things out it went late and then he'd pull off these late submissions those guys with tiebreak you give him an inch she takes a mile we got a hole the Cubs neck you could see like the whole nother level of squeeze and technique and sharpness and everything's in the perfect place and everything that's perfect leverage and when he grabs ahold of something he cinches it up real and he believes isn't wholehearted 100% if you get to goes oh this is over yeah he's so many people in training he does it to every high high I won't say names high high level dudes in training we like holding flush it super legit that is a fucking dangerous fight for Frankie to accept on short note how gangster is Frankie legend Jersey gets yeah but you couldn't fight Bryan Ortega has a different fight on his hands - because he's can be tough take Frankie down but what Bryan does have he has a size advantage mm-hmm doesn't have speed advantage of the wrestling advantage I think Frankie puts everything together better as far as killer instinct by Ortega that's his x-factor I read the other day that Frankie's never been finished yeah credible that's incredible it's never been submitted he also says that recall Almeida is his jiu-jitsu coach he trains with every day and he's with Marlon Brys - right mom can't Marlon mirai's they got Frankie they got Eddie Alvarez who's a monster in their training every single day oh and n Barbosa that's their camp oh and their leader having to be the best mind in the game Mark Henry do that's how of a camp right there that's a hell of a camp it's ridiculous in there you know for Eddie Alvarez and Frankie and you know son it's just like this perfect storm of killers that's brilliant mind the Einstein of mixed martial arts and Mark Henry who's just this fucking savage man yeah it's brilliant what they're doing up there yeah it's one of the hot camps right I asked Frank I said were you were you surprised what happened with you know Barboza and kabhi because Niels dude Barboza's a motherfucker to take down like Eddie and I have struggle man I said I think help good khabib is Guerry very scared khabib Tony fight son I have my number one fight I want to see this year there's just people that I think have evolved from generation after generation after generation of grappler you know there seems to be something happening with those those Russian folks and those Dagestan folks and especially him with his dad being this fucking amazing trainer he's just just tougher than us Joe tougher we're not the same it's something happens when he grabs ahold of guy so you just don't see those his face was like what is getting run over by a freight train just a guy with unstoppable pressure constant punches to the face you're never getting up you feel it you know you're never getting up and if you do get up it's gonna cost you so much energy to get up you're gonna be exhausted and then you know this guy can take you down again if he takes you down again you're three-quarters helpless three-quarters helpless next we're only gonna be half helpless next round basically helpless you're just tough you're just surviving on your toughness and you know he's gonna take you down again and beat your face and it's like Isis torchy man I'd rather just get murked real fast by Francis then fighting could be it's a savage slow death it's a savage slow fight but here's the thing he's never fought anybody like Tony Tony is so different he's so really different animal he's so different he's so dangerous on his feet he's hard to take down he scrambles like crazy he's he's well aware of what it takes to protect himself on the ground he takes a tremendous shot he's got crazy Darcis he pulls Darcys up on people that are that are like you know he did the barbozza remember that fuckin crazy ass fight and he slaps that darshanam that darts his tights on his daughters world class here's the x-factor with Tony and khabib is to me Tony's getting taken down I can't sure I swear I'd bet my life saving that he's taking down that's not the fight right fight starts once it hits the ground who's Tony Ferguson off his back is a monster a monster from elbows to his triangle like his training with Kevin Lee yeah now Kevin Lee is different grappler and could be but still his setups but his elbows you if you rest he's gonna whoop your ass from his back to me that fight happens on the ground we got to be careful of who's judging that fight because Tony can win even if he's whooping his ass from his back you know I'm saying yes it is it is entirely possible that Tony could be hitting them and trying to attack with submissions and you don't like doing MMA math but they both fart barbosa and tony was able to finish him tony has a better resume for sure well he finishes guys you know I mean he catches guys that are really high level with jiu-jitsu techniques I mean especially that Darce super dangerous could be we you know exactly what he's gonna do he's you know his striking isn't world-class but his grappling is pressure everything else is world class we also haven't seen him five rounds five rounds with Tony is a tough task man it's just only gets better but he thrives in that kind of dog situation where you just going going going yeah so to me you know for khabib if it goes that fourth fifth round you know it's it's what we don't know you know that's why that's what that's why this fights so good to me that's why it's my number one fight this year I swear to God if either one whom gets hurt I'm gonna cry you get me so excited yeah he's about to let me just fucking get your date out steep ADC that's great fight - that's a super fight yeah that's a fucking super fight we talked about all these super fights that's a legit super fight yeah that is a super fight right it's such a close fight - very decent undefeated that heavyweight was a former world champion from Strikeforce it's also when you see DC rest of olkhon yo there are levels to this shit kid you got time now yet time to work on your wrestling I'm just kidding I love your vodka it's funny but he actually looked really good like really good I've been in that clinch with DC and that is no picnic yeah threw me around like a rag doll he did real good until he didn't do good anymore and then DC dick said he was gonna do by the end of the round he had his neck and he just was Saved by the Bell then we went to the second round and you know you could tell it was old ladies DC she's amazing he's amazing that just shows you how fucking great John Jones owes that's that's the whole top of the pyramid if you're done at the top of the spear and you go what Jesus how good is this guy and John and John trained for one week in was high off his ass yeah that's how good he is he's a fucking wizard he's on another level best of all time PD's things phenomenal however with these if you're John you're sent home right any underwear thing about the bad decisions you've made in your hope you hope hopefully that you're gonna get back in the UFC DC's taking your career path does John always wanted to go to heavyweight wanted to fight steep a one do all the ship DC goes oh cool hold my beer and then just does this thing you know do you imagine how big these people hold my dick pills you know John John comes back at DC beats um do you know how big QP do you know crazy that would be that'd be crazy they hung up they fight at heavyweight well they're gonna fight a heavyweight you think so yeah that's a belt cow whoa there's a 95% chance that Jon Jones fights in the UFC in 2018 so you're saying in a chance that's his agent tell me there's a chance you can't really listen to agent 2 time soon yeah that guy first of all my dude thing's gonna be the next rock he's full of shit you know you've talked to him on the greatest thing luck in this earth it is entirely possible that he accidentally took them people saying that I'm being paid to say this and I'm tell you right now yes he's never paid me to say anything other than the truth the reality about it is they don't know what he took they don't know what happened they don't know why how he got it and the theory that I talked about is just a rumor that was going around that someone was trying to explain one way could have happened and it's through tainted creatine that was backed up by Nowitzki the Golden Snitch whose is actual employee of the UFC and also when you're not paid do UFC does not pay to say anything on this podcast no you're a commentator yeah they're not but here's a sense to their credit they've never tried they've never ever ever tried well they know better but if they ever talk to me about something it's something we all agree with like you know like maybe Dana and I have conversations about like this is a big fight I'm are you pumped for this I'm like fuck dude I can't even wait yeah are you kidding me you can't put it on dude I've talked to him about it in the past do you once you start insulting him and fucking with him he's like I'm busy he's forgiving no you got to talk to him he doesn't date me anymore no he does I hope he doesn't I think if we can they do if Ben and him sat down and I could be there maybe I could help you'll be the middleman I would do that I hundred percent be willing to do that you help me I want us going through the Reebok day yeah yeah I think Ben is under underutilized and not understood and underappreciated that's what I think it's a real shame too because the father's time you know he can't wait that long did you see what he did to Cara scoff you see what he did a Lima these are top-flight super powerful guys here AG dhalsim and could be once gives us fight 55 and go to 70 what's up son and you know he had that interesting conversation about when he fought Jay here on which is his toughest fight in Bellator split decision yeah he said he wasn't wrestling he said he fucked up striking yeah and his wrestling was off and I was like that's incredible that someone as good as him still needs to be constantly doing it to stay sharp forgot what got you to the dance like that's amazing and so ever since then he's concentrated on his wrestling and just taking everybody down like when he concentrates on his wrestling and he's constantly doing it that's the way to do it and even though it Curtis played that X I'm like dude this Australian cards ridiculous yeah I was fucking in on it getting over with but he that card was amazing but Curtis played goes listen man you guys want to boo me hate tell you I don't enjoy getting punched in the face I'm not trying to get punched in the face now but I'm trying here by anyone you know I'm just trying to get Shane how could his Curtis blades chance the beard dude he took some shots Mark Hunt put it on him and last him he was almost yeah and he gets the double like fuck yeah that's what you're supposed to do this is fighting that's exactly what you're supposed to do and I'm biased as fuck is Curtis from my from my old camp and I see those guys I talked them they tell me how much of a monstrous and I love Mark Hunt I didn't want anyone to lose that fight when I see Mark Hunt get taken down it's Mark Hunt to me is like the white rhino the last white you know I'm saying he's the last remaining white rhino we got to protect this guy don't give them the fucking just wrestler right he's a legend right don't give that guy give him Francis let's see how that plays out give him shit you know I'm not JD yes but you know I'm saying yeah how dare you give him a fucking JUCO national champ ha and send it to Australia oh he almost won by knockout though and Marc's hard to take down I think it was a good test I think it was an important test look they try to do the same thing with Derrick Lewis they gave Derrick Lewis a test at Mark Hunt mark hunt shut him down and stopped him Derrick Lewis one of the best fucking heavyweights in the division but one of the best heavyweights not one of the best wrestlers right but he still is one of the best guys one of the he's a knockout artist and a promising up-and-coming guy they give him the mark on he cannot get past mark trooper Mark Hunt but Ray's blades do not really if it happens raelia but if happened in Australia with all his fans there from New Zealand dude that's a big fight for him it's a smart fight I just might fight for who for both guys mmm mark hunt won if he connected with a couple shots more or if Curtis was it wasn't as tough and as good as he is he could have knocked out anybody at that footwork for Curtis it's a smart fight right for Mark Hunt smart fighter really he's already a legend nobodies but if he wins the way almost won by now in Australia it jumps you up even further not really he's ranked fifth you know but the excitement of the Perth crowd euros good as your last fight if he had to chaos in a row like that to be big to me stylist Arjun I understand what you're saying but he's 40 and he's legitimately one or two big wins away from another title shot think about what you have right you have DC versus steep a whoever fights at who they gonna fight next mark hunt knocks out hold on a second he knocks out him and then he knocks out someone next like who could it be okay well you could try over him again but the problem with all marine fighting for the title again is he just lost his DP by knockout and and then he just lost a Francis monitor down there as well yes number one yeah you've got some fucking real interesting fights but all it would take was Mark Hunt to beat one of those top guys and he's in consideration again small pool there anyway super so small that's why Oh keeps getting shuffled back to the top as tough as he is and it's not taking anything away from him there's not a lot of there's not live sea and fed into the top tiers of the group there's no new blood really well it's hard it's a fucking hard division to find talented guys I think it's the most topical division well heavy I think I think heavyweights better off than light heavyweight like it light heavyweights like Jesus Christ that's a shark tank light heavyweights got a lot of crazy shit going on right now right like what happens if DC loses our leaves rather DC Mountain bounce so if he goes to heavy weight and stays in heavy winds bounces and think of that man this is crazy right it imagine King going to 205 that's not happening he's too old he's gonna fight it heavyweight see that show that dude eats he gets down with that I don't blame a man he's earned it however came to a fight he's not gonna fight for the tie right away he's gonna fight once this year and then hopefully a title fight but did I think what they're planning on is DC beats steep a vacates the belt and then Kane a fight for the interim bail towards the end of the year or be in the early next year damn steep a does not want to hear that kind of talk people just loves to overlook steep a Miocic it's fucking crazy way to the heavyweight division though it's fucking land of the dinosaurs and then light heavyweight well Francis is terrifying for everyone in the planet other than stipa me oh no no no III so Francis woods would lose I'm back off the train so Francis dam in laughs that train I didn't know he can't wrestle at all I think he's like how do you spell wrestling listen so Curtis blade smoked some Cain Velasquez smoked some smoke soot Francis yes all day really so you think Kurt's blades when they fought the first time just wasn't ready he didn't remember that I got stopped via doctor stop it right in the second round I think he goes hold up you have zero wrestling you just hit mitts and lift weights and talk to employees of you see it's to fuck yeah I'm gonna wrestle your ass I want to point out that I do not agree with that assessment I'm sure he trained his wrestling I'm sure he was in the best shape he could be snow he told me nothing I think he burned down the first round I mean I've watched it he's definitely need some where's no technique just wrestling there I from the very GetGo if his shear strength got him through some of those takedowns but you look at his hand placements hips it's not there now it can come it so it's a tough business to be in and try and pick that those skills up and you look at the that list you know dick Lewis he can even double like your ass my Knopf C good matchup curved blades nightmare came glass his nightmare for Bri silver doom fucking nightmare I'll stay over and can wrestle if he wants to steep a obscene nightmare we saw what he did to him the thing is he's so fucking powerful that every one of them could get 90 knighted with one shot the sports of all my bills if sport is to be world champion to be world champion but you're looking at it through the eyes of someone who fought steep a Miocic right he fought steep a Miocic steep a figured him out steep they beat him right but steep a is a very very unusual character and there's some shots that he got hit with hit with in that fight that a lot of dudes would not have been able to take agree with that however if Fabrizio gets you on the ground and I promise you'd be getting down that often he would have choked Francis unconscious that's a different animal on the ground so is Kane okay soon will be beat you up what's T show on the ground you know he's not a big finisher he's gonna do he's gonna fuck you up meeting where he out there's not a huge finish you don't look for submissions France or I'm sorry for doom will fucking get a hold of your neck condition and then think about Kane his grandparents for Rocher osius super accurate and the the the reps he puts in bang bang bang bang you know he breaks you yeah we're steep a is very controlled he's gonna take you down even get fuck he's going way out yeah Kane has a crazy output like his outputs disturbing nuts you know you were you watched the sheer volume and the pace of the takedowns and chaining takedowns together and beating you up on the way down like wow Xavier Mendes said this once we were within the back and it was him and crazy Bob cook and I was like dude I go I think he was just he was I forget who it was that he fought but I said I think he was just expecting to ride the storm out you know like because he just couldn't keep up with Kane and Xavier goes this storm doesn't ever go away never he goes that storm is there forever like you understand there's no ride in this dish yeah just like here down I try to match it it's like the that's I mean they even talk openly about like he's a freak he'll take three weeks off come back you just know it's there's something going on there's something going on unless you slide to Mexico yeah wow that was a fucking mess man nobody could do that nobody even cardio cane can't go to 7,000 feet without being there for a while it's just it's in there it's just no nobody think about that relentless I don't mean right now so you got the relentless approach and DC's fights very similar against IPE and that to me that's where I like it I see when it first came out oh my god it's a super fight let me think about this what up Laura my initial thoughts always go what's my initial thoughts what most people are gonna think well Steve Bay has knocked out power and his wrestling's good he puts everything together well but the cardio of DCs give me an issue if DC can get past that third round that's a big you know tremendous cardio but so does steep a and here's the other thing doesn't think about steep a what we was able to do with Francis right he caught Francis who was the most dangerous kind of division standing up and the most dangerous guy in terms of making this decision hands down hands down he caught him with some strong shots and tagged him several times and now think the difference in size between Steve Bay and DC you got a guy who he's fighting Gary doesn't hit as hard DC's definitely formidable on the feet and he showed that in the the volcon fight he cracked volcon he's his stand-up is very good but he's not absolutely terrifying with his punch is not technician right well he has a technician I think he gets away with some will leave his hips in a pole but yes heavyweight gonna be a little trouble now saying that he is on the field as a heavyweight so well I was I was very impressive his hands in the volcon fight he was doing it was landing juice she played that game Yeah right and volcon is fucking dangerous his stand-up is very very dangerous so I was I'm impressed with him I think he is a technician but he's like 511 steep a 6-4 steep A's long and he's very good at knocking out heavyweights I'm thinking the way steep ain't knocked out for doom the way steep a was able to crack Francis I mean overino dude he's a beast dos Santos what he did to him about what he did mark yes Orlovsky what he did there laughs key to it he's a beast this guy's heavy with all time you see right now you have to say yes because he won the title three he's the only successful three times yeah he's a fucking animal so you got a tall order for DC it's interesting because of his wrestling and it's just ability to figure out how to win and how good he looked in the Vulcan fight but volcon it's deep they are not the same sleep a is the heavyweight fucking champion in the world I don't know for whatever reason people seem to be able to didn't want to look past him I don't know I do it to not obscene he's a buddy of mine Steve a he's a buddy of mine do you look past him now it's very strange like I I was literally and I did the Wilber together won the frame questions how steep a beat fucking Francis I want come out in a singlet and do not strike at all like just I'm scared for a man but you look at it steep eight just pulls it off man I don't know it is he's a winner that's what it is a straight winner is a winner he knows how to win but you know you know who's a winner and it's an Olympian and to me besides John Jones is the greatest of all time Daniel Cormier yeah he has something some other gear in him but also at heavyweight he's gonna come in around 2:30 right and then his leverage and he's talked strong that my fucking the clinch so there's Division one wrestling steep a Cleveland State then there's Oklahoma State wrestling Olympic wrestling you're talking about WNBA two NBA all-stars there's a complete difference there yeah Ben Askren for God's sake you can see it I mean what remember when he fought Dan Henderson you're like holy shit nobody picked up Josh Barnett slammed him what he did to Dan Henderson that was that was insulting see that's a goddamn legend dan Harris is also an Olympian yeah I know he picked him and spiked his head like you was before you threw him around like you never saw anybody show get a fuckin respect and then he showed respect Anderson Silva well that was a fight Anderson took on short notice remember otherwise he probably would he got paid jillee how you gonna spike Dan house and the goddamn American Beauty talking about - that's just Burnett that's Josh Barnett all three but look Josh did have a focus people this is Dan Henderson look this is that's insulting that's rude he's just so strong that's Gustin who 6/6 it's not just technique the techniques amazing you got to be so strong to be able to do that to Josh Barnett that is crazy he flips him through the air and he's literally throwing him around like that's how that's how throw the tires in the gym yeah that's difficult that's difficult body yeah that's a fan and you know what I like that what's crazy is DC slowly becoming the face of the FC he's becoming this world like Star he's pretty coming of superstar I think people are starting to realize first of all he's a really good guy like a really really good person and he's a fucking beast man he's so tough and he throws dudes around like right there what he did what he did his fucking insult and dude look if he gets a hold of Josh Barnett he's like nope dude going down I'll give a fuck what you think oh you're the war master very cool check that out congratulations you're on your back it's just how he does it matter look at this boom his wrestling is just so many notches above most of people right which makes you even more fucking impressed with Jon Jones dude that's what makes me even more impressed like me down you bring that when you bring John up to me it's happy if it hurt John took him down if I'd want those men in black things right breaks people's memory I did race everyone's John's fights I can't erase the past he's the best I know but it's like look at his performances like the fact that he was think about how god damn good DC is and think of John headkick and him stunning him and then putting him away and remember yeah first white John took him down there's a picture of DC literally like oh shit yeah well I mean you said after the fight you really underestimate how strong he was oh my god John's on many levels many levels past what most people understand and think about all the distractions all the shit that guy's been through and he still is they'll perform at that level all the crazy shit almost went to jail the fucking crash go to a pregnant lady's car the all the fucking crazy pills cocaine all of that I'd be one to bet if you gave Jon Jones literally like a bro you're gonna have to fight in three days I would still put my money on John to be anyone in the world he's so crazy this is he's something special man John something special depressed whatever the hell he is I'll take John he's something special and you know you really see it in the fights where he's losing that's what you see how good he is how about the Gusman fight with really trained him just showed up and like did work Oh doing when I say did work you're talking with the greatest light heavyweight fights of all time and it was a five-round war war and John took over in the last half of the fight it's not yeah and then how about you know the Vitor fight he gets his arm basically bent sideways and then submits Vito and Elvis admits him yeah gets out of the armbar which looks fucking horrific the armbar it's like you see how far it's bent and you're just thinking about what his elbow must be doing right now popping and cracking and he still didn't tap and then he went on to coach the The Ultimate Fighter remember he couldn't use his arm right like he one of the reasons why he wanted to coach was because he couldn't train for a while so nuts man dude he wouldn't tap he wouldn't tap you get his arm bent sideways I know a lot of guys do that don't get me wrong but you got to understand a lot of guys that are as talented as John can't get through adversity it's one of the things that make some special thrives in it well yeah when the chips are down he's not giving up there's no giving up it's not happening he almost prefers it though I think he told John hand this comeback we're in a 12-week camp ease your back you know you eat right every day there's no hookers there's no dick pills I don't think it helps them I think he needs a little bit of chaos I've known another absolute like ultimate winners who they need a little bit chaos when everything is going perfect there no whoa whoa whoa we need when you throw a wrench into it well maybe you might be right but I just got to think that just the actual chaos of fighting if treated correctly could fill that void in between while he's doing these training camps I think he still hasn't reached his potential I think we've made it he's seen in a couple of fights where he had a great training camp and he didn't fuck around and he didn't party think a cot yeah well whatever it is maybe he we don't know I don't know what he's doing I don't know I don't know if he goes through cycles a party and we know he's a wild motherfucker sucker self-proclaimed but you have self-proclaim he says he's a wild motherfucker we know we know he's a wild motherfucker but he's also that wildness is one of the reasons why it's so fucking good you have to have the whole thing you got to have the whole thing he is an artist in LA noise you gotta have the wildness you gotta have the physical talent and you gotta have the brain to understand pathways to be creative to take chances to do things wild risks like flying knees on Shogun or spinning elbows on Stephan Bonnar cuz and this is all like when he's fairly new to striking right you also got to be able to have that bit of craziness where you can only train for two weeks and then still go in there with a world-class athlete like a Ryan pate or a dustman and be and still have the confidence go I'll figure it out I know I know he's been training 12 weeks he's one of the best in the world I got this that's a different switch that 99.9% of professional athletes don't have but imagine full dedication full perfect diet now I had to do it mentally guy you think he wants that you know I'm saying I don't know I think I'm free like Shambu don't put it in the fucking container people look at him let him out in the ocean never got released you didn't know how to live in the wild burro well all john knows I live in the wild now you want to toss him into the fucking container and put him in a blazer and some khakis and no dick pills you know I'm saying like let him live man is it a crime to take dick pills and little poke them on the problems not that the problem is is he getting enough recovery so these training enough to reach his full potential and what is more important is that more important or is it nurturing the wild nature that lets you do crazy shit there's a balance he should be able to do both maybe he's not hurting anyone doing coke or doing dick but as you get older and your body gets more and more tired from war right I mean think the battles that guy's been that's the nature of the beast though right that's everyone but that's gonna be a problem if he's not fully dedicated as time moves even if you are fully dedicated like it came Vasquez he has a cage around his spine now I'm saying like no matter what it's gonna take its toll on you if you perform at your best you're partying to 3:00 in the morning and then training drunk that's your that's your path man we shouldn't put these guys in boxes and force them to live like this and you have to do this and this is the way to do it John goes that's not my way man oh really it's not know I'm actually undefeated yeah my only loss is the more camel from whooping his ass so bad it's true that's my only loss so you wanted me to do what I get act like the rest these guys that's not fair man it's bullshit that's the interesting perspective I like what you're saying not everyone fits into these boxes that they want to put him in he's not hurting you see the problem is you hear about someone partying too much neo he's worried dear like man are they happy I know the driver feels they're partying what are they doing you ask him why he's hiding say hell yeah it needs balls deep in these timepieces because he's the best fighter in the world grass Michael Irvin who partied to has some legendary parties the Dallas Cowboys had to they had a white house they call it the white house the all three of them the most famous players chip done on my mansion they called the white house and every week they would throw the most epic parties of all time you know what some of the best teams of all time it's true why do they get check these boxes off let him have a little fucking fun they're nothing like you nine to fivers you know I'm saying yeah look you got a real point there the only argument against it would be if there was someone in his division that was like him but was dedicated there's not there's not right now I mean there's an even if they are they there's BC who puts up the best fight with him but he's lost twice second time in fatica he's dedicated as fuck dedicated his fuck yeah they don't have to be the same to get in that cage man it's not fair yeah it's interesting I know it's an interesting point of view because like is he so talented that he can get away with not training as much as everybody else or is it just that his ability to say fuck it and his ability to just not give a fuck and be wildly accountable one of his talents that's a talent that most people don't have so long with obvious physical talents correct he was born with these god-given talents and he's born with this cowboy attitude and that for him that worked you know there's no mental coach there's no that he doesn't need any of that it's a good point yeah see it's almost like he needs a Fraser right like Ali needed a Fraser sugar a needed Tommy Hearns and Roberta to round they need each other they do they need each other and we have the best I bet DC did bring out the best in him and that's what he said yeah that DC brought out the best in him but he needs someone else now you need someone else maybe it's steep Bay because yeah because if he you know if he fights DC again boy you can make that fight for sure especially if DC wins the heavyweight title but yeah John just ko'd him in the last fight and for DC and fatik and I know D I know the fighter in DC and the winner in DC wants that fight again especially Edwards you say wait champ I get that but as a DC fan I don't want to see that some guys just have your number it's just not in the cards I may be me in it he's not John's equal John goes to another level when he fights them but maybe it's a steep a maybe it's ver do I think for Doom John's a tough fight for John he's D Bay's a beast of a fight for him I'd love to see John force Francis yeah maybe maybe there's one of these heavyweights who out there who can control you know because John's not a knockout artist too so he has to be in there for five rounds with these super heavyweights who hit like a Mack truck you know John does get hit so there's these varies that you know one of the craziest things about John is he's not really a knockout artist and we love him but yet he knocked out DC with a head kick yeah that's right and DC's impossible to fucking knockout yeah he's never been knocked out yeah um maybe John sitting on his punches and kicks better now but what's amazing is how terrifying is without having ever done that or done that but not done it to the extent of some of the best guys in the division like Jimmy Manawa or one of those guys just vicious vicious you don't have that Anthony Johnson pow right like oh if this lands it's over with John he's gonna slice you up Brian he's gonna break your will or you get wrestling he's gonna wrestle you oh you're just too black belly meat or he's gonna submit you yeah hosed Amir hits harder than him a lot of guys hit harder than him for sure Brian eater probably hits hard yeah we did a Ryan babe mhm yeah well he's just a combination of things you know fighting spirit indomitable fighting spirit it's just that motherfucker does not give up crazy wrestling talent super strong just knows how to win and has a checkered past but when it comes down to it he might've had might not have the 12-week camp mine and I eight hours of rest pride and eat right might be balls deep and I'm whole bag of gummi bears so when he shows up he's gonna fuck you up yeah he's on another level he needs it's almost like he needs someone on his level and there's a few of those guys out there like is there outliers man outliers they in this war might not see one yet it might it might be coming up might be a guy that's on the way he might be emerge in a year and a half from now it's just what happens with these guys I mean we can never pretend that the talent that exists today is the only time that we're gonna see in a year from the crazy yeah they're gonna be better man everybody's gonna be better than watching khabib they're all watching Tony they're all watching barbozza they're watching Ben Askren they're watching all these people everybody's just getting better they're just getting better but notice every guy you mentioned besides Tony is a specialist who's great at one thing every guy you just mess ninja there's something to be said for a specialist man there's something to be said for a person who's like a gokhan Saki who you just don't want to fuck and stand up with him it's just it's just shit too high level about shippment John John would take him down he's already for 30 seconds no but I'll pay to watch a guy fight every I'll pay to watch him fight anyone in the world got hurt for chrissake but if gokon can get his his wrestling skills and continue to hone them he's a guide late brother true but he's a guy like a cro cop who's so explosive and powerful that if you just get him some takedown defense it's gonna be fucking hard with the cage to take that guy down yeah you know I mean cro cop became like very short very quickly he went from being a guy who fought wanderlei silva ng a special Rules match and remember beats him standing up and then had some deal where he can only go to the ground for like 30 seconds or some chap eni's weird shit yes by the time they fight the second time he destroys him I mean destroys him just beat him senseless and then he emerged into that wrestling world and he also you know if you ver doom before he's even fighting was his jiu-jitsu coach you know that so for Doom was so is Dean Lister yes so yeah he brought all these guys in so you learn the you know he's also younger than goken at the time so when I see guys like and I'm not hating on people I know you hate on Francis I don't hate them what happens is when you're he's numbered still ranked number one in the world when you're Francis you're ranked number one in the world there's no gimme fights there's no warm-up the UFC can't do it so right you're at this level where you don't really have time to make up for it you can't take three years off at the age of 34 and learn how to wrestle it's it you don't have that time you just don't have that time and it's a bummer it's like getting to the NFL playing for the Patriots and can only go to the left with routes and go and I'll try and learn to the right like Oh what are you talking about man you can't go both fucking weights like no but I'll learn like get the fuck out it we got someone to do it man you know the weird reference I'm sorry no I know you're saying fucking weird Jamie it's I know I know what you're saying I kind of get it I totally understand but seeing as this guy five years ago couldn't do anything right five years ago he just gets into MMA five years later he's thinking about Francis yeah five years in five years he becomes the number one heavyweight contender a terrifying betting favorite over the champion who if he wins breaks the record of the most ever successful title defenses in UFC history so even though he's won two title fights in a row against world-class competition still underdog thank you a fucking year five years in so just imagine if this guy has a kind of appetite for learning and and and continuing to grow that he showed there think about GSP GSP had zero high school wrestling zero college wrestling started picking up a quick train with Russian nationals they up in Montreal did a lot of technical work learn the basics of it and as US the kind of athlete that GSP is he just started implementing it started getting good at Francis would have to do something like that literally have to or you know at the heavyweight division maybe he does in he's just that guy you know that he knocked people out and that's what he wants I don't know oh he wants to be the best man but I think that he can be but there's gonna be some guys that are gonna be able to take him down from it when you say some guys and they could do it for the next ten years that way he's always gonna be able to get taken down there's a certain level where even if you hire freaking you know been asking as your coach he can't teach you enough to make up for those gaps against the DC against a Cain Velasquez even against a blade the Curtis played to the National Champion Curtis plays is also a big guy Curtis blaze is a big athlete very powerful athlete and really good wrestler so he's not the same level as Daniel Cormier but he's a much bigger man those shots that he took against hunt ugly one holy fuck dude that was one cause like he's ready to drop I'm like he's gonna drop my god damn he didn't drop and then he took him down I was like wow I Texas corner and Cody Donnelly my best friend the like bro if you tell him to throw his right him again I'm gonna fucking bust he should literally double jab and get in to the legs he needs to quit throwing that slow right hand cuz mark hunt such a high level striker he sees it coming from a mile away it's so amateur he saw him in Francis if you could put those together you have the best heavyweight of all time yeah one guy who's fucking phenomenal and striking yeah I know you got phenomenal at wrestling can't wrestle can't strike you put them together and you got this fucking transformer ninja turtle who just fucking does war Curtis can strike you just can't strike at the same level that mark on hands but what he can take is a fucking tremendous just huge for now for as long as it lasts right and will it last against a guy like Francis in the second fight I'll tell you this I'd rather be if I had to pick I love both guys I'd rather be in Curtis blade shoes than Francis I will say that well I have a good way I have a grappling background yeah because what happens if I'm a striker Francis I can't control if you want to take me down right Francis can control I'm sorry Curtis can control whether the fight goes the ground or not he dictates where the fight goes Francis doesn't her around Francis does not after the first round the only thing that could change now here's the thing is Francis putting on any weight due to strength training or is he just that big he used to fight at 205 you know that he did he fought at 205 1 2013 no I don't know lick it up Jimmy I'm pretty sure used to fight 205 how is that even possible I have no idea for five years I don't pretty sure you thought to a fight in my batch it crazy here 205 what yeah 205 in African stones which is really 216 oh I'm a stone is like English proper English so weird what is it things like is it 13 14 12 12 I think it's 12 I'm half English screaming how come you don't know that but we know who your president is 14 14 good culture yeah it's not like all things excuse me 13 that's an unlucky number they would never use 13 to the slice at 12 that's good I was in a hotel the other day it didn't have a 13th floor sort of our foursome don't also grow up dangerous it's a zoo been their coddling to people so bad take Friday the 13th oh man people are super goofy would shit like that some people get real goofy strange man yeah how about your boy Tyson Pedro dude fuck Tyson you got my seat on Jerry by the way man any time I'm here - yeah come on damn on down his show and mine I'm a huge fucking fan he's a bad motherfucker and he's a fun guy had motherfucker all those dreams just don't put on a show it's it's emerging hot spot well it's been hot but Australia like John Wayne par from muy Thai obviously ray Sefo in from New Zealand and Mark leader yeah yeah and a few other guys too got Robert Whittaker Australian yeah that whole part of the world Pedro monster and then the heavyweight the big heavyweight forget his name he fought in monster Dan hangman from New Zealand yeah man a lot of monster gets killers your killers there have you done shows in Australia yeah I had a good time man I'm so great I did Melbourne what's up there UFC weigh-ins for Aryan gone oh okay so he started what best I could find yeah soand I'm almost possible to me cuz he that would mean he put on 50 pounds in like two years possible oh dear my optical phase not saying anything say I'm saying when he was 12 he wanted to fly I mean are you not at 205 what do you say II thought at 180 but he thought he was like 40 years old he's lying about his age somebody said that someone did that to us Derek probably Derrick Lewis cause he's so funny no Derek didn't say that did he no Derek fighting this weekend who's he fighting saying that Russians again Tabora yeah yeah he's a bad motherfucker I want Derek to win it's good fight this Dick Francis black on black crime what's up black man sick fight Derek's a beast man I like watchin fight you saw about retiring okay yeah Marcin Tabora yeah why did he want to retire I don't know god damn they're still pushing sage Northcutt on us huh he's learning and growing years old why you mad about sage I'm not mad I'm mad at his haircut I'm not mad at sage I think he's a phenomenal I like pretty boys no twink is what we call so if he was Mexican would you be cool with him fighting mmm no just forced him on me you know I'm saying like it's all right all right I'm a man I would love to see him and see him Punk I he'd be honest I mean he's the first fight on the main cards that really forced pneumonia no I get it it's like the page Van Zant stuff we get it they're good look at you yeah the cuties the cuties hey Paul honestly yeah it's just Mary listen I was listening you and CM Punk if you fought how fast would you beat him I'm not even asking if you'd be too because I'm I can insult you know how fast would you look at me we'll kick his face off well it would certainly be quicker than when I would how badly or how quickly I would fail the drug test it would never take place know let's describe the drug test would be that they would piss in the cup they put in the Machine and it would go off like you have that Bugs Bunny cartoon when they fuckin hit the hammer toy and it hits the the thing slides up and hits the belt all goes flying out of the area that's what would happen you take the piss test they go get out they'd be like he's get the fuck on everything the last time I saw was Vitor Belfort anything right now you're high right bro he's no right let's say dana gives you like that weird brock lesnar exemption yeah no I'm saying man yeah I'm not interested I wish the guy well but what me too I wish him well well as she like him as a person or what is doing I would have never recommended I would never recommend you climbing Mount Everest without a guide I would never recommend you even making an attempt at running a marathon if you've never run a step and I know that he's had some training I know he's had some training just jump right into fight in the UFC the Megane six hit like Mickey gah a major leak sir who is a fucking killer he is really good on the ground way better than you on the ground the idea that someone would think that that's a good idea if I know it's probably shit ton of money they gave him and that's all well and good shirt sighted but if you wanted to do it right this is what you say you say listen dude we got to get you an amateur fight against a guy who's well he might not be it depends on what he's trying to do but if you wanted to get an amateur fight against someone who is of similar skill level and similar experience level so you feel what it's like to be going after it Jane jeff mayweather on Floyd Mayweather's MMA move he might actually web CM Punk's ass first Oh Floyd Percy a punk if they sell the shit out that fight Oh Showtime John good to see you Joe this is amazing fight for my man we got one hell of a fight coming up my heart be still my heart they might do that they might oh my god my heart and you know I'm gonna be in Bart I can't take it my heart is flying in my chest if I saw Lloyd Mayweather across some CM Punk I'd be like this is not real life yeah yeah dude that's the fighting weight well listen if you you know that Floyd can't fight Connor in an MMA fight can let's take that education but the odds of Connor losing are so astronomically small minus one hundred thousand favorite like whatever the fuck Vegas puts on it that's cute no I'm here it's 10 - I don't think they're gonna do another like we'll have odds for this we can't you guys can't make money it's gonna be like nine hundred to one it's gonna be something crazy some buskers Douglas Janis Buster Douglas is only like 40 - it's crazy this is gonna be insane if they're smart because Connors gonna kick his legs out he's only gonna get a chance to come close enough he counted everyone Connors gonna kick his fucking legs out he doesn't have any chance and then if Connor decides to shoot in and clinch he's gonna clinch and he's going to ragdoll him well he could jump to a half garden and do what little you name a submission nine that's a slap in Connors - nine hundred who the fuck made those oh this is nonsense that's a joke oh my god these people my life savings on there that's the easiest money of all time they're off by a factor of ten fucking listen if this fight takes place Floyd doesn't have a chance what about Floyd CM punk though but I got a fighter boys got a real chance yeah Floyd K oh yeah boy it's got a real chance unless CM Punk way but also CM punk way bigger okay let's be honest about that CM Punk is a guy who was wrestling probably like 190 pounds can't wait to get to 170 to fight in the UFC you saw it though son yeah well he's not on anything she's pretty Lucy guettler WWE psych in right but I'm pretty sure he's at least according to everybody that I've talked to and everything I've heard about him he's a real straightedge no drinking no I'm not saying he looks like it he look like now he as clean as they come right but I think he always was I really do I don't think he's lying yeah daddy said Floyd Mayweather is the fucking greatest boxer maybe of all time placed on paper he is I mean the civilian swish means through multiple weight classes undefeated 50 you know I don't care if the last fight was Conor McGregor he's still 50 and I know that's fuckin insane insane yeah dude he's he's on another level of everybody who's on another level what this fight is like it's like it's like you and your buddies at a bar and Floyd walks in and your buddy goes who has no background ever maybe did some performance arts in high school and you look him go can you beat up Floyd Mayweather and then you guys find out you can get punched in the fucking face very fast in multiple times the question is can Floyd fight the same way he fights with big gloves with MMA gloves the reason why I say this cuz Floyd's broken his hand multiple times he said some serious surgeries on his hands now maybe they've cured it and maybe it's fine but we all know that for the longest time Floyd preferred like a puffier glove a big flood protection and but he hasn't had hand problems in a while so maybe he did fix it and his hands looked fucking great against Conor how many pay-per-view used the CM Punk Floyd do and where where do we stop this is where you got to come and cut this shit out because I heard I heard Morgan Freeman throws a mean sidekick do we speak he could sell pay-per-views do we fucking sign him up do you I'm saying like George Clooney no Larry King someone's dying so what is dying or they may catch a once they start swinging we might lose them both good god man it's crazy it's crazy we're even talking about its greatest odds of carniverous Floyd in the mixed martial arts match and you know what else is crazy is Floyd actually considering it Floyd's document and I know that Showtime about MMA fight I think he's gonna make a half a billion dollars wait till I fight anyone this planet if I fight Francis could be even the same night for half a billion dollar half a billion it's really possible I mean they really might rake it in with that fight and the UFC is going to change might be willing to do it if they may imagine if they made a deal to do two he goes alright I'll take one more MMA I'll do one MMA and one more box and God just slow and you know there's a yes I'll fuck him up again and you know there's a market for it that would be crazy money and the actual island lay heads are turning over in their graves they fucking hate this I think you could sell it I think if Connor decided to give like five six months for a training camp Conor McGregor in talks over stunning five hundred million dollar rematch with Floyd Mayweather no crazy get your money wait get your money man can't wait hit your fucking money and honor cannot wait but I would say CM Punk because this is what happens that like jion's over Floyd seeing that CM Punk would have to figure out how to get to take down if they could agree to me it like 160 something like that maybe I'm seeing I tell Duke Rufus take this one out and I'm army crawl over to Floyd cuz Kiki's my face and I just get a little this leg it's a complete shit show and I fucking just sweep his knee that little tiny scrawny ankles out and I crawl on top mount and they just stop the fight what if Floyd Mayweather knows karate will seriously what if we've never seen it before he's been hiding it behind closed doors and comes out sideways and starts throwing sidekicks you like know it's you know fuck you imagine if Floyd starts throwing perfect muy Thai leg kicks swap what's crazy you mean my buddy in sixth grade talking about crazy fucking mutants fighting rocket fire but let me ask you this in all austenite grown man if you are a world championship boxer you're gonna be exposed to a certain amount of kick boxers wouldn't you say hey man show me how to do that how do I do that it would put but part of the leg you hit messing around like right here oh shit that hurts yeah oh shit now show me how to do it she'll not do it on the back okay I like Floyd Mayweather pick up kicks like the Aster mine the way that he could find the smartest people I've ever been around he learns how to dig his body into things you just transfer that to his way brilliant he would start snapping right kicks on people roundhouse kicks next thing you know you can't get close enough you know what that sounds like the move your kickboxer I'd see him Punk's coming up in his locker room they hear this douche douche Floyd just on the thing again like it's brush and CM Punk's going out what fuck no told me this to remember Pete Spratt Pete's Brad sermon that's about Pete the monster for a long he would hurt your fucking legs man Pete's Pratt's another dude like when you watch them kick the pads you'd be like hikes yes certain guys yikes no one that I've ever seen kick anything other than a person may be more terrified than watching Pedro his o kick a heavy bag one day well that's fucking ready to Couture about dude I'm telling you I've seen a lot of powerful guys kick a heavy bag there's it sounds different like most like I seen Maurice Smith kick the fucking heavy bag dude Maurice Smith's another one terrified member represent boom powerful kicks powerful kicks he showed me a lot of shit he like corrected a lot of things I had like a Taekwondo style of throwing my kicks and he was showing me a bunch of different ways that he delivers things dude and he would kick my bag boom fuck your bag up Pedro heizo hits twice as hard is there anyone like that today who kicks this arm dude Pedro hazelwood kick the bag at Beverly Hills Jiu Jitsu and I just sit there like Macaulay Culkin oh it's so hard - is there anyone like the other kicks today not really there's not a lot of heavy weight to kick well I'm happy wait who kids like that Overeem can kick like that not anymore you just he's having a hard time taking the shots that he used to take like but when he fought Brett Rogers in Strikeforce that was one of the first things he did it's crying bro Rogers in the leg yeah many fought Brock Lesnar I mean that's when he was at his best that's true when you body kick Brock close did he's just been through the wringer man you gotta think I'm still doing it still doing I still like still good luck beating that dude he's a nightmare for look at the division he has an amazing ability to work oh this is horrible E he kicks his dude this poor dude oh no he's gonna kick me get rid of bad oh oh don't do it don't do it don't let him do it man tell me he breaks his leg oh he probably would horse griffon broker that dudes like to watch this he just does this just touches it thank dude got a terrible charley horse from him just touched him cv to find a video Pedro his Oh kicks the heavy bag yes that's it you can kick him like a googol the Randy Couture fight Randy has a permanent oh here it is this guy's gonna let him he's gonna hold the pad yeah watch this shit this the fucking power oh shit the guy flew through the air and landed on his back look at this boom like I said I'm doing it for the grandson dude come on yeah he needed view so bad he took a leg kick I'm telling you man I've never seen anybody kick her back harder and I hate doing that when I saw him thudding into that bag I was just imagine my whole body shutting down like one of those leg kicks your whole body would just call for you for you are you on a smaller scale I guess maybe Barboza by this occasion Oh Barbosa but Barbosa is an accumulation guy he definitely could knock you out with one shot he's great kicks though yeah he's got more dexterity for sure he can do more different things wheel kicks and lighter dude and his switch kick is just fucking insane what Pedro did harder than anybody was light kicks I was like Atos the only guy that's ever stopped someone twice and he stopped two different guys monster man yeah how about I would love to see and starting to come out now dos Anjos Woodley dude that's the fight I know wasn't what's a super fight and probably deserves it and I was hoping fuck is going on with Woodley and Dana White no call you're calling each other liars and some craziness and I thought I thought I thought I was talking to Woodley after I didn't get the Diaz fight which is a good fight that's a great fight yeah but here's the deal doesn't make sense so you know numerically rankings but fuck rankings these days they don't really count who vote you look who votes for Army right it doesn't really count belts don't matter so it's all about super fights these days which is unfortunate for Woodley though that's why he wants the super fight well why wouldn't you you'd have to be crazy to not I'll tell you make money that's why you my guys want it and that's a big fight you have Nate Diaz fighting him and here's the thing both guys whether it's Nate Diaz or dos Anjos are gonna provide the kind of fight that I think Tyra needs me to because I think Tyron fought two super difficult guys fought Demian Maia which cannot take to the ground and then he fought wonderboy Thompson who's super awkward to fights where the the kind of action that everybody wanted but see really the only way to successfully fight wonderboy yeah you can't hate on Woodley but you look at Woodley gets a bad rap you look at his track record you know that how many times he fought last year and defend the title and his finishes and the quickest knockout in the in the division he's a monster but he gets this hate cuz you're only gives you last fight so you have the Maya fight which house you know fight in Miami right and again and tougher fights torn shoulder early in the fight but yeah I agree dos Santos ain't gonna he's gonna bring it which is the exact Woodley need 20% dos ángeles is a dangerous fight for any bum Woodley I take that fight because you need it you if you don't fight you're out of the public right like especially the fight fans you can be in all the movies you want you can do that TMZ show that's not moving the needle me right you got a fight but for dos Anjos it's a super dangerous fight because he's got to get inside that danger zone where Tyron could put anybody to sleep you got to think Tyra is the only guy at all at me Matt Brown beat the shit out of Wonder Boy but that was early in Wonderboys career and also the word was that wonderboy came into that fight over train huh was working I was wrestling working on takedown defense he was flat into the fight though and Matt Brown is just a fucking animal right other than that no one else has really heard them except for tyrant and in both of those fights you got to think wonderful it's the big-time striker and one of the best kickboxers to ever fight MMA especially like american karate style and financing this right now might be the best but yeah phenomenal top of the food chain top three Woodley hurts him blast them twice both fights both fights Woodley's the one who almost wins by stoppage you've got to respect that that's incredible that he was able to catch him it's incredible that he has the kind of power that even the fourth round he could still put a fucking hurting on him and almost put him away well he's a monster and also remember Wonder Boy beat ready robert whittaker right Whitakers last long yes Kayode him but that was also Whitaker at 170 was having a really I'm just saying like that's still fucking impressive I think that was what prompted him to move up yeah one of the fun one of them was like maybe not made me do this but either way for four I think dos Anjos here I remember dos Santos striking with out there at a kings with Werdum and those boys and huffy Adaro imma fucking strike at 70 he's a nightmare and also he can grapple me yes very depressing his dangerous to play with them yeah what he did with Neil Magny - it's like Jesus Christ just choose him up just shoot him up man he's a fucking an attack it fight for Woodley I want great at the TS fight for him person get paid and it's a great matchup for him but that dose and just fights a motherfucker here's what I think I think Woodley in any other situation other than that lineup of Demian Maia and - wonderboy fights take those fights out of the equation you got Robbie Lawler who he starches by knockout get Josh Koscheck who he puts into another dimension you have all these people he's smashing the J here on fight I mean you're looking at a Smasher he smashes people so you give him a couple other fights of people that are forced to stand down I know people that are in that division over if there was a different lineup of contenders he would have gone through these fights and if he had emerged victorious like he did face it was an amazing face of the UFC yeah amazing results right and he's great on TV he's great talks well he's articulate he crazed story about his mama house yeah and he's very even you know I'm saying like he doesn't have like crazy ups and downs when he talks very easy to listen to I mean he's got a tremendous belief in himself but every champion does they have to know so all he needed was the right kind of match and those those three fights kind of fucked them both of these fights we're talking about are that right kind of match up they're both the right kind of match up Nate Diaz is the right kind of match up Nate he's gonna fucking bring in that's gonna be a crazy fight and for sure dos Anjos is the crazy matchup at 170 and we when you remember what dos Anjos did to Nate at 155 you gotta go you got to give the shot to dos Anjos have to so shefter dos ángeles just to his last big win man unless he increases step aside for a little piece who maybe need greases step aside and for who was it for Nate but some man I know you guys got got to get that money just give me a days god I'll sit back just give me 50 but hundred and fifty give me 100 150 150 to do nothing but did you hear a shot Evans he thinks Woodley's making mistake and you know Rashad at the same problem where he was arguing with Dana not focus on his career shot goes it'll fuck you up me put all this energy and then Dana and the business sizing you got taking care of the fight business that fight business I don't understand so I don't want to judge but I don't yeah you don't wanna get involved with that because you're not gonna unless unless in and I say this in it's frustrating but unless you're a Conor McGregor type of draw in there's not a lot you can rip there's not a lot to argue with man there's always gonna come out on top and and and I'm it's not a knockdown Dana if I'm Dana I don't know if I run in the other way right it's like my Shore the highway my man like I'm gonna do that's the way you run a big giant ass business like that I get it you're dictator yeah well maybe there's another way to do it but it hasn't been done before it's possible I'm just I think I don't have any experience in it I don't want to talk about shit I don't have any experience either I know that shit I don't know about I know there's a lot of career off of nightmares scenarios that they've encountered on both sides you know but I think that I just would never want to have arguments with the fighters I feel like especially like calling each other liars and ched seems weird because both people I'd be like it doesn't help anyone because if you're Danny go he's a he's a fucking liar no no he's talking about he's a born fighter well he makes you money you're diminishing your product and if you're Woodling go you're a fucking liar you told Isaac frickin ideas like that's porn go heal now Dana goes alright well now I don't look like a complete dick and liar so I'm not giving you that fight I said I didn't want to do it maybe I told you behind closed doors we're gonna do it you just caught me on public well now I can't go back on my word I'm not getting that fight they probably brought it up to him that's what they're saying he said that a lawyer brought it up oh he said a UFC lawyer who's very invested in you as he makes a lot of matches so the law a lot of calls if the name a lawyer one the UFC who works with the UFC actually tried making the fight house yeah that's weird that you say that because he's that the lawyers contacted Tyron and tell them to stop saying that well I'm sure after he made it gave him the offer and dana goes what the fuck take that out no I don't know how that works me neither I don't know but the boy showed he talked about it at all no it had I don't think it had been brought up then you know he had just gotten through so shoulder surgery he just had his labrum fixed which is another thing like hey man how long does that take to fix you got to make sure that shit gets fixed right yeah it's doing July yeah I mean hopefully it'll be done right but that's four or five months like it's touch-and-go with shoulder injuries you really don't know what special style that shoulder needs 100% he's a fucking exploder correct he explodes on that Jay here on fight when he storms forward and fucking throws that shine overhand right like whoa that's a fucking explosion and now yeah because they were gonna try and make him come back quicker cuz they're trying to fill that UFC 222 and then you got because you got Frankie Ortega Frankie yeah an Ortega right and then cyborg versus a girl who's never heard of one thing though he's like super proactive on his recovery he's talking about PRP and stem cells professional men complete professional goodliest expression as they get as they get and I also think he's probably gonna be smart about it if it's not a hundred percent you know so maybe he's planning for it to be a hundred percent maybe there are a few months out if it's not they could always readjust but he also has other you know forts in the fire he goes you know I get the you'll see tonight gig I get this TMZ sports show so Kim forced my hand but I got these other gigs over here too which is mark he's smart he's also got his YouTube thing that he does you know champ life he does his own like embedded that yep these does his own done what is it is it called champ life I think it's called champ life find out what it is I'm pretty sure tyron woodley show it's called smart you gotta you know you gotta do your thing very smart you got a he means diversifying his output it's very smart well I think a lot is learning from you a lot of guys are learning from you I mean they got to realize that you're funny that you better be funny too champ life that's it the champ lifetime Woodley but there's I think it's smart you know to try to make some sort of a transition what's up raise you from a lot of these guys is your very funny and that's a do you that are you aren't yeah I don't know if Tyrone is that funny but he's definitely a bad motherfucker and I want to see what he's up to that's I think that's interesting I think that these kind of shows look would you want to watch some kid electrified dead rats or do you want to watch how the best motherfucker that grave 1/7 got in the world that's why we're brother lives his life don't you want to watch that crane he's electrocuting dead rats I have to be suspended all right check this out though time woodleigh's fucking everybody up on the planet this dudes I mean when you want to watch like that to me it's a fight it's a fine line though and I like what woodleigh's doing stuff like that yeah and you have to have them it's another team control it you know with Frankie Frankie has the UFC gym he has all these other business endeavors he goes I don't deal with it all I have teaming deals it I focus on fighting because for Woodley he's very hands-on that's what made him world champion and if you're not focus on things and I said this is a cowboy I said what do you think you know Derrick Hill was doing when you're on these movie sets men he's kicking bags he's thinking about beating you so you got to be very it's a fine line it's a super fine line and you know you don't see the NFL athletes with NBA athletes trying all these other avenues cuz they're making Bank so they don't have to do it thing is distracting anything that you have to do is taking away from your heart and if you if you've ever been on a movie set before if you ever done a movie I've been on set yes those shows that you yes Alan did to get us it's a lot of fucking work man takes a little roll out though so is even more work but yeah we're not said it's hurry up and wait you're not doing anything else right you know if you are a guy who has to be in fine shape for a world title fight or a world class fight like that like anybody trying to do a movie before like a big fight like a man you better spend a lot of time look at Ronda I need to go back to old but you look at Ronda it's just you have the wrong people in here no you can do this you can do this and now WME controls UFC and will put you in this movie I'll put you in this movie god I don't know man gotta strike while the iron's hot and what's really interesting man is how many times that story repeats itself over and over again I mean that's the theme in Rocky oh we ever before rocky fights clubber Lang he's getting all soft and shit and he's in movies and shit he's in movies with Hulk Hogan memory yeah I mean all this crazy shit was it a movie with Hagen or as a TV show it was an exhibition all serious wrestlers are known joke man wrestlers like you could say all you want that wrestling is fake I'm into WWE no but the fucking athleticism those guys have and the toughness the show slam each other around like that and it would take 300 nights a year man it's a mantra I got monkey boxing somebody its roof he throws to load into the fucking crowd is so proud now who's catching Stallone is it a team of stunt man you think yeah for sure they must have practiced that looks like it doesn't grab that's not a real person that looks like a fake person is it I thought but it has to be and there's no way they could have pulled that you don't think so in the eighties no I don't think so man you look at the body that shit's real I don't know fellas that's not rubbery enough I feel like his legs adjust in midair man you can tell the difference between someone's legs adjusting and they're not adjusting yeah you might be right I had a buddy do a movie star cold and he lets go cold with Rocky and they said Sylvester Stallone will tell real fight stories from his movies like their actual fights when I remember when I was in the Hulk Hogan I remember through this left and I saw the core mine I was like not today yeah you show like in that fight world you know talk about his old fight scenes like they were actual fights but is it for fun or is he really think that they fought famous for saying crazy shit that's definitely him he adjusts he lifts forward when he throws him and he pulls his head back around dude I ran into Hulk Hogan once I met Hulk Hogan when I did the UFC I had to interview him once and it was one of the funnest fucking interviews of my first of all I couldn't believe I'm sitting there talking to Hulk Hogan but he's pumping up wrestling and so I got fucking super pumped up yeah I got jazz Domino's mugging for the camera it was so stupid but it was one of the funnest times I've ever had ever in a show but then she look at you man huge personality the one and only brother sir how are you thank you my brother you know to be with Joe mania brother these guys are going to war out here it's unbelievable now you finish some never made fights before you a you a UFC Fan along a huge fan brother sure now I understand that you have recently announced a partnership with TNA Wrestling the same organization that Billy Corgan owns does he own which one does he own a pretty sure he loads T number with 25 I'm pretty sure he bought this one yeah how cool is Billy Corgan he just decides to buy and he knows his shit though as far as wrestling goes I know but how funny it is when you hear him talking he's like yeah everybody wants me to be all emo but yeah I used to hate them go ahead about the National Wrestling Alliance TNA and then NWA and talk used to be part of NWA - NWA was Flair right wasn't that Ric Flair what's that NWA was Ric Flair and that they want him to go - that's right whoa do I have Ric Flair t-shirts no should you should Ric Flair is a bad motherfucker I'm trying to get them on my show yeah you should have one here I would love to have Mon here Rick if you're out you're out there sir open invitation dude but when I'm into recipes in that video of the football players in the green room yes or in there like yes repeating it and then in between Rick the Nature Boy Flair saying it back no I haven't seen that you find it it's I forget the team that was doing it but they were yelling out his slogan and in between limousine riding her tuxedo van keeping these Gators down here in his areas if you give it to me for the beginning did this and then they spliced it in with Ric Flair see if you can find that it's them say in one line and then Ric Flair saying the second line and then going back to that it's fuckin amazing I don't think that's it see if you there's a video out there someone has it dude I've met someone send it to Jamie on Twitter I've never been more moved by documentary than I mean someone like a catchphrase like someone saying something that's just it just gives you goosebumps and makes you fire it up and make you start fuckin clap dude dude to this day if you say Ric Flair on stage and hold the microphone out the whole audience will go even Australia while Matthews was like balls deep with guy dodge and his eyes out you heard whoo yeah dude everybody all over the world all over the world but it bit some like an amazing weird occurrence that happens every now and then where guy just nails something and becomes a part of pop culture forever but think about it Floyd Conor they're all ripping off from him that's where they got it remember he was way before all of them well it's a hominid version for him though Muhammad Ali was talking shit like that in the 1960 about what his riches and like you know I oh my god that level Jeff Rigel dude Muhammad Ali would write poems I know poems but not about money and splurging and limousines and bitches and alligators maybe not bitches nowadays but know how great he was it's a different though Huey talked about Grady was how he's finish men around stuff like yeah I've seen that I'm saying as far as like boasting and that almost that that low-level where were you rags to riches right you know I'm saying like maybe he did I don't know but I know he would be little people to no end you're sure he said about Jimmy turelli said Jimmy turelli the dreams he beats me better wake up and apologize I think even say shit he's a Perot who thought you said that whoever he's fought I thought it's the Frazier recipient dreams not being right now I think it was but I mean there were so many of those fucking interviews where he talks so much crazy shit you talk shit blob can give me some if you talk about me I'll never fight another fellow toughest dog not even that big of a bear Sonny Liston is he your next time well after I you now like this him the coop I want that bear and welcome home here bear what's gonna happen he might be great but he'll fall in eight I'm the prettiest fight in the ring today that's my label he was a smart guy man he talked crazy super smart I'm too fast but there's always about his skills it wasn't like I had this much money I have a limo I have a Rolex we're like Floyd and like Rick took that to another level that's true right he took the I'm a rich guy thank to a new level and I bragged about his riches each is use a heal so he's a guy got money I got bitches I got Gators coats what's up I'm having a hard time is down from one side of this world to the other then you mean you talking to the Rolex wearing that is the best line I'm just happy that's a real person me too you know I mean just that's like every now and then someone creates a character right they nail something whatever the fuck it is it's just when a guy can do that and it gets to everybody you know how it's so hard these days to be original and like that cuz there's so many great figures before say don't give these lines like what when's the last time you heard someone come up with a new quote that someone's like inspired by like it's all old man you know what the worst thing is when someone tries a quote but it doesn't work there's nothing more painful there's nothing more painful but I thought about there's really you're not gonna come up with some new quote that we haven't heard before it's but it's all - it's been done before man yeah there's some wacky ones out there though some people try super hard for especially hot girls with Instagram like don't fuck with Einstein's quote and partner and ass how dare you can move I do like that how dare you Pythagoras triangle dude did you see Elon Musk where where do you have you seen this where Trump goes thank God the SpaceX stuff like that shows you how basically something about Americans right must go I'm from South America dumbass South Africa South Africa that's right yeah totally calm a dumbass dumbass that's hilarious it's false Google is that fake nope dammit I want to believe my friend sent that to me that is hilarious yeah well how do you not love a guy who shoots a fucking car into space and then put with letters by humans let him do whatever he wants hey man if I said to you hey Brendan let's go to the White House and asked them if we could shoot a car in a space I think I'm gonna go there and just tell him I got this idea I got like a tube and some gunpowder I'm gonna light the bottom part hood fire test I've never done it before but I'm pretty sure I could shoot a car in space I'm gonna have a a mannequin applicant well where's he gonna go it's just gonna float around space try get tomorrow's we're gonna overshoot though what this is one of the things that who's who's saying this Oh Duncan we were like what if the spaceship shot this car into space and this car hits an asteroid that sends it hurling towards earth it's just like a bomb it changes the direction of this asteroid because it's one of the things they've always said like if an asteroid is coming our way they would shoot something at it it would bounce it out of the way Armageddon and that would save us the movie Armageddon Bruce Willis did yeah um but what if it bounced it towards us what is this asshole shooting his fucking car with David Bowie on the stereo this fucking clips this asteroid it goes straight right to us boom us biggest dick of all time then or what if we shoot that car in the space and it hits an alien spaceship that's coming here to give us wisdom just comes right through the windshield this the flat earth Gaia oh that guy's crazy he's only raised $110 hold on it's only 110 dollars at a ten thousand dollar goal listening flat-earthers you need to put your money where your mouth is I'm starting to believe that you don't really believe in this cause yes my boy Michael Hughes $10,000 you get your liver-spotted hands off my mother this is a bailed on the first ship sails right I don't think he's actually does he launched himself into space yet I think they got delayed a few times I'm surprised I was gonna do it they the government got involved most like yeah you can't do that you know that is such a crazy move doesn't fucking he has $10,000 if Eddie you think there is flat fucking give this guy some money but what about that bo-beat character isn't Eva Tsui per wealthy this is a single in 4f well it's because he's been too busy with Flat Earth theory listen man once he understands the fucking real true image of the earth and then you have a wall that surrounds the outer realm of the earth and everybody thinks the worth is round you got some shit to tell the people it's more important than your raps on your right you made things run you got to get people whoa look at the guy from blink 182 noise he what moved on y'all gotta take this Flat Earth shit to the next level fuck the flat versus round argument let's talk more about the simulation and who's programming it is that's how both sides get benefit if it's round or flat oh my god like real bees going through some shit fuck yes flatter stuff what else can we talk here's the thing and this is something really important for anybody who's listening to this you you got to not hang yourself on your ideas I've done it I did in the past when you do that you're not really paying attention you're only looking for things that support your idea it's called confirmation bias everybody if everybody's susceptible to it included I've I've done it a hundred times to myself in the past but once you realize what it is if you keep doing the same goddamn thing then you're being stupid so once you know what it is and you know it's possible let's just look at this look at all the overwhelming amount of evidence from super geniuses that say it's round just you got to walk away it's it's it hurts you it hurts your view of the world to believe that because you can't believe it if you're really paying attention so if you believe that what you're saying is you have a very limited box in which you're willing to operate in you're not willing to accept anything outside of what you've already got as a preconceived idea and you're ignoring massive amounts of data that points to the fact that you're wrong so by doing that you limit your own view of yourself yeah you you you become you you don't trust in the way you view things anymore you're boxed in it's very dangerous to be committed to something you know it's not true it also shows the levels intelligence too because when you got these geniuses who spent the entire lives doing doing this stuff in astrophysics you're telling me that they're part of this scheme too and they believe that it's this is 100 percent of the problem 100 percent it's adopting an idea too soon that's a hundred percent of the idea because once you once you adopt that idea and then you hang on to it now you're fucked like Bigfoot man Bigfoot was a big one for me I was I was convinced it was really wrong with you how long ago was this not when I yeah man when I did this TV show that's when I totally let it go I'd kind of let it go before then but Duncan and I actually went to the Pacific Northwest and we went to hang out with like real Bigfoot experts that we searching for Bigfoot all the time when you say real Bigfoot experts you mean con artists no it's not that dumbass the way I describe those unfuckable white dudes who have nothing yeah yeah it's just they're just a bunch of fellows we decided to call herself a rap band we're gonna call selves you FWD eggs I fuck for white then you didn't find any not there shit about camp spots shells and beer cans laying around you found you're better than that Joe no this is what I found out people want to believe in things and once you want to believe in something instead of looking at it objectively and going well I'm not sure you like automatically go towards any information that would point to the fact that the thing is real not to the whole body of information look well how crazy these people when you meet the people that believe in Bigfoot the ones that have seen it the ones that it claimed to seen it almost all of them were clearly lying and a lot in a little like out of it let it was one life spectrum maybe yeah but just some people are just liars they can't help it they make stories up to make themselves feel better like they just crazy and you can't really say it to their face you don't really know but sometimes it just gets ridiculous and this one lady was one of the only ones that didn't seem like that this one lady was telling me a story about how she was going through the woods and she saw some big thing that was standing up and it was like seven feet tall and it was moving through the woods and she saw this thing and she was like oh my god it's an ape and she realized it was Bigfoot and she saw it for a few steps and then it was gone at the time that was fascinated at the time I was like maybe she really did see it but now I know for a fact an absolute fact that where she lived there's a lot of black bears and black bears will often walk on their hind legs they'll walk like Bigfoot they really do there's many many many many videos I've seen it with my own two eyes I saw a bear walk for several steps like six seven maybe even ten steps sometimes on its hind legs roaring at another and they were gonna fight with each other and they fought with just standing up they went after each other dope but dude he walked towards him like that look at that that look does look like they do that see that bear this is a bear that had injured paws and sometimes they'll get their pop it off in a fight they Duke it out with each other or maybe they get caught in a trap you know some fucking assholes that set traps out there so there's two walk like that they bite you know their back their own foot off to get out of a try and that's real man they get wolves that way they catch them in traps Jesus traps or scary shit hell yeah but these animals you know when they get a hurt paw they'll walk on their back legs like Bigfoot so she probably saw some shit moving through the woods shit yeah dude they just stand there that's terrifying I know and they can walk like that that's terrifying but it's clearly not a fucking big fight you moron no no no see you say that but dude I'm telling you when you're in the Pacific Northwest you cannot see 15 yards in front of you Duncan and I we're talking about it because you know we had a hangout up up there and go wandering through the woods we're like if there was something right there like five trees away and then it moved into the back how long would it take for it disappeared through steps three steps it's so dance dude it's like a q-tip box you know you get q-tips out of a box yeah it's amazing so many of them this is no gaps in between these trees have you been to the Pacific Northwest I mean the rain forests not ever been in there I mean obviously drunk drove through it because I'm handsome shit's amazing and here's the other thing about it it's all pine needles so that you don't even make any noise but I would see a standing figure like that and in my educated brain I go oh that's a fucking giant bear no because you'd be looking at a hill like a hundred yards away and you would see this thing walk through the trees standing up and you'd be like what in the fuck was that and then it's gone so then your imagination starts running wild the imagination starts filling the blanks I don't think it's a coincidence but a higher or not for sure your high well then I'd probably you're in a Seattle man ok then why would you not be hot yeah beans mushrooms Oh your eyes fuck all on shrooms everybody up there son shrooms and that's a walking brown unicorn you're walking down this road in the forest and you see something that's in the wood you see it briefly a hundred yards away for three or four steps your brain starts filling in the blanks and you get excited you saw a fucking Bigfoot and I will go to my grave knowing what I saw that day and everybody wants to be special so everybody wants to pretend they saw a giant monkey in the woods but when you really talk to them that was the only lady I knew that wasn't lying to me she saw some she actually thought it was big fish it was amazing if I had a guess if I had some money to bet I'd bet almost 100% what she saw was a bear you did the show and after coming back from that show you know that Bigfoot's bullshit and it's the same feeling I got talking to everybody psychic readers same feeling I got talking to UFO experts same feeling I got to everybody wants to believe everybody wants some beautiful I can fucks with the UFO makes sense to me there's there's so many kind of X factors there I can buy a UFO it could be real it could be real Bigfoot come on he's the thing about Bigfoot the reason why it's so attractive is because it used to be a real animal 100% was a thing called Gigantopithecus that shit up they didn't know about Gigantopithecus until I believe it was the 1920s they found a tooth of this primate in an apothecary shop in China and they're like what the fuck is this honest element yeah they were selling it and someone found another tooth and they said oh there's nothing in the the primatologist whoo check it out that was a real annum ya dog eight foot tall gigantic orangutan looking thing it's still different like a human is it orangutan family no no dude it doesn't know Bigfoot's supposed to look like that almost look like yeah it's not supposed to look you man I thought like a hairy human ears elbow there's a photo of a man standing next to a proportionate man the average-sized man standing next to which I can't tell Pittacus statue see we could find that in there I know pick up this yeah that's it that was how big it was so that was a real animal a hundred percent now they're not a hundred percent sure that it walked on two legs but they're pretty sure and the reason why is the shape of the teeth that animals that walk on their hind legs animals that walk upright have a different shape to their jaw so that's what they found that looks like I found a jawbone and they found some teeth and they found it like all in the same site and then they realized that they're dealing with a totally different animal and she was around how long ago ten thousand years ago so this thing existed somewhere in the neighborhood of I think that's right wait a minute that might be wrong I think I'm thinking of the Flores man was the Hobbit man the little three foot tall dude sure that was like 10 14 thousand years ago that was really soon yeah like really recently definitely lived alongside people this might be a hundred thousand what makes it attractive though is where that thing lived is exactly where all the animals can across the bering land bridge that connected Asia to North America so there's Bering Land Bridge okay was where they think everything came across short face bears even people that like one of the things about Native Americans it's a funny thing how they found this out they found this out through crazy Mormons who wanted to prove that all of the Native Americans were actually the Lost Tribe of Israel because that was Mormons a crazy brother at least they got some right though so they got one thing wrong yes that's why nobody's fighting over the hill yeah so so this guy who's like some rich Mormon guy spends a shit ton of money turns out he gets the DNA tested they're all from Siberia really yep yeah they came down from Siberia that's why you know they look different as they go through the different climates you know if you look at like Inuits in like Alaska and then that area they look super similar Siberians man Siberians have that strong features like asian chick bongo like like Genghis Khan looking face like powerful people dude that's what they look they're all from Siberia - they're from Siberia and so they're as they came down and got deeper into North America then you got all sorts of different influences different kind of people but they look different and they start looking more and more Mexican when you get down to the Mayans the Mayans are very Mexican it has Tex it's all Mexican and then they've got people coming in from Spain and teaching them Spanish but you got to realize these people started off essentially Native Americans before the Spanish arrived yeah it's really interesting stuff dude it's super interesting snowman found that shit so a Mormon found that shit by trying to prove that his his shit was right but the problem is fuck all this time I'll just wrap it up here all this time is when that animal existed so this animal was a real animal during this time so there anytime that all these animals were coming across the Bering Land Bridge it's highly likely that there might have been one of those fucking things that came over two and then people start to share story yeah and became this folks really dead now like it's dead in Asia yeah but the Native Americans have a bunch of different names for it one of the things that's interesting about the Sasquatch in Native American culture I think they have 40 different names for it too much well I think it existed I think something like that existed or it could have been the same thing about this lady she sees a bear walking on two legs a story - you know they tell a tale and elsewhere smoking a lot of shit in a lot of shrooms that's right dog a lot of it goes a lot of that San Pedro cactus ayahuasca I see a cat I think it's roms and shit in front of the fire okay yeah execute people with knives and shit drinking booze all right Jamie all the different names for Bigfoot different Native American Bigfoot name but are these like those gender pronouns or just waking them up yeah you can the meaning over here isn't always just like this one says big man with a little hat oh that's my boy hairy savage otter man dangerous whoosh man dangerous being yeah a lot of different yeah see the cannibal of that a lot of that could be attributed to a lack of understanding of what really is out there they don't have an accurate account of all the different animals they know there's a bunch of them they can kill him yeah we would find it by now the government would find it if the shit was out there so you don't find it Kennedy would find it Tim Kennedy would find it yeah if you hear about Tim J's new show I don't mean to interrupt your heard anything for Hitler no no no what's hard to kill they put me in situation see if he gets out of it what our boy Aubrey is tell me about this today I think son discovery history are you doing that because Tim Kennedy you can't kill him he's Captain America they like put me in a burning plane he got like third-degree burns he makes out alive they put him in an avalanche he gets out alive they shouldn't do this dude dude he's such a monster it's a fucking animal but I know the best human I tell him for a TV show know that you can't kill him you can't kill him he's a person no no we're marrows waiting there with a hammer he's got a real problem on his hands if you wait there with EPO and a hammer and he's in trouble yeah interesting okay each other right yeah that's a crazy idea he's another guy they put him on anything I'm interested in him on anything except fascinating guy great guy he's guy who's parlayed his career after fighting something great well he is a professional bad motherfucker I mean that's literally who he is he's not what he does - no no smart guy he's educated but he's a bad motherfucker he's get good advice for people he's a badass motherfucker and just like a nice nice dude don't die Tim Kennedy please pleasedon't now I heard that shot yeah I go what if he dies not for TV Tim gotta keep those ratings son hmm yeah I just again wooden you wouldn't wanted to see that guy hanging around all day well I mean if you do people really want to go see the Kardashians house and look at my shoes oh my god super cute they really want to see that or do they want to see Tim Kennedy at the range talking shit practicing killing terrorists I wanna see both do I want I don't want to see the other one you want to see the other one don't care what they said but if I'd like to see Tim Kennedy in the Kardashians house teach him how to fight okay like mix it you know him and Kanye do you think they would see eye-to-eye yeah I do Caitlyn Jenner Jim Kennedy's like the anti Conway I bet he would be interesting with Caitlyn I bet he'd be interesting he's very open-minded guy yeah you know I mean he doesn't give a fuck what you do just don't get in the way of the military no this way fun it's not like looking tell people how to live their life damn right he has a show should have a show well I think there's a lot there's a lot of missed opportunities that a lot of these guys have but they're what they are as unique individuals it's like there's people that are good at promoting themselves and there's people that just don't they don't have that you're from the fighters yeah like steep eh yeah exactly well I feel like Steve pays a can't lose scenario me too just need more attention and people mean to recognize it more and more and I think the more wins like the in Ghana win the Junior dos Santos win the Overeem and it's like he's becoming a superstar he's taking a little bit more time yeah but you know he doesn't help us sell the fight in like well him being a fire fighter him being the most winning heavyweight of all time that kind of helps right like saying they didn't help what do you mean you just say he's not saying he doesn't sell you're just saying he you know he does the minimums for our cell like interviews and media just wants to fight and fight fires you know what man there's a fine line that has to be drawn right between how much promotion you do and how much training you do training has to take precedent over anything which is what steep a does analyze the winners heavyweight it's on the promotion yeah I also wonder like how much actual travel does versus how much access to him at his gym talking to him at his gym you know not being able to film any sparring or not being able to film any training they don't want to but talk to him there have a have short interviews that only take place while he's in training camp boy do you want to talk to him good the champ will meet you for 15 minutes after practice today so he just goes there he sits for 15 minutes he answers a couple questions from a guy in any bolts he said thanks sir yeah yeah he goes in and goes does all his recovery that way it doesn't interfere with travel and all that shit yeah I agree but up but also like he shouldn't have to do that he's not a he's not the guy who's gonna give you a soundbite that's gonna sell a fight he says the fight by training hard beaten people's ass and he fights fires in his off time yeah I mean being just a unique individual in that regard right he's the blue-collar everyone can relate to Stevie more people can relate to steepy than they can say Francis or John Jones well how many guys are world champions but still have a fuckin day job and that day jobs being a firefighter actually frowned upon though in the UFC well who else is done Chris Lytle did it Shane Carwin Shane Carwin what it was Shane do I was an engineer he worked for the city really while fighting Brock Lesnar and they begged him to quit and he wouldn't do it they actually I made him an offer to quit I remember being his currently made like no can't have benefits my kids insurance all that I can doing it wow that's interesting man because if you think about it and and I guess II stance if you book from the UFC standpoint I get it because imagine if Lionel Messi or Peyton Manning or Tom Brady had side gigs while they're in this world champions right this is a bad look man so he can still be that good but you do you have to have this job to meeting the bills like that's not good but if like he worked for the state of Colorado or something didn't he shame Gaza hit water engineer but just stated Greeley okay or the city seemed like really sorry give him some fucking a few years off you know would not be the move st. Greeley yeah just like give them a guarantee to come back yeah I don't know man I don't know you definitely work like then the work force like they could probably for his job with someone's gonna work full-time might not but when they love to have a heavyweight champion I don't think they give a fuck no Greeley you don't say like was gonna sign some autographs during lunch yeah probably right I get both sides they get shamed especially at the time Shane going nah me and I gotta look up from the family who that's how long I'm gonna do this I'm older I have a family to protect I've benefits and 401 K and all that and then Dana going dude you're fighting Brock Lesnar I can't have you having this job and still trying to be the world champion like it's a bad look so I get both arguments rapid firts T pay is not a bad look because people especially to this day like it's a great it's a great look in terms of marketing people love first responder yet they hide it though yeah I guess he kind of hides it like you won't see I'm embedded in that stuff they hide it not really come on not put out there really not makes it look it makes the sport look bad I don't think it does he just doesn't think it does either I'm saying this is from the UFC standpoint where they don't want a guy having a second job but the thing about this fire department is like you get a lot of downtime people don't realize how much alyce caron stuff right well even the way they do shifts a lot of times they do 24 hour shifts they sleep at the station and work out there i had a friend from the pool hall days ray the fireman and ray the fireman would explain it they all had weird names like there was like white plains charlie there was mount vernon Tommy like everybody had weird names International South you had one name no I'll show the comedian I did not that creative guys in the crib but they just rank the fireman a firefighter just need to talk Roy array first ray the fireman ray the firefighter yeah he says he was the first guy that explained to me what a great gig it was cuz he would do the 24 hour shifts he'd like a couple in a row and then he'd be done for the week and that you'd stay there and most of time you're bullshittin guys are cooking you know you work out if you like two guys play cards that's great yeah I love fire fighters yeah so Ray was like explaining to me like that it's it's pretty good gig you know but obviously when the shit goes down and the fires burning then it's a fucking tear yeah yeah that's mean but these guys die you look at Steve bacon John like his most like picks a lot of it's him fighting a fire like there's a big core of him like he's like going to work and you're covered in ash and it's just like damn that's a badass that's Captain America son in a lot of ways right in I mean Joey Diaz has that fucking amazing the amazing description in that game again mentality yeah yeah but that is it man I mean that's him keeping that name too steep a Miocic yeah you know that's not like someone changing their name to something that's more compatible with the modern society mean looks like Cleveland but yeah yeah but look at him look at that fucking animal dude monster yeah people don't appreciate him enough it's unfortunate when it's all said and done he's gonna be one of the most loved heavyweights of all time he'll be like a Jack Dempsey type character even after his career is over that's that's not hating on you see that sports in general like right now LeBron you know the guys hate on him so much of Kevin Durant or Westbrook or even Tom Brady like these greats on the sport right now once they're gone like holy fuck remember good that guy was Steve bays that guy like we're not appreciate it when it happens when I appreciate invar do more Conor these guys like it well it's happening like ah fuck this guy this guy you pick and choose your battles do you think that it's like what is that what's that picture Oh boss logic main - boss last artist in the world what's going on him and Dad dos brag I know let's explain what we're seeing we're looking at a steep AIDS body with a UFC t-shirt on like coming out of a fire with a fire mask fireman's mascot holding his UFC belt and holding a hose in one hand with UFC glove on some batteries it's so sick yeah he's a killer artist man it's just um for whatever reason sometimes that happens where guys are overlooked that happens a lot while they're the King sports not that you can appreciate that guy after he's gone I mean I'm like oh shit real good he was man look if he beats DC he's a shoo-in for the all-time great and right now he's basically right now he's basically you got to think he's the all-time great at least in terms of accomplishments let me ask you this if DC were to beat steep Bay's the all-time great DC he's right up there man look it's hard to do MMA math especially when you got that Jon Jones wild card that's what's the bummer because I 15 feet steep a who's regarded as the greatest UFC heavyweight champion online DC was undefeated heavyweight but then he lost to John but then he's champion light heavyweight twice you would have to prove that DC is better at heavyweight than he is at light heavyweight and that would be a hard sell what about pound for pound one of the all-time greats unquestionable top three look if he goes up and wins just in terms of statistics alone he's light heavyweight champion then he beats the heavyweight champion the only argument against it would be both times he did it was because John was stripped yeah it wasn't because he beat John so so if that's the problem that's like that's a real problem I know permit number one he's fucking amazing you take away John Jones and he's fucking amazing me take away John Jones we could eat just a rumble Johnson twice you know look what he does to Gustafson look at he does to everybody Gustafson fights a war I know there was a war I think Gustafson is perhaps the most dangerous Challenger 205 right now I think Gustafson especially if he recovers perfectly from his shoulder surgery Gustafson when I saw him fight Glover I was like this guy's on another another level another level just something going given I owned it yeah any given night you know there's kind of to me I look at light heavyweight there's 1a 1b and 1c and it's John at 1a it's DC at 1b and then I just said 1c after that if ya like a motherfucker those three any given night could beat each other I think I think you're right I think it's fascinating that Rumble is not up in there with them if you saw the way rumble destroyed some of those guys including Gustafson the way Rumble just puts the fuck and smash on people like when he uppercut it glow over into another universe yeah dude he's he's a scariest guy ever and the fact that he just can't get that off on DC he's not up there as far as the top when those thought it's amazing because you'd be convinced he was did you hear rumbles trying to do bodybuilding do you hear that he's trying to get a professional bodybuilding out yeah Fighting's gone it's over I think you're going for bein what he said after the fight was like probably the best way to go for him and I know he said some different things since then like you said he's thinking about coming back as a heavyweight yeah and he said like after what fight was it that he said let me show these guys how to throw an uppercut well fucking fight was it one fight he was tweeting after the fight was it over that it wasn't Francis over him right no it was a light heavyweight fight he was a light heavyweight fight I don't remember what fight it was welcomes fight Jesus Christ he's giant oh my god are we going sizzler oh my god oh my god who's ready to hit the gym that's a he ain't fight anytime soon no no no no miss he's like what I don't we don't need to test you we're good his his fucking carnival bells gonna fly higher than mine yeah toss around that's an interesting career move though bodybuilding well I know he was going into the weed business too what he said after the fight I don't think you could ever negate that and what he said that he doesn't really like the fight he's just really good at it correct I mean boy when a guy says that that's just that's just he's just laying it on yes who he is and then I want you anymore yeah I remember yet that thing but what the LA Rams liked and what you can do with the Rams be like yeah he's gonna play for the Rams and I went on this rant on my show how he's not playing for the Rams and he DM he was like bro I'm not playing for the Rams moron like that he caught me moron that's me saying yeah he's like dude I'm not playing for the Rams I was a consulting for them with with some you know performance stuff as far as I can you say clearly I'm not playing running back for the Rams clearly yeah I got that big dude what is that what is he doing the time oh oh here's your boy he's just he's super does he what does the shirt say no I'm saying it that Oh cam where's that weird top can we stop wearing those yes I'll cut your sleeves off camp what was the picture above that she the one that you just had up there yeah that's just him and his brother we Balkan baby dudes come on that's ridiculous that he's gigantic body bill existing this is gonna sound gay you know have the greatest back of all time and all of combat sports of all combat sports hold on give me a weight class Evander Holyfield oh yes and his trash his truck just started Oh bro started the top of his head to fuck all son come on so I'm most impressive combat supposed to fucking peaches hanging up the top find out when he fought Tyson Evander Holyfield when he fought Tyson just play a clip of that you finished watching 3rd or 2nd Olympia he's so - George I'm just that formal skin and just up and he was one of the first guys that figured out how to in court prop look at that Jesus Christ Jesus look at that back he was one of the first guys that figured out how to correctly implement weightlifting training because a Mac ISIL still try everyone thought to make you slower yeah and he was one of the first guys that really pulled it off and moved up a weight class he was the cruiserweight champion has a hard time making 195 it's like fuck it we're going up and first couple of fights I want to say he's like you're like 205 maybe 209 yeah and he never got much higher - 11 - 12 yeah well it was the highest he got I would say honestly like 2 to 118 yeah some ways at the bite after Tyson bit him that was the saddest shit Oh Holyfield overall had a better career than Tyson oh for sure - 26 so I probably got up to time is that right now that's not as light as fighting weight by the way that's when they used to test you with one of them Cracker Jacks rings they were just waving around you and if it didn't show didn't change colors yeah I don't know if that was shot everything everybody was on everything there was no testing get the fuck outta here with your testing you think if John Jones was just back then oh my god the Chuck Liddell days yeah come on son the Vanderley silver pride days yeah yeah in the early days the way the best guys would put it is you never knew who was on anything because essentially it was an intelligence test not a drug test because they're only testing the day of the fight most the guys have already cycled off you keep all the benefits for a long period of time and back then they you know rudimentary tests like I didn't have the same kind of tests they have now boom we're gonna fucking traps on holyfield Jesus son it makes Tyson look smooth you know dude dude he fucked Tyson up in this fight I mean I remember watching this with Kevin James we're in my house hadn't seen at all dude it's beating the shit out of Tyson how great at what time was that for they stopped the fight right there I was at the end of the round those around oh dude give me some volume up in that bitch I want to hear this I remember Kevin and I were jumping up and down on the couch screaming I couldn't believe it we couldn't believe it everybody thought like Tyson was the scariest guy ever and that the only guy that ever beat him was Buster Douglas and Evander Holyfield was not the same size and there's and I was coming after him for years just trying to make it happen forever if you remember and remember Evander had those crazy fights with Riddick Bowe who was an enormous guy monster boom look at this Holyfield son to me it's no disrespect to Tyson when Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield ranked pound for pound over yeah people forget and Holyfield was a fucking Olympian man correct did he win a gold medal yes oh no he don't bring a winner go bronze yeah what did you got screwed in the Olympics looked at a boom nobody got screwed like Roy Jones jr. did nobody nobody when he fought that Korean dude in the Olympics that was one of the worst robberies I've ever seen watching box and how that Irish kid who's fighting there he goes they just pushed him back out there I mean Howerton is he and Tyson charging forward do you know I just did a potty she left I saw your truck is it on podcast called bite the mic oh shit Oh boom goddamn dude look look at the body on a first team all bond well Tyson just doesn't look physically the same as he did like just coming out of the pokey like he just does not have the same build that's it stop the fight I'll tell you what you want to fight that he was just as good Anthony Joshua Klitschko man I was jumping that was one of the best heavyweight fights ever ever have for me I was so much fun man let's go gets dropped it looks like he's out and he comes back and drops Joshua it looks like Joshua was out and the Joshua comes back and puts him away and now you got got Anthony and Joshua fighting Parker who's a New Zealand champ who's a monster under Aidan and then he got wild or fighting Louise Ortiz and then the winners fight and hopefully it's Wilder verse Joshua Wimbledon 90,000 son Ortiz is a tough fight for anybody man fight I think one of the ones yeah I do I think Wilder walks through you know I think put stops um Wow I know I know the Cuban Olympian box yeah really what makes you think that I don't know I'm just not that good Showtime fanboy don't lie well they're both Showtime oh they're both Showtime so Ortiz is older and he did piss hot he pissed hot they they're supposed to fight hard to do hard to do and Bob got to be trying if it's hot I don't know you look at his level of competition nice Wilders 38 note with 37 knock they maybe hit him with a surprise test the thing he tests hot for you a prescription is a little muddy but he's test hot before but just I and there's a prescription for testosterone wasn't some weird shit Deontay Wilder is the favorite - 2:35 - Luis Ortiz 185 well you know what man when you see odds like that you got to think maybe they know something and maybe Ortiz is you know what was a motherfucker what yeah we don't know it's real age you know that Cuban age maybe 55 Roanoke both but also Wilders a I'm telling you man he's a motherfucker he's athletic he's long-nosed all this confidence you just the only guy that not to get knocked out stubborn he walked through in the first round put his hands down yeah I saw that that was crazy and then he got auntie Joshua who's just you know the biggest thing right now he's fighting Parkers it's not a walk in the park either there's people like oh here it is there's a stubborn fight well I never been show that again missed it I want to see this boom his right hand is something special me yeah fights long - he does fight long he hits hard but I just think like Anthony Joshua is not this guy no no no I mean he's just not know Steve earns good fighters a tough guy but Anthony Joshua it's a totally different level he's an Olympic gold medalist in the heavyweight division he's a fucking super stud athlete yeah I mean this guy is out of it and while there puts on a show and beats the shit out of him and that's all good and it was great win great win for him great Joshua's last fight though he took out short notice cuz a guy didn't make the way I didn't watch he didn't look great you know it was last second he fought this guy not up to his level and he went to a decision it was a really yeah it wasn't a great fight I have that one on my DVR and I never got around to it don't get around to it don't know why waste your time no it's like if Joshua took the night off recently 90,000 do you think that he did that because he wasn't prepared like cuz he time to say no no I think he was just like I could beat this guy my sleep I don't risk a lot and so he didn't yeah wow he really didn't he didn't push they push the gas on with wild or really doesn't have off nights he's trying to smoke everyone he's 37 knocked out for God's sakes interesting interesting interesting fight well we know that you know Wilder can hit hard and we know that Joshua can get tagged and dropped and recover it's such a fight for heavyweight I just want both them to say that Nick going class eight-man especially not anti Josh but he's moving like a motherfucker look I just wanted to see Klitschko vs. Wilder I thought that would be a really interesting but he retired yeah Wow for a long-ass time dude one of the greats wild iris Joshua if both are when you get that fight damn heavyweight boxing is good right and don't forget Tyson Fury's like let's do it I'm ready I'm all good I'm not mentally unstable anymore let's does that happen have you cleaned it up he got I don't know he got as life together started working out got sanctioned to fight again now he even told Anthony Josh oh he's like I don't need a warmup I'll beat you right now and I got guys who trained his gym and goes he came in whatever he's like 400 pounds just beating the show everyone SWAT they're just beating the fuck and everybody freaked man I'm such a big Tyson Fury fan man did you see the video of him hitting mitts recently oh no haven't dude he's really fast he's a really fast he's a freak like he throws a right hand like look at this this is this is not the video that I saw though the video that I saw but this is this is good too the video that I saw was him throwing a jab at a right hand and ducking up and around behind a guy or under and around behind a guy like that yeah man his angle to start awkward didn't know what to do with them no no it was super confusing he makes it an ugly fight I think it for him I think you know Joshua it's a nightmare for Wilder he's a nightmare just cuz you can't do it ate it he's a little fat right here I mean he's gotta keep dropping weight but how long ago was that one okay no venom head movement son he's a fucking skilled boxer the problem is a guy like him as he starts singing songs after fights and all the crazy shit that does and you just think he's alone yeah you got a he's a gypsy you gotta realize like he's super skillful know what he can do what he can do is very skillful I mean Klitschko didn't know what the fuck to do in that final cuz she was like what was hesitant to your right hand cuz doing these hockey and pop - yeah who's getting popped and he realized like this guy might fuck me up that's why he's a nightmare for Joshua in Wilder he's my Dark Horse because no not a vitamin to our course if he gets his shit together okay but why did he have like psychological problems what happened I just think you know he's mentally unstable a little bit and he goes into this depression and he was world champion then when he got there you don't know what to do he thought it was gonna cure all he's never even defended the title I just gave it up I know that's crazy happy and what's that that no this is pretty quick - it's him there's a guy holding pads for him and he just doesn't matter I mean we're getting the sense of it yeah he's just a really good fighter yeah man um I'm excited about that I'm excited about a lot of shit man a lot of shit's going on yet Canelo triple G coming back that's very exciting that's single de Maio they had to do that single how do you got do that one second do it I mean that's a no-brainer you don't could have bet the house on that fight being Cinco DeMayo Vegas have the odds would it be the Saturday of Cinco DeMayo weekend oh yes Senor on Saturday - this year Oh fight fan son yeah in boxing in fight in MMA and that's a fight where Canelo has a lot to prove right a lot of people thought he lost the fight him and including me got that shady draw I thought was pretty clear he's pretty clear I'm told it's gonna happen you did you set it straight up before anything happened he said dude he is gonna have to knock him out of women - shadiness son Canelo in Vegas I was like you thinking yeah you know I got Roy verse mr. Jerome this weekend this week or right Friday night right is a Friday or Saturday I think it's Saturday right pretty sure yes Saturday and then Cowboys fighting Sunday right yes it's a good-ass weekend then he also got Mikey Garcia fighting for Showtime ooh really fighting Rios I'm actually going out there to shoot some stuff for show to Friday night Friday night out so Friday sick hopefully I'm home and time when you say Rios Brandon Rios yeah really yeah it's a good fight I mean it's not Brandon Rios i watch the food hell yeah yes that's an interesting fight wow that's a good boxing match Mario's verse God Mike Alvarado yes from Denver yeah Mike another challenge is another story blood and guts type character the Wildcat yeah Denver legend you know I'm really glad that all this bullshit has died down with boxing versus MMA like there's no like you can like both of them now you know Katie can I deal with all the time because what I'm doing this isn't a we're safe deal with it did I deal with all the time especially I can't officially announce it there's an announcement coming out next Friday folks your Showtime but it does just that it's boxing it's fighting it's UFC Bellator Showtime like HBO okay there's no there's no agenda we're just off like a variety fun show for a fight fans entertainment fans that's fuckin awesome yeah man I'm excited but you do see that though boxers like MMA that's why it doesn't box yeah that's what gave me the idea for the show when I pitched the show because when I was covering the Conor McGregor stuff I'd have these boxing heads coming in like what are you talking about man why can't I like get out of here stay stay in the cage I'm in May this is the sweet science I'm like well I like both oh man a boxer I like boxing too why's it matter that's like saying I can't watch the NFL and watch the NBA what the fuck are you talking about I like a goal they get tribal everybody gets weird like this is team boxing we're team MMA it's fun it's stupid man there was a thing like that with wrestlers and jiu-jitsu people yeah man when incent anyway arm barred Royce Alger in the UFC and got him in it and they went ran backstage eating anyway yells out fuck wrestling it's like how weird is that it was fun because there was look there's a lot of shit talking going on between all the camps and Royce Alger who was a top of the food chain American wrestler they thought he was just gonna run in and storm the fucking the UFC and start smashing people and they even said in that fight he said it's time to bring in the 18 you know that's what he said it's like a little pre-fight thing and instant anyway I was like yeah you know about arm bars because I fuckin sure do yeah and the NSYNC anima an armbar quick so you can find that instant anyway versus Royce Alger it's voice but with an arc this is an American cat and then he lost to who was that dude the wolf that dude they call himself the will Jackson goddamn it great name though the wolf Jackson those private those tribe is so weird though man us is reverse them it's a stupid you don't you don't have to pick one you know you know I can DVR the box and fight and watch the UFC fight like yeah and watch all of it but a completely different they are completely different there's some things you can do in boxing that you just cannot do in MMA you can't get away there it is it's an anyway Royce Alger god damn what the head and the hold fucking the guy that was like bas Rutten on the floor like the whole deal dude and these these are the early days so this was in 1997 and I was there that's what is that I don't know if it was in Denver mats Denver brother since 1997 I sure I want your fever see in Denver that's Denver are you sure okay I feel like it not been thirteen J it was the second UFC that I worked the first one that I worked was in Dothan Alabama and you don't remember this one I do not remember with that one gust oh there you go so this one is fuck man 97 yeah and so Royce Alger takes him down immediately and ensign went on to submit a lot of guys including he submitted Randy fucking coat or so stop and think of this this is a fight at shit I don't know what way through fighting at it's it's 200 pounds but ants and still even then he had beautiful salt pepper yeah look at those traps on Japan he was already really experienced had a fucking savage mindset look up jack dancing is Jesus just skip ahead to how much better he was even good back there how much better is he now well now he just gets fucking sight back it up a little bit he gets fucking psychotic oh my god look at this you got a bat oh you ruined it the SCOOTER dole john acardo looking a slim look at this and see moving forward Roy Sal just shoots immediately and take is back quick look at the guillotine attempt here look at this switches it over and booted no he goes for the other arm watch this here it is this poor guy has no idea yep he just didn't know what to do oh he slipped out of that one and he's got wrists just risked a pond he doesn't have anything covers his knuckles and some dozen but algid does so it's smart Frandsen like if he was gonna get a choke or some like yeah these are these are the days you didn't have to have anything like Royce is wearing shoes yep look he's got some fucking wrestling shoes on remember guys are scared of wrestling shoes because of heel he looks you get the grip on the hill yeah that was a big deal right like if you're gonna fight in Pride well you got to be real careful those fucking he looks especially if you fighting something like Josh Barnett act dependent or if you're fighting River doom and pride you can be in some trouble because here it is it catches them from here here comes set it up and seize punching with bare knuckle to the eyes and the face it's a totally different feel right it's a different experience completely different I'm a fucking giant proponent for bare-knuckle I really think they should go to bed I just can't well I never passed that now we passed that but you're not because the fingers are all loose look you saw this fight this weekend with the eye gouges yeah let's talk about that look at this oh there goes baby oh that's the extension he's yeah idea how to get out of either this is right here this is fucks bill that's a long finish a flap superfox bill that's it that's a fucked up arms fire broken probably broken yeah that's intense which act is that jacked why not he's on Bart and Randy fucking coat or baculum day yeah I remember when he threw these nasty leg kicks from the butt scoot position so first time ever saw somebody throw real good leg kicks from the buttons musician gypsy that I'm standing over him yeah but dude he would skip forward on his hand and slam that leg like real power in the leg kicks like dangerous leg kicks but not thrusts like radical kicks yeah he would like but scoot forward and roundhouse kick him in the legs and it's like whoa this is dangerous what was your take on that Matthew's Ling Jing fight look dude those that's me look at my little cute little face there's those fucking eye gouges our bullshit man they are my only thing with that and I'm not condoning this cheap but it's like I don't know if you knew what it was poking you know but when you're in when you're the oxygen to your brain is getting cut off you can't let a guy get away with that he'll do it again that's the ref yeah but as my fighters like do any live fight another day yeah but you don't do that way you tap champions I'm sure it's straight-up cheating for sure just shady it's fucking cheating and they should take points away from him he should be sanctioned they should sell them if this ever happens again if we ever think that you're gonna do this again we're gonna kick you out of school out of the league the stadium give them a really a warning we're gonna kick out of the UFC they did nothing can't guard out someone's eyes when they're Cho they did nothing yeah it happened quicker than I thought maybe if I watched it again fuck sakes man I mean it felt like the eyes were in there let's watch it real quick cuz it felt to me like the fingers are in there for long enough for him to know the think Matthews about it what does I get it man it's fight or flight and you're just trying to do if you cannot to tap and the great thing is that you know I get it I think most fighters can understand how it happened right I had a coach lease your bunk oh dude you get kind of submission you know guilty you take your finger Roman right up in his asshole he goes because they might take a point away being live to fight another round you know tapped out asshole pokken yeah check that oil son sort of tap it out knuckle deep you know I tell you who impressed me the most this weekend style bender yeah dude that was some next-level shit some great fights man style bender put on a show man I was I've been telling people about him for a long time man there's a lotta guys cooking fight of the night too I you know I thought um you know I'll see you all look great and after you look fucking bleep okay Joe looked amazing yeah there's some amazing fights it was very good whole night style benders a fucking handful for everybody everybody everybody there there's a lot of dudes practicing their double legs now do you know who's kind of an oddball you know it's got to drop the ball and I'm again I'm on this English bandwagon right now on the train is Darren till like the hype and set him up man names waiting there's all this hype I know it's like the public's like alright dude let me tell you something he's gonna be even better they see him again he's better but we have short memories the public is short men don't remember Booker men don't remember the problems you must fight get or Nelson does does he yeah that's the fight they booked it right when is that for now they want to because I thought they're trying to do it in London but for whatever reason didn't happen Oh major they announced the London card without a headline you can add until headline that I don't know why that's not happening well you can't headline after one fight I could hand Lyon Liverpool are you talking about a fight night a fight and I never pull okay he's rum yeah what I mean I mean I think the dude should be pay-per-view they should make that motherfucker star for sure put him on a big pay-per-view card come on Fox yeah it's true me Stevens rich Emmett dude Jeremy Stephens goddamn him and join watching Jeremy Steven me too but for you if Stevens or Semin as the headliner you can fucking put Darren till of the headliner here it is boom I think it's in here I couldn't find a video okay you hit him with the right hand it was a great fight man this is a takedown we'll just count the so three I mean slow-motion way is just digging in that dudes eyes yeah there's no question I know you got a no question about it they drop the bomb that is that that's not Goddard Oh whoever it is the referee fuck doesn't that ref has some play it here's the thing we have the video of it the UFC should do something someone should do something in the athletic commission so much to do something even maybe in Nevada you got look at that and go hey man you can't ever do this again and we have to find you and we have to say if you ever do be suspended you should be suspended and if you ever do this again you get you're out you can't gouge someone's eyes they lose their fucking vision we can't have any leniency whatsoever towards intentional eye gouging see what John Jones and striking I don't touch you know I mean look he's definitely a now can i you're right look I think I'm a 1-point proponent I think every time an eye poke happens whether it's intentional or not take away a point going to I think it's a good move I think every time it happens we okay watch the groin case because I changes the dynamics of that fight every time I bring kicked in the nachi Asik your stomach not trying to fight there's there's literally no warnings if you do it there's a point whether it's intentional or not each should begin at the point taken away I just like that I think it's grounds for disqualification I just don't think you can allow any room for that blinded guys are gonna get blinded I mean it could happen and if someone if some most guys are completely ethical they would never think of doing this but if a god wanted to they start poking people in the eye on purpose and Roberto Duran did that with Davy Maury thumbed him well remember I'm not saying purpose from our trash around Matt Mitrione Travis is winning that round yeah when in the fight and he gets point two nine that they can't see it's a different dynamic you loses the fight it's happened in many many fights thank God man one but I think there should be no tolerance if it happened to me do we take a point honey just nuts we take a point 100% I think kicking their nuts first of all we should really make sure that the guys are wearing either a tie steel cup or some multi scale cup is like that probably shouldn't be allowed to wear yes then that's worse than all in trouble it's a problem with arm bars right as a fulcrum yeah it gives you extra leverage but I don't think they stop people from wearing it no like Kenny Florian that's what he used to wear that's old-school but yeah but that look dude if you can catch someone though you know Jamie am I put on a steel cup you in trouble fuck yeah man no shit right but those things break sometimes those cords whoa Michael Bisping remember who was he fighting when is fika broke was that Anders is it GSP or was it answered GSP get the GSP here stuff it in his underwear and it's bouncing around this cock and balls yep that's not what you want you don't need that look no you don't want that in your life that steel cup just loosely banging around against your balls hoping thinking this Jake won that fight this there's no controversy with I pokes I don't yeah like if he did win that fight then I got a problem I was thinking of Jake Shields and there are who smart pause remember that yeah that's another horrible horrible incident of eye poking there should be no there's no warnings no tolerance no time I think if you tell John and listen you touch his eyes man we're taking points yeah he didn't close his hands there should be way more cautious everybody right if you've got a free ride to just keep your hand out like that and push guys off by getting your fingers deep in their eyeballs which many guys have done inadvertently but if you know for a fact if you do that you're gonna have to take a point away you're gonna close your fist up 100% of the time but also if it happens more than once you got a problem I'm not saying do on purpose but your style is a problem yeah Hertford Jinling I get why he was like what fight fight and he's he's trying to get out of it I get that in the heat of the moment and I'm giving that bitch still take a point away right there's just this should be process 100% and when you're doing that you know you're cheating when you're doing that trying to get out you're supposed to tell you know you the tap or you don't tap but if he got out of that headlock or that gate down rather yeah but if you got out of it because the I poke the I poke kept him some are another from hanging on longer that's fucked up and it's cheating yeah it's not cheating when I put on a fight see if you can find style bender style bender man don't you think with the UFC and I know it's it's sanctioned by state to state and when you know with like Eve Levine and a maza Mario Yamasaki where Dana's like he's never we don't want him reffering ever again and they don't have a lot of that power I almost feel like the UFC needs to start maybe get away it's gonna be fucking nightmare so it's a long path to go down but dealing with these Commission's they almost have too much power you know I'm saying well in some ways I could see that but in other ways I could see how you wouldn't want to give the power to the organization you have to give it to the sanctioning bodies that are in the states and but they all have to catch up look it's a fairly recent thing if you think about the amount of decades they've been doing baseball and football I mean right we're using the boxing commissions that's the thing right and a lot of these commissions or not that experience with MMA we saw that with at new york when we first started doing in New York do we right I mean this was they just legalized it and then they brought it in there's a lot of guys that were local didn't really weren't that good wow I almost feel like if the UFC had you know the Performance Center if they had a judging center referee Center and they kind of built their own then sent them out to the Commission that's a good idea that's a smart idea but the problem is the question would be are they independent you know you have to be independent right so like Dana White has got to be able to probably shit on you but you you got to be able to keep that from getting you fired they're still independent I'm just saying the UFC because it's judging is such a big fat brush sport judging is different than refereeing right but that's really an even bigger problem perhaps because at least life agrees yeah the referees seem to have more training and know what they're doing there's some there's odd judging that you just go horrible well no I'm saying roughing in judge and listen because it really impacts a sport he said alright we'll put a little money into this we're gonna train you guys on the sport and then put you out to the commissions where your own body st. sanctioned body her style bender versus Wilkinson you know waiting times in a year you know that 20 times in a year in Japan or some shit he's so slick he does got a page a little bit interesting no I don't think so man no no I'm saying as far as his style his demeanor see not not as far as the weirdness is much more classic than page pages like a wild more of a karate sport point fighter who has ridiculous power but with Israel is just vicious technical strike his movement he chops at you he knows what you're doing before you doing it and he's doing a lot of faints man see that see that but obviously that you see that the right leg and then the jab pops one two dude that's some high level shit but look how he goes from South Paul to true north oh yeah I'm sank and fourth compromised it and again he's not as lucy and dynamic is Michael venom page but his movement and a lot of the angles that he's using remind me Michael page but he has better wrestling better grappling better take than defense well the big thing is his striking is pure like more time correct when you're watching greatest moving hind up he uses some toy type right you some karate then he goes he's very fluid that but look at that fucking knee dude this is some high level shit and this guy just wants to take him down - and he's a nightmare to deal with he threw this fucking fake kick and then pop the jab and with zero there's no wind up you know there's no telegraphing at all everything's firing in straight and clean and if he can keep these guys off him in terms of his takedown defense he's a dangerous guy takedown defense looks pretty damn good to me what did he weigh in at oh he's a perfect middleweight cuz he's not telling a ton of weight did he weigh 186 or did he weigh 185 did he take advantage of that extra pound that's where things get interesting you know that's not a crown cut for him though well if it's not a crazy cut for him god damn dude I mean this father could escape down the fence it's pretty impressive a little bit but he's fighting guy he is already fucked up the first round was trying the exact same shit though right not keep him down that's true looks like you I'm saying how Lucy is yep look at that need is a monster it's just the combinations what he's doing is just taking this guy apart it's he's faking he's moving and it's all super technical like there look at this man come on this is like you the guy moves towards him and he backs up perfectly and then punishes him more and I like that he's he's a seasoned vet when you look at his record what they're trying to do to him in Japan that these four matchups come on he's gonna be a problem he's gonna be a problem big problem everybody is confident yeah and then you who do you want to fight because I don't care about beat all these guys whoever wants to come get it let me know yeah I've been talking to him for years man when I started fighting in China I started talking to on Instagram I'm like when he's thinking about coming into the you have seen he so I come I'm in no rush I'll come in when I'm ready he's fucking already yeah I met him at a UFC maybe three years ago maybe four this guy's been I mean this is just this is just punishment the referees there's so many good fight for him at Middle East I mean this is a get middleweight there's look it stopped the fuck that's a night yeah that's enough he's trying man nobody's trying but it getting fucked up like that anyways that heavyweight fight first of all the guy who's fighting that the biggest thing I've ever seen he just would not leave dude they just stop this he look like a bad guy from True Lies he would not go it yes collapse yeah I mean look here whatever he gave himself I think a C - yeah that part C - yeah because he's that good that's no joke man well you see he's a nightmare he just got knocked out like last year in a kickboxing match in Brazil games talking about it like real openly online about well that's interesting first time I we knocked out you know it's interesting the we talked about the way hands that I was like wow this guy's got a very you're guilty getting knocked out he loves it this is greatest thing that ever happened to him use this guy's so 12 in MMA powerful New Zealand on the map 12 and oh and MMA and if you bring up his kickboxing record I want to find out whose it was that made him some I don't know even know and what organization it was I want to say it was some organization look at all these fights though bro know of the last two losses kickboxing there Kent kickboxing make that larger and see what the Brazilian guys name is in glory Alex Pereira oh it's in glory dude Alex Pereira is a fucking beast but I think that was a Alex we don't I think that was a decision yeah ko okay that's the fight yeah that's the fight and glory of Heroes seven was that in Brazil quick on that yeah okay that was the fight that he talked about on Instagram but listen Alex Pereira is a fucking killer he's marking him twice which beat him twice how did he beat him in that fight decision right so he beaten my decision the nikkei Odom that's just shows you how good Alex Pereira is look there's a few guys that are over there that if they just learn how to fucking stuff tank downs Giorgio Petrosyan might be fucking everybody give it a night nobody wants any of that shit if that guy figured out how to stuff takedowns this kids takedown and grapple and look too impressive man yes it does and he's gonna get better I mean he's young I think it's really only 25 how old is he 28 okay young enough but he's young enough where he has a base for grappling day for sure that's where he's gonna give the other middleweight division man yeah he's a motherfucker to fight he's he's very dangerous on feet and he's not sitting still chances keep going back now I see that motherfucker fight well we could easily see til in him easily good ok till easily could be moving up to 185 he's huge giant and with these new and potent positions on weight classes you know where they're trying to encourage people to fight have your weight class in California you have to do it ya know what's still a suggestion apparently are you sure yep yep so it askin said there's no Nowitzki Nowitzki said it's still I saw the Boston I tell you this no I was walking to my seat and he goes I'm walking by he goes come on shop I like that like oh shit cold snitch he started laughing I went dude and I finally get time but I love it ski by the way I love you knew it look at Jeff and I go dude I'm not I wasn't trying to be diminishing like I respect the shit ID is it's all good man it's funny I loved in Vince he too but I also loved Lance Armstrong I have a real conflict I love Lance Armstrong that's why would you like when divinsky comes on the podcast already went after him in a sport where everybody was dirty yeah that's tough I mean come on it's tough I'm Switzerland on this on the fun guys I fucking think it is goddamn hilarious that they say that Lance Armstrong didn't win those Tour de France's they take his name off of it when the the guy on the list who tested Nate didn't test positive for steroids if you go back to a guy who never got popped you got to go to 18th place spot so that means everyone he's racing with is geared up to who gives a fuck correct Ville correct but yeah I mean that's what happened Bordeaux exactly who cares well they've been watching any of this Olympics no kind of balls deepening man I'm not even touched it I'll watch it at night might smoke a little weed and I'm just so memorized by a lot of it men Ikaros got me dude I watched that documentary I'm like this is just some crazy shit these people are doing and I started thinking about it and the really the thing that really made me start thinking about it was why the fuck are they not paying these athletes this show is gigantic it's worth billions of dollars where's that money going why are those people getting paid and the fucking athletes on the fucking night and I know it cost a shit ton of money to put on those shows I know it does absolutely not as much as the springboard way oh come on these organizations are raking in millions and millions of dollars the athletes aren't getting a penny of it the two most corrupted things on in America are all around the world the Olympic sports and call college football dude cause guys it's so fun college basketball in college football especially because they're taking damage it's essentially a combat sport in a lot of ways right I mean you're running at each other you're trying to do war trying to get your fuckin football across the line they're trying to stop you you got a team of aggressors going after their team you're clashing into each other fight in college go baby fight yeah 12 to 14 times a year yeah and you can't if I can't hit each other in terms of punches and kicks but you're running at each other full blast wearing helmets each other harder to do whole body he's your body like a spare to Jamie showed me highlight reel it dudes getting ko'd in football done in Reverse oh it's horrible it's the reverse thing I'm not a big fan of I'd rather watch it my brain has a heart my stupid brain is hard time processing yeah I don't see how when I watch it in full speed or in slow motion you see how the impact we see the helmets flyable see the dudes laying on the ground their eyes rolled back in their head it's a different level of ko2 it's a running chaos level to this game and so like in the Super Bowl homeboy got knocked the fuck out in the Super Bowl it's malicious man it's Chris what's weird I'd let my son play football not let him fight that is weird it's weird right because football you know he could get to get into Stanford get an education fighting it's it's true dude and you're sure as fuck not coming out of you know you don't hear and fighting this corner out of the Palisades you know I'm saying it's not that's true but he could be a great jiu-jitsu fighter if he hates money yes he could do jiu-jitsu dedicate his life to though I don't you just dedicate yourself to coming up with a jiu-jitsu league that's profitable I guess I can take some time and do that if jiu-jitsu gets more and more popular like how much it would already Joe what does I don't necessarily know if it's done ah it would it would have kicked come by now really I think so I think it's more popular than ever what I want to know what is more popular I think that I also think it might be you know I don't think it's never gonna be like a mainstream like big like guys making millions of dollars mm-hmm already hit well EBI is probably the biggest one for sure it's the best program by far the best program to watch for sure because we start noting the way they have the the over time system but do people know enough about it to appreciate it it takes too much time to invest and know in the sport what about combat people care combat jiu-jitsu is way easier I just watch fuckin in them because you see bitch-slap watch anime if I want to see hitting on the ground that's true but I feel like it's a lab for learning what techniques are applicable to MMA before you actually get into MMA basically all the same principles apply if you could slap submitting the face you cease like we're okay in this position this guy's very open the face for slap so if this was punches it'd be a way worse situation for him and some guys can get stopped with slaps like Wagner Rocha dude who did he stopped he stopped but but when you think when you think about from thing about the crowds booing during a UFC fight when it goes to the 301 like could be could be thanked beating the shit out so honesty based like you're booing Francis and steep anyway he's beating the shit I'm now thinking about jiu-jitsu where it's slapping like it's never gonna correlate to the mass it's just not I enjoy watching it I'm a weirdo well you know what's interesting though they didn't boost khabib cuz khabees mauling was so terrifying that you realized like nobody was like boom turning them up standing them up no cuz khabib is just beaten the shit out of them the entire time their dance beating the shit on but if you look at the viewership on that it's not crazy where people are like no one's going you gotta tune into this guy's beatin the shit wait a minute is it a pay-per-view wasn't it pay-per-view that fire what was that fire what fight was that those Gettysburg lows and who else was on this I called the fight so it had to be pay-per-view correct who else was there might have been on no it was announced on the car right yeah it was a good one what is it on 219 says - was it the December 1 was it the co-main event yeah this is a phenomenal fight was that cyborg that was cyborg yeah cyborg vs Holly Holm in the final correct is that what it is pretty sure is that it come on to punchy's but still like you know I'm saying like 400,000 people saw that so pay for the paper you know one's called like dude you gotta tune in this this Russian or cuz where's he from Kazakhstan Dagestan Dagestan is beating the shit out of Brazilian like it's just not that doesn't translate like a Forrest Griffin Stephan Bonnar fight unfortunately well you have to tune in by this pay-per-view see it's way easier to get especially when it's a co-main event already man it's hard to get people to buy in that late in a fight like that late in the card you already made to the co-main event it's already going on what's the next fight oh it's cyborg vs Holly Holm I'm gonna watch it on the replay you know like once you already get deep in the card yeah it's a little late but it's if it's on Spike TV and you call your friend up and you go dude you got to watch these crazy white boys beat the fuck out of you you want to doing that then could be do that people aren't doing it it's not gonna I'm not calling my dad when you gotta tune in C could be beat the show this guy I don't know man I don't know if that's true because if that fight was on Fox I really feel like people would have went crazy if you saw the way khabib kept taking Edson Barboza down and Mallen up the really we were calling the ratings would side with me this year's ratings are definitely set but when it's gonna be fought on Fox he's that fights on he's at fights he hasn't always fights haven't been on pay-per-view yeah who's had fights on fs1 right like narrow torture when you fight him on he's had some fights not his fighting style isn't the type of fighting style where it crosses over to the masses we love them cuz beating the shit out of people on the ground he's also one thing that people love and that's undefeated undefeated I think he's 18 to know so it's not a scream though like a bigger shot in the UFC his last two fights before or the fight before Michael Johnson he fought dos anos and Horcher were both live see on fox events and how it is rating interesting and he be back out at dos Anjos he did makes off of it yeah and Horcher was a real last-minute substitution I mean real what about him what about Michael Johnson with that Fox where he's telling them to 6205 okay that was a terrible one now Jim he's telling you he'll give up his shot out of a monster bang it's a fucking killer son but he needed this fight because he needed to fight where it was post weight loss bullshit like the wind the weight cut was fine with Tony he's got a real nutritionist now looked way better I'm very excited about the hydrant Tony man very very excited about dude I can't find a venue to do a show it's too late what
