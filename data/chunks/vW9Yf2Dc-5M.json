hello freak bitches I'm just something has hit the internet that I don't know need to show you I guess it may or may not be legit but I've decided to tae-young thanks to the cheese catches later Conor McGregor he's trolling do you think so fuck yeah a lot of people have been hitting me up telling me to show you and yeah no one knows what's cool he's decided to retire young which means like 34 eventually listen man unless he got fuckin head kick today and knocked into oblivion the idea that he's going to go out on a loss like that to Nate Diaz look he's got plenty of cash if he wanted to retire young and step away I mean I guarantee you he probably made somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 million bucks with a Josie Alda fight he probably made more than that for the Nate Diaz fight I wouldn't I would imagine after he spent a fuckload of it he's probably still got a few million bucks laying around he's a hero in Ireland he could always make money could always run a gym and be fine but if I had a guess doesn't make any sense the only reason why I would make sense the only reason why it would make sense is Connor had actually thought about retiring from MMA before he got the call for the UFC there was a point in time where he had some friends that were experiencing some serious health issues from fighting and then most recently that young man from the Portuguese guy died in an MMA contest which I think took place in the UK wasn't I know well he involved or related in some way to one of those guys that just died too didn't he know him or trained with them I think he trained with the Portuguese guy that just died recently it is entirely possible in that sense but if I had a guess there's no way he'd do it like this
