Wow or something yeah yeah my buddy from Australia gave me those in that head it's the Asian water buffalo it's an invasive species like we live oh it worked Jesus Christ ladies and gentlemen do you have see performance institute boys hey what's Duncan for script hey Forrest Griffin good to see you we've already talked over each other yeah guarded bloated yeah we've got it we've got it nailed well I'm really glad you guys are here because I've I was blown away when I went to visit the you know you here the performance Institute you go what is this gonna be like you go there like oh my god they thought of everything it's like the ultimate state-of-the-art facility for training for recovery for for nutrition it's fucking amazing I mean it was great we're posting a link to that shit right say I mean it's it's amazing when we went on a tour and check that place out I think was a delle grazie a was with me yeah yeah we were like holy shit like you imagine you have access to this fucking place like you guys have really created something special it's very interesting and I don't know much about other sports but I know this never really existed in combat sports before something like this that's I mean you guys have athletes from all sorts of different walks of life come through there when I was there there was many many top-level fighters that were training out of there it's really really interesting yeah cool well we appreciate the kind words obviously and I mean ultimately yet that the the vision of the UFC was to build a performance Institute that was truly a a world-class high performance center that had everything that fighters would would need and but not only are we trying to align ourselves as the leaders in mixed martial arts but certainly leaders in human high performance yes I can tell people what you do there explain yes my role is the vice president of performance and I essentially direct the the philosophy of how we're going to interact with the fighters how we're going to support the fighters and obviously manage our our world-class staff that they're working with in the performance facility and Clint you you came from a background in amateur wrestling yep and tell everybody like what your job is over there yep so I'm the director of performance nutrition so anything related to feeding of athletes is essentially managed by myself and in our ever-expanding team so it can be as broad as working with athletes for their general training plan integrating within the other performance services as well as feeding athletes on the ground integrating within our kitchen at the Performance Institute supporting athletes as they prepare for for fight week weight descents etc and then supporting athletes on fight week and preparing at that even at the last moment of fight day to fuel up and to be really well fueled for for their performance my background is like you said in amateur wrestling I wrestled and coached at Cornell University graduated no.3 was on the US national team with a number of actually current fighters right now so Cormier Daniel Cormier and a number of other athletes Chris Weidman and some others and I used to train together and then I went back to school and got all my my credentialing to be a registered dietician and so that's kind of led me through developing a program at Cornell to the UFC with a you know pretty unique combination of the nutrition the Dietetics and and then obviously the experience in combat sports and weight cutting yeah and in my opinion the most grueling combat sport I mean I think wrestling's just we talked about on the last podcast it's just it's crazy way for a kid to learn hard work and to learn real competition and thus the the actual physical struggle of getting to wrestling practice and strength and conditioning drills most kids that are coming up in high school and in college they don't really work that hard in any other sport I mean it's it's a crazy sport I remembered in high school like walking into the wrestling room and it's a bunch of gross dudes like in a sweaty hot room and then it was like basketball is right next to it I walk because the basketball there's like news in ten tops and some like cheerleaders I'm like I know what I'm doing no I mean it's my opinion still I think it's the most important skill because you get to dictate where the fight takes place I mean there's no one skill that really overpowers all except for the ability to hold the guy down like the ability to hold someone down and control them on the ground it's so critical and everything else you can learn from that submissions ground-and-pound but the difference in like an elite wrestler like yourself and a person who doesn't have that skill it's it's so hard to bridge that gap it's hard to learn later in life yeah he's one of the few people it's just like I'll just take this up and be amazing because I'm GSP and then I'll become a gymnast who knows I think that's a thing with him though he had such physical abilities we were talking about this almost on the last podcast as well that he used to do that karate blitz you know so he was he was so used to that lunging in stuff that he sort of incorporated that with a blast double and he's so physically strong and such a smart dude and so so good at learning things they just figured out the tech the the essential techniques and he needed a master and just got better and better at him way back in the day obviously UFC one was kind of discipline versus discipline kind of grudge match and having been a lifelong wrestler that's when I started tune in actually and taking pride and all the wrestlers taking names and and grown within the sport and obviously with the evolution of the sport it's it's a different dynamic and obviously each athlete coming from their own discipline is really fun for us to work with as practitioners having their own kind of sport culture but wrestling is a obviously a core component to what each athlete is doing and when I'm working with athletes and talking through their weekly training plan and you know how to feed and fuel for each of these types of training sessions and hearing them bitch about how hard those wrestling practices are I always get a little bit a little bit of pride they're like yes it is hard and imagine doing it for eight months straight for a college wrestling season and grind that out but it's it's definitely been fun for me to watch wrestling as a component of MMA grow and and be able to contribute to to the sport on it on a few different yeah I mean I think the way I've always looked at it as pressure makes diamonds you know this is no other way those those those hard-nosed dudes they come out of those environments they like if you think about guys with crazy determination and mental fortitude there's a giant chunk of those you could attribute to wrestlers there's a lot of them in kickboxing and everything else as well but there's just seems to be it's such a unique sport in terms of hardening like your mental toughness fishel I mean I mean we at the performance Institute we always talk about martial mixed martial arts MMA this is the decathlon of combat sports yeah and I think you know our philosophy is to try understand all the respective components that makes a world-class MMA fighter and I think you know if you're in the UFC you've got some certain X factors and that allow you to be world-class and you know wrestling is a huge component of that but what we try to do is understand the limitations as well because in the decathlon you're only ever as good as your weakest event right right so if you're a striker if you're grappler or if you're a wrestler and you know we're trying to support each of those to understand how we can elevate the whole thing now how much input do you put into fighters if any into how they incorporate their skills and like how they combine their skills together that you guys offer like coaching on technique I mean yeah so break down the philosophy we don't do sports specific coaching so physical therapy sports and nutrition strength and conditioning sports science and then Duncan oversees all those to make sure that they work all right so our philosophy anything that doesn't make you in the better in the Octagon is pretty pointless so what what I do is I'll just go over what your training schedule looks like with you and then you know where do we feed accordingly for this practice you know what and then Grohmann our sports scientists Wendy can you be recovered enough for this practice and that's you know that's the philosophy so it's not specific if you think about it if you guys are fighting and the performance Institute's working with both you we'd make you as big strong healthy have the easiest time making weight go into your fight as fueled as you can but if I start saying hey you know what yeah he's pretty susceptible to light kicks then it becomes you know now we can't support every athlete so when you talk to people it's just like here's how to get the most out of your practices right here's the way to lay this out to just your training blocks I don't think a lot of people understand like basic training periodization leading up to a fight and then that's the other problem with the EOC you don't always have eight weeks 10 weeks 12 weeks sometimes you got four weeks and it's like alright well where's your where's your weight where you at where's your skill where's your conditioning how can we put those things together in time to get you ready on you know but never specific like instruction on how to deal with a certified or not that's it's almost like for a young fighter to have the access first of all just access to the the physical facility like just all the different modalities you guys have and you know the strength and conditioning stuff and the the fact that you can one of the most impressive things the press of things was the camera set up around the Octagon so that you could film sparring sequences and technique sequences and the fighter you can back them up and rewind them and watch it and you can Co see how you drop your leg here see how your you know your your chin is up in the air and all these different different little facts are you think about the philosophy right you have to get close to game speed once or twice a week so for 15 25 minutes you're gonna get you're gonna risk injury you're gonna take physical damage that you're not getting paid for make the most out of it right let me review it treat it like a fight think about our athletes they fight two to four times a year so that's that's a very limited amount of actual footage they have but if you start recording your sparring sessions and treating them like like a fight like a shot do this wrong I did that wrong then you're gonna end up with more like 80 90 which is you know baseball basketball even football you got 20-plus games to you know review yeah and I think it's really important for young fighters also to see themselves doing certain techniques like they might not notice they might think they look better than they do like it's good my coach is full of shit man and then you log film don't lie and you're like yeah okay I see what I'm doing wrong it's not hard sometimes to mimic you know without without actually seeing yourself now you guys you you've been Forrest Griffin former UFC world no one can ever take that from you sir how does it feel good thing yeah sure yeah and now I'm I'm VP of athlete development at the performance instead so it's much much more important but you still Forrest Griffin there's a lot of champions there's only one VP of athlete development change a daily don't worry you've been involved from the beginning of this right yeah yeah so it was going on about two weeks in I heard this was happening and I was like oh hey guys I I work for you I'm doing community outreach right now but I've been trying to figure out the best way to train for mixed martial arts for the last 18 years I don't know maybe give me a shot at it yeah now when you would you say that there you trying to figure out the best way is there a best way yes for everybody but everything unfortunately it's those bullshit answers everybody's different man everybody's got a different ability to work you know like that who's man might have X amount you know before he physically breaks down cuz look at him he's a fucking Ferrari right and he he needs more high-end work or you know whatever everybody's a little physically different the key is to get some subjective feedback to know hey art I'm in the red I'm good I'm not you know do you do you guys do it on heart rate heart rate variability like when you determine whether or not someone's recovered tell me away yeah I mean there's plenty of different ways to do it and the most the most basic level it's just speaking to a guy and getting subjective feedback right how you feelin is one of the best questions that we can ask an athlete but Sam yeah I mean we're blessed and were privileged with pretty high resource at the UFC Performance Institute so we have some pretty involved technologies one of the ones that we use is a system called a mega wave and that gives us a real insight and removes the subjectivity where it can get objective understanding around physiology particularly looking at and the DC potential of the brain so really yeah that's the DC potential the brain is an assessment of the autonomic nervous system yeah so if you look at if you look at the parasympathetic and sympathetic balance of your body we're talking science now I apologize but ultimately that's one of the things that's that's really impacted there you go Jamie pulled something up on the screen here John Smith see windows of trainability yeah fascinating yes and there's Omega wave oh is it something you wear yes so ultimate Sam it's a three to five minute assessment you wear something that resembles a heart rate strap lying at rest and we also have electrodes in anja on you on the third eye of your brain essentially so we're picking up cardiovascular stress and we're picking up the autonomic nervous system and we're looking at things like heart rate variability which you've already mentioned but so this isn't for everybody some people love it and they say hey man this is you know again these are just tools right so different tools for different people right yeah for sure it's uh it's a first thing in the morning measurement to two understand your your recovery your how well you recovered from the day before and those windows of trainability for the next day so I think it all comes back to what Forrest says ultimately what we're trying to do is understand individual responses right at the end of the day everyone's on a pathway of performance mastery to be a world champion and when people respond to the workloads the intensities the volumes in very different ways if we take a basketball team and put them all through the same workout you've got 15 different guys that are responding in very different ways to the same workout hmm so we're privileged in that we work with an individual sport and that's how that's how a mantra is that we're looking every single athlete is an individual and we're building our programs programming strategies in our information in an individual way so you guys have been doing this now for how many years we're coming up on two years on May 22nd it's our second anniversary and do you do you have like a log of all the different cases you've worked with so you can kind of review like what methods were more effective than others and you're constantly trying to improve this protocol or yes you guys how do you guys write it all out I mean we've obviously been involved with numerous fight camps but we're also working with fighters a not in camp and last year we presented this journal our first journal which is a overview a cross-section of all the data that we accrued in our first 12 months and we continue to aggregate that data now one of the privileges that we have at the Institute is we get the opportunity to work with just under six hundred fighters on our roster and so we can create real clear cross sectional awareness of what different weight classes look like what the challenges are to a fighter and then you know the fighters can compare and contrast themselves against their immediate peers in their weight class so that's one of the most powerful benchmarking tools you can create this soar mega wave technology when people buy that oh yeah it's just a commercial product off the shelf and it would it looks like it worked off an app like you put an app on your yelling yeah yeah doesn't everything yeah seems like a thank you but again we use many different types of technologies you know things like force plates can can look at neural muscular responses and some of our nutrition variables will change across time so it's not just one tool that is given us all the answers that the windows of trainability concept is something that really helps us a day-to-day basis to understand can you go into a strength or power type session today and really maximize the opportunity to create that app tations another day that you're enduring it might be an endurance emphasis so what it allows us to do is just give give kind of kudos and credence to the athlete to understand where is the best approach and where you're gonna optimize your responses every other sport is easier to train for than MMA the thing about it I was a defensive end in high school every defensive end needs the same physical abilities you think about the combine the NFL Combine for instance they've figured out over a million years what they want to test for and like the the guys that you know they they run the same they jump the same in per position right so quarterbacks don't need to necessarily do that faster they can throw it right but for everybody else the numbers are kind of the same for our sport and they've collected I don't know I don't know how many data points this point over if it's a lot so they're anonymized normalized so you know what average looks like what you know so you can give a guy like Anthony Smith say look man if and I bring him up because he's mentioned it before he's been outspoken about you know working with the P I hey you know what your force power measurements man they're pretty average for 205 you're not you're not a weak guy you know you could think about going up a weight class so it's just objective information so the athletes and hopefully their coaches can make those choices do you think that would benefit from more weight classes oh that's a great question so I thought how 65 you know look at the percentages and then you know I was talking to actually Dana and Sean and those well this guy's gonna go to 65 this guy's gonna be over 65 everybody's gonna go to or is it gonna help I mean there needs to be a percentage difference but I don't know I think people would just say well shit now I have to do an extra five pounds but again so from a PI standpoint that's not really a decision we have to make what we need to do is collect as much data as we can on that for individual fighters 12 figure which and then also to provide that information to you know third party commissions it's just so many what does the job see are these days I'm very Sokka it's okay I know what you don't like why not from 85 to 205 that's 20 pounds that is an enormous jump so how do you decide like one of guys a tweener like how do you look at a guy who maybe weighs 215 and you go to him dude that those the numbers like what's your plan what's your speed like are you a good athlete for that weight class off right not you what's your arm length how does that you know how does your arm length and the way you fight right so you know if you're Tyson s guy you can have short arms and you Russell got like a gram a nerd style right that's five you don't need super long arms but you know if you're not a wrestler you don't have that head movement maybe you do anyone we've actually had a number of athletes I would say over the last year come to us specifically and sometimes it's matchmakers who were saying hey this guy wants to go down come come take a look meet with the PI staff see what see what you guys think all those things that Forrest said are really valid we do have a lot of battery of tests both in the nutrition space around body composition around metabolic function oftentimes bad weight cuts will diminish and depress the metabolic rate the resting metabolic rate as well as as it progresses over time through through training and then like we said some of the energy systems a lot of the strength and power Diagnostics how does an athlete compare to the norms and the standards that are set for that division so first thing is the first thing that I look at is how to out of how does their body fit into a division everybody's body is broken into three components if you think about it in terms of bone muscle and fat and if somebody's fat free mass it's everything except for their their fat is 90 you know is bigger than 99% of the athletes in that weight division it's not going to be a good fit so a big thing is benchmarking and understanding how somebody's body fits into their division compared to others so that's kind of step one then we look through all these other different metrics to see how they compare and then we have a conversation so if my job is never especially working with independent contractors they can use us or they can they cannot and we are a resource to consult and to have conversations with them about what makes sense on a scientific level can I ask you how that works is like if save someone like Henry cejudo so I'm going to do his camp yep at the UFC Performance Institute how would they schedule it with you guys tell you I'm gonna be here for eight weeks we've set up camp in Vegas we'd like to do it at the at the gym so it happens all the time where there's whether it's a week or eight weeks that filters into every single member of our team especially as we're doing more and more on the ground at fight events but that gets filtered up to Duncan and then Duncan handles the the coordination of that yes that could literally be there with say if he was gonna fight Marlin more eyes they literally could be in the performance Institute at the same time Fisher and that that happens I mean you know we're a split-level facility where they're never in the same zone at the same time you know see you scheduling I wouldn't be doing MMA in the Octagon with your schedule them first-come first-serve do you ever anticipate a problem like with guys that are supposed to be fighting each other you know like what just happened with Maz Badal recently like we're an actual fist fight breaks out man you find most of these guys want to get paid to fight not pay to fight right but when you see like cameras aren't on they're not so that fight we yeah that's true right when the cameras aren't on and the other thing is when you're leading into a fight my thought was you cannot let that person think they intimidated you and if that means you actually have to hit them maybe it does but the the you know the idea is that I can't let you think that you have a mental advantage right in any other sport so we know I ever want to see that like this is like you have stopped that but in fighting it's like oh they're just doing extra fighting yeah yeah like if it's a basketball player sucker punch is another basketball player in the face it's some sort of a press conference like that like Maz Badal did I mean you'd be like what no way but in fighting like Ali did extra fighting to do honest people for that performance was going to get extra money's stunning knockout of Darren Till was one of the top guys in the welterweight division the weight ko-dan was crazy so he got it from that and then to tee off on Leon Edwards after the fight like that it's like another one like that's part of that it's very good for him unfortunately like I don't want him to do that I don't want to encourage but if you want to think about like a fighters popularity build in there Bradley he's an I don't give fuck I'll punch you in the face guy and like well a lot of people are now he's a real and I don't give a fuck I'll punch you in your face guy they're real they're really exist and he's a world-class fighter like that's a that's sellable that's unfortunate I wish guys wouldn't ever fight at press conferences like Cormier and John Jones I fucking hated that but tell me that didn't sell more tickets no don't that's sold a shitload more tickets how many times they throat show cause you're on that dolly oh how many times they show that even in the promos I hated when that happened it was a terrible thing that Connor did that got damn that's awesome and that's a that's a fine line right yeah people that weren't even involved got cut yeah I don't I can't mean that I mean using it promoted yes yes yes we just tried to avoid it and hide it or do we let people know that this is a real thing they call all all people involved go looked is the business we're gonna get paid okay we're gonna run it we're gonna run it every 15 minutes we're gonna show that dolly smash oh and that's will Harris's company is that the the gentleman what is it what is it called not to me of a fighter yes that's his YouTube show that I often thought was a UFC show I didn't even know that he had his own show there's so many good guys right now that are putting out good content and it's well Harrison and he came in here with komaru smart super nice guy but his uh his footage is the his that was his footage that dolly smashing it the window so the thing you see over and over again thank will I think the embedded guys from the UFC were on the bus as well so they got the inside Jesus Christ you know hey listen man this is how the show works it goes off the rails occasionally it is what you guys have set up though is kind of an unprecedent thing in the combat sports world but he's never anything like this for boxing your boxers can go and it's closest to the Olympic model so we went around benchmarking yada yada 60-plus facilities and you notice like a lot of the people that we hired worked with you know International Olympic sports and that's kind of our athlete model right so Olympic athletes they might go to Colorado Springs for two weeks or for four months or for a week and do like a skills camp or something first we have the same out you come in three four days and then go home with like a program you know a diet right addition program PT program your training load goals etc so you'd leave with that right and then maybe you know you can't you don't wanna move your life to Vegas you got family kids back home so you come out three days every other month and they can actually monitor and tell you this is how your trainings going it's just again just data on whether it it's working or not working as opposed to my old boxing coach oh not today kid I don't but it's good I don't know yeah the scientific approach of getting those little extra percentage points of improvement is really what it's all about and it could really be the difference and it's such a crazy sport because it's so wild and unpredictable and you mean you could speak to this better than anybody the results may vary right it is a wild goddamn sport I had one of the best camps I ever had was a Keith Jardine didn't go so well I was fucking amazing in the gym I was like I am so good right now I beat everybody up this is raise it but you know is a 14-week camp yeah our fallen party there's no other sport with as many degrees of freedom as mixed martial arts right our execution well there's a stylistic background white classes and you don't even know when Dana's gonna give you a call to the next fight let's let's look at Usain Bolt right you there's a reason why Usain Bolt is 100 meter champion and he's not the 60 meter champion all right our guys if you look at mixed martial arts that is six to thirty six seconds of high-intensity work followed by two to three times as much low intensity work repeated throughout a five minute round 77% of fights are won in those high-intensity efforts right so that's where the fight is won and lost but you don't know if that six seconds is gonna be the first six seconds of the fight or the last six seconds of the fight so Usain Bolt knows that he's going 100 100 meters all right our guys don't know if there needs to be the the best data the best finish yes so you got to prepare for everything so all these degrees of freedom these very external variable things that come in to mix martial arts make it the most complex bullet to figure out and build a structure and a development pathway again it's so interesting to that so many different fighters have a completely different approach like you've got low volume high-power approach like maybe your tyron woodley and then you got a guy like Nick Diaz who just smothers guys he just stays on you and keeps punching you and talking shit to you and he sees you starting to lose your breath and it keeps coming after you and he can push a pace because of his long term cardiovascular condition right I mean it's it's and you can't tell him he's doing it wrong no not everybody's doing it sometimes your physiology right it's gonna determine the way you fight mmm right like like the arm length of John Jones and the leg and arm length I can't fight like that cuz I'm gonna get I'm not gonna be at the end of everybody's punch just out of reach I'm gonna be getting hit by everybody if I start throwing those tips you know yeah and also it allows him in training to like get better like he's always got this so he's got this advantage he's like constantly getting better and he's also the best I've ever seen at utilizing that reach he's very good at keeping in his opponent exactly where he needs him and in in his range and then when they close up he's very good at being defensive I mean it's it's mean that's what the best fighters do right the fight where they want it to go but it's just so interesting to see that everyone does have a different approach that they make work with their body structure it's quite unique as we've looked at a lot of our physiological assessments and when you take the data and you compare and contrast for example people with grappling and wrestling backgrounds versus striking backgrounds you you can take something like power and you can differentiate between those two so all right I want to get a competitive advantage as a striker and might need to improve my strength work because the wrestlers are already stronger than me we can look at the strength characteristics and you know our data shows that those comes the guys that come from a wrestling background are far and above stronger than the strikers which you would expect right but if you look at things like can you differentiate our top 15 in the world versus the rest of the roster in that weight class it just it takes away any comparative any comparison and at the end of the day all in a complex chaos based sport skill is always going to be the best determinant of performance so we're not saying that the physiological variables aren't important to the sport of MMA but it's really hard to tease out where you need to push your strategy and where you need to optimize your training because in a in a homogeneous population of world-class fighters it kind of gets up absorbed and it becomes invisible where the differences are an important point we usually are a little more specific perhaps just told me what not to do what do though well and that's where the individualization personalization for every single athlete comes in we find their strengths and in some of their their gaps where it might be the the lowest point scoring component of their decathlon of MMA and if it's a deficiency that maybe hasn't been taken advantage of yet but we'll that's where we fill those gaps so that they can start to fill those holes and become more complete more comprehensive that might be strength power it might be energy system it may be it could be anything it could be orthopedic I mean we have where we're trying to assess every component of preparation that can support or limit that athletes performance in the cage in terms of you know how how they all those things work together it's really vital that if somebody's working on their strength and power they're not feeding their body in a way that's actually limiting their ability to perform at a high intensity training right because then that limits the the adaptation that we're looking for as a response to that training and that's that's a really critical point where nutrition fills it really is a foundation that supports the development of all the other adaptations that are required to become that complete mixed martial artist so is the strength and conditioning plan is being laid out as the physical therapy plan as the recovery plan all of those are coming to fruition the nutrition obviously is really near and dear to what I'm doing is really critical at supporting the adaptation so that we're not pulling the but you know that the athlete in two different directions in terms of the adaptation now in terms of when you take fighters and athletes into your performance Institute have you guys ever worked with young jr. like amateur mixed martial artists kids that are coming up and did you ever do stuff like that to show them like give them a peek at what it's like to see like the world-class fighters well we don't have the performance Institute in Las Vegas because we're very much aligned to supporting our current roster right and it's a facility and a philosophy that's been designed to support our current roster what we're doing in June of this year however is opening up a facility in Shanghai China and which will have a completely different business model in terms of that will be very much a developmental program for guys that aren't in the currently in the UFC so obviously we're trying to improve the talent standards in in China and develop that market and break that new territory but the mechanism to do in that is gonna be very much through talent development in the performance Institute so over there we will have MMA coaches and grappling coaches and striking coaches we don't have that in Las Vegas because we're currently working with guys are already on the roster well it's such a unique sport and the fact that even though it is one thing when you get into the UFC the paths to get there are so widely different and you really don't know what the right way is the cro cop path the right way to do it or is it Daniel Cormier path the right way to do it no one can say and different fighters will win on different nights with different styles it's the one of the only sports where your pathway in you could say that if someone is an elite kickboxer or an elite grappler that going in with that one major advantage in that one skill set could could take you very very far versus an overall game approach that some guys have where they're really good at everything right and the true specialists if you look at the day the true specialist the GSP zuv this will still hasn't necessarily risen to the top in the sport of MMA you still see guys that are stylistically they have a stylistic emphasis and that's their x-factor that keeps them at the top of the game yeah and and then there's execution which is creativity and their ability to perform under pressure their ability to maintain their cool during camp where they never over train and they they stay in a good space they stay in a good headspace enough girlfriend problems or boyfriend problems and then they get to the final night of the competition with the most in the tank and that's a that's an art in and of itself right so when you first asked about you know something I've seen that I love training partners right so bring your training partners to the O CPI and we've had I don't know six seven eight guys that came in as training partners and are now on the UFC roster so that's that's why I'm not an asshole to anyone that's cuz you never know there's also you get the chance to see these I mean every guy has to start somewhere every girl's to start somewhere you get a chance to see these people that maybe never get this invitation there and they see the holy ground what God well to your point to about the facility world-class facility the the services we would argue or even better than the facility but training partners coaches those that are on the contender series those that came through for the Ultimate Fighter they have all been able to use and to access the facility in short periods training partners can come and access the facility eat on campus strength trained with the UFC athlete use the facility upstairs and trained in the MMA space and when they get the chance then when they get the shot then they tap right into services and and it's an opportunity for us to you know essentially influence the community even before we're working with them directly which is which is a really huge component of our philosophy and really what we're looking to accomplish I think it'd be massively inspirational for the fighters to the younger yeah I mean our philosophy is to accelerate the evolution of the sport of mixed martial arts that that's in our mission statement there's everything when when you walk through the doors it's right there on the wall you know yeah and to do that too we're trying to shift the barometer in terms of not the professionalism of the sport but the expectations of fighters within the sport you look at someone like Brian Ortega and and listen what what we're not trying to do is take the wild out of the stallion right we're not trying to just push science at fighters at the end of the day these guys are world-class fighters for a reason but you can train and shape the stallion and it still has the wild at heart right so what we're trying to do is shift the barometer so there's an expectation of what a professional athlete should should really expect browner tiger has worked out in his garage most of his crit garage sorry it's a but in terms of you know what's the expectation that professional fighters should expect you know the Performance Institute demonstrates that you know not everyone can have access to it obviously but that's enough operation and it's it's where people should understand in the sport of mixed martial arts the standard as a professional fighter you can expect and it's it's so important I think that you put all these things under one roof like that and create this environment because it seems to be trickling off into other places like the the the level of training and recovery and everything is so intense and so severe that people are starting to try to mimic certain aspects of that and there are their own gyms and their own different place the problem is you can't do things in isolation all right if you just say where I'm gonna really hammer the recovery piece and forget about the nutrition piece mmm it's it's a large machine right there's cogs and all the cogs need to work together and that's what we truly feel we can offer and we we can deliver is this integral necessarily a multidisciplinary service but an entire mister plenary service where we have multiple aspects coming together to fill the whole picture of an athlete's portfolio of needs and that's what we can offer through the performances did you the other thing we want to do is figure out what the best practices are and disseminate them like we don't want to just know a bunch of stuff so we can keep it remember we want every other gym like hey here's what we've learned this is how we do our recovery take a take of it try it see if your recovery see if you want a laser bed maybe you do maybe you don't this is what we found success in you know so you wanna you know what's the point to learn something and then hiding their way yes sir and everything's about assessment so it's not one recovery modalities not one nutrition modality it's not one strength thing auditioning its assessing so then we could build that personalized approach and so here are the modalities here's the philosophy that we've developed to help optimize athlete's knees around what what what we're measuring and we're not winning fights that's that's obvious that comes with the X factors that comes from the fighters they're their passion and their commitment to their sport but what we're trying to do back back to your original question I think around this 1% is so hard to measure but what we're able to do is to help them to do it more consistently and to do it longer into their career so that they can they can optimize they can maximize their ability to train to adapt to perform and give themselves the best chance to be successful on fight night yeah there must be so many fighters that come from discipline whether it's judo or something on those lines and then they start fighting in MMA so they get a boxing coach and they have a few guys working with them on leg kicks but they don't have a nutrition guy and they don't have a recovery guy I don't know if someone understands like deep tissue massage they had to find that guy they got to find someone to organize a diet for them they got to figure out how to cut weight healthy proper and there's these things are so difficult for fighters to put especially you don't live in a place that has something like an American Top Team or some gigantic institution yeah I mean this fights is even top fighters on our roster might potentially hire a nutritionist for a short period of time and if I come you know for an eight-week period mm-hmm this this should be a 52-week fight we should be considering our development as fighters and as athletes professional athletes 52 months 52 weeks of the year you know I think that's right that's what our philosophy is as Clint has already talked about in terms of plug in the holes and being able to offer the services that you need as a particular athlete so there's large gyms out there American Top Team aka they've got their own guys that's that's great Jackson they've got their own people and but you know there's plenty of people on the roster that have an MMA coach and a grappling coach and that's it so the performances that you we feel we can help and support those guys do you bridge the gaps right and we're not trying to displace the the programs where athletes already have resources but I don't know of another MMA gym globally that has the capacity around assessment that we do so yeah we have we have some really great practitioners but bose and of our strength coach and his team cannot write programs for 570 athletes it's not possible but what we can do is assess those athletes provide that feedback back to their strength coaches and have conversations about how those coaches can use that data to support the development of that athlete and that that goes across the board for all of our performance services well it's a pretty amazing resource because if you're a young fighter and all you have is access to the people around you you if you're fighting the UFC you get to have access like instantaneously to this gigantic group of people where it's like it went for us when you were coming up you mean you were real pioneer I mean that was that was not available to a guy like you know I mean I the story all the time but so I was actually a little bit ahead of my time I had you know I had an actual strength coach that had letters behind his name I went to college to be a strength coach not there was like an ex bodybuilder I had you know a relatively good nutrition as to at least had a degree in chemical biology I had a good physical therapist but I didn't really have like I was my coach you know at the end of the day I was the head of performance so I'd go did you Jitsu and you know jiu-jitsu coach one should go hard and then you go kickbox but you're gonna go light but it's kick butt so you don't and then you know and now you know nobody's - the strength coach and nutritionist on different pages so I think just understanding that everything has to work together which I didn't really understand well what I'm saying is that you kind of had to pave a path because when a guy like you was doing all that stuff with a real legitimate strengthen condition coach real legitimate nutritionist how many other people were doing that at your time not that many but I got to be around good people like Randy Couture Chuck Liddell those were kind of guys I got to hang out and say well he does this he does that Chuck actually what him did how much of this stuff but rain I know what I'm doing kid all right yes sir yeah he just existed on pure savagery when you step back and look at your career like how amazing is it to be able to step off from there and do something like you're doing now for the UFC Performance Institute it was just very meaningful for young fighters when you really do get a chance to give back with your experience and your understanding of the right way in the wrong way the mistakes that you've made it's huge I mean that's the whole that I mean that's the whole genesis kind of from from my involvement in the PI like look here's the ten thousand mistakes I made yeah you're gonna make mistakes too but these are the ones you don't need to make you know again the sports changed man it's 25 years old every other sports so evolved bends around so long our sport changes all the time I forget who was talking about it but you know even the guys fighting ten years ago probably couldn't compete with gas fighting today you know but I mean what I would say is well and it's not only for the fighters Forrest is a huge resource for us the bet the best piece of technology we have is the door handle that leads from my office to to forest office right because ultimately he's a massive resource for us that are not necessarily coming from an MMA background and are trying to support the MMA community to bounce ideas off to essentially beta test things from a thought process perspective and he's a huge part of the performance institute philosophy because we can use and call upon his expertise so here's another funny thing when we were putting together the the the team for the PI I kind of shied away from people already doing MMA I wanted combat sports everybody that's done it has done judo boxing on an Olympic level they've done combat sports but I wanted like a fresh set of eyes coming from a different you know than just you know because I know really good anime strength coaches I know pretty good MMA you know you you you know good and but get get that fresh set of eyes you know nutrition actually was a little different because the rest of the world does not understand a way cut for an MMA fight it's not like it you know we go to EXO should go to any high level facility and they you say I'm gonna lose a percent of my body weight and then compete on Saturday they're like no don't just fight in the high weight class I'm like yeah that actually isn't gonna work out for me they they just won't comprehend it though I know you perform better like none so it's that's another thing about having a limited amount of weight classes when you jump up Chan is crazy man yeah he's like 174 175 on fight day yeah fighting guys 190 yeah but with a lot of energy Z yeah that's interesting is that his age O'Neil's yeah I think it's probably a good move though at his age you know I think he's back from UFC Ultimate Fighter wanted inside we knew though like on the show that he was the one that would go forever just crazy awesome is that gonna stop I mean when when he beat mickey gall that way I was I was incredibly impressed you know like this kid might test him he didn't test him at all I mean he was amazing so prime Diego Sanchez performance 15 years into the game I mean it doesn't even not even just into that's just in to the UFC yeah he had amateur fights and our professional fights rather before the UFC he's been in the UFC for 50 Chris Brown or at least 14 right 2004-2005 was yeah we shot at 2004-2005 so yeah what's that yes I'm we're somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 years just amazing that he's so enthusiastic about it still yeah they'll give him a vase for his top of his mantelpiece on his fire or something carriage clock or something just to recognize it 15 years yeah yeah that's uh that's a long time in a combat sport a long time so that's the other thing man that is not the norm that's the deviation right don't leave you got it for I made it nine years in the UFC eight years actually and you know I didn't have that many fights I broke down I fell apart yeah that's pretty average you know I was like woe is me and then when you look at the data it's like oh no I'm just average 35 that's that's when you start fall apart when you look back now with what you know now and all the athletes you've worked with at the UFC I do you think you would have done anything different eight rounds why would you spar a rounds there's no a road fight are you literally just getting slower Forrest you already slow I don't know it's again being a pioneer like you were there wasn't really a whole lot of guys before you that were operating I had the other pioneers like the Randy's and the chums and that's what they were doing so I better be top of it or do it they - that's the craziest thing about shit man is I'm not gonna question them boxing it already figured out you shouldn't beat the fuck out of each other every day they'd already kind of figured that no and the other thing they figured out is we would work with people I would spar with Wanderlei Chuck Randi in boxing they don't spar with people they're equals past a certain point in camp well think about it you know a lot of it they start like is Floyd Mayweather sparring with I don't know really good people his level no no definitely not he sees when he blood boxers and he's tooling them yes yeah have you heard of them though they're not famous and rich so they're not they're not elite whereas do you think about like a gym like our gym like I'll just use Randy's because wanna talk bad about anybody you're fighting other champions every day right maybe dangerous as fuck yeah maybe drilled together sure learn from each other roll wrestle like control your training especially guys that are in the same weight class as you that may someday fight you that's awkward yeah yeah and there was no guidebook yeah you know you know guys like Keith Jardine and I shot Evans figured out they're like I we already had to fight each other we'll train together now so we won't have to do it again right it's good move if it works out the the level of guys now is it's so extraordinary to see like when you see the elite champions of today you you just have this insane level of a fighter it's it's really as a person who's been involved in the sport as long as I have I still never cease to be amazed at the the level of town of these guys coming up because some of these guys coming up that you just could do everything and they could do everything at such a high level and you realizing you're seeing the results of kids that started out learning MMA when they went five seconds oh yeah man you know I had a purse I have a personal gym and I remember Ronda Rousey were like man she's gonna change my bottom line all of a sudden I got a mat full of young women just trading Thank You rod yeah chief for sure changed it gina carano changed it a little bit before her you know people have this idea like oh you could be pretty and fuck people up like oh that's a totally different kind of girl it's like a superhero like a real-life superhero now she plays it in movies right yeah but it's just incredible to that the sport when you look at women's MMA like like particularly Amanda Nunez Chris cyborg that fight I mean that is as crazy exciting as any fight you will ever see your fucking life and Amanda Nunez bombed on the one of the greatest if not the greatest women's MMA fighter of all time and ko de in the first round and spectacular fashion like if you're not a fan of MMA or women's MMA after watching that yeah like that's funny mention that I just think about Holly Holm like what she made out of she's had a million fights like what she's doing so right like she's just he's she's a you know GSP couture she's got a genetic specimen and I think I should you know she's just again she does that 52-week fight camp type deal you know yeah you don't see her ever get now shapes and that's not how yeah you know I still think she got a raw deal in the Durand amiright o clocks pretty few times hard to the buzzer absolutely two times and not no no points taken away no nothing and we were shocked we're like that's crazy and then on top of that she dropped her she dropped her with a head kick and she dropped her with a straight left like in my opinion she did the more damage in that fight and I was I was shocked but that mean mmm a judge yeah it's never gonna dad's crazy we cannot help you with that at the performance Institute but we got some data when I was getting that before when you were talking about little kids when I was I was rather talking about kids coming up and amateur fighters they were probably something that would be really beneficial of having some sort of a program like that in America where kids can understand the right way the wrong way to do it so they don't have to repeat these problems and these these mistakes that have already been kind of gone gone over and that's your background the British Olympics is that would that be something that the UFC would ever think about doing in the future because if they really wanted to ensure that they had a good pool of high-level talent it would certainly add to that yeah I mean there's no clear performance pathway right into into the walking you know the highest level of the UFC for the sport of mixed martial arts so but there's guidelines for training that I think might not happen every every gym as a curriculum and what we're trying to do is obviously add to that curriculum from us you know from a training perspective a recovery perspective but ultimately what what's the best pathway and as you've already contested two people are coming to this boat with so many different backgrounds so are you gonna chop that that X access route to to the UFC in half or you actually gonna promote it and find you know many ways to get into the UFC I think you know we can look at things like the Olympic Games that does it emma may ever ever enter into Olympic Games and create a pathway who knows and I'm sure the UFC a you know looking into that type of thing in the future and trying to be ambitious but right now it's hard to define what's that what's the optimal way and one that it was the optimal route into the UFC yeah it is really that's one of the more interesting things about it like we were saying before you could really have any combat sport path boxer wrestler anything could get you in there I'm sure it's the same for other disciplines of martial arts but I have a lot of experience in kind of youth wrestling development and when MMA came along it was a little bit of a fear we're gonna lose a lot of athletes to MMA and we did originally lose a lot of athletes on the Olympic level - mmm a Johnny Hendrix is a great example promising young wrestling star went to MMA became a UFC champ did not become an Olympian but what it's really done is its created this popularity in wrestling and no small part - I think some of the the feedback that you've provided around wrestling being so vital to the development of mixed martial arts but there's been a real boon I believe in youth wrestling and in in you know youth and high school wrestling because people realize and recognize that this is a pathway into you know into becoming an elite mixed martial artist of all the athletes that are in the UFC you know there's a very high level of champions right now that were 2008 Olympians but if you look at the roster and how many people wrestled in high school it's staggering and so just getting this base not only technique in the grind mentality but the strength that you you know double legging somebody from when you're five until you're 18 you develop strength that you can't develop when you're 22 and this core strength and ability to do that is is is a way to get into it and I know that other disciplines are likely receiving similar windfalls but in terms of developing that curriculum for for development and that's that's definitely part of the you know what we're interested in and you're like alleviating some of the the big the big mistakes but there's still innumerable ways to get into it think about when you're doing jujitsu you had to like struggle to find people to roll with when you started right sure it was like there's like six guys you can roll with now you can go anywhere like you can be doing a show in any just look up and go drop in on our local jiu-jitsu yeah it's panels it's in jocks noon the other day at 60 people in it six-zero like what the fuck there was nowhere to move there's your talent development pathway to the UFC that's those kids classes right yep yeah it's it really is interesting too and it's dependent upon if a kid lives in an area that has a strong jujitsu program or a strong my program often times that's what dictates what path they get into the sport from know don't you know good good women's wrestling program or wrestle like a girl I'm on the advisory board so not only women's MMA but women's wrestling as well and there's what's really interesting working on the kind of the clinical side of of what we do with the PI is every discipline has its own not only support culture but physiology that goes with it you know as we talked about the strength dynamics for wrestlers are going to be different than the the reactive strength for for our strikers and then nutrition and and just overall lifestyle type sport cultures is really interesting coming from the different disciplines that you came from boxers they do the road work they're doing a lot more fast and morning training wrestlers that have you know obviously a weight cut culture that they bring with them and have a little bit more experience there a lot of the Brazilian jiu-jitsu players especially from Brazil have their sport culture so it's so intriguing being able to you know nothing we work with one sport but with so many subcultures within that sport and really really interesting to get to work with and obviously working with the female athletes like you alluded to earlier adds a whole another layer in terms of the dynamics that were working with in terms of the physiology with with our yeah I was just like the female physiology in the weight cut that's just a whole like you really need to go to school for that yeah I would imagine that's a big difference now you help them organize their weight cuts I know you work with tomorrow Guzman for his cut for his last fight so so with tomorrow we we absolutely worked with him all the way through all the way through the fight did you guys know he had a broken foot he was limping around but we you know no we didn't and if we did we were to mentioned it but no I had no idea and you know crazy is that guy hey he I did not he you know that's good that's awesome night I was actually happy he's in the building for the whole time and I know that I was happy as a yes good what happens in the walls stays in these walls cuz if there's this place like the Performance Institute and it's run by the UFC oh the the UFC that pays me to fight people I'm worried that that's gonna get to that right oh of course we started this like I don't want to know like I'm the liaison from them to the other side of the half I don't want to know whose weight is what I don't want to know who's got a nagging injury that's your you know some of that is actually HIPAA you know information that's your private stuff though even if it's just how strong or weak you are if you're having a bad day I don't I don't want that to ever get out of our walls right so that's obviously yeah yeah you're a conspiracy guy it's you know what does have to do with yeah guys always think the UFC's out to get him oh me too I always thought like ah they're gonna find out that I got this or that and you know well you know it all dries out for me the stress of preparation for a fight I mean people are always worried especially if there's a little tweak something going on something with the hand something with a leg some with the knee it gets out people find out about hear about it yeah yeah that's the thing it's the thing tomorrow in you know every other athlete we work with comes in with sensitive injuries and we have a private treatment suite within the performance Institute the the PT area so they can come get private treatment and then in terms of you know supporting him for his weight cut that that starts 10 weeks 12 weeks for tomorrow you know three four months in advance you trying to get him down to before the day of the cut so every athlete is going to be a little bit different based on what what their background is what is comfortable cutting from yeah what Ryan what their historical weight cutting practices have been how hard they've been on the body so we're assessing somebody like tomorrow for their metabolic rate where they fit in terms of their body composition into that weight division their word lean tissue versus their their fat tissue those that have a higher degree of lean tissue are going to have a muscle has more water than than just fat and bone so you can push the body a little bit further for those that have a higher lean tissue and so all of that planning and preparation starts many many weeks in advance and and having heard tomorrow on your show a couple weeks ago a lot of a lot of what we do with an athlete that doesn't have a history of missing weight may have a hard time making weight but oftentimes they're making it harder on themselves because they're pulling the body in two different directions like we talked about if they're training in one way and feeding in a different way what they're doing is they're just undermining and kind of digging a dig in a hole that they can't get out of by the end of fight camp and that fight camp gets really long like force talked about what do you see in terms of the way they fuel themselves it's like the biggest error sticking to one one style of feeding regardless of the training style that they're engaging in so MMA athletes they have to do high-intensity training sessions strength and conditioning they have to be doing sparring they have to be doing pads rounds that are crazy hard in every athlete each one is going to have a different intensity relative to their body type and so if somebody's doing pads it's a nine or a ten out of ten in terms of intensity and they're doing that fasted or they're doing that without carbohydrates available to do that work they can't they can't a hit those training intensities repeatedly and then they can't adapt as a response to that training so they end up just getting slower and more beat up instead of faster and more powerful so if they're doing high-intensity we need to fuel the body in the specific way that supports that training effort and then the longer turn adaptation to that bout additionally if they're doing low intensity we can adjust our fueling strategies based on what that dictates you know if it's if it's a kind of a base aerobic training session or if they're doing skills and drills we want to be feeding the body to adapt differently than if they're doing the high intensity sparring strengthening conditioning or pads or whatever that might be so for every athlete we're looking at how their body uses substrate energy the energy that they're using the substrate between carbs and fat at each of these intensities and then we also need a base at base we need to base our recommendations on where their body fits into the division if they're if they're 20% out from their weight division four weeks out then we're gonna have a little bit of a more aggressive strategy nutritionally because if weight becomes a primary factor if they're 10 percent out 4 weeks out then we're going to have a little bit of a different conversation and prioritization around the fueling strategies and all of these conversations integrate within our strength and conditioning program so that we're working in concert and tying in the workload in into our own system as well as the the training load that they're engaging with with their skill specific training now when you vary the diet that you give them independent dependent of the workout what is what is that based on is that based on a hard accepted science of carbohydrate versus protein versus eventual fat essential fatty acids like how do you determine that so we we use a philosophy a system called metabolic efficiency you could call metabolic flexibility I've heard it called as well and essentially the body will use different substrate at different intensities and at low intensities and at rest the body can and likely should be adapted for our for our sports athletes to to fat at rest now it depends on the sport type again if we're a shot putter or if we're a hundred meter printer then we're going to be much more dependent on carbohydrates and really the creatine phosphate system we're not even getting into the glycolic system and Duncan could talk a lot more about the energy systems but essentially we're reliant upon glucose and ATP for energy at the lower intensity bursts right so to hit repeated max or sub max efforts we require blood sugar and without it we will deplete our initial stores and then we can't we can't we can no longer hit 90 or 95% of our max we start hitting 80 and 70 and 60 and in diminishing our ability to do these high-intensity efforts now do you guys see anybody come in and try to fight on a ketogenic diet cuz I know quite a few guys we're doing that for a while I know Bryan caraway did it Matt Brown yeah that's right he has fought but he varies and I think he yeah well I talked to him I think he did one pretty pure and then he did you know he did the one where you you know you might take in sixty or eighty carbs but then you were come off from the state Kittichai I don't mhm some of those guys like Zack bitter he's a altra marathon runner he he there he does eat ketogenic most of time but then on days of big races he'll consume a lot of sugars yeah and yeah and again on insulin sensitivity too yeah so essentially the more we could regulate blood sugar at rest and low intensities then we can expand and to support the development of that kind of aerobic oxidative system and by adapting to use fat as a primary substrate we're doing a number of things one we're balancing blood sugar at rest so that we can really limit the insulin spikes and and essentially adipose development in addition to really driving the body towards the oxidative and/or the oxidative aerobic system and then as we increase in what we do is we assess how the body adapts out through the training intensities and we'll repeat that kind of on a monthly basis to see how the athlete changes and then as they increase in the intensity of a training effort then we will adjust the ratio of fat to carbohydrates as as this as a fuel substrate I thought I was gonna come up organically but it didn't do the trifecta five prep systems you guys didn't your team were going to 22 events this year indeed take it away all right what are you doing so I'm shooting a promo here Joe so essentially we're assessing and then we're programming based on each athletes needs so like for said one of our most valuable partners at the UFC performances two is this meal prep company called trifecta nutrition and and they essentially have all organic meal line that can be developed all a cart ordered all a cart and so with kymaro as an example we worked together for his past two fights and and many athletes like I said are not fueling the type of training in a way that leads to their long-term adaptation but can lead to overtraining earlier in camp and so what we really won't want to do is to understand how that physiology works and then program and then provide those athletes with the nutrition whether it's on-site at the UFC Performance Institute at the events as well as what I was getting at like 22 events that go - so you think about like I would you know I would literally smuggle oatmeal into Brazil like you're stealing food you know they're like if you get there you know the little thing that says Norgay a little pass mm-hmm they can go to those fights and actually feed you throughout the week for that oh wow that's where I was drawing yes oh that's incredible so they would like you know to fight in Stockholm they would come to Stockholm we live if it's one of the 22 events okay so but if it's one of those ones events they would go and you could get the UFC pi/2 Fuel you threw the entire event yep so there's a number of levels so I'll get there in just one sec but essentially we'll take them through the fight camp fuel them for adaptation so they show up to the event we know exactly where they are they're fueled and then we could take them all the way through the fight so 22 events most are domestic except for some the pay-per-views there that are international so of the 22 the only international ones are the pay-per-views the others are the ESPN events and those are pretty much exclusively domestic but what we what we've done is we've out reached all of the athletes that have crossed paths with us at the Performance Institute so it's not it's it's not roster wide yet as we're working through a lot of the operational stuff as an example we aren't able to get into the kitchen at every hotel so then we're working to find a community kitchen trying to find contacts that local uses to actually cook them yourself so trifecta hired a chef so trifecta did they're our partner they've been amazing in terms of you know trying to feed our athletes we identified this as a real need to you know we we run a marathon with those guys right tomorrow as an example we work together for three months we get them to a week before the fight and then it's like Pat him on the block and say good luck right we as we know fueling is is impactful all the way through the fight you know including 30 minutes before and so instead of patting him on the buck and set button saying good luck trifecta hired a chef who I've previously worked with the he worked with me at Cornell University for a year he was an intern with me he worked at EXO's for two years and then at a two-star two Michelin star restaurant here in LA and Providence's is the name of it and he got hired he's their executive chef and and is building out the fight week meals based on me and my team's programming so we work with every single athlete that we've connected with at the PI it's gotten up to you know on average between 14 and 16 athletes at all the events that we're working and we provide comprehensive fueling so all of the food calories that they put in their body from the time they step on foot on Tuesday for fighter checking all the way through you know 30 minutes pre-fight I mean including all the supplements NSF third-party tested supplements for supplement safety to make sure they're not getting adulterated products we're keeping track of everything that they're consuming on the supplement side we don't sit in the sauna we're not there to be a weight cut coach we are the we're the sports Dietetics team to support them on a on a programming and on offense you know science evidence-based level so we we we will consult with their teams around what's the safest what's the most effective way to support an athlete making weight and then we instantly once they make weight we have supplies that was developed cooked prepared by our chef that morning in the night before to support rehydration electrolytes to optimize the gut repopulation of gut microbiota as well as balance the osmolality so that they're not getting gut cramping and issues that happen when you ingest a ton of sodium and and glycogen glucose that causes a lot of water to rush into the gut and then we essentially feed them all the way through like I said breakfast lunch and then and pre-fight to support their performance on fight night I'm an outspoken critic of cutting weight I don't necessarily think it's the best thing for the sport or for the athlete I mean I think one of the benefits that we would get out of having more weight classes available that fighters could get their body to a the weight class where they're optimally at has there ever been any discussion I know you guys have had discussions about PD usage and how to stop adulterated supplements from getting to fighters and and making people test positive but what about some long term goal of potentially eliminating weight cutting the way they've eliminated peds so as we already talked about I come from college wrestling tragically in 1997 three college wrestlers died in Florida of course it's always Florida was it no one was it University of Michigan and I I'm not I'm not exactly sure where the other two were but let's pretend we're we're Florida let's say Florida - feels like Florida just gonna show their head anyway not even gonna check now accept it but the n-c-double-a dramatically overhauled their way in rules from the day before - to the day of and there are a lot of similarities in terms of the types of athletes that are wrestling versus the types of athletes that are competing in MMA but we work in and we work with professional athletes and we work for a professional fight promotion and and the dynamics of professional fight promoter is completely different than the n-c-double-a and the reason the level of autonomy with our independent contractors versus the incidental eats is different and and we as the UFC you know the performance is - we have the health and safety of our fighters in mind at all times and and that's priority number one and I've I've had to literally call the ambulance on athletes that I've seen not doing well because of health and health considerations you personally how do you feel about it about Waco don't wake up I I would like to I personally would like to make it safer there there are there are less than ideal I think safety concerns you know that we've all heard of and the you know a lot of us have seen and and from from my perspective the closer that you could bring it to to the fight the better but because of the promotional nature of the UFC it's not it and then we have we have limited ability to affect change with your see because from etc the Commission's the Commission's really are the ones that are really made like that asshole but do pick your weight class make the weight or just say you know I'm not gonna be able to do it I got to move up right you know like it was always hard for me to make 205 but you know I didn't really want to fight heavy weight and I made it and it towards the end of my career I walked around like you know I used to get pretty big I was like hey I don't want to do that I want to be a professional be a professional it comes back to the hole i hate's keep standard with the 52-week fight camp all right like do you need to get 20% over your fight weight if you're 20% over your fight weight that's not your fight weight you know just making very good points just just I mean you can bear weight classes all right maybe there needs to be a weight class like every whether it is like every 10 and 10 pounds or every 10 percent so I think percents a lot more important than right the other thing is maybe in time it'll happen there's 570 athletes is not enough to fill that many weight classes and then you know you're boxing guy or you you know then you get a weight class yeah I'm just gonna run around and we're gonna have fights every three pounds and then it then it becomes a little mmm I don't know if that's necessarily there's like 27 belts how much do they have really clearly is that it's an unnecessary risk it's not necessary to have a guy hydrate themself or a girl dehydrate themselves so that literally to the point of going to the fucking hospital 24 hours before a cage fight is insane if you could eliminate that why wouldn't you that's the number one thing I think there's no benefit whatsoever to making people dehydrate themselves 24 hours before a cage fight it sounds crazy no nobody's gonna disagree with you but we what's the best way to figure out the best way to figure it out is to first of all you could definitely avoid a lot of struggle and tragedy by figuring it out right I mean the fights that happen where waiters for fighters in several organizations cut weight and die during that process that's heartbreaking you know if we could avoid that there's already dangerous sport as it is we are collecting data at the performances too we we all have some opinions around what works best in terms of reducing the extreme weight cutting creating some competitive parity in the cage I think is a really really critical point so that it D incentivizes that right that weight cuts process yeah if you can't be as big in the cage well then right then there's not as much of a benefit the problem mate well it is a very complex problem and the regulation and in mixed martial arts is such that we're the promoter and we abide by the regulations of every single state athletic command and so we are we're collecting data so that we can understand the issue we're coming you know we're working to come to an understanding to then share with with those that there are the the legislators of the system so that they can help make it safer as well because it's it's not just a unilateral decision where we tell our employees what you do we have 2570 independent contractors so each of us has you know some strong beliefs and opinions in this space and value yours and I really respect that the passion you bring to it this is this is my passion as well that's why I came to the UFC is to to impact this culture and hopefully on the policy side as well but it's a very very complex system that we're working to to kind of you know infiltrate or to affect from the inside I truly understand that it's complex but if you could wave a magic wand and not have weight cutting wouldn't you do it fuck yeah nobody's disagreeing with that why not just slice it what us do that they can do that one Fc is doing it it can be done you just you have a program where you make sure that people move up a weight class they don't you have hydration tests you make sure that they're never there never really taxing out like some guys we've seen some guys I seen guys shuffle to this to the scale because they couldn't walk we've all seen yeah yeah where guys are literally on death's door 24 hours before a cage fight that's crazy if you could eliminate that I men one Fc firfer trying there's holes in that system just like there's holes in there always gonna try and get in the systems that the system as well well you know stick that you or I could go by and Walmart those aren't that easy to be or that those aren't hard to beat dehydration tell yes yeah no they're not you're 100% right I mean it but it's more more it's more protected it's more difficult to do they have a they have a far different regulatory system than we have is we have 50 independent state regulators we have coming down down in Brazil we have different regulators it's it's very complex and and III think that we obviously here at the table and if the performances to have have that as up as a primary kind of area of focus but we're working to affect the system okay I mean I'll sum it up what Clinton his team are doing is let's see the debt like let's collect the data let's figure out what it looks like you know what what Donna's been doing for the last couple of years collecting every fight wait let's see you know let's let's look at the data figure it out from there yeah it's it's just such a it's such an unfortunate aspect of it that I get has been there from the beginning or at least from the time the weight classes started being instituted but it just seems to me that boy if there's a way to avoid them.6 they had it they had it right sorry guys that throw it with the giant guys but those that like yeah yeah we'll go back to that yeah that's pretty hard by itself yes it is yeah I just um we don't call it cage fighter we call it octagonal struggling yeah well you say cage fighting people go what do so mix - oh you mean like the UFC I love Ronda Rousey yeah it's about your messaging sometimes right yeah accepted that do you guys have long-term plans for expansion of the treatments and the different things you do do you have like a look is this something that you guys are constantly working on improving yeah I mean absolutely the sports science landscape is vast you know and we try to keep abreast of all the latest technologies the advances in theory and philosophy so yeah that's at the heart of everything we do you know we're trying to UM stay at the cutting edge of sports performance so how does that do you have to go to conferences and find out what the lowest up guys are doing and I mean you know I did the math this week actually you know I always say the churches in the building the churches of people our staff has got a combined experience in pro and elite sports of 106 years we've got 18 Olympic Games supported within our staff alone Wow okay so our people our our staff our what is so precious to the performance Institute and we're very proud of our staff and that they're their respective world leaders in their own individual areas and well yeah of course you have to go and speak to people of course you gotta listen to seminars and clacks and gather information they love those conferences all right what you're gonna have to do is process it you know the yes there's a lot of pseudoscience and bro science out that you know so you you've got you love that word right yeah that's a real problem yeah so you know the ability to process it is is what makes the difference you know what no not everybody could be fortunate enough I don't even have to be smart I just went out and found a bunch of smart people did they make me take notes when they make you sit I honestly used to really like try to upskill myself and everything and at some point I was like now is not just hey Clint come here I got a question now in terms of like recovery stuff I know you guys had a hot pool like a sauna or a Jacuzzi rather it was right next to a cold plunge how much of that stuff do you guys do and what what what equipment do you guys keep again both undervalues I was head of strength a director strand the conditioning puts it you know intimately in terms of the in the UFC everyone's training heart you know every you're not training harder than the guy next to you or in the gym next to you what what is the key is how fast you can recover and train again at the intensity that you need to the day after day after day and be robust enough to tolerate that so recovery and regeneration is just as important as the training exposure in fact your body obviously changes and adapts during the recovery and regeneration process so yeah listen we've got hot tubs we've got aquatic capabilities we've got cryotherapy we've got compression we've got you know everything that you would expect in in in a world-class facility what we're starting to do is really try to be a bit more prescriptive around that and as Clint's already talked about you know it makes no sense to us to look at a high neuromuscular striking session where you're hitting mitts or hitting bags and use the same recovery strategy as a high metabolic grappling session these are totally different physiology physiology challenges so yet to be prescriptive and to be a bit more strategic in our approach and but at the end of the day what is core to recovery it's such a personal thing you know some people don't like getting in the cryotherapy chamber some people can't swim so they're not going to get in the water and do hot cold plunges it's just it's going to stress them out more so like you know it's the hey going here to drown it'll help you recover deep what's not a deep or this you know there's some people just cut the fear of water cuz you can't swim you know so they do about baths Wow shower too crazy no go your mom when you smell a my god guys us have the sauna on premises as well you have guys go from the sauna to the coal plunge me personally yeah it's supposed to be a great benefit of that right here sure and again you you know you've had under Galpin on you about all these bro McKenzie all these people that breathe in it covers most of it although there's a lot of information now around recovery yeah but it's still a massive gray area think it's out massage do you have that on staff as well absolutely I thought what do they do like like Rolfing that kind of like deep tissues of grass how often you guys recommend that for athletes because the the the Soviets for a long period of time was really shocking when we found out they were massaging their athletes everyday yeah and there's there's debate as to whether or not that's good or bad like what are your thoughts on that well I think what Heather who's our director director of PT I'll tell you is the the the the fasciae and and the the fighter posture and and the way fighters are putting their bodies through particular challenges obviously creates a lot of muscle tone and creates a lot of tightness in the fascia and just methods and mechanisms to free that up to allow the joints and and you know the articulation of the body to work effectively is huge if you have greater than a I'm trying to remember the numbers but a at a 10 to 20 percent imbalance in the joint within your body you know the seventy to ninety percent chance of injuring that joint right so just the the the difference in terms of symmetry and balance within the body and its influence on injury is massive so white wine why not be proactive I mean trying to utilize manual therapies and recovery modalities rather than working in a reactive process and waiting for the injury to happen and again that's that's core of our philosophy is that there's been a big shift in the barometer for some of the fighters that come through the performance Institute you know the clinic and the therapy is somewhere where you go in you're injured well you know what we do is we promote it just as much as a strength and conditioning piece so what you talking about range of motion you including flexibility exercises do you guys incorporate a lot of that stuff as well oh for sure but again it's it's you know the fighters tend to be pretty flexible so again it's it's on an individual level but most strikers most people can kick you in the head in the UFC they'll be pretty flexible in individual orthopedic assessment right so I am this is tight that is tight all right we need to loosen you up we're gonna put that in your routine right so everything is needs analysis driven right so you know Brian Ortega don't need to be any more flexible you can throw us put a slider it just needs to maintain its current flex boom right so you it completely varies and if you got like a stiff wrestler someone who's like just never really worked and think about the combat posture that internal rotation that combat past you where you're constantly throwing I mean just chronically doing that year after year is gonna set you up for some amount of tightness in terms of fascist so again I don't wanna go outside of my scope of expertise but and we're very proactive in promoting fights is using modalities proactively rather than reactive ly so say if a fighter came in and they did a hard grappling workout and after the training what would you recommend and how much time because there's there's some thought that the body should exist in an inflamed state post-workout to fall zones on the face of training so yeah right and also for a certain amount of time right and then there's more of a benefit of going into cryotherapy after like an hour or so so where the benefits and again if you're off camp what are you trying to do you're trying to break down your body so it can be overloaded and recover better you know you using that super compensation to take it to a new level of adaptation yeah income when you're sharpening the knife ready for the fight you want to remove any type of fatigue because if you're getting close to the fight you need to optimize your training and always peak to the performance on fight night so you know it's gonna be a strategic we've got a period eyes your recovery as you would period eyes your training loads in camp or off camp mmm-hmm but yeah there's different approaches and different modalities that you've got to utilize so if you look at grappling and the metabolic demand that goes into the wrestling and the grappling you know that that's a lactic lactate kind of response that's a you know a circulatory issue in terms of those those metabolites are circling around the body you got to remove those all right so is that gonna be something like a muscle pump type recovery strategy that'll help it remove it through the through the liver and into the lymph system I mean like one of those compressions so yeah it might be a compression pan or it might be hot cold you know if you go hot cold the vessels will expand in the heart and will contracting the cold you get a natural kind of muscle pump and how many times you ask fighters to do that when they do a hot cold thing do they do it these are a sequence yeah I mean we we have a preferred methodology right now it's about three three to four minutes four times in each finishing can't go back and forth four minutes finishing the cult you look at other you know other experts and other professionals in the field they'll say sit in the cold bath for 20 minutes you know so it's there's still not the science not the data and the information out there to really support somehow yeah how do you optimize me how do you know whether or not it's having that much of a benefit compared to not doing that ask the guy yeah just I'll suggest are to make away you know yeah number one subjective do you feel better you know that there might be no science around cryotherapy I'm not suggesting not but there might be no no dates or no science on it but if the guy walks out three minutes later and feels like crystal mind and his body is fresh I mean it's kind of worked right yeah well the norepinephrine the the raising of the levels of it dude the extreme cold exposure I think that's been proven I think cytokine develop cold char proteins and protein both of them that's all proven stuff right in terms of measuring the actual inflammatory markers Oh Audie but some people don't like it I'm just making the point that if you like that stimulation and you like that sensation and you walk out you can forget the physiology kiss now it's laughing into psychology and that's still part of the recovery process yes is it's beneficial Fisher I will sidetrack just in terms of recovery nutrition is a core value of the recovery process as well so as much cryotherapy as you do if you're not recovering stimulating muscle you know converting from catabolism to enable ISM providing nutrients for for substrate regeneration that's a critical component as well so that that's that's critical what we aren't doing is providing tart cherry juice or hide antioxidants immediately post training as well that yeah what we'll include that in other periods of the day in the evening or not are not immediately around a high-intensity training session for antioxidant effect of antioxidants post training similar it limits it blunts the adaptive response based on the the body's recovery process so if you if you blunt your immune response to to a micro trauma muscle tears that need to be rebuilt stronger and faster well then you limit the adaptation so yeah we want to provide nutrients to support recovery but we don't want to eliminate the adaptive response to to the training session that's what's so fascinating about the science of it that you can get that that specific that you know that if you consume the high levels antioxidants post-training it's going to blunt the recovery time that's you have to so yeah it's amazing curcumin tart cherry juice there's a number of spices that are included in a lot of different things so whether it's cooking or or in our supplement protocol that we will include but we're gonna target them away from the high intense how far away from the high intensity to a couple hours couple hours I mean it comes back to you know kind of fights a kind of Coach process all this information right you know can they physically be aware of it what are the catcher give me the bag so again let us do some of the grunt work yeah Performance Institute and we can give you some of that education I'll tell you how I feel and then we'll come back we'll talk about it maybe a changes coaches and gyms don't have to feel like you're trying to poach them and take them away and bring them to a new play that's a beautiful thing about it's like it's open to everybody who fights for the user and the other thing which oh say is this this isn't no cost to the fighters Yeah right it's also their choice well they're independent contractors they can decide how much they want to engage with us as much or as little as they want and again that's the same with the trifecta program for meal prep it's is saying with our strength and conditioning program so again it's it's all bespoke and customized program in it they're expected at no cost it's it's so exciting for me because having seen the fight the fights in the the sport and the level of sport evolve over all these years it's so exciting to see constant and continuing innovation and when you guys came along and built this thing and I had a chance to go and visit I was so excited because like this is just as what man every sport needs something like this but the fact that the UFC has do some testing come by do some testing old where are you more old than other yeah right now my left hip I fell down skiing we make it great sorry you make a great point because what's what's been one of the really exciting things for us and refreshing and also for the UFC Performance Institute is that sports like the NFL the NBA you know the English Premier League we're having representatives from all of these teams NHL coming through and trying to understand or just be trying to understand what we're doing how we work in our sport science into the sport of mixed martial arts and to try and capture our philosophy and our approach from a facility development perspective through to kind of our educational processes through to the way we're interacting with fighters and again we're trying to shake mixed martial arts which are no influence at UFC that's that's an that's our number one mission but the the the the global awareness round around the performance Institute is really exciting as well now I know you guys you were talking about your place in China are you planning on going anywhere else well right now you know the expectation of our desire is to influence mixed martial arts globally we're truly a global sport so and right now we don't know what that's gonna look like but the ambition is to obviously have performance Institute's around the world that can help the development process on a building like South Africa mm-hmm badass over there get the malaria medication ready bro huh cipro right it's a pro I don't know what that stuff is he just wants the red wine oh it's pretty master what is cool about is about us operating and athletes being independent contractors and accessing us however they see fit is we have so many different case studies and utilization we'll have people come out for a week at a time access our team take that back well have other people come out for a part of a camp or a full camp others will come we had mesa barber actually she talked about it publicly but she she worked with us quite a bit for her last fight she booked a flight from Nashville to Vegas to reconnect to get updated nutrition strengthen conditioning or whatever whatever metrics that week update based on her health status as well as orthopedic support post fight so we were able to get a number of days post fight as part of essentially the completion of her fight camp to get her ready for the next phase so there's a lot of different ways that athletes can utilize based on just whatever their needs are whatever they perceive their needs it needs to be and then whatever influence were able to kind of make over over there preparation and Maci barber is a perfect example of someone getting that kind of high level treatment very early in her career she's only 20 years old right no super exciting prospect and for her to have access to 21 like 3 weeks she's older a days over the hill that that voice is Forrest Griffin ladies and gentlemen no one else when you when you treat these younger fighters how much emphasis do you put on giving them just some just a smart protocol to try to minimize the potential injuries like to get them to understand the relationship between range of motion and injuries to get them to understand balance I know you guys have a machine that you actually can measure the muscles in the body and show like the left and the right side what's what's what's week and what's strong right what does that call again I mean it's we use fullest plates in instant in particular and there's something you like down in those there so we have the DEXA scan which is essentially you know a low-dose x-ray that measures the the mass of the tissue between bone mass muscle mass and fat mass and so we can get a balance of the musculature and the skeleton bilaterally when we when we see a big imbalance on that front because that is a nutrition related test we will share that with both physical therapy and strength and conditioning and then physical therapy could break that into more nuance around strength imbalances around joints using the bio decks and then strength and conditioning will do very similar kind of understanding using the the bio lateral force plates that stupid machine told me I had two pounds less muscle on my left leg am i right it was accurate oh yeah no I do I blew my day out a couple times but I just didn't really so when you found out did you start doing like extra one-legged pistols on the left side for two weeks maybe even three and then I was like yeah I got some emails to send any niece died and now he just keeps running circles let me ask you this if you did see a fighter and they did have something like that and they were active they're still competing you saw all the time what do you do yeah I mean we have a lot of fighters that have imbalances muscularly that that's that's not a nutrition-related obviously our support is going to be important for the adaptation right and this goes to Heather around an orthopedic assessment what are what it what's the imbalance what's the injury risk like duncan was saying in terms of strength and balances she and her team heather linden are our director of PT would would do that orthopaedic screen see what the imbalances are and break it down and then that would lead to probably programming in her space and then also to strengthen conditioning to build programs around whether it's mobility range of motion or just around it kind of hypertrophy to make up for some imbalances so that's where the comprehensive approach comes in i might assess something and then kick it over to them there's many cases where they would assess something whether the strength coach happened this week so-and-so is having a bad training session they talk about low energy they talk about not not being able to recover or get up for the next training session that's an immediate referral over to my session to my side of the defense so that's where the integrated care becomes really really critical so how if you had someone that had like two pound weight difference between their left leg in the right leg how much time would you give them the gain that way back would be dependent upon the individual or like you would probably want that to be a priority before they went into a heavy camp or something like that okay you can't resolve that immediately but that would be part of the I mean it comes back to the the return on investment right what's the return on investment to and the reduction of an injury risk to try and influence that two pounds you know I mean that's a conversation that's you know we're gonna have that conversation on how effective or influential that is going to be on the outcome of the fight so you know that's Clint says as fighters at what round truly imbalanced and but what's the risk and the time and effort it's going to take to make that change if it's in a fight camp we're probably going to just leave it as it is if it's off camp and we've got a little bit more time to try and address it all right now we can be a bit more proactive about but with me they were like you're all what take you out back and shoot you now they did we messed around with some VFR stuff yeah VFR blood flow restriction your occlusion behind zoo type approach but again in physical therapy and strength condition now that's not revolutionary anymore that that's that's part of just another tool that we are to it it's it's a way to come to argument and or accelerate hypertrophy so if you have someone that's coming back for returning from surgery or an injury and you're looking to get muscle mass back on to and the limb without necessarily loading it through free weights or whatever it may be you can use blood flow restriction methods to try and increase the hypertrophy mechanism what are you thoughts on electrical muscular stimulation those little pads and shot ceased no no that is called Heather yeah what they they come by a lot with different machines to using I have not no well no actually no that's not true I was the test dummy I think with a lot of things with some short-term relief and again you're influenced the nervous system the long-term changes are potentially not there here's our ask you about cupping so legit yeah is it real Michael Phelps if you think about massage that's all decompression when copping does is the opposite it lifts mmm-hmm alright so again when we're talking about faster and changing faster and and releasing faster if all you ever do is massage and depress the tissue you're not getting that mechanism of lifting and and bringing it up into the cup so that that's kind of philosophy behind it and and our our therapists use it a lot but again it's just a tool and and and and they're gonna use the tool for certain situations and they might leave it for others is there any scientific research to back copy not that I'm aware of but I might be completely wrong so um do you ever do it I got a couple show me like what's going on with your leg bro Forrest Forrest would you do oh so do you know do you know Russian from an Oso yeah surgery six weeks ago would you have done MCL PCL Elsie oh Jesus man do you know the single-leg when you do this scissor defense to the single leg yeah scissor I don't mm-hmm not at all I just fell right on his leg turns out you can't do a thing you can't not do a thing for six years and just think you can do it it's not riding the bike it's a it's a perishable skill as me and Clinton now now so how long ago but I have three new ligament so I'm good oh geez ixnay flicks you know six and a half weeks or 3 new ligaments from cadavers is that what it is MCL was able to be repaired down on itself PCL cadaver LCL cadaver I'm getting world-class cuffing today I got graston yesterday hurt like hell but literally I'm just beta testing everything I I was the test subject for Roman for all the exercise tests now I'm the test subject for all the PT rehab what about stem cells or exosomes or anything along those lines we got our flights to Panama book dr. Neil Riordan on standby I'm sticking with physical therapy at the moment but I I honestly don't know that much about the other components but I'm waiting for embryonic stem cells in the u.s. then I'll do it kill easily surgery yeah it's fantastic yeah they're doing something was edible stuff if you're really interested you should talk to dr. Roddy Magee he's also local in Vegas yeah he's amazing I went I did a consult with him you sent me yeah MCC boss sent me and he said for my shoulder and he was like yeah there's nothing there for its attached to I'll take your six grand but it probably won't work and I was like well I appreciate the character doc yeah he's very he's very honest about the potentials but your shoulders been operated on how many times three yeah that's rough now what are the options when something like that happens can they I know they do shoulder replacements but what does that entail yeah I'll probably do that eventually and what does that mean they just put a different socket socket yeah what do they do it while the surrounding ligaments no I don't know that's terrifying and I think a lot of those are still intact so I'm a-thinkin range of motion were to improve as long as I go mess around on our PT once or twice a week it stays functional so wouldn't you say mess around like what kind of stuff you're doing something stuff for mobility or suffer you doing like clubs well I like where you're actually like moving through with them like pressing on the muscles and you're actually like lifting the weight what's that called where you're lifting weights or someone oh you're like oh I forgot I'll faint you've written sorry no worries physical therapy did you have you do a lot of band stuff and a lot of shoulder guys get band work I do yeah I do them like as a warm-up every day yeah or every you know every whenever I work out except for today I just jumped in cold and like let's see what happens now how much how much time do you spend on sort of educating fighters about having to strengthen up all the the surrounding tissue around knees and shoulders and necks and things along those things that are commonly your core your lower back tissue resilience is is massive in our sport because again it's end range resilience right it's with with the submission and and the you know the grappling exercise techniques obviously you take in a tissue and the tolerance of that tissue to attend range you know by being able to train that over time in a progressive fashion of course it's gonna have an influence and yeah we part of our programming is it's gonna approach that for sure now you guys have been in action now for two years you've had a bunch of different fighters move through and do their camps there we've had roster of 570 without over 430 the fighters have already been through in the first 22 months and we have a retention rate of about 73% so they're either coming back for repeat visits or they're getting remote programming from ourselves now how much has this changed like over the the two years how much does you have your protocols change your programs have changed a lot yeah I mean yeah a lot we're learning more about the sport the data is showing is more and you know again just the opportunity to speak to more coaches more athletes again we're servant to the fight community and we're sports scientists therapists and the end of the day the IP sits with the coaches with ma coaches and people like Forrest so just being able to understand how we can collect that information from a technical tactical perspective and try and fit it into our philosophy of sports science being complementary to that that that's that's evolved all of our processes extensively over the last two years have you guys ever thought about putting any of these sessions online yeah I mean I shouldn't yeah I always say the performance Institute's got three responsibilities the first responsibility is to service athletes to service our fight community either face-to-face or remotely the second thing which we're trying to do something like this is to aggregate more information and more insights around the sport it's always available anybody could buy this no but it's it's you can get it online through it you know it was sent to every fighter on I Ross okay the average person you can go to our two Twitter accounts and things like that and find on there there's links out there and so everybody knows that you have C fighter right just go fine but the second thing is we need to understand the sport the sport of mixed martial arts is only 25 years old professionally so aggregating data is a second thing and then the third thing off the back of that that data is dissemination and education across the global fight community so we we're called the performance Institute for a reason not the performance gym because we are truly trying to do project work do research work work with partners to try and aggregate that information and our awareness and our understanding so that we can push out there so the plan is obviously moving forward to really ramp up our educational platforms to support the global community and hopefully and we'll have kind of certifications coming online and those types of things as well strength MPT our filming stuff to put online all right now this is the way this exercise is probably done these things to look out for for physical therapy and strength conditioning you know you guys have a youtube channel we don't what here's the thing we we don't want to act quickly this isn't we're not like a YouTube thing we want to like hey when we release something we stand behind it this is this is tried and true these are practice method we don't need to rush it also these jerks are always busy like working with asshole athletes Wow well I think that would mean what you guys are doing is amazing and it would be even more amazing if young fighters people coming up yeah get it really could influence a lot of folks yeah you're right and again it's in our ambition it's just we're just two years into this yeah our first year was just shit let's just get operational we don't even know what this thing is is anyone gonna come mandate to the UFC give you I mean how much will they say hey man make a fucking awesome place will people do their best all right this is Dana high five I'm going back to work like how does that work how does how does it get set up now maybe it was like hey we want insights into the athletes we want you know event if its origin was like hey can you guys make people stop missing weight and getting injured so much and more importantly when somebody does get injured can we like get them back quicker can they not work with like a mom and pop car accident chiropractor to get like a professional athlete you know can we get them back so the the the goal right so the mission statement is you know so long gay careers to you know to help athletes make the weight class stay within the way class fight great at their weight class so again specific mandates like the exact KP as I forget what they are they were somewhat up the bar so what I would say is we can legitimately say in the first 19 months of the first 19 months of our existence we've saved 22 fights either through medical intervention or the work that Clint has done around someone that's behind their this at their weight descent and we've really expedited that process so it's amazing that we're proud of that number and it's hard to build kp8 around that but that's why the performance institute was implemented GPAs KPIs key performance indicator oh so we're not a fight team right we work with the whole roster so now what we're not judged on wins and losses although some some would you look on social media and some would think and but where our KPIs are around things like how can we support fighters make weight how can we get them to the door the Octagon in a healthy fashion and again we 22 fights we can absolutely say they probably wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for the work of the Performance Institute so there's you can put a financial cost potentially against that and that that's kind of the philosophy behind the performance Institute alright gentlemen any last words Clint you can say something I was just gonna add that that a lot of what we're doing in the in the athletes that we get to interact with are the cases that require huge interventions you know people that are coming off a six fight win win streak are not looking for how to fix their metabolism or how to stop missing weight or how to improve their power because it's a deficiency or an orthopedic injury so we're working with those that are really successful and those that are struggling and everything in between so it's around those those interventions that have led to fights actually happening there there's a huge amount of I guess risk for lack of a better term that we're taking on as we're as we're really working with the athletes best interest at heart and doing everything we can to support that athlete to be more consistent and to be able to do it longer into their career so they could you know do the best for for themselves for their family and for I guess the UFC beautiful anything Duncan dad no I mean this is a trip you know in terms of where we're at with the performance Institute our ambition is to really affect and support the global fight community that's what we're about and hopefully you know moving forwards here we you know people are gonna see the value of what we're trying to do well I think they already see the value I certainly do I'm very excited that you guys are around and waste the money it's definitely gonna be a waste of money yeah what does that mean though right cost money but I think ultimately it's great for the sport for sure thank you and it's just an amazing resource and I'm glad you're a part of it too man needs a lock means a lot to have guys a former champion who's been there I mean since Ultimate Fighter season one you know I mean it's creamy your fight I mean everybody says it it's a fact your fight I'm at least once a day that fucking fight made the sport what you were in he was in a fight okay that fight made the sport man really did that that the fight was so crazy people were calling up their friends like when they start doing that the Elson numbers are all shenanigans right you get like a hundred people there checking there they don't really know who the fuck's watching one but they know that something crazy happened during that fight and they have estimates that there were as much as six people changed and started tuning into that fight while it was happening they don't know what the real numbers are but it was chaos and then afterwards I never saw anything like it I see it was like all the sudden people wanted to watch the UFC it was almost instantaneous the season finale The Ultimate Fighter went on the air and then the door opened and people started pouring through it was crazy man and that's you you and Stephan Bonnar you you guys are responsible for literally the birth of this explosion that you you we're all seeing right now that we're seeing with this ESPN deal we're seeing with these incredible fights no it's cool and and I you know I love that that I got to kind of be that that cornerstone but you know now the P I the UFC itself the stars today it's only building you know that was the beginning there's you know there's so much more calm there's so much more to come but you're a bad motherfucker forests over there just just don't ever drill jiu-jitsu arrested on people but seriously I mean I'm super happy that you guys exist it's awesome for me a treat for me as a fan ixora having to work out with you preach and all the inside stuff it's very exciting so thank you much continued success gentlemen please come visit again I would welcome anytime okay thank you very much all right [Music]
