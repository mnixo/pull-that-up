hello freak bitches have to film it by 2018 you think Bert will still be fat 100% absolutely you're really committed to this of course man he's a guy with feelings I know and I love him he's one of my best friends I'd do anything for that guy if you're gonna get inside his head and change him yeah would you stop get him stop drinking no what about after January 3rd definitely not no I want him to be happy the only way he'll be happy if he keeps drinking absolutely maybe with new technology he'll figure out a way to fix your liver maybe though we'll have like a stem-cell liver cleanse and I'll just pump that shit in there way way into the bird is thin future maybe having something like that and maybe Bert will have to drink more because his liver will be so good yeah that the booze won't last sober up in the fucking party and harder he's a fun guy to party with oh yeah yes have you ever seen him do stand-up with a shirt on yes back in many times um I saw him for a while doing it he used to do it right he only started doing that I feel like about two years ago maybe three I feel like it's it's fairly recent in the time that I've known him and seen him to stand up and I think it was since then have you ever seen him do stand-up with a shirt on no I haven't either yeah it's it's it's uh but it works it's almost like part of the persona you know well it's like I forget when he didn't used to dude was he bigger than you or is it just me nah man no we're about the same about the same size how does his pants stay right above his dick like that that seems impossible seems like right there yeah but that in this different photo that's Luke Asher showing his goods ladies most is a funny guy two men he's got a new show coming out on Comedy Central yeah that's uh it's a really cool idea I'm sure we'll be back to talk he's a very smart dude yeah very very smart is that Bryan Callen showing his abs with Bert Kreischer right below that I was at Eddie IFFT oh it's Eddie IFFT see I'm so sorry Brian but when that's a little tiny image it does look like Brian can tell me does it him look at Eddie Eddie you shredded those bird looks good there no that's not true at all Eddie is a CrossFit shit oh is he loves cross we're just got that bloated distended thing though well then who's it's I'm saying that's it there's no way to get out of that I think he could what's he down to now was he claiming I don't know cuz he hasn't claimed in a minute well here's a photo that he keeps bringing out with him back when he was real thin yeah when he was really young like in college that's hilarious he's bringing that one out but getting back to that bro they were talking about what's going on in the Ohio River and that they're they're putting these catfish in lakes and they're taking them out of rivers are putting large catfish in lakes but they can't survive mmm they can only live in these lakes for so long but everybody wants to catch a big catfish so they have these commercial catfishing businesses where recreational catfishing whether they take these people and they'll have them fishing in these lakes and they use some sort of chemical in the lake that forces the catfish to bite yeah and this this chemical fish Bordello yeah it's a really gross man because it causes these legions on the catfishes skin so these people catch these cat fishes and they have catfish rather sorry and they have these red sores all over their body because some chemicals been introduced into the water which I guess the irritant causes them to like they're biting out of frustration I guess maybe the unspeakable and pursuit of the inedible what's just so bizarre like what a strange choice that people have decided let's take this animal out sit there there's one with legions on it oh yeah yeah we see another issue arises when bigger cat fishes are introduced into pay Lakes yeah so legs yeah they have these lakes it's so I didn't even know they I didn't even know there was a pail it look at all the spots on that one look at the fucking spots on that day and see if you find what it says that chemical is that they dumped into the water just go to the head of river in Virginia you'll catch a nice one I've caught 70 pounders well in a river really mm-hmm yeah I mean how many of them are fish you catch is a blue that's a white cat a white cat cause it's a big one white cats blue cats channel cat but yeah blues and whites are usually biggest did you like heads get really big too but they don't live in Virginia I don't think it's called juicing okay the chemicals they put in the water make the fish bite in the PEI lake industry it's called juicing oh weird look at the fucking lesions on that thing scroll up a little Jamie back up look at that the poor things body that's just wrong it's bizarre it's not just wrong it's bizarre I tell you I don't really understand how that ever got passed how people are like accepting that like that's a natural one the one below that this seems totally healthy that some got caught from a river so these pay Lakes is like I guess it's like a private land thing somebody owns them and it just keeps dumping these fish in there and apparently they don't live there very long they don'ts of fishing equivalent of it those little teeny high fence places you see in the east you know go hunt go hunt elk on 40 acres how hard was it for you to get sober huh fear was a big motivator in that for me you know losing my family was that was that was the thing that scared me so much that was the bottom I hid that my family's gonna go away because of my behaviors that I brought home from the road I got kicked out of the house by my wife I was living on my own somewhere and I you know I did not want that and maybe as part of my upbringing you know my family kind of disintegrated when I was a kid you know father left mother passed away I had to live with my brother and then kind of just all like the family you know where'd my stuff go where where it just kind of floated away and I do not want that happening you know no matter what's going on we're gonna talk this stuff out make it work you know my wife's of the same same idea same thought that you know her family she was the invisible kid too you know so we relate a lot so there's no way we're gonna let you know any argument get in the way or just you know we're survivors we're survivors and we're gonna we're gonna talk through it no matter how much and you know she she did the right thing she kicked my ass right the hell out of the house you know and that scared the shit out of me so and she said hey you're not just going to the therapist now in us that's talking about this you got to go somewhere and sort this shit out so that's what I did though rehab did rehab really worked for me telling Jeff to go for well what worked for me was seven weeks some place like basically tearing you down to bones ripping your life apart anything you thought about yourself or what it was anything you thought you had your family your career your anything gone strip you down to just okay you're born here's how you were when you were born you were okay you're a good good person let's get back to that again and then they slowly rebuild you and then I went to another they call him aftercare places I went there to a couple different ones and they find tombs stuff and get integrated back into life cuz when you're in this cocoon and you're your friggin raw I mean I was raw meat when I came out and you can see it in that some kind of monster movie I was pretty raw still I didn't know what I could or what I should or shouldn't do you know so the the last place we went to was a place that helps relationships so they got me and my wife together and we'd see see people separately and then come together and talk about what we did and communication friggin saved my life saved our family and working through that stuff so very grateful for my wife she's the one that didn't ask for this shit she walked through fire with me and we walked out together stronger way stronger than we ever would have been before and you know my kids know my story my kids know my struggles and they respect that they respect me in a different way I don't have to tell them what to do all the time or just be like I'm this it I can say sorry I can tell them hey here's what happened when I did that and you know I don't need to preach to him they got their own stuff but now they've now they goof with me I ruined my trust with my family and now by some miracle they are goofing with me it's like dad shut up what do you get my come on you know you're over blowing this your way out of dad you're taking up way too much space here okay so they helped me and I realized that there is help in a loving way [Music]
