turn on the lava-lamp he knows how to turn on everything is man young Jamie 3 2 1 I'm live with Nick Swardson former drug dealer Nick Telstra's tale Pallister tale is a view con wild it's a tale of youth gone wild how many people like broke windows because they heard that song wild finally somebody labelled it we all use go wild in songs could be inspiring in a bad way sometimes right yeah you do some stupid shit did you how many people carelessly whispered I know fuckin careless dude maybe people woke people up before they go go yeah welcome up they were not ready to go they don't plan on going solo god yeah just a lot of fucking people this year when you stop and think about George Michael Prince who was the latest one there was some big one Linkin Park just a minute ass that's right a faster that was a big one Chris Cornell both in the same way yeah and then Chester between it suicide on his birthday birthday dude yeah that was a really that was a weird one man that guy was 41 on top of the world the lead singer one of the biggest rock fans of all time but it's it's hard to say like what caused him to be so fucked up but most people point to he was like very sexually abused when he was a young kid and that just he never he just never recovered from that and you know you know yeah I never knew him but I had friends that really close without it they just said he was like the most gentle sweet guy fucking powerful voice man oh yeah I got shred food powerful yeah no it's horrible it's so hard for people to understand that you could be the lead singer of like I mean arguably one of the biggest bands of our generation yeah giant huge arena filled up there was a photo of him stand on stage with no shirt on in this massive arena show and everybody had their cell phone lights on you know people do that now instead of lighters oh yeah I was a kid I was a boy we didn't have cell phones we burned bodies we had fire and we had fucking fire hazards but he was we standing on stage I was like yeah that's the photo like look at that shit man that's no one could ever possibly imagine that that guy would not be insanely happy I mean look how many people love that guy you're just getting a tiny fraction of the love that mutt guy must have gotten and it still wasn't enough yeah yeah hard to understand I mean yeah that level of just inner sadness and darkness I mean good lord it's just awful the things that guy went through to get to that point and he had six kids yeah so I mean it's just like it had to be so much that even having kids and being when his kids wasn't enough fuck man that's a crazy picture though it's a sick photo oh mine all the way up in the rafters yeah I mean that's probably like 30,000 people or something crazy yeah well they're all the people that don't have phones yeah what's their deal losers maybe they're just cheap maybe they're like re maybe they just went flip-phone I can't handle it can handle the apps it's just too much too much temptation are is resisting and he's gonna be chopping his own wood soon Ari's gonna have a well I guarantee you are he's gonna he told me wanted to buy land and I was like you want to like build a house Heels no no no I just want to camp there it's like what buy land to camp on yeah he's gonna buy like land but he's not gonna build a house like land land or like re like stamping his kids can't they were calling it glumpy which is camping with come it was him Jay oakerson big J posted it on his Instagram page but he loves being outside he loves nature they just I mean I get it look if you can camp with you if you really don't need a house what do you need you need a trailer to keep your shit in you know like a trailer to put pots and pans in if ya ya if you still want shit you know that mean you can't can't have posters anymore but ya know posters you can put Farrah Fawcett on the roof of your tent puts the youth gone wild clothes her yeah how many fuck what does he just fucking go camping why do you have to like buy that to me that's not camping if you're if you own a plot of land and then you're just sleeping on it is that technically camping that's a very good point that's sleeping on your land that's like if you're hunting and there's a fence around the animals and you're only on one acre exactly is that really hunting fucking honey you just chasing down shit that can't run away yeah yeah you're cheating you're not camping no bears are gonna just wander up by your campsite nope that's part of the thrill of being a camper yeah you're out there for real in the wild yeah you can't be on your own little land unless your land is huge but then if your land is huge and yeah it's like say if you have like one of those ranches in Texas right ever see those you know Texas is like something insane amount of Texas is private land there's not a lot of public land in Texas it's it just all giant ranches and some of them are like ten thousand plus acres like 20 thousand a hundred thousand like you could camp there I guess because it takes you like three hours to drive across it that's weird can't drive to your house it's too much land it's too much right it's too much why do you need that much land how about Ted Turner doesn't that guy own like the most land of anybody in the country here today King Ranch sprawls eight hundred and twenty five thousand acres of South Texas land an area larger than the state of Rhode Island cattle and over two hundred quarter horses King Ranch is one of the largest ranches in the world today I wonder if they hunt on that ranch who a lot of us which Kings I'm fucking baller he might as well be a Keith the King of Rhode Island Burger King maybe it's a Burger King guy that is insane man that is insane no gay bars okay that's three or four in there for sure no gay bars but there's plenty of truck stops rest stops are like where they're at now they haven't really gotten to the full-on gay bar not full admittance they just wanted the meat at the rest stops yeah when we were kids that was like the thing like you'd always know that dudes would try to bang dudes at arrest a hundred percent like if you're at a rest stop and someone knocks on your door - dude he's looking to get a blowjob there's no rest there nobody's resting our widel dicks wide-awake and in your mouth they figure out to meet it rest up so I've always wondered like how does that work CB radio that's breaker breaker 1-9 I'm looking to suck some dick anybody out there hologram 69er 69er coming in breaker breaker 1-9 I like to meet in bathroom smell shit excites me was this Senator or whatever the politician was the the gentleman who got arrested in a sting operation because so many dudes were sucking dicks in the bathroom at the airport feels like there's nobody at Minneapolis where I'm from yeah the people called me about it I was like what the fuck I don't know hey man what's the comes up with your airport what's all is it how many taps it had to be so many people that they actually went and put a cop there to try to bust people I mean how many people have to get their dick sucked in a place before they hire a cop yeah we found a hot spot is Senator pleaded guilty reportedly after bathroom stall incident that's yeah arrest Minneapolis st. Paul Airport yeah and he was uh he was like tapping on the ground they had a way at dad it was a tap move yeah okay what is he said at the time of the incident incident I complained to the police they were misconstrue my actions I was not involved in any inappropriate conduct he said I should have had the advice of counsel and resolving this matter in hindsight I should not have pled guilty I was trying to handle this matter myself quickly and expeditiously I get it and I travel wearing tap shoes see part of me thinks this is hilarious but part of me is sad that this guy has to like hide what he's into and he has to hide in bathroom stalls and and learn some fucking secret tap and just smell farts from around the world as he's coming according to this report cited by roll call Craig tapped his right foot which the officer said he recognized as a signal used by persons wishing to engage in lewd but what if you were there and you just tap on your foot yeah what if you're just impatient cuz your shits taking other stuff next oh he also then entered the stall next door and blocked the door this luggage oh jeez what is that right how does the other people get in then oh my god what was he in there with somebody he was trying to block anybody from coming in oh my god he must have been just going to town on guys in an airport that was his spot people were kicking trying to kick in the door what was happening there yeah but how does like how does a spot become notorious like how does arrest it what does it say proceeded to swipe his hand on an installed divider several times I want to know what the fuck the cop was saying if he was like stop I can't do it here I can't suck your dick here we don't know what the cop was saying right the cop was totally leading him on I mean it sounded like he had the green light unless the guy's a total psychopath when you go into a stall with another dude and you stack up your luggage in front of the door that's a bold move that's weird it seems like you would only do that if you were emboldened didn't just tap his foot he touched the office there's foot with his foot he reached his foot all the way under here's my question we know cops are full of shit right just like people people are full of shit put cops are people not all cops a lot of cops are awesome we know some cops are full shit like when something like this happens I feel like that's one person versus another person I don't really feel like a cops word is worth more than a regular person's word because I think a cop is just a regular person right I think you should listen to them when they're doing the job but something like this it might have been exactly as this cop described but it might have been like that Baltimore cop that got busted planting drugs with his fucking camera get a body camera on and what he didn't understand is when you turn on a body camera it records 30 seconds before you turned it on so just in case you turn it on in a moment of duress with something Crazy's going on you know it shut the camera and you press on they can see someone committing a crime perhaps so you have a 30 second buffer I didn't know that he didn't know that either dude so they got on video 30 seconds of him implanting the drugs that he then pretended to find oh my god dude that's horrifying horrible fucking horrifying that's horrible see because because if if you're gonna be able to convict someone and this guy says this and that guy says that and who do you believe well I believe the copies an officer of the law that's crazy cuz it's just a person this is not a disrespectful thing against cops I'm not I'm not a disrespectful person no but that's the very amount of power is a scary amount of power and it's just a person now some people like I have a bunch of friends they're cops and they know how to handle it you know they've handled it and they've they get it they know what it is and they're real cool about it like Big John McCarthy the ref for the UFC he's one of the best examples Big John is a he was a serious cop and involved in some fucking hairy shit for years one of the nicest guys you ever wanted me and totally fair and reasonable guy and he was a guy you know that was like a bright and shining example of what a cop could be and if the world is filled with Big John McCarthy as cops it'd be a wonderful place I think we'd all figured out what cops are just people man especially when these cops are going into these situations like imagine me in a 21 year old guy or however the fuck old you are and all of a sudden you're working in like Camden New Jersey I get the fuck out of here you're not ready for that you're a regular dude and you're gonna get thrust into some chaotic almost semi war zone yeah in some of these bad neighborhoods these people after patrol yeah and just another world with another set of rules and just shit just going down and do you think you're coming up on is most likely a threat to your life you pull a guy over you're like you pull a guy over in a 65 Impala what are the odds that guy doesn't have a gun right you see like one of them lowrider cars and you see some some gangster looking fellows with some crazy face tattoos and shit and they're driving on those cars do you imagine having to pull over someone who you knew was probably willing to shoot you and you have to talk to them about their brake light being off or they were five miles an hour above the speed limit you know the videos you've seen videos of cops getting shot we have you know that that could happen you around people just lying all the time they're all lying yeah how many of them are telling the truth they talk to you 90 percent full show 90 percent so every it's just to us panic I mean like when I would get pulled over I mean like I panicked I fucking like yeah that cop that shot that chick the recent one where the woman called in Minnesota yeah she called for the police and then she came out and when she came out the cop shot her that to me is the perfect example of why like we should reassess what a cop is and reassess like how many people get to be cops it's an extraordinary responsibility you're putting on just any person an ordinary person I would say I think you have to be an extraordinary person to be a good cop for sure you also have to deal with the fact that there's been a lot of bad cops and there's a lot of prejudice against cops there's like two giant factors but I think that job where you decide whether or not you pull the trigger and end someone's life and you're a panic er you know you're a panic er you're not you're not a guy who does well in in confrontational situations right maybe you haven't been in a lot of conflicts maybe you've seen too much shit maybe you've seen too many people get shot maybe you're suffering from PTSD maybe you're on edge all the time maybe you have nightmares that someone's gonna take you out and then also in your in the hallway and this lady comes out or an alleyway and you shoot her and you're like what the fuck like you might not even saw her you know people have hallucinations under great duress like when they think their life is on the line they see things that aren't really there it happens to people all the time they'll they'll like mistake someone for something else they'll mistake someone for an attacker you know it's a that's fucking and I mean she called the cops crazy that's what's fucking insane to call nine-one-one because she heard what she thought was a woman being assaulted and then to approach the cop car and they get fucking shot phrasing I mean like what but it's what it is is people not handling pressure very well pressure is it's it is such a massive factor in the way people behave and there's no bigger pressure than you showing up you have bright shiny lights you're in the enemy car okay you're wearing the enemy enemy uniform and they know you have a gun and how many of them have watched so many videos on TV of cops planting evidence planting evidence of kids being shot by cops and stories were cops jobs on the back I mean like crazy shit yeah so you're dealing with the weight of that when you step out of your car yeah I mean that's anxiety 24/7 - that's a job that is insanely hard to do and we should we should figure out a way to re-engineer that position we should figure out a way to give them more help more support and explain like like the only way like cops and civilians are gonna get along is if there's no fuck-ups or very very few fuck-ups like anytime something like this happens you realize you gotta realize like you got a bad system like the system is you never just a regular person and give him a gun right kind of psychological training do they have have you seen what they what they're like how'd they get the gig if you seen what they're like under the gun have you seen what they're like when someone wants to beat their ass have you seen what they're like when someone is throwing punches at them trying to kill them some guy randomly right he answers a call he opens a door guys throwing bombs at him how does he what does he do how does he handle this does he shoot the guy does he run away can he fight back has he ever been punched right fuck man you're asking some regular person to just be involved in potential like civilian war zone on any given day like if you're in Miami Florida and someone gunshots fired in a warehouse like what are the odds these guys don't have like oops piles of cocaine in this warehouse yeah machine I've seen narcos come on man well that's the thing it's like you've never seen a mellow cop movie there's no like chill movie where it's like all right yeah the end it's like fucking not step smoking the Bandit it's pretty even then they drove recklessly nobody around yeah I mean nobody to hit all right I have a question for you okay what is this I hear about your dream pills those pills somebody said that you killed your it's alpha brain it's a nootropic what it is it's it's actually nutrients that are building blocks for human neurotransmitters okay like there's certain foods that are called we're I'm saying foods cuz you eat them it's their supplements mostly vitamins and there's minerals and a bunch of different things you can get from plants and there's a series of different kinds of nootropics and if you've never looked into it it's a cool thing to study these they're actually supplements out there that enhance your memory and enhance your reaction time as well like you know how you feel like if you're hungover or you wouldn't even know this is such a man of health and never drank but that feeling when you're like kind of foggy like cutting it were some days you just kind of it's not firing right so we know for sure this is like really obvious to everybody that there's a difference in your performance based on a variety of factors right right lack of sleep nutrition exercise stress there's a whole host of factors that affect how your brain forms nootropics what they can do is boost up your brain's ability to remember things like verbal memory is a big one that they show and we did two double-blind placebo-controlled studies about alpha brain it's one of the things we found we found memory reaction time and peak alpha flow state all improvements not like statistically significant improvements in those areas okay so what I found is uh there was a company called this neuro one is the supplement I forget its company but it's bill Romanowski you know Bill Rowan ass I know very well yeah that guy is Jesus savage Savage the player super savage and remember we're gonna talk about the new CTE study that just came out it's crazy with football players but anyway bill Romanowski he used to be friends with this dude Sarah and no name and no name was there were a cool radio station in San Francisco so love doing them and no name was friends with Romanowski Romanowski was training him he was like he was like trying to get him in shape it's like come on you fuck I'm gonna work you out and put him through a bunch of brutal workouts and then he gave him some of his supplement and that's how I found out about it and the supplement neuro one he invented because he was suffering from head injuries has been so made concussions man he's having memory problems and all sorts of issues so he started looking into nutritional like what's what helps boost neurotransmitters which helps boost serotonin there's right there's like 5-htp is a big one that helps boost serotonin and l-tryptophan as well because l-tryptophan actually converts to five HCP and then you have to add in a bunch of other shit like adaptogens and b vitamins and all these different things like there's a combination that you can hit of nutrients and bill Romanowski use I think he uses a little caffeine in his as well the level of anything to do with him by the way this is not an advertisement we don't sell neuro one but it's the shit it's really good and that's that that's the first thing I found out about it found out about that and then we wound up making alpha brain which is our version of it with a bunch of things that work together synergistically and if you take that stuff before bedtime a lot of times you get freaky dreams like if you take it like an hour before bedtime like right it seems like right when you go to sleep you know that's when it's just getting in your system and I guess when you go into your REM sleep just get an extra fucking fat juicy pipe of neurotransmitters to work with you start have a freaky ass dream there's this full inception yeah there's a bunch of piracetam is really good too people love that stuff love that choline choline is a big one that's one of the ingredients about these in Lucky Charms so what is half a million lucky charm very smart today they're basically you know it's their nutrient yeah no that's the trip no I was just a super sketch skeptical about this and you definitely should be you definitely should be I would never ever in a million years try to sell someone something that doesn't work honey I would have zero desire in doing that so everything that like we do it on it right I use yeah I use I or I believe in it it's like there's nothing there's no horseshit thing so when this whole nootropics thing came out we like we rushed and got alpha brain out and a lot of people called bullshit they're like like there's no studies this is no science it's a snake oil I was like oh you gotta have like all your ducks in a row right start claiming that you have nutrient of regardless of whatever anecdotal evidence you have use a good learning but I mean that's weird because people never just cry bullshit over stuff for no reason well never just go what no fuck that it's like everything that everything you don't happens what I saw Katy Perry sitting down with DeRay Mackeson do you say I'm akiza norm Adkison of black lives matter and Katy Perry was apologizing about cultural appropriation because I guess she wore braids for whatever fucking reason and she was sitting there is the weirdest thing ever man they're both on a couch and they have no shoes on and she's touching him and he's wearing a blue vest I was like what the fuck am i watching was that in a dream look here's the thing dude where's that blue vest everywhere I mean he loves that blue vest that's his look you know I'm saying fuck mr. rochester's first of all give the socks aloha socks it's strong confident man are they in the matrix those socks are rainbows homie what bitch colors there and so she's culturally appropriating a lesbian right now with her hair she should be careful she's recovery propriate literally an old lesbian she wasn't a hipster ass insane asylum that they're in that's her bathroom it's where she shits data that picture in the wall it comes down and she climbs on time shits in the mouth oh my yeah it's crazy it's a new thing all the celebrities you're doing like look how they're sitting here facing each other it's so bizarre I can't play you any of this because I don't want to get the video pulled off YouTube but it's mostly it's him sitting there listening to her just go like this barfing she just didn't want people to be mad at her for doing for wearing braids yeah for cultural was there is an outrage let's see what she looked like when she was culturally appropriate and cultural appropriation is so crazy the idea that you can't have braids if you're white not my god people just try and control people they're trying to control people once they're fucking $0.02 everybody wants to throw in and chime in yeah it's just everywhere everybody wants to be like I got I have something to say it's like all right well and everybody wants to be able to be mad they won't have a reason get mad yeah we talked about it earlier everybody was super super mad yeah we were talking about the behind the scenes stuff at and about how many different mindsets you have to kind of manage when you're working on a show and how many people are just looking you get outraged about stuff especially lately it's so it's a weird fucking time for this yeah no you can't joke I mean I I sent out like loose cannon tweets sometimes and I would do it more back in the day and then I just like the more you know you get shit-faced and I'm like please like write a tweet and I'm like I just I don't want to deal with what it's somehow somebody could I mean even like innocuous harmless instagrams and stuff people still like jump on them I'll be like yeah you know like I saw this bird know like what would you what kind of bird is that but what did you fuck it or I mean like why are you hating on the brim now I just sorry I just saw it don't you think though that for the most part most of the interactions are pretty nice there's just so sorry yeah right there's a small but those small percentage you don't forget no and it's it's just I mean it's the ones that are really irrational and the ones that always make me laugh or people it'll go like a comment or something and I don't really you know read comments like in an uber on a plane or something and I'll just like see check out the comments some he'll be like hey fuck you you're a piece of shit Mike alright I just like it and then they'll comment back like I can't believe you like that like I was just kidding like I'm a huge fan and I'm just like well this is just weird for me just weird you're just sending it you just wrote a whole thing about how I'm a piece of shit and I just liked it and now you're like no I just I just want to get you watching bomb yeah from their perspective like that's the best way to get him to respond like that's the best way like that way you know you'll you'll be you'll have your back up against the wall well it's like you said it's like when a lot of it stuff's positive and then the ones that pop or the people that are like hey your fucking face sucks wow you know the man that's so rude which it does your face does not suck that's DS dude you're fine dude first listen there's a lot of people out there with some fucked up faces that would kill for your phrase oh but no I was saying about dreams I would have liked when I was detox from like a fucking booze extravaganza and I would I would have dreams that's why I was intrigued cuz I would have fucking crazy dreams where I would be it would be so lucid I went riders in the storm right now that was like a like a mixed version yeah it was like elevator mushrooms like DJ version so you detox our detox not have these dreams and they were so loose and I'd be like walking around the dream and I'd be and I knew would know I was dreaming and I couldn't wake myself up and I would try to wake myself up so then I would try to like jump dive out of a window to wake myself up or try to like do something that will like jar me awake and then I would do it and then I would wake up and then I would be in another fucking dream do not be in my bedroom and I'd be like oh I'm gonna go up and get some water and then all of a sudden realized oh my god I'm still in the dream because this isn't the shit on my walls and I'd have to wake myself up again fucking gnarly dude like you psyched yourself out in the dream wake up wake up oh look you're awake yeah but it's really just more dream your way yeah so that's I was kind of fascinated by that it makes you wonder what is real if you could live in a perpetual dream what's going on there you're still there's something happening you're experiencing things there's this things are happening whether you're lying there with your eyes closed or not there's a bunch of shit it's going on a bunch of experiences that your senses are taken in that are pretty fucking remarkably similar to real life right like that's why it's so crazy because it feels real right that's why dreams like especially lucid dreams trip you out because it feels real it feels real but I liked it like when you dream like a really weird Jimmy just accept the reality of like like when I remember a drink I'll be like yeah I just totally was in the stream and just accepted that I was like riding a rabbit you know what I mean like over a fucking skyscraper to like save Katy Perry's face or something you know wasn't so except I'm like yeah I'm doing look at that fuckin beer that fabulous Morrison people didn't have beards back then either when he hadn't grew this beard the video is him and a fucking beautiful old Mustang being a bad motherfucker yeah beards really considered rogue back then oh yeah he was I was he was his rogue as it came man dudes used to pose dick out on stage went to jail for it he's driving to the Tempe improv right there I remember that he's gonna go see Joey how do we know what really goes on when you're asleep for eight hours how do we know when you're out cold when you call you're out right how the fuck do we know what's actually happening what's going on in these dream states because you only remember a fraction of the time you're out right there's a fraction of time what if dreams aren't fake what if they're just some alternative reality that you occasionally intermingle with when you're conscious or unconscious rather like when you go into a dream state maybe that's just like the shadow of something that just happened that was real maybe you have like these these moments that seem like eight hours to you or five hours to you but you're really interfacing with some completely different timeline and some completely different reality and the world is pliable it's not locked down like rocks aren't rocks and water isn't water but everything's fluid and changing constantly and that's why when you're in these dreams you freak out because all of a sudden like the physics of reality are gone you have like snapped you into it maybe yeah well you there might be a war look just the fact that this world exists in the state that it exists in this world is very very bizarre right if it wasn't real like this if reality wasn't real if we all lived in some sort of a black-and-white print version of life and then you got to experience the life that you and I know that's doing stand-up and being in LA and flying in planes and using the internet and experiencing life in the 21st century in 2017 you would be like this is the craziest psychedelic trip if you went to Times Square right would never you would never experienced anything like human culture and you went to Times Square you would be freaking the fuck out yeah that'd be insane it would be insane we're just so used to it we're so used to it we don't realize how bizarre the actual world is well yeah I mean it possible that these dream worlds that these are just different worlds you tap into when you conk out every night is a different world B could be infinite could be you're running a series of lives like you have multiple lives going on and your decisions you make in this conscious life affect all of them and maybe you have other lives when you're asleep there are conscious when you're awake but much like you're asleep and you don't remember what the fuck is going on when they're asleep they don't remember what the fuck is going on and you interface you might not just be nick swardson stand-up comedian got you might be an entity that interfaces with multiple different dimensions in the night and you just don't remember it just like you don't remember sleeping right you don't remember dreaming you don't remember a lot of shit that happens when you're conked out for eight hours right well they probably don't remember when you're awake and you're you're interfacing you're not just shutting off like your your brain wants to everything needs to shut off so that your other self in this other dimension can interact and can go about it's its world and maybe eight hours to it is a month or a week to us we don't even fucking know maybe that's a huge important part of being a person is that other world has to hasta coincide with it maybe that's why Michael Jackson died because they gave him that shit that conked him out that didn't you don't dream under that shit they would basically put him under anesthesia every night and he wouldn't get to interface with the other world all right I gotta go no you never know I'm fascinated by dreams they fucking are weird man but I mean yeah that maybe they do mean something maybe there's another most likely not I mean just covered in spiders and screaming I think that's basically well you can wear a role you work out stuff in your dreams sometimes like you'll experience I work out something but I don't I don't work out every man dreams that's a good point I've never fucking ever worked out and in a dream I've never done that either that's fucking crazy I realize that I used to throw kicks in my dreams I used to like when I was young especially my girlfriend's would complain that would like twitch I'd like literally like throw a kick I remember when bill pair of make jokes about it like it sound like a Bruce with Bruce Springsteen song throwing kicks in the night let's get old ice house chronicles we went on a whole rant about it that's a lot of guys have that problem like fighters have that problem good my fucking old roommate New York we couldn't wake him up you had to you had to like throw something at him from like across the room and then hide because he would wake up in an immediate melee it was immediately like game time and we thought we found out the hard way we were like hey wake up and it was just ding ding dings and it was just like if you would just it would take him like fucking like 15 seconds to like come back down oh my god yeah so I don't know what everyday alternate every fucking day what if it alarm clock will come up it wakes up swinging or no that's be a person it would have to be a person so I just put an alarm clock next to him we couldn't afford it we were the alarm clock the bloody alarm clock some people don't like to be woken up man that gets super mad at you and other people just chill like hey what's up yeah what's going on man why you guys wake me up hey man why are you naked you ever seen someone get knocked out and they ask questions they think like what's going on here so it's the weirdest thing like what why are you guys here like why are you guys staring out I've seen it before but I've never not in front of me dude it's weird it's weird the brain human brain when it gets shut off and then comes back on it's almost like an old Windows 95 computer when it reboots and you see the DOS thing you see the what is that the black with the white screen the boot screen yeah is it dot the DA screen and then you see it would take a long time to boot up and be all janky and shit and you wouldn't be able to click on the internet yet it was like when you get clanged like I imagine football players it's the same thing but they oftentimes don't remember shit they don't remember anything that happened they might not even remember like getting into the ring they might not remember any well I was gonna say I mean you've seen so many fighters go through it do they do they ever remember the knockout some of them do yeah some of them remember everything they remember seeing like oh fuck like the last moment where he's like he caught me yeah and they're just out yeah they remember getting hit they remember what hit them some of them some of them don't remember anything that's the thing about brain damage it's it gets completely variable it's variable like there's some guys that just they've been knocked out a ton of times and they're okay it's weird like Alistair Overeem's perfect example he's been knocked out of gang at times and he's fine like at least he appears to be he's very lucid right articulate I mean he's he's got his composure but after fights he doesn't you know like when you get cracked like he got knocked out when he fought steep a Miocic and this is not his fault and I said after this that I don't think we should interview fighters anymore after they get knocked out because he said that he thought that Steve Bay tapped he thought he had the guillotine and Steve pate Taft he was saying that in the replay so we had to play the replay back cuz we didn't know if he was right I'm like we'll play it because he was saying this to me while I was interviewing him that's why so we played it and you couldn't see the tally I think he believed it yeah it's just because he just got knocked out yeah no that's not a good idea to interview people have to get knocked terrible I thought it before but I never I really you know it's like I just felt I felt bad like I had to play the video because he said that it happened so if he said that it happened my job as an interviewer is to play that video right I just expected him to say something along the lines of you know I thought I had him you know if you could remember the fight I thought I had him but he got him he got me fair play to him you know the normal no stuff give him a chance to represent themselves so when that was going on it was like okay this is not fair this is like he's he just got knocked out cold there's no way like three minutes later yeah no way no way and then everybody gets mad at him for that you know you can't get mad at someone for that oh it's too weird yeah so this study came out today Brendan Schaub sent it to me because he's freaking out it said that what is it something like 97% okay that they examined 111 former NFL players only one didn't have CTE Wow not only that they found that 87% of people who play football at any level had CTE this is what's really crazy man who played football at all levels all levels for like so I assume that's gotta mean like high school including high school oh yeah it's good yeah and who is that guy Jamie we talked about this before forgive me for I'm not a football fan I like football but just don't know enough about it who was that guy that jumped on the car that's right Chris Henry is his name yeah that guy was young and like a super stud athlete right I'd have been like 25 26 I'm like that when they did an autopsy on him they found he had severe CTE it was like this guy's brain is wrecked like popo see if you could pull that study out because people were super shocked because he was in his prime yeah I mean he was in his prime and he was a super athlete yeah I remember that I mean you Jamie you know a lot about football what how much of a badass was he Oh as far as like top wide receivers he wasn't maybe like in the top ten but yeah he was no he was sorry yeah he was starting to get to come into his own and area he died in a traffic accident had chronic traumatic encephalopathy I always fuck that up encephalopathy and set in Sep encephalo encephalopathy encephalopathy right in said low Pappy encephalo encephalopathy encephalopathy boom oh my god it's got to be neurosurgeons going crazy right now shut the fuck up you idiots you can't even pronounce a word a former degenerative brain damage caused by multiple hits to the head at the time of his death according to the scientist had brain injury research center a research center affiliated with West Virginia University the guy says in quotes we would have been very happy if the results have been negative of multiple areas of Chris Henry's brain showed CTE and then they go into details about it so you got to think like here's a guy who's in his prime 28 years old right just bad motherfucker huh and he's not showing any signs of like falling apart and he's got C CTE it's not scary well I mean it makes you think I mean I talked about that was a lot of my friends I'm a big NFL dude die-hard football fan and we were talking the other day like I did does it continue I mean like 25 years from now it's for the lot of these guys well yeah but I'm saying like this NFL I mean oh I see what you're saying does the NFL continue I mean at some point these studies and these things are going come out and it's just gonna be you know it's horrifying think you're better off fighting I think you can get knocked out and fighting and you definitely a brain damage and fighting but I think if you become like a Mighty Mouse like if you get to a skill level that very few people get to when you're at a super elite skill level I think you probably take less damage it's hard to say because there's been some fucking wars with elite I mean the Mighty Mouse thing might be a bad example because he's so fucking good a lot of his fights are just mismatches right you know it's not like there's another Mighty Mouse out there that's trying to fuck him and like someone and everyone can't be the Mighty Mouse I'm saying like it has to be there's gonna be like various levels of competency across the board but like if you could fight the way that guy fights like he doesn't he's not a brawler he's not doing anything stupid he's not just like biting on his mouthpiece and throwing bombs he's super technical in his approach he's like a consummate professional and like a strategic wizard and how he approaches interacting with guys who almost strategically wizard all that was a selfie I caught that though you miss wizard at all of your chance but what he does is just the probably the safest way to do it the smartest way to do it because he's just so competent that he's not getting hit and he's is his tactics are so clever and so skillful that he's able to like avoid a lot of like big bombs that come his way right football players aren't avoiding shit know you're getting hit ever getting hit you're getting hit like there's no Mighty Mouse in the football world right if you're a linebacker you're fucking hitting people they're hitting you you're hitting them peer if you're on the line you're not if it's not stop I mean - not just that it's not even getting hit in the head they're saying doing this like slamming in here that's your cherish neck and jerks your head and all that stuff just the sheer impact the alternative they just started this weekend this is like the pilot what they're calling the American flag football league so there's like some former NFL players in this why don't they just blow guys on the field I don't know if this off you know yeah that's that's not football that was depressing why'd you do that you can't have no one that guy knows while he's doing it but I'm figure skating we need to get something more manly I like their helmets or lack thereof though I like that I think that's very smart you know if we just doesn't write the helmets those are rugby helmets right we're not really helmets the headgear this they more protect your ears and all that gonna help them if they have head grounds maybe I guess maybe a little no just wear earmuffs they still have those things in when I compete in the Taekwondo days the guys got knocked out and one of the real horrible things was they got kicked in the head and knocked out they're usually out cold and their head would bounce off the ground so depending upon like where the fight was taking place most the time there was no surface like we would fight like on an actual basketball court like there's a video of me fighting on an actual basketball court you can see the lines on the court it's solid wood right and then you kick a guy and they fall back and their head would bounce off the off the wood and it was terrible like some people got knocked out and it was horrible so they started making people wear first it was a headgear that you could just wear on the back your head literally just to protect you when you got knocked out so that your head didn't bounce off and then some guys they started making you some guys voluntarily did it you started making you wear the bigger all-inclusive helmet so it's a big foam protectant around your head like the thing you buy at football games like a foam no it's like you could find it pull up taekwondo headgear it's like your face is exposed but like you have like these things that cover your ears and the foam all over the protects your head that's what it looks like that's exactly it looks like there's an adidas one so it's like see how it's got the foam around the ears and the foam on the top of the head that your face is completely exposed and most I don't know what that one is that's not a it's like a year one Friday the 13th the one you had on it's perfect that's a real talk window mask the white one or that red one there's an adidas one yeah so that's in those are World Taekwondo Federation ones some of the International Taekwondo Federation ones those tournaments a lot of them they did differently and they they did fuck and they stuck old school a lot of times I remember they still had the the wood floors and there was no headgear they but I think they probably change them as time goes on but they those those head gears were designed really mostly to protect you when you got knocked from your head bouncing off the ground then they started making people find on pads too after a while they changed the floor yeah I mean yeah heads is key yeah fuckin hardwood yeah it's the being I fought on the fucking since I meant a hockey rink a hockey rink that didn't have any water in it they put a tarp down my god they put a tarp down we fought on concrete it was hard well I put the tarp down if I saw three people get knocked out two and one dude who got knocked out his eyebrow bounced off the off the concrete like you know there was basically just like the whatever the bottom of a ice skating rink would be you would drink it was for the Bay State Games to was a big tournament it was a big deal because the Bay State Games is the Olympic Festival and it was the first time and I think only time they ever had Taekwondo in it if I if I welcome it was gonna guess I think I was 19 so it was like 86 so uh these guys yeah there's one it's Google - Taekwondo tournament kids on a hardwood floor see this might be it might be a tournament where they spar or it might be a tournament where they know that looks like they have headgear on the ground right they have they do swarms turn oh yeah little red thing right yeah those are head gears what's the little bar behind it I don't know what the fuck that is they're like a floaties for a pool I don't know what that is that might be a different kind of tournament there might be a point tournament I think it's floaties Fighting's a new it's a new sport that comes up dildo whipping so I was I was thinking about this this past weekend I was talking to somebody about that brown bunny movie we've talked about that movie before that's that Vincent Gallo movie where he sucked then he was it with Chloe Sevigny who you said it perfect I've never said it right ever I'm very a trickle Joe are seven yeah seven yeah yeah and we were talking about how that it fucked his career for sure and probably fucked her career for a few years - right I did yeah I mean he was so promising to be like a lead gargoyle but he was freaky dude yeah out there I mean like I had friends that were friends with him years ago and they're like this it's just on another planet you know like of course I mean you got his dick sucked in a movie for real and you guys dick sucked by a movie star that's not just like getting your dick sucked I mean she's had a really good career though she's done a bunch of shit since then yeah that was a while ago so she I don't know out of the loop so what was what has she been in fuck she's one of those chicks like pops up and she's on an HBO show I think she was on Big Love I feel like ever she was a lot of good indie films but I feel like I remember there was some baggage to her in the beginning my wrong shoes and kids was her first thing Wow she was in a movie called three needles that sounds hilarious dude kids is heavy yeah shadow glasses dope was a party monster hold on sorry she Jenni and the girl the main girl Jenny and forth come on kiddo horoscope before us got fucked her on camera I don't remember kids I just remember yeah she was the chick that got AIDS yeah yeah I think so yeah that scene they dude fucks her while she's asleep like don't worry it's just me Caspar yeah she's got AIDS and the ideas she gave him AIDS joke's on you screenwriters what was the telling and he was in the wire yeah everybody said that I look like him when I was in high school I remember that I was like great click on that what year was that movie doesn't boys don't cry American Psycho she's done some shit dude yeah but when did all that stuff happen like when did the the brown bunny movie happen you know you just back up was right there go back fast unless bro right up there yeah there it is okay so she's got an Academy Award winning movie boys don't cry yeah then she's like time to fuck no it looks like time to fuck was before that no no brown bunny is fucking after so I was brought Bush don't cry that's down there no it's it goes lower I'm going the wrong way I was thinking the top was the more recent ones Wow yeah yeah that's a crazy choice so she's still done a bunch of stuff since brown bunny she did zodiac I mean yeah she's a big love but not her agent must be so confused so what do you want to do he had a real he had a real backlash who write Vincent Gallo didn't he uh yeah I mean I think he's one of those like self imploding dudes I don't think he was ever really like he did Buffalo 66 was actually a cool movie she never stopped working so you go 2003 killing it yeah so it didn't impact her negatively maybe he did I don't know but she still worked but you don't really hear about that dude anymore and before that movie he was like he was a big he was in Buffalo 66 remember that yeah that's a great fucking movie I just said that Joe did you say yeah are you so sorry in a dream state I was trying to remember let's try to remember what we're just yeah Buffalo 66 is cool him and ricci dude I didn't hear you say that I feel embarrassed I wasn't listening to my Oprah cardinal sin of conversation I was just struggling with my memory it's all right ironically enough after telling you about nootropics yeah my for helmet no I did yoga today drain my brain I'm a 15-percent stupider when I do yoga I want to get back and doing yoga 15% stupider away for like four or five hours after yeah it's wrecked yeah hot yoga like my breath oh god my brain cooks I did that once and then uh I was like I'll try it my sister talked me into it and I was 15 minutes into it and I thought we were done and I was like all right and then I got up and I'm like we have to be done and the woman was like no way look another 45 minutes I'm like well you fucking do like I like I just got out of there it was so intense as I had done yoga a couple of times I got in cocky and it's you know I really liked yoga like kind of Center me and showed me the fuck out you know yeah and I tried the hot shit and it was just not cool man it was too intense its intense like you definitely I was dizzy and but you know what it is dude it's not the best if you have to use your brain right afterwards for like really solid like three or four hours but it is really good in terms of like overall right overall the overall your health and the way you interface with the world you're way more chilled out if you do it a lot yeah but face so you did it and immediately got in your car and then drove away what else should I do stay pent up a lot of water land lump I should glump in that area yeah you know took a shower and got the fuck out of there got some neat did you shower I did of course got it that's what yeah I think there's something really good for your body though that especially that hot one I think that 104 degrees and stretching out just think it makes you more pliable definitely makes you more flexible like when you're doing it you can get into positions that you can't get into when you're cold so that means to me like there's some there's some sort of a benefit and being like really warm in terms of pliability the muscle tissue yeah 100% 100% that's so many questions I mean it wouldn't be that popular if it weren't it didn't have some kind of effect yeah even like you know it's like even like getting in any situation when you're cold and stretching and trying to do anything active it sucks sucks yeah yeah yeah you can't you don't perform at your best once eighty below zero outside yeah like I got a massage the other day and it was freezing in the air-conditioned then I stopped the guy and I'm like what the fuck you doing then you never say quiet did you try to get some no no but I was like what the fuck man like turn this off a friend of mine his girlfriend was a masseuse at one of those Burke Williams places or something like that you know might not have been that place but it was like a high-end spa place and they had it at one of them dudes go cuz he had up he was running a whole prostitution ring in there where guys would come in really and it was like I lived like a name-brand place yeah like a legit place yeah he just developed clientele that knew that he would suck their dick he'd give you a massage and suck your dick like he just had the market cornered I guess I guess it was a win-win he like sucking dick and he wanted to make some money for massages so his books were Phil fucking Ari I'm saving up for that land gonna pay for it so that land ain't gonna suck itself [Music] yeah so if I can just plug my show typical Rick's season to already cancelled I already told you that yeah you told me that so I was just saying speaking of our day and I'm glowing relationship with Comedy Central at least they gave a shot how long did have any episodes did I do before he canceled it we did two seasons the six episodes each you can still watch it but it's not going further what is it a surprise to you that they cancelled it no no no that we had a show that we wanted to do we wanted to bring you on to do something that was called bro Sasson and it was about a guy who's raised by an assassin and then he get the the assassin dad feels bad that his son never had a real life he just grew up in a Sasson environment the jungle so he sends him to college and becomes like the ultimate frat dude but he moonlights isn't assassin still but he still likes frat guy during the day oh good and that was me and I would like sleep in the base like in the Attic and then I would be an assassin and like on the down-low at night but I was always too high or hungover too drunk Wow and we wanted you to be one of the guys that would be a recurring assassin dude up man call me social about it in the room that I wrote the pot the script every day was like this is hilarious and they were like now they just passed on it whoa yeah I was like all right cool good talk when I rewrote it for free and they're like yeah we still don't want to do it I'm like well why'd you buy it they're like I don't know I was like cool see you guys later good talk it's hard hard being an executive imagine some of the bad shows that come their way they probably get so confused you know it's probably like bad cops like network executives like we get mad at them because they fuck shows up or they put in their own input or do you imagine how many bad shows come their way how many just terrible ones think about the ones that are on the air and they're thinking about forgetting their job fired the show's gonna get cancelled people gonna lose money they're gonna be out of a job they won't be able to pay their mortgage like fuck there's all this pressure on them fuck you know I can't well buy it we'll buy it Nick will have the show well I hate the show I hate it too okay sorry dude okay can I precise it like these people are on adderall they're all tweaking their work they're working 10 12 hours a day and adderall is a lot like meth if you don't know that folks one of the one of the key things with people they do when they do meth is shit at decision making the decision-making turns to shit cut to headline Joe Rogan says all network executives are doing meth that's how I wish that's how it works Wayne I have a buddy of mine who's a writer and he told me everyone's on it I said really he goes yeah it goes I just know so many journalists are on it so many writers are on it they're all on adderall well especially I mean in Los Angeles just like in terms of what I've seen socially out and about I mean holy shit every chick is on adderall it's like fucking nuts I've never I've done it once and I was just shit-faced somebody gave me of course I put it my mouth and then I just I didn't really feel it but you know kind of made me a little bit more alert like kind of Cokie but it wasn't anything special but I have friends that they just they take it constantly yeah it depends I'm sure on the dosage depends on the person pants and how you can handle it maybe you can hit maybe some people it's super beneficial and they can actually handle it nuts I'm not saying it's not I'm just saying for sure there's some abuse going on I know people that abuse well yeah I mean certain things are made for a certain purpose you know I mean like when you make a pill that helps people like focus and certain situations easy folks yeah that's not what you fucking take it Coachella with like a bottle of fucking fireball that's not why anybody made it they weren't like yeah this is a pill that you take at a music festival with fire ball creaming along yeah [Music] no Skid Row yeah let's get ro right yeah isn't it yeah yeah I try to karaoke Skid Row once I was a fucking horrible mistake I try to karaoke that song I will remember you and it fucking goes on for like six minutes and I had no larynx I was like crying blood it was horrible I drove by the hotel the other day where Jani Lane died you know Jani Lane the lead singer of warrant she's my hotel right over in Woodland Hills how'd he die vegetables he ate too many vegetables no dude it was all salads in his house what his place was filled to the wall with salad oh my god fucked up man he got too healthy he's so healthy drink too much water you ever heard of that people dying from drinking too much water yeah like frat hazing and shit like that when they have water chugging contest super bad folks do not do that you you can get to a state where your body literally can't process all the water inside of it and you die you can fucking what ie die wondering to what is water how does it kill you it ruins your organs or your heart I do not know we should find that answer do you drown that's a good question something happens some sort of toxicity some of some effect of the water that's in fuckin Aqsa t sounds smart we say toxicity it's a good word to throw in if you're in the middle of words right we're dealing with a lot of issues and you know the random toxicity of the environment how many central are they gonna keep going with this is not happening without re is that the deals are gonna keep it on the air season and that's it I don't know there's a fucking genius idea what to take him off that show yeah it's so fucking weird it's genius what pull him off of his own I wish what you talk about why it happened we can't I wonder if we can now that he's got a special on Netflix I have to ask for permission but the store is ridiculous it's hard man like I said hard being an executive hard being at what we call a content provider Nick I believe you're a Content provider we got to provide with Comedy Central but I mean I'm just saying in general I don't think it's that hard if you have talent that is proven that you trust like find a network and you brought me a show that would for me there would be a 90% chance that would go to pilot for sure because all I need is Nick to become an executive I'm figured out my career path okay as I was playing the at the odds before they weren't ninety ten it wasn't that good it was like you know 50/50 so I like the odd so do you think you could maybe do that from just quit my for me yeah for you Joe yes I will sign up for corporate America decided like I don't like the shows your pick and I'm gonna be one of you I'm just I've not not thought about doing that because I'm not here I have so many friends we all this we're all from the same talent pool of comedians and writers and stuff were like everybody has stories but it's like yeah I pitched this I'm like that's fucking hilarious like yeah it's fucking they were like now I don't get it well why don't you just start doing shit on your own because like we mean it was Simon Rex in particular I feel like you guys could easily do that on your own and put it on YouTube and I bet it would be giant we could I mean we're gonna try to shop it around to a couple other networks and I get involved with other people because we already have established contents we already have two seasons and it's it's already there so we just need something to go like yeah we get it well do you own it like you could bring it somewhere else yeah because it's just through streaming which you know comments which was obviously like cool enough to give us that and that's all the executives got fired because one Jesus Christ you're just gonna check it away well sure it's gonna go on vacation have you heard about his dreams man he's kind of crazy man yeah man got a Do It Yourself you know it's not their fault even it's like counting on them to know what the fuck they're doing they know what the fuck they're doing would they really be a TV executive who wants to do that how many people want to do that I mean it they might think they want to do it but once you realize like the stress involved fuck all that man it doesn't seem that complicated though really do I don't think so I mean if you have people that you know someone could bring you sign Feld and friends and you know the whatever name some other show bring some big-ass Frasier some big-ass sitcom cheers Cheers perfect example and you look like a goddamn genius he's the guy who got cheers in the air whoa but you could have just got lucky they could have brought you the fucking Sex in the City or the single guy or a lot of sitcoms and everybody forgot they could have brought you a lot of bullshit the musical there was a lot of bad coach you know I remember coat I liked codes shut the fuck up fuck is wrong with you man my bad bad experience well that's you that's don't put that on coach the guy was a writer for that show I'm gonna sitcom that I did it's like whoo just act it up act it up just swing in with the old double-edged broadsword chop chop I would say but that's a different conversation a network major nekkid like in one of those Maine like NBC CBS like that's so arbitrary and what's gonna be a hit yeah but what they bring you like is your I mean obviously I'm saying people yeah for sure but even talented people occasionally create turds of course right so if you're a crapshoot I'm not saying fuck it I've seen there's different levels of like what could you know what's got a better chance like it bring something with a vision and it's really you know like you or you're passionate about it I would go okay Joe is bringing me this impassioned idea that I think is funny I'll give him a pilot so the thing is about shows this is the really hard part about shows you're develop you're developing them while you're presenting them so like the show starts out it's a new show you're trying to develop the characters you develop the way they interact with each other while you're putting it on the air like creating any pretty on the air like as time goes on things get like you saw like Seinfeld like in the later years or friends a perfect example right everybody knew the characters everybody just flowed together you knit like even though there were new scripts like the thing was so established like what was funny about it and how it worked when you're creating a new show they're always like fire and pee like that Kevin James show like they're they're like they change out they'll swap out the wife and like they did it on bewitched get her out bring a new one in and you need a black neighbor like okay you need a game friend and then like right then you know when it's not working everybody wants to throw their fuckin jizz into the soup mix like I know the fucking perfect thing this is missing and that that's that's what happens with those shows right they all just get souped they just get all these different opinions until they take out like South Park they don't listen to shit you know listen to anything but that's my point is that if you comment major networks is different like the cable networks save a little bit more leeway where it's like you know if somebody comes in with if talent comes in with a strong idea and a strong script and a strong vision and stuff like that I think that's different right with networks you're getting you know a bunch of major show runners with an idea and you know they're trying to fit into a formula yeah that's different it's still hard it's still hard but it's I'm just saying there's different percentages of it ya know for sure I mean South Park came in they were like I mean I remember stories where they were like they didn't get any notes they were like they don't even live here I don't think I think they live in Colorado or something they were just like yeah well we're gonna make this show that just like stay the fuck away let's probably did move well yeah they're from Evergreen it's like one of my favorite places ever did you ever see the original wall what would Brian Boitano do yeah of course that is that's how they got started and that is to this day like one of the funniest fucking things I've ever seen in my life when someone gave him user actually a girl I was dating she was an agent's assistant and she got a VHS copy of it and she she brought it over my house and we watched together we were fucking crying just falling on the ground crying he was so silly and Jesus versus Santa yes that was insane I didn't say big I got the VHS tape in like 1996 and I said that's exactly what that's the time somewhere around there and I had that VHS and I would watch it I was like what this is insane it's kind of funny because it's like much more shitty animation and drawing even than the current one which is crazy hard to believe you know you watch it it's like you're watching like ancient like you like ancient cave art of Jesus or something you know I mean it's like it's weird when you're seeing this old way they used to draw everybody in comparison to the new voices are so good he's amazed yeah they're genius those guys are amazing Trey Parker did the voice in this new what was the fucking animated show that I watched he did the voice of someone and then a despicable me yet that's what it is Despicable Me yeah they realize yeah yeah I saw it with my kids it's hilarious those despicable meats all really good even if you're a full grown adult they are fucking fun movies like my kids love them but I actually love them they're fun those movies are good man you saw the third one I saw Mom I've seen first to have kids bro I've seen it multiple times holiday kids I saw underwear man oh yeah Captain Underpants or something like that I think was underwear man called Captain Underpants yeah there's a made a movie out of it I'm probably not gonna see that by myself I'd be super weird some guy just watching captain they make good fucking kids movies today those despicable Me movies are good movies yeah they're really well done so the third one holds up third one holds up it might be strongest one a lot of people don't like the minions one they're like I'm tired of those little fuckers like they need the other guy grew to balance out the minions yeah I can't just have the minions minions went rogue yeah all these fucking assholes people didn't like it I found it I think it was good I enjoyed it I found an entertaining fuck fuck the minions well like Toy Story dude Toy Story 3 was like one of the best movies I've ever seen right yeah it was good yeah I wept yeah they were dislike some dark moments when the teddy bear is trying to fucking throw them in the incinerator yeah that was intense intense shit lots of bear lots of high like that did you see babe the UH talking pig movie yes Giroux seat babe pig in the city part 2 I don't think of it alright see that movie they decided to take the talking pig like broad farm movie throw them in the city where some of the dogs are prostitutes it goes so fucking rogue it's amazing you'll love it I'll text you remind you oh my goodness it E and there was a big outrage cuz it was so like aggressive and weirdly that's super dark and trippy whoa big pain there dogs I swear to God yeah it's nuts look at that's one of the hooker dogs Oh Mike and the pink that is hilarious look at that harlot that's hilarious yeah weirder dogs man they used to be wolves they scare the shit out of me figured out a way to turn them into that and have them live with us I think about that when I'm around my dog cuz my I got a new dog recently seven months old now I got him a few months back and he's a golden retriever okay it is the least wolf-like dog that has ever existed on the planet this dog has like zero aggression in him like even when he play fights like play fight with another dog just like zero threat of anybody getting hurt it's like there's the the mellowest comest and you guys think like somehow or another people figured out how to take a wolf and slowly whittle it down until you make that right like what what was he eating they probably gave him some weird fucking shit mess with his brain dunno it's just breeding they figured out a way well I mean I think that life is crazy pliable and where you have the best chance of success I mean obviously it's not my theory but where life has the best chance of success it kind of molds itself to that whether it's by putting people in colder climates making their skin lighter so they get bet more vitamin D because there's no Sun out so to say that the atmosphere related could be yeah and the atmosphere of a dog is the only way a dog got food it had to be super cool with people so the dogs that were cool with people are the ones that stuck around and they kept breeding and breeding and the ones that are the coolest with the people the ones that got fed the other ones got shot and killed and they didn't get the breed so it's always like the ones of the coolest with the people that got closer and closer to the campfire and they got the scraps thrown their way it was a sweet deal you bark and they they're cool with you and they give you free food and you keep the fucking wolves and the Bears from eating them and you bark bark bark when anything comes and they could be alert that was a whole deal with people in wolves and and dogs and so they figured out a way over countless generations to turn that wolf into this fucking dog like into a poodle like they figured out how to do that and I mean it's just life adapts it finds some weird ways through the next thing you know you're holding a french bowl like what the fuck that used to be a wolf like Oh a wolf got whittled down to it I'm not no disrespect to French bulldogs they're adorable I love those little dogs but it's like how the fuck did that even happen yeah you never see like stone like cave drawings of poodles didn't exist look like perfect pom pom like ankles and shit you know what they found out about dogs it's really fucked up is that all of them came from wolves they thought there was like that like dogs came from like Oh a bunch of different wild canids you know a bunch of different like African dogs and different dogs nope nope all of them came from wolves all of them that's super weird dude well then a wolf like fucked a frog or something there's no way a fucking pulled dog just comes from a wolf it does slowly but surely over thousands of years they turn a wolf into a bulldog it's nuts are we gonna go back to wolves do you think we could turn into jello for sure we could turn into some cube-like thing that sits in a hard form that we carry around if people found out hey man you can't break your bones if you don't have any you can move things telekinetically now and everyone's gonna fit into this fucking cube and we just would be a square thing with no bones just slops right into this just indestructible plastic barrier that you can carry around in life until you wanted to fuck and then when you wanted to fuck you guys would get close to the bed and then you would just ooze out on top of each other you would like open your doors together and just ooze on top of each other my entire family in Arkansas they just escaped do that yeah zip pills it's everything Hill's got him skittles I don't dog scare me because the dog bit my balls when I was a kid I was playing wiffle ball in my front yard and I'll never forget it and I rounded third and a dog lashed out and punctured my scrotum and I ran into the house and I pulled my pants down and my mom and they just sit so i dog them always to this day every time I walk past a dog I'm horrified yeah dude yeah not cool yeah that ain't cool maybe I will be a jello guy yeah for sure no balls to worry about it's a better path than getting bit in the nuts by a dog yeah if you have no organs okay nothing can break down you're just a giant hive of tissue and everything now a dream but it's a dream that you can control they've got to the point where you don't need a physical structure you don't need skulls and organs and livers all that stuff is handled exogenously they bring in things they bring in like these connection these tubes that link up to you and then slowly our bodies devolve to the point we don't have organs anymore we rely on all our organ functions to be handled outside of the body by machines cuz it's way more efficient and it allows you to stay in the dream state and control your life do you have eyes now dude there's no need you see way better in the dream state you have a mass of cells that somehow or another contains consciousness that interfaces with the dream state 24/7 okay I wear a hat you can but doesn't matter you can be a jello shot you can but you know it's not a lot of juice there you want to be a big fat tube like a garbage dumpster filled with cells the more cells maybe you have the more horsepower in the dream dimension right that's hot to make sense right yes obviously well we're definitely devolving right if you go from like if you look at other primates like primitive primates you'll get orangutans and gorillas and they would fuck us up we're so weak compared to them right so if you were obviously like the weakest by far of all the primates other than like little tiny monkeys yeah for sure so by far our bodies have gotten weaker and OER and less capable and like our tendons are not the same there's so much stronger than us so there's something that's happening to our body where it's getting like smolder and softer and weaker and they have a plant-based diet gorillas do yeah chimps eat the fuck out of everything though they eat they're more closer to us they're horrifying remember that story about the guy who brought his chimp a birthday cake mm-hmm and the monkey attacked him and then bit his nose off his fingers and ripped his penis off yeah bite his fingers off but his fingers are bit his fingers off and his nose you know the story yeah they tore his face apart he was jealous the month the chimp that it was jealous because he brought a birthday cake to a chimp that used to be his see the chimp used to be his and say the worst is that it is that the story the chimp used to be his and he brought the chimp to a sanctuary when it got older because as they get older they get super sketchy they start biting people's fingers a lot of jaws I'll know they get super aggressive and the consequences of them being aggressive or so ferocious don't don't show me any pictures please I didn't want to see it yeah it's hard to give up the chimp chimp loved him still so you'd go visit him on his birthday you brought him a cake well the other chimp saw that they didn't get a cake and someone fucked up and left some doors open and the chimps opened the doors and just fucked him up because he didn't give him a cake that's all it was because he didn't give him a cake they tore his fingers off they tore his dick off just because they didn't give him a cake was that that the idea was that because of the character was as a fire no fairness no no it was a fairness issue they were jealous that he gave the cake to the one chimp and they didn't get any cake and they were fucking furious and you're also dealing with these chimps that are contained in this artificial environment that freedom mr. lash out anywhere and they directly associate people with being their captors you know the people are the ones that keep them in they're the people the ones that feed and the people the ones that control them and then if they can get out fuck up the person doesn't give them a birthday cake yeah it's like the worst aspects of people magnified times 100 like you'd see it right in front of us like yeah this is what we used to be this is how we got to 2017 you had to be fucking ferocious you couldn't be like hey man I'm just here to be like one with the animal back in the days of like living with Jaguars and shit you had you had to you had to literally yeah you was liberty' so when we think of like what we're becoming we're obviously becoming more passive we're becoming more better able to deal with interacting with each other without violence and that all that all that stuff makes us mush here all that is this making me more it's not even weak it's just like physically not not attuned to violence right so if we're physically not attuned about why do we need all the strength like why do you want you need to be so fast if I wasn't trying to kill you you don't you sit in a cubicle all day so everything just starts to right just like a bulldog their face some wonder they figure to make their face all flat our whole body's gonna do that man we're gonna just flatten out so then our body's gonna absorb the bones once we start like encasing ourselves and we go back to the jello people yeah you realize you don't even need food you work like a like a plant you have this this box that contains you and it uses photosynthesis awesome oh so you'll your cells not like water and shit just like soil you need some soil you're gonna put some soil below you're gonna be a plant you're gonna go back to plants fuck plants in the matrix like in a week no I'll take a while all right good 100 million years or so will definitely be like some sort of a gigantic organism connected to some probably some natural Internet you know what they'll do their figure they'll get to a point where they're like you know what this regular Internet is too unreliable we're constantly relying on these cables I have a new idea here's my new idea we are going to make an internet by going into all these plants and genetically engineering them and turning them into Wi-Fi towers so everything is a Wi-Fi tower and this is the new internet they're all connected with each other and you through using a computer or a cell phone or whatever you're interfacing with nature now you're no longer interfacing with some artificial servers and the Verizon you know fucking throttling your data because they don't like you using Netflix no no no no now you're dealing with reengineered plants where plants are now the distributors of information I can't tell us that it's heavy bro but it might be real I mean they know that plants talk to each other they're they're percent certain in the pranced plants allocate resources they have this whole underlying like there's like a whole almost like an Internet of mycelium and like fungus and all this different shit all there they're the network of their root system and everything that they communicate with each other about what we don't know we know they they do certain things like plants here other plants getting eaten and they changed their flavor profile and they become toxic they have like a terrible toxic taste to them what yeah giraffes do that not always it's works or dr. wrap some eucalyptus trees do that when giraffes are eating them and uh a bunch of different trees they've shown that when you not only can this is a crazy study they did not only is it not knowing for sure that these plants are being eaten but if they hear it so they played recordings of like crunching recordings of caterpillars eating leaves and they've played it next to these trees and that the trees altered their profile they start excreting some sort of a chemical that makes their leaves taste terrible so what they found is like that like if it'll happen in Africa where one plant will be thinks the acacia tree that's what it is it is right I'm pretty sure things the acacia one the changes it's not eucalyptus is the acacia tree and one animal will be eating it the other animals catch wind that something's eating it and they literally become toxic to them they taste like shit and so they won't eat it and they'll starve to death rather than eat the plants some crazy chemical strategy and they communicate with each other that's how they find out that this other plant is getting eaten it goes through the ground they have this fiber about Jesus it goes through the ground they have this fiber of all these different organic things like like fungus and mushrooms and shit they're communicating good Lord it's amazing that is amazing to think that like he doesn't even hear it they allocate resources they like figure out a way to allocate resources towards plants that are connected to them that are more needy it's a very bizarre we totally don't know why they do it we Tommy we don't know how they're due it's all some new thing over the last like 20 years that people are beginning to figure out that these plants are somehow or another interacting with each other and maybe interacting with their environment a way that we just don't understand yet it's fucking weird man I mean they might be conscious in just some way we just don't imagine we can't imagine it right but there might be some sort of a you know we think of consciousness as like hey man I'm gonna go to the store tonight guru said you know hey man you know I'm gonna go take my girl to the movies that fucking Planet of the Apes thing look sweet you know that's what we think of as consciousness every day I do that but without language and with whatever the fuck plants use for communicating it might be some sort of a weird language that they have but that we don't even perceive but could use language could be we don't know I mean I don't know I'm just guessing I'm talking shit WOM hi bro right I'm asking questions because I just want to figure I want to have a more plant-based diet but I don't want students whispering and shit yeah like Tony careless whispers in your cauliflower mark yeah buddy but maybe they'd like you to eat them because they didn't like you to eat them how come when you shit out their seeds that's how plants get distributed well yeah all so how do they know what tastes like shit to us if they're altering how it tastes exactly they're trying to get us to eat it and it was just wanna make it better for us to eat them maybe they're like oh maybe oh is eating mark maybe I'll fucking create a new spice and maybe it'll be better and he'll eat me faster or some shit hence peaches why are peaches so delicious to try to trick you into eating them so you shit out one of those pits right if you get some nice nutritious shit especially if you've been eating nothing but peaches your shit would probably be fucking primo for growing a peach just ready for an S&M dungeon you're out there in the woods you take a massive dump with a bunch of peach pits in it and they get fertilized and then a new peach tree grows and this one's even better it talks you into deep just slowly just like a wolf becoming a French Bulldog the peaches become sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and then even we get in the mix like you know what this whole peach sweet and shit you're saying happening fast enough for me like me and my boys Monsanto we brought scalpels and laser beams and birth control pills and we're gonna figure out how to get these fucking peaches super sweet and they last for a year right yeah but what if you take a shit and the tree grows and it's not peaches that's just a shit tree and you can't hack that's where that's what ends up happening Chesapeake just get so sweet that they turn into shit yeah right that's the world I want to live in it's like you fix it until you break it exactly you fucked up he tried to sweet try to get the peaches to sweet and you got to the procreative nature rebelled yeah see that's the argument for diseases right the reason why there's so many diseases for human beings is that there's just too many of us and nature's like no no no no no no you can't just do this you can't just have 7 billion of one thing this is fucking stupid we got to kill some of these things no we kind of figure out a way no we got like plague and all these different things like no no no we got injections we're gonna kill all that and I'm gonna keep like battling it one step ahead diseases and scientists are going to war every date on the front lines I mean that's what's going on do it nature's trying to jack us you think it's just try to pull there they're pulling the plug on us well the last time you dog got sick I don't have a case we if you have a dog here's what you do you give you dog a parvo shot they get like distemper they get rabies and they're good they go around eating everything they find licking everything linking everything pissing on everything what percentage of dogs gets sick is it even one right right that can happen but like dogs getting colds when does your dog get sick your dog start sneezing dog you ever get a cold the fuck out of here dogs don't get my dogs I don't have a dog but if you did I mean I've never heard of a dog getting like a sinus infection they happen they happen when those Bulldogs for sure they get all fucked up cuz their nose is only like a half an inch long they have upper respiratory like horrible problems I have friends that have Bulldogs and they said it's a fucking nightmare yeah one of my dogs a half Bulldog he's half Bulldog and half Shiba Inu so he's got like a little bit of a longer face what is that a Star Wars character what is it Shiba Inu yes it's a dog okay bitch you fucking made that up I didn't it's a kunti little furry dog that's a little on the aggressive side you know get a little cunt II see your dog's half cunt a half kunti half one snaps just wants it now but he gets Kunti with other dogs he bit my puppy in the face it's pretty photo well it's not your dog no that's not my dog but my other dog the biggest dog I have is the most chill he doesn't fuck with anybody what the fuck dog was that - what did not have oh why did it not have eyeballs it did have eyeballs glasses pull that picture out oh look at that little cutie that's why I got him because he looked like that when he was a baby that's what your dog looks like a little bit but it's got a little more Bulldog to them eyes but the thing about dogs man it's just a very so much personality wise it's a trip you could have three dogs from the same litter and one of them's just a totally different kind of dog and the other ones like when they get dogs for police dog training they never know like what dogs gonna like how they're gonna come out like you look for a specific behavior but you don't know why there's like good bloodlines and everything like that but out of a litter they're not it's not 100% even in a good bloodline but they're normally what kind of like police dogs are never like they're specific I'm feeling like German Shepherds or what are they they have a bunch of different dogs they use Belgian Malinois are really good but those are super hard to control golden do attack dogs they're real good attack dogs like the sick on sick on people they're like very effective because they're super hyper aggressive and they'll just go right for your throat and fuck you up they use those a lot in military what they would call the military theater Oh hmm I like that that what they say and they say that military theater military theater no they said a starring Khloe seven and then it's like a way to it sound smarter than you really are if you said using something in the military theater I think what kind of an asshole has a military I think you bad feet or anything you sound like you're smart with the diarrhea theater we're going to the yeah if they like had musicals and they did them in basketball courts they'd make $2 no we'd go see a musical on a basketball court you have to go to that now yeah if you dress up you can see it how it really is sneakers squeaking on aluminum steps and these people have no microphone and they're below you doing their stupid play yeah be shit like you the fuck out of here bridge theater whoo it went to the this new musical at the gymnasium it was terrible everyone started throwing toilet paper down on them you go to the theater like this place is old this must rule I've got a new suit for the gym yeah nobody's ever said that going to the theater some of the theaters that you're performing when you start performing in theaters across the country you'll perform in a place it's like started was founded in like 1920 weird backstages you know walkthrough and everything it's fucking pretty dope what I was gonna say earlier is retirement Florida and I did my last tour and I did 55 cities everything was great and there were only the only train wreck shows where Florida and I did a performance art center and it was in I believe Orlando I'm gonna say and I showed up and they had I went backstage and they have a huge murals for like wicked and The Lion King and all these huge productions and then there was like Nick Swardson and then I so I was like alright did the show me to stop the show cuz two chicks got into a fistfight oh of course over what I don't have no idea it was in the balcony and I was like trying to figure out what was happening but I couldn't because they were escorted out and then afterwards they were like yeah it's a fight and then bunch of people there's vomit all over the bathrooms so that I went out to the staff and was like what happened and all the staff were these old women that were like used to plays and musicals and weren't ready Nick Swardson fucking tornado to come in so all these like 80 year old women were not equipped for like this that people were sleeping in the bathroom there was puke on the floor fight like that is hilarious it was pretty funny I was like yeah sorry about that next week though we've got wicked next week it's a resurgence of cats being brought back by popular demand his cats being played anywhere across the country but I know it's not on Broadway anymore I don't know actually ask that same question it's not on Broadway at all that was a I have a bad bad opinion of musicals and a lot of his based on a girl that I dated when I was a teen who made me go to see cats with her and we're not in you're 18 you don't have any fucking patience for anything oh yeah what the fuck definitely don't have any patience here's all the musical yeah people that are dressing out it is playing someone who wears it playing back on Broadway Oh Andrew Lloyd Webber's long-running classic is back on Broadway exclamation point I mean yeah a from Caroline's remember yeah I don't mean to dis it last time I I was thirty fucking years ago 32 years ago almost well there's still cats I'm not evolved I feel like I need to go now let's go I'll go blasted like seven stars of death deep and we should eat first like have a take the stars of death like full-on take five stars of death and then have a steak so this is my thought process you're sitting in the restaurant like right after you order you go alright let's do this you dumped those stars of death down your system and then the food start to come in so the food piles on your body has to struggle to digest the star and all the fat from your food like steak and mashed potatoes if you're feeling non keto and as you get it gets cooking like right when these dudes so do you you're just in a cyclone of fear and self-doubt and and and self-criticism and introspective thinking and feeling vulnerable about and everyone's watching you and you know you're gonna die and everyone's gonna die and uh and then and then to top it off though we bring a litter box and so we all defecate into the litter box and then when they get mad at us for like it's fucking or around cats dude this is perfect I was in Pittsburgh and I showed up for UFC in Pittsburgh at the same time when they had a furries convention oh no way just told you go I would have gone I couldn't at work I can't I had a show and then I had a UFC I like it was there for both shows and that had the UFC way inside the weigh-ins on Friday and then I had the show right I didn't want to go anyway I just I just wanted to they were you could see enough just by seeing them interact in the streets but as you're driving down the street you would see fucking dozens and dozens of people in these furry outfits right dozens I mean every way you looked you saw like these mascots like squirrels fucking people are dressed up like monkeys look at that Fox isn't shit and they fuck each other oh yeah they do well here so you know that anybody wearing that is fucking something yeah and you know what you might like try to fuck a female Fox and you pull down the pants and it's a hairy dude but you're like well god dammit I'm already here I'm not really ready for this but like look how they're all walking around and they get together of them there's photos of thousands of them together just thousands and people love it god it's gonna be so hot but they physically hot yeah I like that outfit I mean I've worn it costumes like that just done like sketches and shit okay buddy what is going on here in this picture this is so strange they're courting each other they're holding hands and staring juices eyes like you know what this is it's like you saw cartoons and you're a little kid and they just fucked your brain up you're like well this is what I'm looking forward to when I get out of this house then you get out of the house you hear car accidents gunshots rape but do they fuck each other while they're both wearing a costume or do they fuck people that aren't wearing a costume apparently and this is I'm sorry if you remember the furry community and I misrepresent you but some of them have hatches where their asshole is sort of like those old-school pajamas and those Wild West cartoons yeah remember the Wild West pajamas where they had like like Popeye always had those Dukie flap you've got two buttons they cover your shitter like the shit trap and you open up the trapdoor and drop a bomb in there and then button that fucker back up they didn't have probably had drawstrings they probably didn't even have like rubber waist bands back then right like those big buttons on either side how do they tighten down your underwear back down with buttons that makes sense they probably buttons in the front and buttons in the shitter if he had buttons on everything back then so these kids they thought that was the future and then they went out there and they got punched in the face the moment they left their house and then probably somebody did terrible things to them and they went to school and they got picked on and then here they are just wishing they were a squirrel just like in the cartoon that was my favorite site when I was young then watch the squirrel cartoon oblique I want to be a squirrel I don't want to go to school I don't want to do this a much what-have-you squirrel well the hotel we were at they had a request it was there filled up with furries except me and a few of the other UFC staff I'm not I'm not lying it's a mill dancing and they got a request and the request was the furries asked if they could put a litter box in the lobby no way yes they wanted to pay for a litter box to be brought in to lobby they liked this whole convention is all us so can we do that and like I was like what the fuck they took my idea for cats they tried to get a litter box and put it in the front lobby of like the Westin in Pittsburgh to make smelly and apparently I mean it could have all just been just they could have been like come on man well they definitely were asking for food to be delivered in bowls on the ground whatever they ordered they wanted to put in a bowl like a dog food bowl and eat it on the ground right there's several different rooms that we're requesting this that I can see though if you're gonna go that distance if you think you're not taking a shit in the fucking Lobby all right don't ask you don't know until you ask I think it's all us it's all us here it's just all us we're amongst friends well pay well pay him let me just ask let's just ask like they're so crazy they just probably asked yeah I mean I guess like have they'll just have a litter box in your room in the lobby yeah come on man I bet a lot of them had him in their room yeah going up that fucking flight of stairs a duffel bag filled with litter housekeeping and a big ol fucking plastic cement mixer in one of those plastic cement mixers you know ever make concrete when you were a kid do you ever have to make concrete no like construction jobs sometimes you'd have to make concrete so you have to pour the shit and pour the water and mix it you have to mix it in this big old fucking plastic tub that was a lot like a big heavy box right and you could just do that to get one them cement mixing tubs good lord I want to do that I want to try it if you give thousands of people I would get into a furry outfit I don't want to get fucked okay but how would you be who would I be yeah if you could be a furry like what creature would you what do you feel like your spirit animal is Nick mmm that's a good question I don't know maybe uh do you think you're a monkey or wolf I would say a monkey over a wolf of those of the objects okay so we're moving more towards monkey I'm just trying to get like a taste palate so I would say there's questions that I use to determine which one would be best for you oh I would say is squirrel squirrel yeah like you are a rat but your tail is so cute we let it slide plus you only eat nuts and plants yeah rats eat everything yeah I'm not after looking right sketchy yeah rat sir this can't be trusted carrying diseases squirrels are chill I used to hang out with squirrels in New York I would go into a union square and I would get up I saw a guy get a bag of nuts and I watched him he would sit in the middle of the park and the squirrels would come and crawl on him yeah and he would put the he would put a nut in his fist and the squirrels would reach in like it like it was like a little hole and pull the knot out and eat it on his arm so I studied this guy for a week so I was like I want to fucking do that so I go and I get a bag of nuts and I got the courage up and I got into the middle the park and I set there and the squirrels started coming on me and I started getting like panicky but you can't panic so I just zoned out and then the squirrels started feeding out of my hands and I started becoming a squirrel man and then I started I wanted to show my friends so I bring my buddies and like like to the park with me and I'm like watch this and they'd be like what the fuck are you doing man and I'm like watching this girls would be on my arms and stuff my friends were like dude I'm not on board with this I think nobody thought it was cool it is thought I was like a fucking complete lunatic I was like I thought I was like an x-men or something like gotten looks like powers I dialed into like a whole I don't know you became like a beast master yeah I thought it was rad remember that show yeah of course the duties to be able to tell animals what to do and they don't listen to him yeah Beastmaster was the shit fucking ripped the one thing they could remake they fucking doubt that be a sweet remake another person you should be the Beastmaster you or me we could be Beastmasters we could do it brothers and sisters be smash there's a bunch of chicks too we got it you got to have diversity today if you're gonna pitch a show we should have at least one black female trans Beastmaster look at them these act that seems like the newer version because master is that the original Beast Master didn't whore no no there's that guy right that's that yeah that was the original Beast Master that was the dude that was in a movie called laser blast laser blast was a fucking favorite science fiction movie of mine I was kid man like during the Star Wars days yeah and he found his gun he found his gun up on the right I was so bad you put the it was his alien gun that you put it in your arm like you put your arm in it rather like you fist this gun like that's how it works and he found this thing like the alien that's like crash their spaceship and lost their gun and this dude picked it up and the gun slowly but surely turned him into this monster it was awesome fucking things yeah see that girl like see the pictures those are the actual aliens that's what he turned into those the laser blasts 1978 dude that was 11 years old and this came out so when you see the guy like in the upper pictures goats crawl out scroll up a little bit see that like the one with the teeth out in the left hand side in the top yeah and the left hand side yeah that one that that is what he turned into when he kept fucking with that gun the more it was like sort of like a take on golems ring in a way right like the more he fucked with his gun like the more he would become with one of those aliens and start shooting shit with this weird fisting gun it was dope though dude see if you can get a clip you find a clip online turns into me in Vegas hey dude when you're 11 it's awesome cool screen it's a special preview oh this is a preview see so dude finds this in the desert what the fuck look in the aliens like oh no he's got our gun they're pissed off see they're in their spaceship and he uses it yeah see this Bishop Lance story of a UFO that has landed and visitors Sherpas decent effects oh my god is the greatest thing of all time but is he looks like a douche well we have the new studio we should do a fight companion with this movie laser blasts oh my god you don't drink anymore damn it I do you do I'm just taking a break how much of a break I'm sorry I started on the movie in like two weeks so I'm taking a break until after Labor Day okay after Labor Day you and I'll get fucked up and we'll watch laser blast 100% and we will start it from play he'll watch this fucking silly movie play more of it keep his TV running in the background the entire time the shows on yeah there's like ten seconds left of the trailer it's so bad how bad is it that looks really bad gun sounds like that so I was wrong that's not that's not the laser blast guy it's a different kind of different it looks like him he's from another movie though the guy the laser blast guy was in or the Beastmaster guy was in some other movie he looks familiar he was like a little shit what is this a French for everything at the whole movie wait show B semester trailer look how bad it is look how bad like even though the like the fucking letters are shaky like when they play the letter so yeah that's but we can't even keep no effort into the skill back then they would like they would do all this shit by hand like a bunch of monkeys that's a dude Kim no further Cheryl Smith was probably hot as fuck back in the day right she definitely cook do you think so I mean it was 1978 I don't think they were do I don't think you had a choice back then yeah they made you do coke they punch coke in your face after you when you were born and you had to wear bell-bottoms yeah this is the beginning of the movie dudes like hey what's that like this it's movie so fucking stupid he's like well just walking just walking through boiling hot shit desert leave so I think this is like the alien with the gun well let's save it until we wait okay until we watch yeah yeah we'll save it yeah yeah this is the original alien that he was uh that's what it was that guy dies he leaves him the gun boiler alert so I'm wrong I thought that that guy was the Beastmaster guy but bit-beasts man doesn't matter we were still turned onto a gem with laser blasts I'm glad I remembered that I don't know how I remembered that I don't know how the fuck that's still in my brain because I haven't seen that movie and I probably haven't seen it since like a year after I washed the birth sign that's tough yeah that guard singer he was in a but he was in some movie he played a blind guy that guy's been in everything yeah he was a wolf it's kissing to do but uh know about cut that out Beauty and the Beast he's going lrg on that mmm hey Xena that guy's got a gang of movies he did but also Beastmaster and The Young and the Restless if you had a beast master would it would people think it was racist if you hired a black guy what do you mean if you had a guy that could talk to monkeys as long as he's a white guy if it's a white guy and the white guy can walk into the forest if Falcons land on them and fucking giraffes come up to him and he gives him an apple and shit everybody's cool with it but if you had a black guy like jet black Wesley Snipes black and he's walking through the jungle and all the animals flock to him and he hear the monkeys they talk to each other he tells the monkeys what to do people be like no fucking way that is so racist are you saying that black people are like closer to these animals before no no that's what we're saying no no no we're saying he's really cool and the animals like him that's not what I got out of it bro how come white people can't talk to monkeys but black people can get the fuck out of here with you racist bullshit ass ablest movie right but he but if it's a white blond guy you like yeah I can talk to anything it's amazing he's like channel's the spirits of these animals they know he's pure isn't it facial here yeah to a unicorn people in freak out he doesn't have any clothes on it but his hair is quaffed he's like he doesn't need clothes bro just need shampoo and some conditioner he lives in the jungle but his hair is just perfect it's just like Styles kind of frosted for the forest doesn't make any sense he's super close with the Eagles dude I had a hawk issue in my backyard yesterday I tweeted I Instagram this picture that I found a hawk dead in my yard that another animal had something at bitten its head off she's in him eatin its breast tissue ah okay so that was a while back well yesterday I was out my yard I let the chickens out I have chickens and the chickens are wandering around and there's three fucking Hawks they're not big Hawks they're small it's like the size of this thermos you know so probably like 12 inches higher so I'm not a big hawk but they're trying to jack these chickens they're like I'm the chicken coop and one of them swoops down and slams into the mesh like bangs into the mesh of the chicken coop like it's trying to get at them sees a chicken dude so I'm like this is crazy so I have my kids come out my wife come out we're looking at these birds swooping down and one of them landing on top of the roof and the other ones in the trees I'm like this is so fucking strange man what is going on and they're just making noise like really loud they're juveniles and I've found two of them that are dead and what I'm thinking the two of them that I found that are dead are bigger so I did I saw these animals these small ones and then the next day I found a dead one and the dead one also had its head missing I think there's some sort of a bird war going on in my neighborhood that there's like a bird gang war going on and I think there's hawks and there's larger Hawks and one of my friends saw a larger Hawk eating baby Hawks in a tree good lord yeah yeah he was he was in the on the way down the street and apparently going to his car and he saw these Hawks that are in our neighborhood killing these baby Hawks more like what the fuck is going on and so I was like well so they were the babies were there by themselves they were like in the and then the Hawks killing the babies he saw it happen I was like that is insane so this like some sort of a gang war because I told him about the Hawks being dead and he found one of them like that shit is getting real in their neighborhood dude it's crazy it's fucking a hawk mageddon I wonder well I think it's just Hawks killing other Hawks like they're like trying to like establish probably just like all these other and I'm like apparently mountain lions do that too bears do that they'll kill young ones to find other peoples young and kill them because they think they're competition there's only so many rats you know the right or a rabbit that a hawk can eat CAD fuck dude that's been Lance so we found two two different Hawks with no heads do you normally have a lot of oxygen neighbor this is definitely you see him all the time you see him floating around there circling all the time see him all the time oh all throughout the Hollywood Hills you could see him I don't know if I've ever seen a dog maybe my friend Tom Tom sharona's director he was in his house in Studio City and he watched like a dove or some small bird just get jacked by a hawk right in front of him it was sitting on a fence just burbs just sitting there chilling oh what a wonderful day to be a bird and he said this Hawk just came down mom just grabbed him right there and fucking flew off and they do it just for fun right they don't really eat him the birds did they really dude birds eat birds yeah we played a video of owls Jack and hawk oh yeah I've never seen now no and I love Jackie a hawk yeah yeah that's crazy I've seen owls like eat rabbits and shit right they put a night-vision camera on this tree so they could capture these these Hawks that were in this this little nest together might be even a young Hawk this owl comes in from out of the sky like you don't see anything until you see its eyes you see its floating eyes and then watch this watch this video it's amazing that's a hawk

Wienerschnitzel is there gotta be mysterious I've gotta be Hawk Ethan Shamma Lamma ding-dong there's a lot of people have done that right like Jamie Foxx he had the most brilliant idea ever he made his name and androgynous name so that he would get picked as people to go up in the Laugh Factory because it was a laugh act you open mic and they would pick chicks more than they were picked dudes cuz they weren't very many chicks so they tried to get a certain amount of chicks right so he made his name ambiguous he changed his name to Jamie Foxx with two exes that's pretty cool smart his old

Azalea is that her name there's a video that she's doing what she's shaking your ass it's literally like trying to fuck in a waterbed it's like this suffix like stop slow down unless that's you realize in which case multiple apologies your big ass shaming your body shaming my job I'm not body shaming but if you have a crazy body we're gonna talk about it and if your ass is that giant people going to talk about it yeah guess it's body shaming to be no it's it's a surgery shaming that's what it is I think that's legitimate just surgery shame sure right if you call it like if it's not like if we had done that earlier would we have lost Michael Jackson like if so many surgery shamed him like soup Hey Dude hey hey hey stop yeah what are you doing what's going on why did you know I was doing this what's going on why is it getting so small yeah like his nose started caving in there and what was Katie I'm aware good lord good lord I mean I have a friend so I went to dinner with a friend of mine she's awesome and I hadn't seen her for a while and she got plastic surgery plastic surgery and I didn't she didn't bring it up I didn't seen it for like five years and I was it was noticeable not big time but enough and I didn't know what how to handle it I didn't know what to do so I just didn't say anything but I wanted to be like why yeah but you know once somebody already does it it's kind of a fucking moot point to be like hey what'd you do go back so I just let it go but it was really awkward it was she was already fucking gorgeous and then I was I don't know why she did that shit herself so it was really it was really bizarre very bizarre feeling have you experienced that have you have seen I mean you must I definitely have but my friend even weirder was dating a girl an asian girl who got that I surgery when yeah yeah and he hadn't seen her in a long time and then he actually told me about this after we did the podcast we were talking about that eye surgery remember even we showed it like how many Korean women in particular are getting this crazy surgery where it changes your face it makes your eyes way bigger they cut your lids oh if you like this anime weird look and it's apparently super super popular but he hadn't seen her in a while and then he saw her and she had the thing done and he didn't recognize her he was like what right it was like it was off I was like if I saw you and all the sudden your eyes were giant and had to go hey what's up Nick I could look at that Wow yeah but in that case it looks really good but let's say Bravo but it's it's a weird thing that is like super super common to get that look right so they go from having is that a bunch of different girls who that scares a shit up dude we have a friend I just realized who got it done if that's a bunch of different girls that freaked me the fuck out have you seen him no he got it done you know that is mm-hmm of course mmm he did the same thing with eyes it's keeping them DL yeah that's why I wrote it down I didn't show you but that's like your she's becoming like westernized see this is what they do it's so crazy dude they slice your lid and then they take like a chunk out of it like say if you were cutting up a mango and the slices they take a nice little mango slice and then stitch that bad boy up and then your lids are just way smaller says nations have different need for beauty Choi says in Korea the land is small and crowded that everyone can see and look at each other in the face what what the fuck are you talking about no you don't like having slanty eyes that's all it is you don't like the way your eyes look I get it don't say crazy shit and unless that's a translation problem nations have different need for beauty listen to this explanation hey why do you guys have so many eye surgeries well in Korea the land is small and crowded and that everybody can see can look each other in the face did you say you're on pills yeah they got shit-faced well it must be some sort of a a translation issue I think so yeah because like if you said that to man like neck is I think he's gone crazy dude he doesn't the sentences don't make sense no joy they do buddy since I joined my eyes we couldn't see about your face hi what's wrong what why is that weird mm-hmm ya know my friend that I didn't seen fro I didn't know what to do I didn't know what to say so I just started screaming and threw hot water in her face oh my god as Thao's that loves I could it starts screaming and got like boiling pot of water and sorry everybody stopped and I just ran out jumped into it yeah do you memory now you're living dead or not what night Living Dead and Bay's in the Body Snatchers yeah when someone would turn into one of those things and they would just be like just something wrong yeah like I don't know something's wrong with Nick he just doesn't seem like Nick anymore this lights wrong you would wander off really be an alien yeah I would find the pod find the pot under your bed like cobwebs oh yeah well it's like the thing remember the thing I do that was the fucking that's the best movie when my favorite of all time the original John Carpenter the fuck yeah well that was so trippy that was one oh yeah that was a remake but it was a good Remus awesome phenomenal remake but that was so trippy because you didn't know until they burn their blood who is an alien so you just walk around like yeah what happened to Gary I don't know you all right mark yeah yeah yeah just tired didn't get the dog to it became part of the data member that when they burned it they got the dog too yeah tentacles and shit remember when they're doing an operation remember when they're doing an operation on the guy and the chest opens up and becomes jaws it bites his arms on yeah they're doing that the what's it called they had a fridge a little bit later fibula a defibrillators and it's fucking it turned in jaws and open up and bit his arms off yeah that was ruled that movies and it holds up even though the effects are bizarre it holds up it still gives you like wicked anxiety dude Kurt Russell in this movie is like one of my all-time yeah look at that that's crazy it opens up and bites out guys isn't that guy for Cheers was Ian Cheers he could be he's not he should be say was as this is a scene from Cheers this one the last episode so they cut him up yeah these guys are going crazy like Steve you're cut off I'm returning to a big spider thing yeah that was kind of a head popped up legs and started running around like a spider time who was scary as fuck how about the end and is the best don't spoil it I wha spoiler I didn't is that Rick Baker yeah for here that's Rick Baker he's the special effects guy that did American Werewolf in London ledge he passed away right I do not think he did I think he's still alive oh sorry right I believe Rick Baker still alive I think he was just working on something something that's going on right now I forget what it was but I feel like there's some new project that I just read something about I forget what goddammit did you see the new version of the thing they did a third version I saw it I thought it was good I did not like it oh dear you know I just it was I wanted to like it but I just thought it I thought was bad joke a bro people get mad if you don't like things they like yeah bro you know maybe you suck yeah you saw they turn it on you get mad at you but also I'm somebody we're like I wanna like shit so like when people are like oh you're just a hater it's like no I fucking go to a movie so I want to like it if I watch something like I don't want to hate something why would I go why would I make an effort to go to a movie to hate it that's fucking retarded I agreed so I go and then I'm like I'll just I don't like this and then people go no you don't and I'm like no I don't I just I didn't like it it wasn't you know I'm on your side bro thank you Jesus everyone so touchy yeah it's ridiculous did you see life with Ryan Reynolds I did see life did you like it I liked it did you like it Jamie I liked it I put it on Twitter and I got attacked people like you're fucking idiot that show sucked that movie blew was stupid was cliche same old shit was a ripoff of aliens there's a lot of people that liked it but it was like it seemed like there was a good percentage of them that hated it well here's the thing as like that critique where people go it's you know they took this is and it's like yeah movies do borrow a certain elements and especially like life had certain stuff that yet devices that they used right but it's also it's still you just have to go okay and then like sit back and just enjoy performances and enjoy what they made it's a fucking a really well shot movie you know what it really highlighted to me that television shows like it's contagious bro now you're doing it yeah thanks television shows like house of cards in Game of Thrones these serial shows they've ruined movies this is why because like to tell story in ninety minutes are so limited yeah you can only get it so invested in the character there's only so many different plot twists you can have like especially like this sort of a genre right like you take an alien life-form it gets on board the people and tries to kill them okay how many many times we've seen that we've seen that a fuckin thousand times in movies right right so you're gonna run into a bunch of Pro and you got to jam it all into ninety minutes like there's certain things that have to be like plot mechanisms they have to take place like the alien has to attack the first person you're gonna see it coming there's gonna be like a bunch of shit going you have to adhere to certain cliche gathered devices that's what people that the do like Prometheus I did like for me I didn't like Prometheus I didn't love it and I like the new alien I didn't see the new alien but I heard it's going it's great I mean I like both of them I got a lot of shit for that people like you're fucking idiot and I was like easy Graham what no I wasn't my Grob nobody no the people I do hang out with people that are critical like director friends and shit but all directors are the worst to watch a movie with yeah they're pretty bad director people is there there so beyond critical but like I'm critical of comedies like when I go to comedies I walk out of a lot of them I just like you know the worst is well if you around actors that haven't made it actors that like barely work in that choice yeah that's yeah that's really bad what ever happened to his career you're like that's Daniel day-lewis yeah what's his bit alone day yeah his career really fell off after that movie yes somebody said that about the dude in Jurassic Park like he's in fucking Jurassic Park it's one of the biggest movies of all time everyone's career falls off after Jurassic Park okay it's no way to get bigger you stupid fuck like I'm sure the guy probably did a lot of movies after Jurassic fucking Park also maybe he made enough money that he doesn't have to do movies anymore you twat right yeah he's cashing his fucking Jurassic dollars and can I have my latte I'm tired of this his choices career his career totally dropped off do you say nonfat nonfat soy nonfat soy sugar-free please yeah it is funny like all I'll do interviews for stuff and they'll be like yeah man I'm just looking over your stuff why did you do that movie and I'm like cuz my friend was in and he asked me to do it so yeah suck I'm like I fuckin yeah I'm friends with people and they're doing a project and like hey you you want to do this I'm like alright I'm not gonna go no I fuck you man my friend like yeah there's like other variables besides you know jamming I was willing to do your assassin show exactly there it says right there you would do that for she trusts me look into it yeah that could find out like halfway into the filming Nick eats a pound of adderall a day a full pound of adderall they deliver it in pounds he's just on adderall he doesn't even know he's making a movie he just found out it's a movie thought he was in a dream about making a movie he just found out he's actually making a movie he is no he thought it was at the pizza he hasn't slept in a year there's one year no sleep this guy puts adderall on his foot and then kicks it in the next mouth a thing if you didn't sleep for a long time but you were still up moving you would probably start just start hallucinating right isn't that what people said right listen sorry I did a show in Tahoe riders I did a show in Tahoe and I forgot to be hydrated so I didn't get hydrated at all and so I didn't drink any water and I was drinking on the plane I me and my buddy got in arena we drove Tahoe we were drinking in Tahoe I did my show we just kept drinking I didn't drink any water and then I got home dick I was up like I don't know maybe like 15 hours and then I kept drinking and liked it really think about it I'm at the casino I'm having fun I'm the night start feeling sick and then I try to go to bed and I can't and then so I'm awake throughout the night and then the next day I'm like still awake and I'm like kind of panicking now because I haven't slept for like over 24 hours and now I have like I realized I have altitude sickness because I'm my puking and then I haven't so I'm trying to drink water so I got I drank and I had alcohol poisoning and altitude sickness and sleep deprivation so I flew home to LA and I had slept for like thirty fucking six hours and I'm in my bed and like I gotta go to sleep so I get in my bed and then I I just start hearing like music and like all this stuff and like people like there was a party next door but there was no party and then so I was like what the fuck and then I'm lying in my bed and I just hear pounding on my floor and I was like what the fuck and I heard like legitimate like pounding and I was like totally awake and I realized I hadn't slept and then I like it took like a sudden like some sleeping but I got some nyquil or something and I finally got to bed but it was super weird man yeah I've heard people that do those races those ultra marathon races they start seeing shit that's not there cam didn't have that happen to him but I've heard other people they see people on the side of the road waving at them that aren't even there really dude altitude we were gotten altitude fucks with me real bad my friend Ben Ben O'Brien who was on the show last week with a week before last he was talking about how he was in Nepal and he was getting altitude sickness while he's in Nepal and he saw a baby on the side of the road and there was no baby

one who like cuts his losses like this guy is not gonna make it bang IV you got to think about survival of the group man your buddy would not survive around me do you lost and think how you would handle things differently I never saw lost ever saw one episode never saw one episode I've heard people i watch it yes up until like the last season and then quit I heard a guy here to kind of jump ship last season I was like they're like standing around while there's a pool that brings you back to life and no one's freaking out like what is wrong what the fuck kind of show am i watching do you

happens in real life the perfect blocking yeah perfect blocking and we'd let people look at each other you fucking asshole you're all standing around no one's freaking out there's a pond that brings people back to life and you guys are just phoning it in fuck you I think that's why I jump ship and excited to see derailed super bad and then I heard that the writers didn't think it was gonna go that long and so they ran out of shit that's so that somebody told me that they were like yeah we didn't think it was we weren't really ready it's so good in the beginning though in the beginning it's so good it's such a good show for the first like who knows how many seasons I binge watch was actually over six right yeah up until the last like season started fall apart it's that many people on the show and our boy Dominic who was on the show it's been on this podcast it's like funny my buddy or I guess yeah and then what happened to de sel kind of overweight who won the lottery there's the girl

do you have you have a few pairs of shorts some flip-flops and a microphone in case the microphone downstairs breaks cuz that's what you do now you go down and talk to people we go down tonight Nick did you stand up anymore well can you stand up I mean I have a mic but you know they never know what I'm coming I have a mic so yeah it's kind of whenever I want to do it immediately you telling me you wouldn't go to a bar if you knew that every night Joey Diaz was gonna take a microphone and just start walking through the crowd and talking shit a hundred percent I would do that hundred percent yeah but that's Joey Diaz like I wouldn't good at that you wouldn't be now but you gotta get better okay gonna get better at being a bar guy bar emcee you see it's a skill man like anything else like playing golf like jerking off you get better at it right doesn't make sense it doesn't but I think it does know maybe he'd just be like you turn into a singer everybody's like make you should really tell jokes again no man I'll just Jimmy Buffett songs in my voice know so I'm like diarrhea everybody clap yeah you could have like funny songs yeah yeah that's the move alright I'm on board and I go to dinner Joe wait um you have to leave right now vegan place pretty soon a vegan place dude you're healthy and up what are you doing I'm trying to uh just just kind of get back into shape yeah so I'm getting back into the gym and I'm and I've been pretty good with my diet I'm getting kind of fascinated by diet so I've been off dairy for eight years well and then I've been pretty much cut it out sugar I have like dark chocolate if I really like start craving shit but I'm trying to like really get my body I'm like really fascinated by diets my new fascination well you find the difference right you eat healthy and you feel difference when I quit eating dairy and it was some random dude at a juice bar who worked there and I was always sick and he was like hey man you're always six Whorton and I go yeah and he was like do you eat a lot of dairy and I go yeah and he goes do this he goes quit eating dairy for two weeks see how you feel he's like cold turkey and I go okay fuck it so I did and I haven't been back in eight years why my sleep everything my stomach never got sick never got migraines it changed everything and then I got super fascinated by that I still drank my tits off you know I mean tried raw milk no apparently some people have an issue with homogenized and pasteurized milk and they don't have it with raw milk or they don't have it with goat's milk too especially raw goat's milk I've heard about goat's milk I just want to just bypass all of it I do like almond milk and rice milk yeah well it's a it's an ethical thing to bypass too if you really stop and think about it because there's something fucking creepy about mass-produced like handles yanking on titties yeah how's that I like kind of perpetually pregnant like isn't that what they they're the cows like they're constantly nursing right so they're they make them get knocked up in order to have the milk come out right the milk doesn't just come out nuts out when they're they're nursing it's a little weird that's weird it's fucking weird but I want to try to fuck with going vegan for a little bit and just see how it is so I mean you know so far how long you been doing it two days but I mean for the most part I don't really eat a lot of red meat and I mean I eat like chicken and fish but I'm gonna try to go vegan I'm gonna try to do it for like two weeks you know one way that you can get protein that's very ethical and you don't even have to think about it too much is scallops and mussels and and things along those lines when you eat the fuck are they called mollusks is that the word mohnish fish is what I'm looking for shellfish in particular like especially clams and like oysters yeah Easter's and things on those lines they're so primitive they don't even have like nervous systems we just think of them as like an animal like a living creature because they can move right and close this but a Venus flytrap that's probably way more sophisticated and it's a plant way more sophisticated and organism than that and then especially be talking about those acacia trees they'll have this communication said that there's nothing going on like that with mollusks they're like really stupid there were super ancient life-forms that are kind of meat but they're almost like we're talking about like that fucking gelatinous thing inside of the box that's what they're like you can eat it yeah scallops are amazing I mean I've had scallops they're amazing it's a mollusk as they're called yes well a scallop is a mollusc like a clams a mollusk a mussels a mosque oh that's a genre my expert five minutes ago can you remember the name of it yes scallops are amazing but those things are a good way boy stur x' they're a good way to get protein a lot of them is sustainable a lot of those things are sustainable because they actually make like farms of them they grow them on the ground the same way you would grow fruit they grow them on the ground of an ocean obviously but the same way you would grow fruit or grow vegetables like you can grow these things and they're a good source of quote-unquote animal protein in an ethical way like these things are so primitive they have like they're they're they're not feeling shit like they're not getting bummed out that you're eating right they just clamp down and close they're like SuperDuper they have a damn protein yeah very high in protein really good for you boy stirs are a good way to especially stirs in olive oil it's a good way to stay in a fat based diet like ketogenic diet cause there's so much fat in them for the olive oil and then the oysters themselves very very healthy for you oh yeah really good for your body I got sick from oysters I had too many one time but I mastered a different different story you know raw oysters you really got to get fresh what are you talking about talking cook smoked oysters he get in like cans like I take him with me on the road I'll take a by him in bulk and I'll take him with me on the road so I have healthy snacks like in my hotel room wasters yeah is it can't shit bad for you no no I'm sure like there's some leaching of all sorts of different things when you put something into a container I wouldn't I wouldn't say she'd eat it every day because I ate ice to eat sardines every day but I turned positive for arsenic they found traces of arsenic in my system and they realize deadly we it is but it apparently it's just one of the heavy metals that is at the bottom of the ocean that's affected by pollution the levels of it is affected by pollution and so these sardines are particularly the kind of bottom feeders and if you're in a polluted area and you get sardines from a polluted area they'll have heavy metals in them you know like Mercury's right yeah so I got off the sardines for a while and went back and got tested I was a hundred percent clean they're like it's gotta be the sardines I said totally make sense can't eat them every day bro I was eating like three or four cans a day anything got high in sodium two sodium's okay just drink with long as you drink water sodium is fine like the idea that there's a total misconception about sodium causing high blood pressure and heart attacks that was all based on a bullshit study that somebody pushed through what what was that study like sodium does not cause high blood pressure Google that because there was like this whole bogus study that people keep repeating over and over again about salt obviously we have too much of anything to kill you right like we've talked about water right water will fuck you up too much salt will definitely kill you too many stars pound of salt you're fucking dead man you're a dead man right you need a pound of meat it's time to end the war on salt the zoella's drive by politicians to limit our salt intake as little basis in science yeah it's bullshit not only that it's an essential mineral like you need salt yes salt is it really important you don't want to have too much of it absolutely that meaning like you don't want to cover everything in salt just like you don't want to drink too much water just like you don't want to eat too much fruit like if you eat too many orange it's not good you get 100 oranges it's not good for ya it's horrible so much so much sugar yeah but to have a good healthy amount of salt in your diet especially like Himalayan salt really yeah that's really minerals that shit's ancient these things are like Himalayan salt that's salt crystal thing there's a lamp that's all what if you ate that see that one over there that's lit what if you ate that puppy super that thing's supposed to like it emit energy man mmm feels like it Jamie remind me to replace the battery in that one or whatever the fuck it means yeah a new bulb just I don't eat electricity oh it burned me yeah don't fuck with it no dude throw it out is it plugs didn't it plugged in anymore I think I hope it doesn't work and just keep it plugged in was just in there cooking my cut back on start smoking with diet I'm like really fascinated by so you got somebody doing this for you you talk it to a nutritionist just just kind of reading shit and just going by you make sure that you you get what you really should do really should do and I can send you to a guy is um go to a real good doctor that specializes in nutritional profiles and get your blood work done and like I find out like do you need maybe you need nice and you need vitamin D and mean vitamin B like here you're low in this you're low in that there's a lot of stuff that people neglect and they're didn't even know you know you don't know until you actually get your blood work done you don't know what slow what's okay I do want to do that I mean I take a lot of vitamins and stuff and I ask good I think I I kind of like I'm doing a decent job just going rogue that was my last tattoo by the way Brooke how drunk were you I was actually pretty decent Vegas why'd you decide to write Rogan you're Armony there's me my buddies and we go like I like when we're like partying and like my buddy I'll text me like hey you want to go to the gym and I'm like I'm going fucking rogue that just means that's gonna I'm signing up for blender you're a good party or though dude Oh tell you I've run into you going rogue many times and it's never been anything but hugs laughs oh yeah no I'm like a really good drunk like I know how to do it and I know I'm not like people like see me like I post photos and shit I'm always you know out like raging and I'm not always raging but when I do it's like really controlled it's not it yeah you're good at it I've built up a tolerance of and I know what I'm doing like I don't just do any shot that's handed to me and just like I don't know I I I keep it very simple but yeah I get really fired up I just I love drinking and going out yeah I'm never like fighter guy or I'm never like moody yeah dark guy that's the worst

I just said that oh yeah I don't I mean I'll take breaks but I like drinking it's fun I don't like the effects of it on the body but it's that's the that's the fucking trade-off the trade-off is it's fun for a little while and then you're like oh yes in Italy I drink wine every night I was in Italy I just got back I drank wine seven nights in a row I drank mini glass of wine I pasta seven nights in a row I totally went off the rails with my diet gained five pounds I have two it's Italy that's what I'm saying dog yeah there's a certain shit yeah you got to go off the rails and enjoy yourself but it's fun to go off the rails and get back on the rails and you appreciate being on the rails I like the way you think yeah but you're like you're not a drunk that I'd ever avoid if I see there's certain people we all know them you see them drunking like oh yeah I can't be responsible for this I got to get out of here ya know it's scary there's some comics where I'm like oh if I got a babysit that babysit this person oh there's some dark motherfuckers man these texts do believe she said that to me bro like oh my god I can't do this I can't do this I can't read you text I can't help you with this this is yours yeah people go bad rogue she's got my kids bro okay okay I got it hey look at the time you're not thinking rational you're drunk you partied into a family meanwhile in the middle of it like he's going through tinder I'm just fucking swiping the worst I lost one of my best friends it was like one of my rogue fucking buddies and he my roommate was friends with his ex-girlfriend and they were watching a movie and I came home and I went to bed and said hi to him and then the next day he like flipped out on me you know and I text him I go what's up man he's like my ex-girlfriend was that your fucking house yeah is what she movie with my budding he's like what the fuck man it's like you didn't tell me fuck you and I never talk to me again so you were supposed

they watch the movie while you were around but it's like it's like bad rogue friend that just gets fucking they just you know I just can't do it drama like when I go out I don't want drama nobody does I think what we're talking about earlier how chimps have this horrific behavior I think there's some of that that's left over in people and I think it comes out when you get involved in relationships and breakups I think you see that angry chimp come out sometimes oh yeah alcohol is one of those things obviously it affects people not just even alcohol so jealousy though just jealousy as well yeah
