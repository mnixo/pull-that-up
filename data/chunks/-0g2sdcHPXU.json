hello freak bitches but if Lisa was on the other day and listening to Lee on that like he's never been to a strip club before but his little voice when he chimes and he's like scared of them he said I want to take that guy I don't know it's I think it's a money thing because he says like I just don't eat it you pay the money then they try to get money out of you someone told the story something about Jeremiah Watkins trying to get took him to a strip club when he freaked out and just like ran out the back they see the same kind of thing like he'd I don't know if he's ever been to one or doesn't want to go or yeah he he looked at the ground and walked in the front never looking up all the way to the pack and half the pack today yeah I did I did get a day this is crazy I did a show with George Perez in Compton at a strip club in Compton and let me tell you man and that was one of the most eye-opening like that exists we walk in there's strippers like this stripper just came up to me and goes hey honey look at this pussy I swallow the babies you want to get it you want some of this like a baby mama like I don't know like she was still baby hand sticking out of her probably a blue baby once you attractive no there was there was a few but then every time you talk to him you're like oh if I fuck up I'm dead you know like she was like ghetto yeah it was pretty crazy hostile yeah what about the clientele well they they were mostly there for us like they George just pretty much we had the whole club or ourselves they vote was all people coming to see the show so it was in strippers too though and strippers too so it was the idea that you would get people in there for the show and then the girls would dance for them afterwards yeah and while we're doing the show they were coming and sitting on table hey you wanna go get some butt sex upstairs I got a question for you can you talk about the run rabbit run race you had that you won right yeah we can talk about that end no I'll let her describe it because it sounds pretty crazy what happened so the hundred mile race that I was doing a months before Moab at about I mean 12 miles roughly to the finish line my vision started blurring like in the periphery and over the course of the next couple miles closed in until it was pure white I couldn't see anything so I just like stumbled my way along roughly ten miles of trails to get to the finish line pretty much I would say like 98% blind what I could see my feet like right in front of my feet but it was just whiteout so I was running and falling everywhere it was probably hilarious if you were watching but I hit my head also on a rock laughter you're blind yeah one of the times I fell so I had blood dripping down my face like stumbling along totally couldn't see the trail you still won ya managed to finish and and hold the lead you're a savage you should give seminars on how to be a savage that is crazy so what what did what happened to your vision so since then there's been tons of people kind of talking about it apparently it happens in ultras quite often they are thinking it's a corneal edema so basically like I wear contact lenses to see and the like contact mixed with the air and the dryness and mm-hmm all sorts of things cause like a kind of fluid or I'm not really sure how it works have you ever thought about getting lasix or something people who have done LASIK also get this corneal edema so for now I'm just staying staying with the contacts cuz I've I've been learning how to deal with those a little bit better what do they look they look different they they look a fair bit different so that first bullet Amy showed was like a Brahman bull then one of those scrub bulls which is just bits of friggin every sort of bull over a lot of generations will come in and interbreed with it and then sort of wrecks the herd and when when did they get released or when did they escape well I would have been with the first cattle that come into Australia so 1889 Wow yeah so they've just sort of morphed and become wild animals yeah in a wild bulls very dangerous very dangerous yeah so what happened was Pedro shot this bull and dropped like you know dropped unconscious he thought it was dead walked up to it it jumped up like he literally got up to it and it jumped up and anyway they'd end up getting him against the tree like he ran to get up a tree he felt it hit him and it sort of lifted him up the tree he climbed up the tree this is the gross bit then he felt something warm and his legs and looked down and his guts and everything were hanging down over his legs but he's a tough bastard he gathered his stomach back up and sort of held it in place then the bull actually died he climbed down out of the tree and end up dying two times I think once in the air because the Royal Flying Doctors come in grabbed him because he's a long way out in the middle of nowhere and then once on the table is operating table as well Wow he survived all that and in a dying of a bloody mass heart attack so no way yeah when he was only thinking is I need 36 or 37 do you think it had anything to do with the American was related at all really yeah you would think that a guy could get past getting gored by all push his guts back into him like that guy's not gonna get a heart attack yeah that's life's not fair right wow that's crazy right but I mean is anybody been skeptical but yeah everyone's great oh yeah and what's your response to that you don't know what I know right well you know though I can't I don't know I can't tell you some of the shit that I know and I can't tell you but what could it be that's so crazy if you you know I mean what you've said well think about what you've said you said that there's some ridiculous sort of propulsion system that allows you to move through time that they they visit this planet all the time and extract resources right that there's people in the government that are trying to disseminate this information but they don't know how to do it they don't know the right vehicle do it they're doing it in these sort of controlled chunks mm-hmm think of all these things that you said what could possibly be crazier than that well you're asking me how do I know and no no no I'm asking you what do you know that could possibly be crazier than that well I that's the shit I can't tell you it's not every hunky-dory is it something were you worried about the fate of the human race I think that's part of it where should I move move it's not existent flip your dick out if I should go to Australia how about I mean where's the spot I don't think there is one unavoidable spot this is what I will say there it's not existential in the sense of they're not gonna come here like Independence Day and nuke the place but it there you know there are things to worry about but sometimes you read these books with the writers go a little too far with their bullshit just too much it's like you were saying you ever go to people's houses and they talk and then this a ship for 20 minutes they like it's like by Studio City where I live go to that coffee shop in time the time you know what they were saying in there well the day after the Vegas shooter the Vegas shooter was Sunday night do you know what these idiots were saying in there Monday but that this had to do with women's rights and the abortions and and they just talked these new breathing Gentiles they just talk that's all they do is talk with big words to impress you but they don't say shit they don't say shit three or four big words to let you know they're smart and then then say nothing there's a lot of repeating narratives oh yeah every time the show the new show I'm gonna do I'm buying one of those little tape recorders and I'm putting the money six fucking morons every day then at night I'm gonna do a show about what they discussed because this is 60% of America what these fucking people talking about this is the idiots the shit that comes out of their mouths it's amazing and you sit there and go no wonder fuckin Isis wants to shoot us listen to these fucking dummies listen to what's coming out of their mouths women's rights that's what I'm talking about well what was their argument they were saying that the guy though they all got everybody their argument is everybody trying to be smart and everybody it's just six people trying out with each other it's like when you go to those fuckin dinner parties you talk about and by the time they serve the salad you want to put a gun in your fuckin why am I even fucking here with these people I could have stopped at Burger King had a better fucking time that's why I don't go to those dinner parties because there's eight people to and once politics comes up you lose me Joe Rogan I don't want to hear about it no more you lose me you lose me these new political people talking nonsense you lose me move forward either impeach him get a new one or shut the fuck up I can't you put the news on anymore but it's definitely he didn't send the check he called her oh yeah what the fuck man just told gives a fuck who gives a fuck there's got to be something more there's got to be a seal stuck on a beach somewhere in this fucking country something more important than this shit every fucking day so the politics is over my world religion you know I don't want to yeah that's a bowl talk about politics or religion at those fucking things but this new breed of Gentile they just talk for their sense of talking to see who's the smartest person in the room and at the end of the day they're all a bunch of dumb fucks anyway [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
