hello freak bitches this is a period where I was doing a lot of psychedelics and one of the experiences you've probably had on psychedelics is the the amazing experience of just looking into somebody's eyes on acid or mushrooms and just having that just open a kind of an inner landscape of profundity or seeming profundity where you're just you know you can just be staring into somebody's eyes silently for an eternity or what seems like an eternity and what often happens to people is that that after having experiences like this then looking into people's eyes can become a way of really of activating that state of mind where you you know you just being committed to looking into people's eyes and never looking away can be a way of sort of introducing that sort of liquid psychedelic experience you know interpersonally and I was sort of into that too for a while and so I was kind of walking through life you know like I guess Tom Cruise does just like exactly just never just just like I'm just gonna go with you let's see where this goes and I'm just never gonna look away from anyone ever again and you you get you start having it's it's intrusive and I stopped doing it you you start having unusual experiences the first thing you do is you discover everyone else is doing that for whatever reason so all of the Psychopaths and the Scientologists and all everyone comes out of the woodwork because they're there's some number of people walking around earth at this moment who are playing that game or just all it's like you look into their eyes and it's just I lock for as long as you're gonna stay and you never they're never gonna look away mm-hmm and so whether it's a barista at Starbucks or whether it's just somebody who is 50 feet across the room at a party and you make eye contact they're not gonna be the first one to look away and so you get into these really weird encounters and I had this I remember this one party I went to where I was sitting on a couch and I looked across the room and it was this guy looking at me and I probably you know 40 feet between us and he looked at me and I looked at him and then it was just like War of the Warlocks you know it's like neither of us were gonna look away right and it'd just be that you and I was doing a lot of meditation and I was you know I had it's probably taking acid once a month you know so I was I was pretty tuned up for this kind of game where it's just like you know I was not I had no problem making eye contact with some strange guy you know 40 feet away and after a certain point he jumped up and kind of raced over to me and you know we had a problem he's like what the fuck are you doing and and and it was like a real this so what I was doing was so intrusive but he he was at his own game going because he you know he didn't look away right all right he was available for it but in any case you were when you walk through life like this you you discover that there are a lot of people doing this for whatever reason and it's it's you definitely have unusual encounters hello Joe for fuck's sake what are you sitting up there in your heart he asked me if I was David Letterman and I should tell everybody about this chair that's uh this is my latest device to try to mitigate back pain from sitting and it's called the I think it's called Sally yeah si el Li and it's a saddle chair it's like a saddle so if you see how it's sitting here no no one's endorsing this I'm just telling you it feels I'm gonna tell you this they would hate me endorsing this because it feels like shit it's like the least comfortable chair I think I've ever sat the anti-commercial but it's very good fruit back and make sure you like you can't sit anyway other than like this like you have to sit like straight up you can't like slouch in this thing it just doesn't support it and when I sit in a regular chair by the end of the podcast my fucking neck starts to hurt like my back like around here where I've been injured starts to hurt wouldn't that like stretch your asshole out though and like give up so I'm trying to do know if I days here for if I ever do wind up going in the pokey I want to be just gaming soon no it doesn't do anything your asshole you fucking idiot easy no this is you're not listening you the whole idea behind this is it's like a saddle if you sit in a saddle you actually kind of have to hold yourself in place so by squeezing your legs together it's not opening your butthole you're actually squeezing everything tight so if you were a gal and you wanted to have one of these I figure it would probably be good for the ova JJ probably tighten that baby up mmm like women are supposed to like do those Kegel it not supposed to supposed if they care about Treaty of penis correctly with their vagina they do those Kegel exercises where you squeeze your vagina you can actually make it stronger there's some crazy bitch and rush up that's like the world record holder for the amount of weight she can carry with her pussy but it's something substantial like 50 pounds so she shoves a dildo in her pussy attaches it to a fucking kettlebell and and does squats holding this this dildo in her in her box just with her shield pushing back like grabbing it like that is anybody else getting hungry I don't know why I'm getting peckish jebra here honey suckle divine yes yeah is the one that used to shoot ping-pong balls and either tuna fish sandwich yeah where was that at where'd she do no she did it the track there on Philadelphia because it was like we were kids it was like this big joke about how many suck up Ivana but I was up at the BRIT and they were shooting a porn and you know these porn girls need so much attention obviously I didn't have anything else to do and there's no more conversation so one girl sits on a brush she goes do your trick you know the container their cigars put in James that in it and she just pops it out but she paid she hit the girl too hard or was so funny girls faces there and you go boom get in the girl goes fuck ah big red mark on her face explain that she could shoot whoever pussy so hard at her yeah I can see you're doing it Vince is fucking up really needs to make you a part of it I told Tony when immediately you should do it and I can't believe you didn't take it Tony cuz that is like one of the biggest things for you for you because you are that I was trying to negotiate doing it part-time from LA that would be awesome that would that would be best for both sides because I wouldn't get burned out on it and they would have awesome great ideas that are hip and cool and I would have been able to do what I wanted it hip and cool whenever God says my ideas are hip and cool I'll go are you sure it depends what ideas he's talking Undertaker has a scarf but in the hip scarf it's a scarf with little skulls all over it like he's a pirate he's drinking a Frappuccino I never saw this one coming yes Undertaker has gone Metro metrosexual Undertaker maybe if she changed it all sudden Tony starts working for them and every character becomes gay and it turns out that there's there's someone who sprinkling gay dust over all the other competitors there's a locker room there's and it's he's turning that's that's a plot that Tony comes up with he turns the entire roster gay it turns out there's an openly gay wrestler and he has gay fairy dust okay will you sit in like a leprechauns ball sack lady red killed a leprechaun and and turned his ball sack into like this are you ready for this sure what if I were to tell you that there is an openly gay wrestler that blows dust in people's faces his name is gold dust Dustin Rhodes a third generation wrestler what's going on his dick that's gold dump our baby you've heard of horsepower that's like related to Dusty Rhodes yeah yeah how'd you know about that see Rhodes yeah I used to be eight this shit made sense this guy's real please I need
