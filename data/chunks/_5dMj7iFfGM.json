must be from New York yeah well you could definitely tell that 4 3 2 and we're live John Joseph so this is like I'm excited yeah man and I'm excited too for I think it could set a nice precedent because there's so much fucking toxic energy between vegans and non-vegans even if we're just joking around people get so fucking angry and it's not necessary absolutely I mean where's the humor where's the comedy yeah I mean the other thing is I don't sit around call like I'm not defined by what the fuck I eat like like this dude said how come you don't call yourself a vegan I'm like because I do a lot more shit than just eat plant-based food it's part of what I do but don't you call yourself a vegan to me are a vegan right I practiced that lifestyle for sure but I don't call myself vegan that's interesting I would say people say you know how do you like I don't like to put any type of material late label on myself and if somebody says you know to me and pushes the issue I'm like I'm more of a Hari Krishna bhakta yoga person than I am a vegan you know even though I don't wear animal products I don't use animal products I eat a plant-based diet 100% but to call myself that just puts me in some you know some shelf oh it's just another vegan or whatever the fuck you know it's well you know it seems to me as like people always searching for an identity and if they have an identity that you know I'm a I'm a carnivore I'm on the carnivore diet which is all the latest trend right and then people get really hopped up on that and that's all they want to do is talk carnivore diet so the the the difference between what's happening right now with this carnivore diet and vegans seems very similar to me in that they're very into the identity of their food night not their food choices but certainly into the fact that this is how they identify they talk about it all the time and I just think there's there's pitfalls in that there's like traps that people fall into where they lock their identity into a group absolutely and this is what happens with vegans it happens a ders it happens with Republicans happens with Democrats it just becomes a group thing and then you automatically oppose people the other group and you you have like you have conflict with them you have hate with them do we need more walls we don't need many notes and and I'll tell you what really got it for me and and I started doing this in 81 before anybody I came out of incarceration I came out of abusive foster homes my father was a professional fighter tried to murder my mom beater continuously I didn't even find out I you know that I was I was conceived out of a rape from him on my mom so getting locked up hitting the streets and then meeting the Bad Brains in 1980 and seeing them and who they were surrounded by it was a lot of you know people who were into very metaphysical stuff like so I got into the yoga and I know you've been doing yoga now too so one of the first tenants of the yoga practice which slams all it is all this label shit is a hump Ramasamy that I'm actually my identity is the spirit soul it beyond anything in the material world any label you want to put on yourself so that's really where I come from with the whole thing and I think the toxicity level that is existing now just because of what people fucking you know choose to eat I mean I have my issues with certain things that are being done because because of the condition of the planet and we're not being good custodians of this planet that we're in charge for kids and future generations what's being done now there's industries that are destroying the planet like you know some of it is irreparable damage being done but I really try to keep it metaphysical with everything I do and who I help I mean I'm working on a documentary right now in here thirty of life with hardcore fucking ex-cons I just did 20 25 years 30 years if I go in there trying to preach some some vegan shit to them I'm coming out of my fucking like y'all dude this is where I've been I and where you are people help me and I'm here to help you I we didn't start out you know we don't even say you know we said you know plant we're gonna put you on a plant-based diet what are you gonna do tell them don't wear leather fucking shoes don't do this don't you know in the whole thing even when jay-z and Beyonce it's never enough okay they went and did you know they said vegan right okay we're practicing a vegan diet we're doing a 30-day vegan so what are the vegans do attack them all but if they're wearing fucking leather and it's you have to be able to fan the spark so if you see some goodness in someone you have to be able to fan that spark not throw water on it and that's the problem that's being done is people are so judgmental because they've built this walls the walls between them that it's just fault-finding and I was telling the guys I trained them this morning we're in doing this 30 to life we'd Kip Anderson and we're at the Amity Foundation where these guys got paroled and I said look there's two types of mentality in the world there's the B mentality that's looking for the sweet and the good in people and then there's the Flies and they're looking for the shit I said when you see shit on a sidewalk and a dog takes a shit or in New York you know a human takes a shit within a matter of fucking 20 seconds there's flies on that motherfucker so I try to roll with the p.m. a which I learned from Bad Brains positive mental attitude which Napoleon Hill HR copped it from Napoleon Hill Think and Grow Rich and all those books on self-help and it was like he told me no matter what circumstances you may be in and I was in the Navy at the time in Norfolk fucking smuggling fucking up catching cases came out of took took Navy over going back to jail and I was fucking up I didn't know what to do fucked out of my mind hanging out with Henry Rollins and Ian McKay and all those guys in the DC hardcore scene in New York punk scene and you know hanging with John Belushi on fear that night we would have once that breakfast at a Saturday Night Live and just you know the just doing crazy shit and he was just told me you know whatever you may be going through in life if you keep a positive mental attitude you could get through anything so how am I going to criticize people just because you eat meat or do whatever it's like you know and some of these people are hardcore Christians and it's like you're supposed to say hey what you know hate to say not the sinner or whatever the fuck that whole philosophy deals with I mean my point is I'm trying to knock down the walls between people and unify people so I think what you do good is you you're a very positive role model in terms of hard work in terms of your your your mental fortitude and how you approach things and I think people need that I think one of the things that's going on right now with social media and one of the reasons why people will attack jz4 in leather shoes even though they're there they're looking to stand out they're looking to be virtuous they're looking to be the person that's more virtuous than the person we're pointing a finger at man fuck them and there's always a lot of fuck people who aren't this or fuck people who aren't that should never say fuck people cuz people right are they're just like you they're human beings and everybody's on a different path tell me why you believe the way you believe tell me why you think the way you think and I'll tell you why I think the way I think and I bet we'll find common ground and that's what human beings need to do more with each other the problem with social media is it gives us them in this unusual platform to get people to pay attention to their ideas maybe their ideas aren't even that good or maybe their ideas are very obvious you know like you're gonna point at someone hey man you know you shouldn't say this word hey man you shouldn't do this thing because that we've decided that's a bad thing we've decided that that's culturally unacceptable anymore and now everyone's gonna attack for that very reason instead of describing how they feel what makes them feel when they say something what makes them feel when they do things where what's going on in their head so we could all relate on common ground people just want to attack and it's it's a big problem with what's going social media is way too young it's a new thing and people are using it and these really fucked up ways they don't exactly know what they're doing while they're doing it they're not even aware of the effect of their printed word what it's gonna have that's why you have so many trolls and so many mean people and so many people just trying to get a rise out of someone they're not even aware of the this process they're setting in motion they just know they could push a button and watch something happen they're just going whoo yeah I mean this is this is a lot of what's going on today I mean and some of this stuff is is destroying people's lives yeah what's that fucking do and they don't they don't realize that you know it's it's a shame because like when I was growing up we didn't have social media there was no motherfucking internet there was no none you know I remember I had the first pager it was fucking you know gigantic so like we didn't even have no internet everything was you know word-of-mouth and if you wanted to catch shows if you wanted to do this if you had a beef with somebody you didn't go on fucking social media and talk a bunch of bullshit you fucking walked up to the person and you said hey Here I am and what the fuck let's let's deal with this let's talk about it talk it out but now you got people buying followers and do it it's just that it's you know it's just the most toxic environment in a lot of ways and it's a shame because it could be used and that's why I never post negative shit I try to use the platform you know make light of shit not have a stick up your ass there's too many people that do even the plant-based vegan thing and everything's so fucking serious I'm like you might reach more people if you lightened up you know like like stripes lighten up Francis okay yeah I think so if you say you eat meat I'll kill you well you did write a book called meters for puss law tell you how that came about and actually I got attacked I'm gonna tell you something else you want to talk about destroying people I got attacked more by the vegan feminists for that book fuckin tried to destroy me everybody cuz I wrote books now first of all and then she she went on a blog and called me a misogynistic I said yeah I like massages but you know call me a misogynistic scumbag and then fucking piece of shit and all this so I just had I just wrote hey any of you ladies that bought this book for it for their fellows and it helped them please fucking holler at this fucking woman and tell us something they shut her fucking blog down and then she called me a maniac and I said let's call Jemaine you sent people on her the way she sent people in you but take this and then I said we have we have a saying on the streets in New York back in a day don't start none and it won't be none fussing you know but the thing was I'm gonna tell you how that book title came about because it was a woman actually Cameron Rinaldi from HarperCollins wave and what happened was I was training that crunch Erin Drago's Winooski is my trainer and he's got me to all my fucking Iron Man's everything I was a fucking broken up person injuries all this shit so I'm work I was working at crunch in training with him and then another person a friend of mine all the five points guys used to be there you would see them all they had a ring on the second floor so this guy was doing pad work and I'm telling them hey you know listen man you got a fight coming up man get on the chlorophyll get on the wheatgrass get on you know eat as much recovery foods as you can that's gonna fight inflammation so some fucking mama Lu quit fucking 1980s tiger striped pants fucking you know he just took everything out of context and then he's like you're fucking people that don't read me the fuckin pussies and I'm like yo you got like 50 pounds on me but if you want to put some headgear and get in the ring I'll oblige you he's like what I said I don't eat meat bro and then the funny shit with the whole book title was it was going to be called the grow green road to health fitness and longevity and my business partner Todd Allen goes motherfucker who are you dr. oz no blood clot Joseph singer from the cro-mags they want and mr. pussy and and then I said yeah I said yeah this motherfucker was like you know saying fucking people that don't eat me to pussies I'm like motherfucker that dude ain't probably ain't seen his dick in fucking ten years he was overweight and all I said I said that motherfuckers too pussy and he's like yo you know what throw it back in her face and I was like I don't know man that's you know that's you know pretty fucking bold statement he said do it do it so right away two fucking emails in the city of the vegans that way yo that's how it started and then we out agent Dan we got hooked up with this guy Dan from ICM he's like met my business partner in the Hamptons he's like go that book is fucking dope man I think we could get a deal within a week he had for office so you wrote it first yeah I wrote it first and we put it out so was the thought process behind whitener you just had a lot of shit in your head just want to get out yeah well I studied writing under Robert McKee so I wrote my memoir first interested yeah story I I fucking that guy's like my guru for writing I took I took the story seminar twice he's fuckin amazing I mean Brian Cox's portrayal of him in in fuckin in adaptation fucking brilliant spot-on so and you know I actually became friends with Robert mr. McKee I would he smokes like crazy realizes yeah he smoke cigarettes like a fucking gym a lot of writers do me yeah but not during the class so when he had the breaks he would fucking do like two three cigarettes I said you know my friend has an organic green tea extract company and the polyphenols and that is going to counteract all your fucking smoking shit that you're doing so I gave him five bottles and then every time he would call him he would have his people call yo you know that guy fucking McGowan get him and bring me some more of that green tea shit mmm did he quit smoking I don't know I haven't seen him in the problem is it gives them a charge if there's some you know a nootropic charge yeah fires up your brain yeah it's smoked a cigarette man I smoke like crazy I used to smoke cools in lockup and shit like you know cuz that's what they give you in Spofford and and when I went upstate it was cools like it quit I quit cuz I started boxing in lockup and they would have us run this fucking Hill called suicide hill and I would be fucking puking and I was like I gotta quit fucking smoking so I quit smoking be dazed to do smoker fights in the lockup so if you had a beef with somebody you went into this rec room was explained smokers to people they don't know smoker fights means you just have a beef with somebody and you could just throw on the gloves and and go at it and as long as it's like reasonably within 20 so for weight difference like yeah you know although in lockup I saw people much bigger people fighting much smaller people in some of them guys I mean I would I was not good I got I would fight the black dudes and they would just beat the shit out of me but I would just keep coming back you know I'm Irish I don't quit man I was and and then you know I learned more of the sweet science and you know went into the Navy and and so you quit smoking just for boxing yeah I quit smoking yeah for that for that reason but when I was locked up I didn't quit or almost to the end because toward the end of your sentence they allow you to go home because they want to reintegrate you back with your family or whatever I never grew up with my mom so they would send us home so we would take the carton of cigarettes and open it up very carefully open up the cellophane carefully slide the cellophane down and put joints inside the cigarette pack slide it back up glue it closed the carton of cigarettes and that's how we would get to we back from the visits so I wasn't smoking weed coming back out of nobody's ass that was nice no thank you so that you know so that was the process and you know so that's why that's why I quit but that's the book came I had a lot of shit a lot of demons inside of me from what happened to me me and my two brothers was you know pretty severely abused in all kinds of ways and his foster home physically mentally sexually abused by the older kids in a home it was fucked up and I never told anybody but that was always something no matter how much I lived as a monk for two years a Hari Krishna monk nothing cured that fucking anger that was inside of me that I had toward these people for what they did to me and the secret of like yo it's fucked up to say I get yo you just dude from the streets you had knife fights with Puerto Ricans I got shot with a 22 and Forest Park selling angel dust I got stabbed and then to try to say y'all this motherfucker molesting me is what it took a lot out of me to to and nobody knew it because I never talked about it and I took my keys class and that was the turning point because I went up to him and I was writing a script at the time based on what happened to me in the foster home the kids in the screenplay we based what what happened to me in in my younger period of my life and I never told anybody what happened I would just avoid that but then when I wrote the started writing the book and I was taking his class and between you know parts of his thing when you went on the break you could walk up to Robert McKee and say ask him questions so I said mr. McKee as far as a protagonist who was abused as a kid and he stopped me right there and he said listen stop right day said McGowan everybody uses it it's a cliche you know abuse of children to develop empathy for characters we could otherwise not give a fuck about it's not what happens to somebody it's what they do as a result of it and that's the fucking light came on and I mean for years I would sit there and it took me seven years to write the evolution of a cro-magnon and I would get to that part of the story and I would lose my shit and break down crying like fucking uncontrollably because of what happened to me and my brothers so I just skipped over that part and I would never address it but then you know he gave me the strength in a lot of ways to be able to say hey man you got it he wrote in my book so I have his book and he wrote to me he goes John always write the truth and that's when I knew that that needed to come out in the book to cleanse myself I've been two years on crack 88 88 to 90 crack pills you know doing whatever getting shot at with fucking ar-15s robbing deals I had TOS or now it was Kos at the time kill on sight I was I was a fucking maniac because I just didn't care I actually kind of wish subconsciously that somebody would put a fucking bullet at me when I'm doing crap a lot of people get molested yeah almost act out to the point where they want someone else to do it for them because they don't want yeah I was definitely in a lot of ways that's that's what I was doing but when I took his when that seminar helped me so much because it's really like he's really like a fucking a guru and a teacher man the man is amazing if you ever get a chance to take the Robert McKee story seminar it's a three day seminar I took it twice then he does workshops but the story seminar I just walked out of there after the third day it's ten hours a day and you're just like you're fucking you're like speeches like what the fuck did I just experience it's incredible and and that gave me the power to go and tell my story the right way and the amount of emails of people that I received that were like yo that shit was done to me thank you for having the courage to tell the story and you know I just kept writing after that so even the meat is for pussies book was you know if you read it it's tongue-in-cheek I'm not calling there's a lot of dudes that eat meat that could kick the shit out of me I'm not saying what I'm saying is if you continue to lead a sanitary lifestyle and you eat this fucked up food that's out there that they're putting out there that they're knowingly putting out there to fuckin poison you because they're tied in with the pharmaceutical companies it's a racket it's it it's not a conspiracy has been proven that this is what they're doing you will become a pussy dependent on the pharmaceutical companies to keep you alive if you if that's what you want then this book is not for you put it back so you got into Hari Krishna's and you got into this whole consciousness trip from the Bad Brains which is crazy like think about that like people would assume like you think of the hardcore scene you're thinking of drugs and violence and tattoos and not a us and you were getting in so tell me about that how did you get into Hari Krishna's I'm gonna tell you so initially my first in my first interaction with Rastafarians it was 1980 so I went to my ship was going to Jamaica so when you go to Sonny when you go so you go to any port and they take you down on the mess deck and they show everyone you go here you go like they show you these films so when we were getting ready to go to Jamaica they're like if you're gonna use and it's these like military films from like the 60s if you're gonna use you know have sex with a prostitute make sure you use a prophylactic and then the next photo was a fucking Rastafarian with smoke coming out of every fucking orifice and they're like and under no circumstances should you talk to these people they're just gonna try to sell you drugs so who the fuck do you think was the first people I went when I got off the ship because I didn't hang out with like any of the dudes on my ship I got the fuck away from I was the only punk rocker I was wearing Sex Pistols destroy fucking t-shirts they're looking at me like I was already into punk rock since the 70s so I get off the ship and I meet this like 20-something year old fucking dread dread dude and he's like yeah I'm on what you need I said listen you know I'm fucking smuggling some weed back I wanna I want to get take because this other sailor told me yo you go in there and you get them to take you to the carving shops and they carve out the fucking statue and they pack the lambsbread in there and then seal up the statue and then I had a hookup with the officer the guy who did the watch and counted so say every fifth person you got searched so I was always avoiding that because I would hate to do it off with some weed or whatever the fuck it was so when I went to Jamaica I asked his kid as soon as I got off the boat like there was no hotels in Montego Bay nothing it was just you took the ship the ship anchored out in the bay and you took a boat in and landed at the dock and it was just like some fucking ancient like crazy shit like that you would see back in 1804 yeah say Laporte and then this dude was eating his cart in the fucking shit and I might kill I'm like french fries and burgers at the time and I'm like kill what the fuck you eat him what is that shit he's like I'm on his callaloo and a key and he's like man you eat this I live to be a hundred and fifty to Ross I was like really I said let me check that shit out took one fork full and I just was like fucking disgusting I should taste like dirt dude what was it it was callaloo what is callaloo callaloo is a green it's like one of the most nutritious collard green yeah it's like collard green it's like they have a DAB greens down there that don't really grow anywhere else so I think it's like a combination of kale and collard greens and then Aki is like this fruit and it looks like it's yellow it looks like egg almost but if you eat Aki when it's not ripe you'll die you get poison it's just type of thing like when the fruit opens up so it's like a red fruit if you eat it when it's not open you will die really yeah Aki Aki will poison you and then and then he was eating seaweed and beans and anyway so I went up into the hills he took me now I don't know if you like reggae but I do I fucking love reggae so do you know where Peter Tosh wanted red or alive do you know where that came from no okay I'm gonna tell you so back in I think it was 78 this cop they hate the Rastafarians in Jamaica by the way because it's a big Christian the Christians invaded that place and just fucking turned everybody into dogmatic fuckin thinking people you know to judo you know the what the white man does everywhere across the planet you gotta be my religion fuck everybody else this is what's up so they did that there so what they call the Jamaicans what the Rasta is called the Jamaicans who don't grow knots they call them bald heads man you know like Bob Marley crazy bald head so what they did with these guys a cop tried to kill a Rastafarian and the Rastafarian killed a cop so they put a bounty on every single Rastafari and wanted dead or alive you could kill a Rasta and drag him to the precinct and collect a reward so all the Rastas fled up into the hills and it was called the Green Bay killings they just started killing all these Rastafarians it and so this guy brought me up into the hills and I met these rosters and the nya bengi the drummers and all that shit and the guy had the actual cuz it was only like two maybe three years prior to me going there in 1980 and I got to meet like these cats that survived that shit and they had the news clippings and all this shit so that was like my first experience with the whole roster thing and then I met the Bad Brains one night at first my and on em cats came down with teen idols and untouchables that was Henry's whole crew first I know Henry's been on here I'm pretty good friends with coming on next week tell him I said what's up well fucking love him man he's the fucking great human being he's a beast and yeah he liked when I split the baby he let me stay at his house and I was eating his food and then after a week of him going to work and coming home and his foods going he's like alright John you gotta get the fuck out go somewhere not here but they played and then a week later I used to go during the middle of the day in my car in the Navy and go to happy hour and I'm walking in and the owner comes out he's like you got I'm going in he's like no you don't understand they're fucking black man and they're incredible so I go upstairs and Bad Brains are sound check in and I'm just like what the fuck is this and if you haven't seen the Bad Brains I'll tell you the best video to watch 1982 CBGB's they got the whole set up there and if you want to have your shit blown away just watch that so that's what I actually sold there their manager acid I was selling acid at the time so they managed I sold him acid but I got to talk with HR and he started telling me about this PMA shit and I told him yeah man I fucking got out of jail and went into the Navy cuz I caught another case they offered me military here we go there's them right there yeah fucking amazing dude will this get us taken off YouTube you think yeah that's the singer he's a fucking maniac he does a backflip perfectly on the end of this one song at the movies and lands it perfectly that's that Seabees in 82 wow I was in there I was their roadie I wasn't yes so I was actually living as a Hari Krishna monk at the time in Hawaii when so how did the Howard Christian thing well I'm going to tell you okay so what happened was they had so I talked with HR he said yeah I'm on it was really funny because they were all from DC but they talked with patois accent yeah Mon JA gonna arrange mom we're gonna run into him to each other again you know so I beat someone down on my ship pretty bad and I got quote for a drug case in Norfolk so I knew that they was trying to persecute me and you know send me to fucking prison and I was like really not gonna have that so my ship pulled out and we were going to like show back to South America and I had this that I was on the you know basically under arrest cuz the fight it was a civilian case for the drugs I sold to an undercover cop outside of a club called Kings head in it north walk on Hampton Boulevard it would stay it did plonk shows so I sold him you know LSD and he was undercover cop so I got arrested for that and then that was pending meanwhile I go on my ship we go out to see this one redneck kept fucking with me and he was like fuck Eve New York faggot and like just I'm like dude chill like you don't know me like I'm not fucking with you just let it go man and he just wouldn't let it go so I trapped him in in the paint lockup I was supposed to mate and I beat him with a fucking paint can in the in the soft tissue till he shit his pants then they arrested me so they had they had me on the fucking ships arresting all this shit and I got this bad infection they had to medevac me off the ship back to Roosevelt roads Puerto Rico and they forgot to say that you know I'm supposed to be handcuffed to the fucking bed and then they cut they didn't send those orders because this was pre computer so the paperwork I fucked up they gave me money and my ID and and then they sent me back to Norfolk and then I was just doing all my shit and so they just didn't know that you're supposed to be in cars for they didn't know that I'm supposed to be awaiting court probably court-martial whatever the fuck and then a civilian case to so then the I was in Nimitz Hall which is TPU transient personnel Union waiting for my ship to come back and they were gonna deal with it then so I was there for like I don't know like a month and a half and and they were like yo your ship the dude I was cool with he'd warn me he goes yo your ship is is fucking talking today and I was like fuck I was like I gotta get the fuck out of here so I just packed up a couple of things and I got on the bus that used to go through the base and then roll out Hampton Boulevard and as I'm fuckin day I'd already pulled in and as I'm pulling out the gate in the seat the fucking master-at-arms of my ship the police are right there walking across the street to fucking Nimitz Hall to get me and I just shunk shrunk down in the seat but if they would have looked up that was it I wouldn't be here telling you this story cuz my life would have taken a much different trajectory so what happened was I went up and I hitchhiked with his band undead from New York this punk band Bobby Steele he wolde yeah Bobby Steele was the original misfits so they played the 930 and they gave me a ride back to New York and I get out the van and right there on Avenue A 171 was motherfucking HR in the doorway where they recorded and lived he's like Rastafari I'm like fuck and what happened was they were playing a show a couple days later and there's a big Porto Rican gang that was right there that didn't want them hanging out so they went in there one night and they I mean they killed people I'm not gonna say the name of the fucking game because for whatever you know I'm not trying to out him like that but they were had the largest heroin cocaine spot in America the feds busted they were the busted them knocked down their building the whole shit alphabet city was out of fucking control so nobody the Beastie Boys were there that night nobody would fight these dudes back and I was on a fucking quaalude which is gorilla biscuit you think you got crazy strength and I said to che EE who was the engineer that shit I was like yo let's get these motherfuckers man and he's like - they kill people don't fuck with them they will kill you and I was like yo come on you fucking dude your punk rock he's supposed to be fucking tough let's fucking get these guys so they calmed me down but when I got outside the dude tried to stab me so I blocked the knife and I hit him with an elbow and pop aah pop knocked him down smashed his head off the curb next thing I know four of his homies come charging at me yo you white motherfucker trying to stab me and I used to wear a chain belt and you can ask Henry we all used to wear these chain belts with a quick-release a bike chain to fight people because in DC it would be the Marines would fucking or the rednecks would beat up the punk rockers so I got in a chain fight with these motherfuckers and I ended up so I go to run back into 171 because I lost the chain and one of the Beastie Boys slams that tries to slam the door on me to keep me out on the street these motherfuckers want to kill me I pushed my way in I got stabbed in the shoulder and then they put out a kos on me they were like we're gonna kill that motherfucker nobody would hang out with me except for this one crazy Russian street fighter kid named James Concha that's the only dude so then I said I couldn't go down and alphabet city at all they were waiting there with fucking guns and bats and like we're gonna kill that dude but because the Bad Brains were black they kind of squashed it over it so but I went up there to face them and they surrounded me like fuck a dude was like ready to fucking off me and Doc and Daryl docks the guitar blade I was the bass player came running out yo yo yo yo chill chill and they were like you know he was just you know standing up like y'all came in there trying to stab everybody you would have done the same shit and the one dude's name was crazy Eddie and he got I think he got murdered now but he did mad time and he just looked at me and it was that moment or the standoff where I didn't know what the fuck he was going to do but he just goes out of all the white motherfuckers over here you're the only one with heart we ain't never gonna fuck with y'all again just don't hang out outside the storefront because there was gigs at 171 a that's where Bad Brains play Beastie Boys and then the Bad Brains let me move in and then they recorded that first album which MCA from the Bad Brains greatest hardcore punk album of all time the raw cassette the lightning bolt man I was there for the whole recording and then they got me a job and this is where the heart Christian thing comes in I always come full circle but uh so this punk band named the dots who put out the first Bad Brains single Jimmy quit was in a band and he put out a single called stay close to me and pay to come and Vinnie worked at this health food store so they started giving us food and that's when I started changing over to the diet because Bad Brains were like you HR would be like you don't eat the fucker you don't eat the Babylon food you got to eat I tell I tell is veidt's how low tile can be fatal took me to the hell does I tell it means pure pure plant-based food no no oil no fucking salt it's like oil yeah dude it's this trick it's like the photo like avocado oil yeah no no like if you take coconut and you and you fucking shred it down so fine that the oil comes out of it that's fine but they don't do processed oils that's a different thing when you process the oil if you have health problems like what they proved in forks over knives then it becomes a toxic oil to the body and if you have any kind of hard conditions and stuff like that you should really avoid it so anyway what they did was they got me they were smart because they wanted me to give them free food the Bad Brains it got me in the health food store and the dude was like this hippy yogi dude hooked up with sachin Ananda Swami it was called prana foods and he's like well you're gonna do karma yoga when you first come in here in other words you're not gonna get any money you're gonna you know you can eat and it's karma yoga it's good for your karma so then I told everybody in the motherfucking neighborhood I was like yo I'm working at this health food store come over and get some food so Bad Brains would come and load up groceries I worked the juice bars giving out fucking sandwiches to the entire neighborhood and dude is sitting there watching me and after the end of the day goes excuse me did did any of those people pay for that food I go nah man that's that karmayoga shit you were talking to me about he's like you're on salary as of tomorrow do not give away any more food so then I was like I worked there for a little while and Vinnie took me to the Hari Krishna temple on 55th Street so I kept trying to defeat this dude philosophically I was like yo Bert and he knew the whole philosophy of the Vedas and the bhagavad-gita is where all the yoga all the Yoga Sutras and all that comes out of the bhagavad-gita and probably put out the bhagavad-gita as it is which which the original bhagavad-gita from India and I kept trying to defeat it you read the bhagavad-gita all the time every day I read bhagavad-gita and srimad-bhagavatam what do you think soma is who soma what's the soma soma RAAS soma-rasa that is a drink that they drink on the heavenly planets it's a it's a beverage on the heavenly planets that they get in toxic intoxicated yeah the big question is like what's in it there I don't know no one knows these elements you know when people say you think these life on other planets I'm like what do you fucking Mamaluke of course this life on other you think you're the only fucking life in the universe come on man well that's one of the things in the Bhagavad Gita's is flying crafts and soma is one of them and some some ones one of the interesting things rather and soma they it's some sort of a psychedelic concoction but nobody knows exactly what it is they think it might be a combination of several things they think for sure psilocybin is in it but they think it might also be hashish that hashish might be in it yeah I mean if there's other there's elements in the in the upper planetary system that brahmaloka and all these different planets in the solar system a dark astrology is much different than the Western astrology so they talk about planets way above earth you know that what are they when you - they're teaching you the bhagavad-gita though what do they describe soma so they called it soma-rasa in it that was a beverage that's drunk in the heavenly planets available on the earth planet is is the demigods drink soma rose demigods on other planets that's the only time people drink it I mean she she does she bite smoke the ganja and stuff like that and I don't know you know they put the ashes of the crematorium on their bodies and stuff like that but they you know the thing about there's four principles in the Hari Krishna when you live as a Brahma trying monk which I did and it's no intoxication at all no no eating of meat fish eggs none of that no gambling and no illicit sex so I was actually a 100% brahmacari celibate monk for how long for two years and I trained martial arts in Hawaii in the hills with this one black dude who was fucking fierce and he was a brahmacari too so we would train and completely celibate I was getting up two o'clock every single day in the morning I was in bed by 8:00 and training and working and just you know trying to heal my my soul but that came because when I first was going to the temple I wrote I would write down my questions I know I'm gonna get these motherfuckers tomorrow because I was reading gorgey Krishnamurti Brahm das like I studied you know I saw all those guys I went to see Krishnamurti speak and meditate I was good I was just eating it up like once that light came on metaphysically for the meditation and the yoga and everything I just went full fuckin bore into it so it started from the health food store yeah because I worked for many Signorelli who's now the drummer for the unsane he still plays drums he was in the dots he was in turbo hydra-matic a bunch of bands in New York and he just started hitting me with questions what do you think this is what do you think I was like I don't know man and then after giving me this book he gave me this book called the science of self-realization and I read it and I was like dude this yoga master AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada I was like I got to find out more where is this guy and he said oh he left the planet in 77 but you could go to the temple and see the whole process so I was like y'all I want to go and I went and they had this ceremony and it's called greeting of the deities and then the song that gets played George Harrison plays bass on it and I was like y'all it was from the brahma-samhita and I was I just was attracted to it everything I known in my life was pain and violence and just fucking crazy I mean you know I thought it was a pathway to some sort of an escape from the trappings of your past it was a pathway to enlightenment pathway to peace absolutely peace but some of the most fierce warriors and what I loved about bhagavad-gita is spoken on a battlefield between Krishna and Arjuna Arjuna was a chariot Krishna's this line this this sampradaya comes from the warrior class and if you read any books on martial arts they're going to tell you the martial arts originated in India the original martial arts school were all in India and at one point sank Acharya chased all the Buddhists out of India and they fled across the Himalayas into China so this is actual history that you and you can see where the martial arts spread out across across the planet but you know a lot of it a lot of things that are around today originated in India so to me that really I was always in you know I was a street fighter I messed around even you know with some going to martial arts schools always on the outskirts that I even went and trained with Ron Van Cleef when he had his school in New York but no show yeah but he would he would always be trained in police forces and I was the only white dude in the class and it was all blacks and Puerto Ricans and when she came time to spar they beat the shit out of me I was getting fucking wrecked by the by the black belt Bible you know I was no light sparring back then no nobody that's pardon the other there were schools Victor Vega Ron Van Cleef Ron tag annachi dis dude doc this other dude named Rodin who ran in school University of streets they would run from into the dojo like 20 dudes and just all out fucking parole yeah like even Bryan Callen his teacher and all these guys they train under master Choi and he some name Choi and he encouraged you to fight yeah you are training to fight like he's very common back then yeah that was a big part of it because you had to develop people that could actually perform in competition and one of the best ways to do that was to have challenge matches so like we were talking about smokers yeah they used to have allowed that in LA up until real recently over the last ten years or so they banned smokers but used to be able to get your experience in actual fights on the smoker and that was a little bit more prepared than the dojos storming days yeah but the dojo storming days that's how a lot of people got good and said like you have real fights you would go in there some guy would come from another school and you knew you were gonna hit each other as hard as you could it was it wasn't it wasn't really sparring well I'll tell you a lot of that spun into gang bonds too because a lot of people that were the martial arts teacher this one dude JR he's famous he was in the New York Times he was one of the biggest heroin traffickers on the Lower East Side he was one of the first guys to get busted under the RICO statute he did the full 25 and he trained all of the dudes that sold for him and all his street soldiers were all trained in martial arts so a lot of these guys were doing shady shit behind the scenes because that's what alphabet city and the Lower East Side and that's what New York was about I'm actually good friends with Ty mock don't know shit yeah Ty mock in the last dragon time Marc's father is a Hari Krishna his name is Cosmo I met him in LA like fucking 20 years ago he came to a shows like that's the last dragon yeah well you know he I won't say names but he out is somebody that tried to do some shit to him and they blackballed him in Hollywood and the guy said you're never gonna make another motherfucking movie and he hasn't oh he got fucking dude and he suddenly that happened a Hulk Hogan somebody tried to fuck Hulk Hogan yeah imagine giant human being I was like I'm gonna suck your dick he's like no brother like I bumped you to sleep this is that this is like this Terry Crews thing a lot of people have made fun of Terry Crews because how does this big stud of an athlete who cares if who grabs your dick just swat that guy in the head but he's saying no this is a this is a system systemic problem when you have people that are in power and they control your destiny and that's there's a lot of that a lot of they'll ruin you may have and they did a lot of people listen like the whole like it's a you know the whole me to shit first of all my mother was raped twice so if some dude is pushing his weight around on a female I think that shit's fucked up and then they're gonna turn around and fuck him but fuck these people I say fucking get him the fuck out of there and I'm gonna tell you a story because Julia Phillips and Michael Phillips they you know they fucking produce one of my favorite movies of all time which was taxi driver and Close Encounters they did all those movies she wrote a book called you'll never do lunch in this town again in the 80s she had the cro-mags coming playing a movie at the Ritz they flew us off the motor head toward picked us up in limos she wanted this shit to be lips sunk I said now if you want the cro-mags it's a fucking real show and we're gonna fucking lay it down we had like a thousand of our fans the ankle tape fucking dude just crazy shit and two people broke their necks during the shooting so the movie's called it's called the beat yeah but the thing was she was one of the first people to put out and expose these fucking scumbags for doing that shit to people in Hollywood and exposed a lot of that in a book you never do lunch in his town again and when the book came out she was on the set for interview with a vampire and they came and pulled it off the set and she was fucking blackballed from fucking Hollywood she never made any more fucking movies and then he's all pre-internet this is pre-internet get away with things like yeah and she just fucking put up the middle finger to all of them like fuck you she passed away of cancer but she was like a real fucking punk rocker man she fucking took on the system the boys club in Hollywood and you know even the shit I don't know how legit the Cory filming you know stuff is I know him and whatever but like she saying it's a problem that you don't yeah it's like one of those things where I don't know what to do here yeah you know some shenanigans but I know that it's something happened yeah I know it I know it goes on something happened it's not just him I mean that the list is a mile long for everybody that comes forth there's a million people that are sitting back and I don't want to say anything because I don't want to take that shame on well that's what happened with me you know it was the same thing like you know you have this rep and whatever the fuck but that's all false ego even all of that stuff like yeah and then the person that I was with at the time said you know this story is gonna help a lot of people you by you coming forward and saying what happened to you and how you're dealing with it now and that's what that's what I even did I got this new book the PMA effect coming out and the whole shit is about healing people and help I mean I've helped thousands of people kick drugs kick suicidal thoughts and and you know it's not that I'm like I'm turning him into a vegan it's like dude I'm gonna show you the system that worked for me that's all I can do is tell you I'm like the fucking mailman you know I'm just delivering the fucking mail to you I didn't come up with it but I'm showing you the yoga the plant-based diet the meditation the training constant fucking training well through all the things are doing you're committed and you're you're disciplined and that's attractive to people right people look to for people that are doing things that they wish they were doing yeah so they see someone I mean that's the whole cult of personality right they see you they see you you've got this powerful personality and you're positive and doing things and people gravitate to that and they want to be a part of that I mean that's that that's what happens but but but the first thing that I and I said it cuz vice did a whole 18 minute special on me if you if you just google fucking vegan Ironman this shit comes up they did a 18 minute documentary and one of the things I said first off is don't say you can't do it you could do any fucking thing you apply yourself to you just haven't tried you could do what I'm doing and I'm gonna tell you I go to races these iron man's all over the fucking world and these guys show me pitches one guy was fucking he lost a hundred fucking pounds dude he was so depressed he was on meds for depression so everything that I'm doing is coming out of service it's its service to help people it's not I come at them right from the same fucking platform I'm like and even Nevada is what does this a tree not a piece thn on television Armani domina yeah yeah Kidani acid ah hurry you should think of yourself lower than the straw in the street more tolerant than a tree always ready to offer respects to others in that state of mind one can constantly chant the holy names of Hari Krishna so that's the philosophy so where does the false ego in thinking I'm better than you because I eat a motherfucking vegetable and you eat a fucking piece of meat or whatever it is it's not about that it's about trying to help people and have compassion to people and that's something that's really getting lost in this world is compassion everybody wants to kick people when they're down and I just don't understand where this fucking sickness came from and I think a lot of it has to do with reality TV and this whole microwave in stuff aim for kin culture that exists now it's like what you said they think that if if they put down somebody that's gonna make they're gonna gain power from it it's like it's just crazy I don't come from that I come from like yo man let's help one another to make this world a better place how are we gonna save the oceans how are we gonna save you know and you know it my thing is this look they just said that the the fucking commercial meat and dairy industries are now the most toxic they're the most toxic of companies on the fucking planet they just surpassed fossil fuel with the destruction they're doing to the planet so I'm like eat a little less smooth that's coming from it just I just it's it's it was just all on where did I read it was on one of the main sites like that so is this by from methane gas as from fossil fuels runoff here's here's the thing so before that Gulf oil spill ever happened there was a fucking dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico the size in New Jersey why all the fucking runoff of the farm the Capo's and the farms with the fucking toxic pesticides the fuck and all this shit that these guys are spraying roundup and everything else and and the nitrogen that's in the fucking shit when these lagoons that have a hundred thousand fucking gallons of pig shit you know it all was draining into the into the Mississippi and then draining into the Gulf so if you look at what's going on in North Carolina right now cuz I was just there motherfuckers can't even swim in the fucking rivers anymore and it's happening in Europe too they just had to cancel the swim on the iron man in in Hamburg because of the green algae and all the shit that's happening now because of all the runoff that's happening with the farms and everything is just we're making this planet of fucking toxic wasteland well what we've done with farms and it's gotten we develop cities we have giant groups of people that aren't growing anything and then we given people incentive to make as much profit as possible and when they're trying to make as much profit as possible without ethics or morals and consideration or or the impact on the environment they set off a process in motion that we are many many decades into right now so to try to correct it now we're just seeing the effects and then on top of that there's all these AG gag laws and gag laws are devastating because when you see like one of the reasons I became a hunter is because I was watching these films of factory farming and I was like I'm not I'm not participating in this I have to figure out what I'm gonna do I'm either gonna become a vegetarian or I'm gonna become a hunter I decided to become a hunter and that's how I get my meat but when you see those videos those are the videos that expose people to the realities and the horrors of factory farming and those are illegal in most places yeah you go to prison now it was a festival for showing horrible immoral acts that are done to these animals and the way they're treated and the way they're contained and we were talking yesterday about this video of a pig farm that there's this there's this pig farm these pigs are smashed into this place where they can't move at all they're all in these crates and then it's there's a runoff from where they shit and piss and there's a giant lake outside of pig shit and Pig piss and no one who lives anywhere near that could avoid that smell you drive anywhere near that area it's a horrific toxic smell so it's already gotten to this almost like in correctable position like that that that business is a toxic business but it's not a regular of like a Joel Salatin farm you know what that guy has not heard him he runs this farm called Polyface farms and what what he does is he has all these animals lived like normal animals like the pigs they're not in these cages he has them roam free and they sets they set up these enormous portable fences so they take the pigs they roam in this one area like pigs naturally do and then they move the fence to a different area and they transport they did you know move the pigs over with it so the pigs are never contained the chickens run free and then they go back into the chicken house at night and then they try not to have mono crops like when you have mom when you have a thousand acres of soybeans that shit ain't normal yeah that's not how plants are supposed to be and then you have to throw pesticides on them and then when you're rolling them up you have to grind everything up with these gigantic machines and everything gets caught up in there mice and rabbits and everything that might be in there in the neighborhood while these machines are rolling over all that is unnatural and it's not how human beings are supposed to grow food it's not our food it's supposed to be some of these plants or animals are supposed to be interacting with the environment but what we're doing with these things is making in incredible amounts of profit and these people are addicted to this profit these corporations are addicted these profit they have this constant growth mentality where every year every quarter has to have more this it's a never-ending game and they make the laws and the only does the other thing well there you have massive amounts of money so they bribe politicians and they use all of these these lobbyists and what they do is they get these laws passed where it's illegal to film them doing immoral shit and so then you don't see this you just go to the store and you buy a cheeseburger or you go to Jack in the Box you go wherever you go and you buy these things you get corn you know where you get corn syrup in your soda you don't think twice about what what has to happen for that corn to become syrup and how much environmental damage has to take place right I mean this is the world we're living in right now is just waking up to what has been in motion for many many decades right I think what's really important though is that we're honest about health and that we're honest about the consequences of our actions in terms of like our purchasing power what we're doing with food we've got to be honest about all of it and one of the problems that happens with hunters or carnivores or even vegans or vegetarians is people only want to look at things that support their position right and with vegans there's a lot of people out there that only want to look at things that support vegan positions in terms of health and this becomes a real problem because they start they start using studies that are very shaky they start adding things to to documentaries that aren't necessarily true or proven and it becomes propaganda and it becomes propaganda both ways I see with this cardboard diet now there's a lot of people that with this carnivore died that are like this is the only way to go you know just eat all meat and I'm like man I don't know about all that I don't see any blood work I see blood work only I talked to Sean what is his last name Sean the doctor god damn it the fuck he's the the main carnivore guy how can I not remember his name what does how does that slip in my my Shaun Baker Sean baby Sean Baker he released his blood work it's not good yeah blood works not good testosterone slow is also a citation and I just want to say who the Hoss let's just look at it this way who are the hospital's filled with that are having procedures for bypass who are the procedures being done for people removing their limbs for diabetes it's not the people that's it's the people that are eating this toxic diet that Americans the standard American diet and what people have become accustomed to eating rolling up and even these carnivore people let's just take that for instance if you do all meat sure your body let that motherfucker might have been on a Dorito diet we don't know what the fuck he was eating prior prior to that so then you put the body's a perfect machine so it at the beginning of when you're doing all meat the bodies becoming accustomed to that but you know the analogy that I use is that's like getting off heroin and getting on method on because the methadone yo I kicked dope when I'm on fucking meth now mm-hmm because the method on down the road is gonna take even a long at all and I've seen people that are doing methadone for 20-30 years and that's why I love the analogy because the long-term studies of those diets do not exist right now no there's no long-term studies for the car but if you look at the blue zones around the planet of the people who were the most Centurions and the people that live the longest they have three things in common okay and there's there's blue zones in Japan Costa Rica Greece around the United States well the top five mm-hmm with the most and then and then California and it's the Adventists the seventh-day Adventists so the three things that they have most in common with the people that live the longest number one they have a meditation spiritual practice they do something every day for PMA for positive mental attitude whatever their higher power is they do that every day number two they move their bodies they're working they work in the farm they're exercising number three they eat primarily a plant-based diet they may have a piece of fish in Japan or whatever or a piece of meat once in a while but primarily the seventh-day adventists study was actually the best one because it was all from different people with different ethnic backgrounds and the one thing that they had in common the seven day of men is don't eat meat and that's my point with the whole thing and you know when it comes down to diet is I just see what what worked for me and I try to relay that to people and not not be like my ways the only way and this and that because people people doing other people doing other things in their way there's raw foodist is all these different people and the problem is with the false ego in the human being everybody wants to think that the glass is full don't try to tell me shit I know it all here's an issue with Centurions Centurions he said Centurions centenarians Antonia I think it's centenarians yeah people that live to be a hundred years is one thing we have to take into consideration you're talking about people that lived already to be a hundred years so when they were fifty was fifty years ago alright we're talking about 1967 nobody knew shit about diet back then this is a fact right okay so the people that did live that long and they were living this it's almost an accident in some ways are inconsequential like what what is going on today with people's diet and how long will people live today there's far more information in terms of like nutrition and what you should do and shouldn't do for your body so what I'm concerned with is like what optimizes people today I want to see blood work yeah I'm gonna see like what is going on with your blood lipids absolute what is going on with your nutrient levels what is going on with that and in in that case we don't have we have just a few studies for a few people or a few tests for a few people that have done this carnivore diet we have some people that have done the vegan diet and haven't had real hard problems with that yeah but let's just let me just say one thing because to throw the word vegan on something that does not make it a healthy diet I know drink instead of fucking a hundred pounds overweight they eat nothing but fried tolkien pizza you say an organic whole food plant-based diet that's what I roll with right I don't I don't fucking say I do the vegan diet could mean anything but when you say whole food foods in the original source organic no pesticides whole food plant-based diet that's what I roll with right that's why I don't treat nutrient dense mineral dense and the initial ones with people that live a long time one of the things you get from a lot of plants especially like rich green leafy plants right you get a lot of minerals absolutely and more importantly if these things are raised in an organic environment you're getting soil that's not depleted and this is a big problem with mono mono did you see that's the article that just came out today that forty years ago an orange was ten times when more nutritious I think it was I think it might have been seeing in online or something they posted an article that said the fruits and vegetables from 40 years ago were 10 times more nutritious than then the the way they're being grown today because like you said rows and rows and rows accents how do they extract the nutrients properly from the soil it's impossible well you know they have to actually add nutrients to the soil most the time they're just adding nitrogen and a few other different minerals but writers mineralization or pigshit like what yeah what they do is to get how do they get rid of that pig shit no they spring it on the fucking crops yeah and and you know well you're supposed to rotate crops right you know that's rotation what you plant next to each other that are extra I'm not a farmer composting but I have a friend that is an organic farmer and isn't it his name is Keith and he farms up up in like New Hampshire and he knows all about crop rotation at Keith Leon Forte if you have Hari Krishna do you can do it that's what he does he has a small farm these small farms are legit you can have a small farm and be in symbiosis like you can you could be in harmony with the land but man you start your growing you know fucking a thousand acres of corn for cattle feed there's you might as well be making oil well I mean you're you're you're doing something that's kind of crazy the environment it's not natural and listen you know I saw Ted Nugent play with fucking ac/dc and Black Sabbath in 76 at Madison Square Garden I went to all them shows but you know when he came on in the shit that he was talking I was just like the fucking GMO crops okay eighty percent of the GMO crop is being fed to animals for fucking slaughter the the what he called the stupid vegans are not the ones that are eating that shit that most of the crops that are genetically modified because you have these corporations McDonald's every one of these corporations they want every fucking piece of meat that tastes the same they want every fucking french fried potato to be the same so the only way they can control it is the control of the genetic markers so that's why they're using all of the all majority of the genetically modified grains and Monsanto you know who just got bought out by Bayer and they're changing the name because Monsanto is such a big rap I don't rap rap if you don't know it Bayer just bought them yeah now do you know the history of bear from super cub no but my G Farben no prior to that they made the Zyklon cast that went into the Nazi death chambers well that's you know what's funny that that night cyclone gas was created by Fritz Haber Fritz Haber's also the guy who created the process of extracting nitrogen from the air really so he's the guy the reason why we can grow the kind of crops that we have today is because of Fritz Harbor they say the 50% of the night rain and most the nitrogen and most people's DNA comes from the Haab or method he also created Zyklon a Zyklon a cyclones 'i guess the nazis well he created Zyklon a and they added the smell to it so you could smell this toxic gas you would know it when it was coming so you can get out of the way the Nazis switched it to zyklon-b Fritz Haber was actually a Jew and they took his invention and cut out the smell portion of it so that they could gas Jews wow it's dark shit I said Jo's a smart motherfucker it's dark shit saved a lot of people and killed a lot of people they want to try that guy for crimes against humanity while he was winning the nobel prize for science at the same time as he was also the first people he was one of the the first people that implemented a gassing program where they used it to gas the Allied troops in World War 1 that was Harbor well he was a big part of that I didn't I did not know that yeah it's crazy shit so that is how we get nitrogen we get nitrogen from the Harbor method when they're pouring nitrogen into the plant into the soil so they can grow plants that's a big part of it when you say genetically modified - the big part of that is like we want to think about Oh like labs and science and all this jazz but almost everything we eat is genetically modified including all of our grains like especially all of our fruits and vegetables we were saying about tomatoes or orange being different than it was 10 years ago fucking everything's different yeah because they want these things to be durable so they could throw them in a bus or a truck rather and travel closer sell them some more here's the thing and I know what they do they take the DNA of a flounder and inject it in a tomato so it can resist the fraud how do they do it I don't fucking know is that real it's that's real so if you eat a tomato does it have flour yeah now vegans if you're eating GMO shit maybe you're not eat vegan food you could be eating a fish tomato thing is if you eat plants plants absorb like you they found salmon DNA in some plants because plants absorb this the fish that people use for fertilizer yeah you know so you're getting some of that animal but it's a natural cycle that you're getting it through I mean animals eat animals plants eat animals animals even eat plants I mean there's fucking crazy plants in South America it looks like a leg of Oz and these rats they get attracted to this sweet smell around the edges and it's slick and they fall into the hole and the plant closes and I'm gonna swallow them and eat some yeah well well you know the other thing is this you have chemical companies making your food their job is not to feed the world they're not to keep you healthy their job is to sell fucking pesticides let's let's be fucking straight up about it so yeah they created what was the other cross genetic there's a there's a vegetable I think it was brought was a cauliflower broccoli they mix two things and came out with it's a different process but what they're doing now and really what they do when they can take roundup and pesticides and put it in the fucking seed right is what they're doing now and so the plant from the growth cycle is resistant to these rights and and all the people that are having the gut issues I don't know if you listen you know I know you had rich roll-on twice he's my fucker boy he's a homie dude he's fucking everyone asked me like what's that motherfucker like from what's he like in real life I'm like that's the most genuine fucking dude you know you ever have anything going on he just wrote the foreword to my new book the PMA effect I mean he's such a fucking he's a solid cat very solid but it was not going with that you took me down to plants glyphosate yeah so he just had dr. Zack Bush come on who's a doctor this is clinical research this is not speculation this is not fucking vegan propaganda this is fucking science and he proved that glyphosate and what's happening now with the gut health of gut health is such a huge issue everything the bad fucking disease it starts in the gut and the glyphosate is eating through the stomach wall and causing leaky gut and all these other physical diseases from happening now the other thing is you have to realize what these pesticides are they're neurotoxins and then the ones that they're putting inside the seed when the bug eats the leaf it fucking dies so you're eating these fruits and vegetables that are completely fucking toxic well here's what happens when they created it one of the things one of the reasons why they were able to implement it they said it doesn't kill people it kills plants and it kills bacteria so everybody's like Oh fine yeah no problem it only kills plants and bacteria that's totally safe no your body is filled with bacteria your good bacteria your God has more eco alive than there's ever been a human being on the planet ever there's more e.coli in your life and any humans than I ever lived more numbers and you need them you need the bacterial flora gets destroyed by glyphosate you know by round that's a that's that's I mean that podcast that he did that episode with dr. Zack Bush is fucking it's fucking unbelievable and I'm surprised like you know motherfuckers take tattooed out at this point well it's they're making so much money and people aren't listening and there's so much signal there's so many noises and they use the word that everyone loves to use the two words conspiracy theorists yeah that's a good one but here's the thing once you can prove something and there's data and evidence to back it up it's no longer a theory it's a fucking fact so nobody could speak allottee and by the way when they implemented it they probably did think that they could get away with it they think it would be fine they really probably didn't know as much as we know today about gut biome right that's all new shit it's all within the last couple of decades already yeah yeah chem cheese fucking him yeah I drink a lot of luck yeah I drink a lot of kombucha eat a lot of kimchi that's where I get it from primarily yeah that's good stuff yeah I mean gut biome is gigantic you know to the point where people make memes joking around about me saying gut biome because I say it so much and you know the other reason that I was I didn't know where this whole conversation would go because I have respect for you as a martial artist like I said I know Brian since the 80s and you know he always talked about you but rich role wrote you and said that I was up at his house and heard that I was coming on a podcast and you responded to him in a text message and said yeah it's so fucking toxic what's going on like I just want to sit down with you yeah it's another form of identity politics yeah you know and people look there's a lot of people that I'm friends with that have all sorts of dis they agree with things that I don't agree with they have ideas that I don't agree with I mean you're allowed to have varying opinions that's what human beings are all about we're supposed to be able to communicate our ideas but you're not my enemy if you eat plants that's crazy right and the promise I eat plants - I eat a shitload of them like this idea that you know that vegans and meat-eaters are supposed to be enemies I mean I hang a strange missing man I'm gonna tell you straight up I hang out with dudes that fucking eat McDonald's like I have friends like I don't look like I said I'm not the fly looking for the shit you know I try to look to the positivity of every human being and some of them eat meat my brother fucking my brother eats meat I'm supposed to hate my brother cuz my brother eats eats fucking meat you know it's it's just like it's I it like you said its identity politics and I don't roll with that because if in my line of work and what I'm doing which is getting people out of some really dark fucking shit in their lives like this documentary I'm doing now called 30 to life the shit that these fucking inmates have been through in the you know I met one guy he did 50 fucking years man and he's 90 years old and his story is he's in Amity foundation and it's out now he's in this he just got paroled after 50 years 90 years I got my fucking phone and listened to his story before you judge a motherfucker cuz they got locked up he served in World War two in the army he served in Korea in the army he had his friends fuckin blown up in front of him fuckin he's seen shit we can't even imagine in two wars Korea you know what them motherfuckers went through over there with the cold and fucking they couldn't even bury the bodies bro they had the fucking stack them with you know just insane it and and he came back and and went on to the streets with PTSD they didn't even know what the fuck PTSD was back then when he was going through it and some shit happened which I did not he got double life so obviously something really bad happened and I don't know the circumstances but he's 90 fucking years old right now and he survived the the riots in Folsom he survived insane fucking shit and I'm like yo and he's out he's out now he's nice there's a fucking picture of him show me the picture what is it what is it like when when you're out after fucking 50 years in prison and he's the most humble genuine fucking dude all of these guys like like I just got what we're training to do a 5k and rich roll is leading the run and and I just got Nike to fucking give them all air Pegasus new fucking sneakers these guys are in fucking tears man like nobody gave a fuck when we first went in there met these brothers one of the one of the biggest toughest scariest motherfuckers broke down in fucking tears and was like y'all nobody gave a fuck about me man the fact that you guys are coming in here and doing this for us you know you don't know how much this means to me and I mean he had to leave the room he was crying hey I'm gonna show you the picture at his cat yeah I mean that's why I do here this is him right here read that text Wow look at him there man that's crazy and he's trying to hit on all the female camera girls who shit like he's a fucking papi chulo I nickname boy I lost it oh you did sorry just disappeared on me yeah right here Wow yeah he served in both wars honorably PTSD and so I think you know he said people fucked with him on the streets so what is he what is he doing with his life now he's in this program so they get paroled to this program called a me Foundation and they serve out their sentence and try to reintegrate them so what I did was when I pitched it and it's Kipp who did what to health and in cowspiracy and whatever and I I hooked up with Paul de Gelder I don't know if you know him he's the Australian Navy SEAL guy he lost his arm and leg to the bull shark we were talking about him yes that mother had carbon fiber bandages dude he's one of the baddest motherfucking most positive people you ever meet his fucking story is insane I just raised e seeing him walk around with that fake are my fake hand like his yo totally normal he gave me a fucking like I was sitting in a chair and he came up and was like I heard like like the hand around hand strong dude is fucking he's like yes there he is Wow you know I had to be really careful cuz you know I used to take care of my business with the right hand and like you know that's so crazy yeah dude a bull shark took his arm and leg and now he's on the Discovery Channel Shark Week and he fights for ocean conservation because if you kill the lead predator in the oceans and the culling that's going on so I contacted him and I go Paul I'm gonna tell you right now the whole vegan shit is becoming this shit for rich fucking people and the people that really need it are the ones they can't afford 25 dollars to go to a veg fest and all this shit it's becoming this pompous fucking shit and the food and you'd go to try to have a fucking meal and it's like fucking fifty bucks and just in fucking appetizers right and the people that really need it are not getting access to this and I saw 13th the documentary about the prison industrial complex in America you know did you see that yeah so you know what's going on yeah and I'll say it's prison is basically slavery slavery there's a loophole in the law that if you're incarcerated and do a crime that you can be put to work and not get paid if you get a dollar they're in there making Victoria's Secret fuckin underwear and all this other shit it's fucking crazy so it really fucking lit a fire under my ass and I said Paul I said all this a lot of these documentaries are like you know I eat vegan and I got big muscles and fucking whatever the fuck I'm like what about the motherfuckers that really need it what did I go through I've been to fucking hell as a kid I was on the streets in New York I went to I was in the same place Mike Tyson was Spofford in the Bronx only white dude in the whole fucking place fucking went upstate did all this shit I'm like what changed me man it was this process I said the people that need this shit they're not getting access to it I said let's come up with something and fucking help these people let's go fucking help these dudes who are coming out of prison and then we contacted Kip he's like I want to direct it me and me and Paul wrote up the whole treatment and and then they contacted we were going to try to put him in an Arab you know these dudes in a house and then we found the producer found Elizabeth who's the producer African American chick these girls are fucking their money man they're fucking great dawn and they found this place called Amity Foundation and they're like they're already doing this they have them in here they're doing meditation drum circles American Indian chants so much when you were young and your life is filled with turmoil and chaos you found the Hari Krishna's you found this discipline and becoming a monk and sticking to this plant base untrained eye but you had a Buick aim your ideology it became your life it became like a path and this with a lot of people need they need a yeah it gives them a feeling of purpose it gives them an identity and and to made to feel like they matter and that's what society has brought these motherfuckers that they don't matter and they even punish you after you do your time that's why they trying to do they're trying to sign this legislature that's a do away with the box I don't know if you heard about that in California you have to check off a box that you've been convicted of a crime so they're trying to do away with that because yo you did your time you served your fucking you served your time you you know you served your debt to society why should you continue to be fuckin punished and they can't even get a job working anywhere right because no one will fucking hire them so it's a hole so what we're doing is I have Dante Ross coming in he's you know been in the hip-hop game forever one of the dudes wants to be a rapper another dude wants to play guitar I just hooked up with Yamaha they're gonna give him good guitar amp all this shit tal Ronan who owns crossroads restaurant which I heard you talking about so I listened to your pockets are you talking about you were talking about that's Travis Barker's well he's an investor yeah so Travis but I Ronan is the chef that runs the plates supposed to be amazing I want dude fuckin tal said tell him to come in fucking have a fucking dinner they do fucking every day man crazy food he's like he's Oprah chef dude and he cooked for the Dalai Lama he's like was looking kind of yeah yeah but it was about giving these guys facility to change their lives and that's what this documentary dirty life is cuz like what they told me go on on this 12 for 30 days you're gonna change your motherfucking life and that's what I did and I stuck with it and I you know the training and and everything that I do for Ironman and you know just I'm on my fucking 11th Ironman I'm on the road constantly with the cro-mags touring I'm in the gym everyday I'm not trying to be a fucking you know 90 pound fucking Iron Man dude I still hit the weights hit the bags do whatever I'm all about recovery now my friend errands are not trials in joggers ooh ski runs recovery in New York City so I'm all about this evac pod and the new comm which provides in 30 minutes you get three hours of restorative sleep his whole she's that dude it's fucking amazing man I went up there I'm like his fucking guinea pig like all the shit that he's learning massage school fucking trigger point therapy everything that he's been learning and he's a bad motherfucker he fought in the Golden Gloves he has black belts he's a hawk or dude all tatted up and you know I just been on this and and I went into crunch cuz they were offering a special day and he was he led the boxing and he talked kickboxing and worked with all the five points guys would all be in you know five points Muay Thai so yeah before that they were all up in crunch you know training and then they open up the school but he was there and I said y'all I want to do this Ironman he started you know training me from day one to do my first race I started with him in 2010 I did my first race 2012 New York New York Ironman so then his whole journey now they opened up this place Recovery's right up the block from hands of Gracie's on 30th Street so they have this evac pod which takes you to elevation it increases your vo2 max by like five point eight percent and I think doping doing the EPO and everything only gives you three percent and and then he does the neucom so now I tried to test the shit and I'm like alright neucom it fucking works with the wiring in your brain so you put this these fucking you put blinders on and you sit there with these fucking headphones and he has electrodes he puts this gel by the way I have his card and he said you come to New York next time for what's right I was settling up to here yeah dude so the thing was I tried to fight it and be like no I'm fucking not gonna pay not gonna go out and the vibrations that they design that the the the sound vibration that's coming through these headphones like I'm I'm like just trying to fight passing out and I just fucking went out and then they woke me up and they're like yo how long do you think you bent you were out I said 15 minutes they were like you out for an hour and 20 I'm like what and it's just it's fucking bizarre like they're learning so much about recovery and now all there's all kinds of pro athletes are coming into recovery in New York the the studio over there on 30th Street all hands those guys hensel's nephew who just won what did he just what was that MMA tournament he just won something fuck he had some fight and he won and a lot of those guys are coming in and a lot of pro athletes there's a lot of endurance athletes that's a girl that are going in so what how does it work again there's electrodes that are so he puts like do you have a TENS machine you know add a nice gluey fucking pads right so it's these squares and then he puts this gel and he puts it behind duct of gel and he puts it behind your ear here and then the headphones and the blinders but it's sending a pulse into your body and the sound vibrations it attached to a big machine it's a it's a fucking little machine like this so it's something that we could have here you can yeah you can have I'm telling you man you will bug the fuck out that sounds crazy like he's an expert in it like the guy who manages the whole shit he's an expert in the neucom stuff Wow so like you know he's a big fan of yours by the way too he shout out yes Aaron so this is it right here yeah oh so when you put this on is it on a timer like yeah it's over wake up when it's over no they had to wake me up man that's yeah those are the pads they woke me to fuck up I thought I was out for like safety minute step 2 microcurrent stimulation step 2 for neucom is to use a sub sensory microcurrent to catalysed effectiveness the new comp supplementation so you take pills with it - no I didn't take any pills ok I just the combination of the supplementation the microcurrent works on the midbrain to interrupt the body's natural sleep strain a chiral stress response research shows this microcurrent helps balance the brains neural chemistry by reestablishing optimal neurotransmitter levels you won't guess why Healy as far as on that should help the way your brain works yeah yeah it's it's insane dude and they're the only one like the only ones in New York that are doing the new comm they're the only ones in the East Coast that have a fucking sivak pod one of the universities out here they've got one in Orange County ya know II and McCall was using that shit for a while he said well the woman who holds the world record time trial I believe she was doing sivak the pod it's it's fucking insane you go in this thing and it's like you you go you have to work up because you can't just go to level five and and your fucking shit will just bug the fuck out so I worked all the way up to level five but how long did it take you to work up to it it took me like a couple of weeks you know but like what I really noticed was with my running because III mark my thresholds and everything so every run when I was training for the last race I just did Chattanooga a Half Ironman so every run I was doing it's going in the sivak and then going to do the new comm and then I do the normal tech boots like they have everything at this place recover so like they're just using and then they have this other fucking magnetic blanket that fucking you you sit on it and then there's isolation pad on top and it sends these frequencies through your body oh I've done that wasn't what does that call I feel I'm fucking I'm spacing on they have that at the cryo place like it's and they're getting they got cryo coming now and and it just flushed like I've noticed that I can go fucking hardest I mean I would have to bike a hundred and twenty miles and do a brick and get off the bike and go run 13 miles and I'm like fucking breaking threshold fucking records cuz I started taking up any athlete who's serious about even hen Zo's I think it was his nephew or something that just had that fight the coach was like you know what the fuck are you doing and he's coming into the sivak twice three times a day and he's like dude he's his gas tank he just doesn't run out he's just he's fuckin grapple and he's you know doing everything and he's never fucking tired he's I've never seen him perform at this level so the the success is there even this woman she broke the world record I think it was four TT time-trial or track or road or something this woman cyclist did sivak and she and they accused her of fuckin doping that's it the bigger yeah more physical yeah they have that there too does something it does something yeah cuz I've been you know you're always getting hurt you know that too I'm always dealing with a fucking nagging fucking injury you got something else that'll clean issue yeah so you know I'm the I've never had a race I've got my I got my nose broken Cabo Ironman I'm swimming out and shark-infested waters fucking leaking but like even from boxing I knew don't blow your nose because your eyes are gonna swell shut so I had to do all mouth we I've my first Ironman I ever did was New York City and chromatics the drummer Mackie booked the fucking show this is hardcore the night before so we played to like 3,000 motherfuckers going off you know that whole Martian shit and we fucking lay it down and I fucking I had my brother come down he drove me back to New York City I had a stress fracture in my foot I took a shower and I went to the swim start and I did an Ironman in August 12 2012 in fucking 95 degrees New York City humidity but I was not gonna be I mean it's just a fracture in your foot stress fracture in my fucking foot and the thing is right where the cleat is that's where I pressed that's where my stress fracture the second metatarsal and it was just and I didn't take ass when I didn't take nothing I'm just like you know videos like David Goggins walking like that I fucking maniac I'm like fuck my pain you know it took me 13 hours and I only ticket to get over the stress factor it took months it took months and that's why I started wearing Hokies now I run with Hoka Hoka Hoka these shoes and there's other big pads yeah giant that's like a two inch pad what is your shoe goes down in there it's not actually but it's this scientifically designed foam that absorbs shock from the from the road so a lot of the top had the jacks and runs in them she just fucking has been winning like crazy she was just so fun better cushioning better cushion and when you get you know I'm 56 so it's like I'm not a fucking dude that's recovering so quick as I used to in my 20s or whatever so I never fuck with barefoot running shoes I can't manage there's no there's no cushioning I just can't do it but you run it you do a lot of you run on cement yeah yeah well sometime in New York's I live in New York City I might run the trail the bridal trail in Central Park if I can run around the reservoir but mostly my shit is all in the city and the hookers just fucking like you know I'll be the next day people say to me yo you must be fucked up for a week after race I was like I did Conan World Championships two years in a row and the first year I did it 2016 I fucking went snorkeling with my girl the next day for like three hours so like the inflammations not there I'm getting really dialed in on the equipment aspect getting fitted for the bike getting the right shoes to run in and it's it literally took me you know six years to get dialed in on uneven the nutrition aspect and doing them races cuz like you don't want to get a belly full of fucking gels and all this other shit you know so anyway it's but the recovery aspect of what I do like I just watched Coggins was on the rich world podcast and he was talking about how much he oguns and stretching that he's doing now two three four hours of fuck and you know strand I know you're into yoga love it yeah it's fucking great and that's what I need to start getting back into my girl Erica is always pushing me she's like fucking bought me a kiosk thing for fucking integral yoga and I mean she bought that shit for me last year I still I'm you know it's what you resist like if you read have you read the war of art by Stephen Amon fucking love it you haven't bought a stack of his books nice to give them out to my guest things that are keeping the war of art do the work yeah but he talked about resistance and the main thing about resistance is usually we're the most resistant to things we need the most yes yeah you know and it's this deep shit that book III was grateful every morning I sit down to write my screenplay on my next book I read his shit yeah you know cuz it's just and and The Four Agreements I'm big into to I went to actually somebody got me tickets to see Miguel speak Don Miguel and it was a life-changing encounter for me The Four Agreements don't take things personal always do your best be impeccable with your word and don't make assumptions which I always for I've created wars in my fucking mind and then they're like dude I wasn't even thinking that with the fuck's your problem that's class it's fuckin dude this ocean shit is fucking crazy man and I think of everybody just slow down and read some literature on some of these teachers that you know humanity could do some so much better yeah I agree pressfield's great man and what he does say about resistance is so so powerful because there is something that keeps you from doing things that you know you're supposed to do and when you do them you feel so much better it's like why didn't I just do it like why did it what was all this procrastination and bullshit that was involved in me like putting this off and then when you finally do it every time I walk out of a yoga class I'm like I got to do that again tomorrow I got to keep this ball rolling yes this is a part of my I gotta get I gotta go especially for God like you because everything is tight you know racing and running and everything and then and then when you're on stage everything's plans crush crush crush crush destroy yeah you know I mean it's like the main thing about yoga is its static these poses and stretches and your your core gets activated and everything gets lengthened it's just it's a smart way to maintain well you know what it is I try to justify it by going well I do yoga at the gym when before you know cuz I'll do my trigger point and then I do all my trigger point myofascial release all that and then last 15 minutes my girls like that shit don't count what's something it's better than nothing you need to go no but I remember how I used to feel when I would come out of those yoga classes in 81 I would feel like I could jump over a fucking building yeah and I need I need I need to get back to that but even in the resistance aspect you know what not doing what you're resistant and it could be something like I made an agreement with myself to fucking straighten out the papers on my desk and go through all this shit and if I don't do it it puts me in the worst fucking mood Shore coz that's what resistance you know when you cave in and you give into resistance man it's like you and it could be the smallest little little thing like you know anything yeah and it just it just irks the fuck out of you I'm like yo so I try to that's a good philosophy to live by and you know to have something that's been fucking with you some things you're putting off whether it's getting back into yoga or cleaning up your diet or quitting smoking or whatever it is the having that thing over your head where you know you haven't taken care of it it makes you think less of yourself it makes absolutely yourself less yeah and and and that's one of the things I tell these everybody I work with because I mean literally today and I'm not bullshit I'm sure I don't try to be like you know I don't even say I'm some kind of teacher whatever I just passed the info to these motherfuckers today I had fucking four people come up to me on the street you know I heard you on rich Wall fucking soil you want vice dude love what you're doing man you fucking help me I got into triathlon now I quit fucking drugs this guy told me that today and he's like oh I quit drugs I fucking stopped drinking that's what it's all about that is what it's out now am I am I'm not gonna give a fuck and be like zoning something and find fault with what the fuck he's doing I was like yo man props to you dude fuckin you know you could do anything you know you apply yourself to and that's really you know my whole thing in life is to just you know and that's what Prabhupada Pol Pot came to America in his seventies aboard the Jolly duta across two oceans had two heart attacks almost passed away but his teacher in India said to go to America at 70 years old with seven dollars in a case of bhagavatam x' and he came to America to the Lower East Side to the Bowery what's a baccarat Tom the baccarat Tom srimad-bhagavatam is what's known as the spotless piranha it's the bhagavatam srimad bhagavatam is an ancient literature in India it's called it's part of the Puranas it's called the spotless Puranas so there's ten days of the book ten kantos he didn't even have he brought the original texts that have been passed down from one teacher to the next to the next to the next in India and they said his teacher bhakti siddhanta said you need to write these books in English for the world to help the world so he didn't all the people in India were like Swamiji you know you are you're at the end of your life why are you gonna go to America it's a very dangerous place not only did he go to America he went to fuckin New York to the Bowery they robbed him he slept on the floor he fed people he cooked me allen ginsberg got him his first storefront over there called matchless gifts and they saw the humility of this person Prabhupada and what he did for people how he has so much love he would cook the meals serve everybody clean up before he would even eat a grain of rice he had no possessions none he slept on the floor on a mat and they saw the humility of him and he just and when I learned his story there's a great documentary on him called your ever well-wisher on YouTube and it's about his life and how he came and you know Acharya means one who leads by example it's not what and I've learned this just by these big mouths that are out there I talk so much shit it ain't what the fuck you say it's what you do it's about your action and your words and how you interact with other people and how you see other people these fucking so called celebrities it's when the cameras ain't on how do you treat people right you know what the fuck is the real core of your existence what are you here to do and when I saw a proud pod and and and you know read all this stuff on him and then started taking up the process I was like you know it just changed changed my life so that you know for the better you know well why you saying that and it's very enticing for people right like the guy I want to do what he's doing I want to I want to feel better like he's feeling better that's what's amazing about having someone who's a great role model meaning like I mean you might not even think of yourself as a role model but by living your life by example by doing things that you should do by being healthy by being active and enthusiastic but you've got passion about what you're doing about your music about pushing yourself about your books about the exercise and when you do that people that don't have purpose in their life they see that and they go that's what I'm missing I'm missing cuz we're missing so many things in this life but one of the things that people are missing is role models they're missing someone who they can look up to and go oh this is the way to do it and it and when you emulate their life style and start thinking the way they think and using their lessons and applying them to your own life you start seeing benefits and then that passes down to other people who see you advance it's like a candle one candle could light like a char was that for me mm-hmm like a char could have been telling me to worship fucking cheetos in and I would have done it thankfully he was into the right shit right but I would see him go onstage and I would see his humility he wouldn't he would always say Jah is the ability of anything that I have he would always give praises to the Most High to Jah Rastafari humble is fuckin hell and the best musicians to ever those four motherfuckers are praised by every single fuckin musician today if you talk doc Daryl Earl and Gary doctor know every motherfucker musician out there will be like those dudes who the fucking dons because they study music they were into jazz and they were into fucking Return to Forever

fugitive for 15 years oh that's funny yeah so the thing was he's you know return to forever is Al Di Meola Lenny White Stanley Clarke and I'm missing chicka Riya mm-hmm fuckin do you ever listen to this shit so you want to go down a motherfucking no listen to Return to Forever romantic word you want to go down a rabbit hole with how fucking amazing these fucking musicians are or weather report

musically energy on stage nothing and I would see these dudes I'd be like what the fuck are you into and then the role models that like you said you know we need good role models yes there's you know

right path in life and I've been I've been trying to stick with it and pay it forward that's my whole thing is paying it forward paying the knowledge forward paying you go out of my way to fucking help people I feed the homeless in New York I sponsor a soup kitchen I've done benefits that have been on MTV cuz you know I grew up being starved man in a foster home like did this bitch fed us she would take Oreos and she didn't like the filling so she would scrape off the filling and spit it in a bowl and put it on green moldy bread that was our meal for the day so we had to learn to scam as kids they fed us rotten food we were never allowed in the house they beat the shit out of us they were so cheap they made us clean their carpets with toilet bowl brushes new toilet bowl brush because they didn't want to run the electricity all seven kids had to take a bath in the same fucking bathtub water one after the other so how did we get around that we went to the fucking gas station and we would fucking bathe do bucket showers and everything was about survival it was all survival survival even even on the streets I was a heroin mule that's how I survived I left st. John's that's how I got into punk rock you know the Ramones rock rock rock rock away Beach and st. John's Home for Boys Rockaway Beach in 1976 I'm like y'all I'm weird and I started getting in the Iggy Pop and all that and then you know it was and then I'm seeing the Ramones hanging out at 116th Street at the circle and and when I split from the boys home I moved in with these junkies in this bungalow and they're like yo go down and alphabet city you're gonna you're gonna carry all the heroin back for so that was my gig and then he set the guy up and robbed him and all this crazy shit then I was making fake acid and going to the garden and just a fucking street urchin and then I got into the angel dust selling it in Forest Park at the Dome Frank Grillo's father knew who I you know Frank Grillo - actor yeah he's friends with talent yeah very good friends right fucking he's another great human being man Frank I know from crunch I met him at crunch actually like there was a lot of cool people that were and his father he goes yo I just read this guy's book like you hung out his father was like supposedly homeless in Florence you remember this kid that used to hang out with disco and all these and Bobby Byrd and all these guys and so he's like oh where the fuck did you hear those names like is this guy Johnny and you know John Joseph he was a fucking kid back then and you know was was on the streets over there fucking selling selling dust at the Dome and so just oh you know all that crazy like I've been around all those negative people and tried to like you know I have people this one got junior nuts and dougie host and they both got murdered but they would be like take that pipe and go smash that guy in the fucking face with it and I would do it because I was 14 years old I'm on the fucking streets and you know you try to impress crazy motherfuckers by being crazy right and I did a lot of fucked up stupid shit in my life then I'm still trying to write the karmic scales for so my work will never be done until the last breath I taken in this lifetime I'm trying to help trying to help people and you know what by whatever methods I can you know that's well that's a beautiful path man I mean you've turned a terrible situation and a terrible terrible circumstances into a way that you've created now or you're inspiring people all the time that's very positive I mean just did the impact you have I think one of the things we were talking about earlier about all the negativity that people have online I think part of the problem with that is I don't think people totally understand I think what we're handed is these tools to distribute our thoughts and our information and we're trying to get rudimentary reactions and we're not understanding that these reactions don't just stop with the person that we're interacting with they affect ourselves because they affect how we feel about ourselves if you write some petty shit about someone you don't really respect yourself yeah you you fee if you write some nasty snarky petty shit about someone and you're insulting for no reason you know you're insulting for no reason and you feel it yourself you don't have great self respect for yourself for that and then on top of that that person that you hurt their feelings they might perhaps interact with other people negatively because of that as well chain reaction they might get they might become the first attack next because they've been attacked before too so they start acting that way in the first what it is is a lack of understanding that a lot of us have all of us I've been guilty of it too of the impact that our that our communication has because we're not thinking about it in a comprehensive wide scale look we're thinking about in terms of that is annoying to me so I'm gonna fuck that guy's world up by saying shitty things about him and his fat stupid face and whatever you want to say about them and then insult them and I'm gonna tell you what a lot of the problem is - and I see it all the time we're losing the art of even having a conversation between human beings because this is what everybody does you know when you see them going down the motherfucking street and yo New York is still motherfucking dangerous and now all these mother fucking texting zombies now you come out of the club and they rob they're getting run over they're getting fucking crazy you know but the thing is is like this right now we have a law I go out with my friend Jake from rocks off in New York City he does all the rocks off tours it does all this stuff he has a rule when he goes out to dinner everyone has to hand them motherfuckers cell phone in to the fucking maitre d and no cell phones so that you sit there and talk with each other you have the conversation and it's what is you know I saw this whole special and it was it was on CNN and it was Anderson Cooper and it was the guy that was teaching mindfulness I forget he's been teaching meditation I wrote about him in my book so the whole rule was they had to be mindful the entire time that they were at this thing ad that no cell phone no TV no nothing and they had to be mindful when they ate mindful when they took a shower mindful when they walked down the street remaining mindful during conversations respecting other people and like it was heads of the heads to CEO of fucking Google and all these big companies were there and what they learned at this retreat for the ten days or whatever that they were there a week it was so powerful that they took that and implemented that in their companies and now Google they make everybody sit down and in fucking auditorium before they start their day up there in Silicon Valley or wherever the fuck they are and they have to just sit there for ten minutes and be mindful and meditate and be mindful and that's something that's becoming a lost part of humanity because it you know the the internet and all it is shit it's like people are losing touch with themselves and with each other yeah you don't validate me I don't got it you know what I do when people when they even knew I was coming on here and they was talking shit I fucking deleted I didn't even read them off for comments once I saw a few toxic words I'm like fuck you delete block sealed fucking later to me it's out of sight out of mind I just don't have time for people capable but yeah because you know I still have the tendency to do too for disagreements and I do take things personal I will make assumptions I'm a work in progress I'm not healed just like I say I'm always gonna be an addict there's always that possibility that I'm gonna fucking I have to have my coat of armor which I say my sword of fucking PMA and my coat of armor which is everything I do every day but I'm not beyond the shit I'm trying to so you know why the fuck do I want to go hang out with very negative people or listen you know or if somebody starts talking shit about somebody else you know what I say to them now you're my man did you tell so-and-so that why the fuck you telling me I don't want I don't want to hear it and I forget which philosopher said it but it goes the only true examination about like when we find fault in others it's really what we're seeing in ourselves we're pointing out the bad shit in ourselves for sure constantly for finding you know with other people yeah and it comes back to that fly mentality man I just you know and try to set the good example and that's another thing pop I said example is better than precept and right now you just have a motherfucker bunch of people talking shit instead of trying to be the example and try to live it and do it there are a ton of people out there that's crushing it and staying positive and doing you know getting off drugs getting off alcohol like even the people in this program man you don't even know the shit that these guys have pen - it's it's fucking insane can you imagine spending 20 years in a fuckin jail cell well go in the Pelican Bay or going to Pelican Bay and being in the Shu like what the fuck that does to human beings like the strength that that takes and I'm gonna tell you and the other reason I got involved is because my uncle back in the day worked at Chino prison in the 70s and 80s he was like the assistant warden or something in Chino now Chino if you know the prison system what they call that here in California is gladiator school but there's a documentary about this guy and he's a former Navy SEAL and he went in there in the documentary is called salvaged lives and he went in there and taught these guys he put him through like a little blood staying squirted him with holes training them fucking hard as hell told him every aspect of commercial diving and when they got released he got them jobs on oil rigs and all this stuff making six figures and the guys who were working for these oil companies they said these are the most skilled fuck people that we've ever had come to work for these companies so between trying to be the set a good example and seeing the people before me that's done it and wanting to reach out and help people at seeing and my uncle telling me about this guy and then seeing the documentary when it came on I was just like I got to try to do something to to turn the tide and having a platform like Netflix or whoever's gonna pick up this documentary it's like you know it's it's it could show people listen stop incarcerating motherfuckers it's about education not incarceration these are not animals these are human beings yeah it's a broken system it is sure it's not helping anybody it's just making people harder criminals and it's just punishing them by keeping them locked in a cage and they never get any better you know and the idea is they were moving the dangerous elements of society and protecting the rest of us yeah I get that but they're this idea of rehabilitation it's non-existent now they even removed the exercise equipment in the prison because now they want to be more dangerous right yeah you know it's basically like warehousing bodies man and they violate them one dude got violated for smoking a cigarette in the facility and they sent them back to serve the rest of his fucking sentence they it's crazy and especially out here in California like California and Texas and Florida man is fucking crazy you know and and and look I look back to the whole situation that went down in the 80s because I really try to do research and the whole thing that went down you had Nancy fucking Reagan saying just say no and you know what George Bush Senior was doing the fondles operations in South America you know about that selling crack fucking selling motherfucking crack the Vice President was bringing the cocaine landing he had Freeway Ricky on holy shit landing the planes in Arkansas right boo Governor Clinton and transport saw the cocaine and then played the Tom Cruise movie fuck yeah I saw it I loved it what is it called made in America maybe America made in America yeah yeah and the thing was and then they passed they passed these draconian fucking drug laws like I think you could get caught I forget what the exact amount of grams were of minut portion of crack cocaine and there was dudes getting busted with quarter pounds of fucking coke but that's good like man's and they would get fucking a slap on the wrist these dudes would go away for ten years so they they put the coke in the neighborhoods they funded all their operations in South America and then they passed draconian drug laws and this was the Clintons hello I was a friends with Michael Rupert Michael Rupert guy who exposed all that do you remember they had those town hall meetings with the DEA and the CIA and Michael Rupert who was uh he was a homicide detective for the Los Angeles Police Department you know what I did your I did I did I think I forget was a homicide he was homicide right and he he went in front of this this big meeting on CNN and he explained it to every was c-span or CNN I don't remember but it was on television and he explained that he busted the CIA selling drugs in the inner city and that he has documents that can prove there's a detailed history of them selling drugs than using those profits overseas it was a documentary about it that came out and it was these big the fucking big drug dudes in LA said yeah these guys we just show up with fucking van loads of fucking coke and you ever see that video of him talking in front of those people see if you find that video because it's fucking crazy eye-opening video but there's they're having this town-hall meeting here it is right here fuck oh yeah I saw this fuck yeah man how are ya good what's he's been what this is yeah yeah went crazy allegations of CIA involvement and drugged truck yeah they date date [Music] you shit out they're like what the fuck the CIA cell in jail but you know just told everybody that do you know that they Declassified those papers too fucking those you can read all of those papers now online that they fucking did that shit freedom and then they invent then they invested in the fucking prisons yeah so they're making money yeah that's the crazy thing is privatized prisons all it's insane the most evil thing that you can make money and therefore you're incentivized to make draw drug laws more strict so you can get more people in prison so you generate more income thirteenth man if you ain't seen that fucking documentary it's when I saw that I knew what my calling was to do cuz uh uh you know Noah Levine he wrote this book Dahmer Punk's and he's been a Buddhist he was a heroin addict he used to do a Buddhist ministry in the prison zing and change these people's lives and uh you know he they came out in this magazine called Sasha and I read this article so Sasha in Sanskrit means the mode of goodness so that's what this magazine was called and I read this article about these inmates that he was working with and one of them said he was never getting now he's you know life without the possibility and he said if I had access to the information of what I've learned through this program I wouldn't be where I'm at so then that planted the seed in me and then just seeing what the whole shit turned into how the people that really need the food deserts and everything that's going on in this country and the research I've done and everything I've been talking about and fighting for change by taking action against the fucked up shit and then thirteenth coming out and just lit another fire under me I'm like man you know let's fucking like help these people man and and but yeah the whole I knew about all that coke shit back in the fucking day and at first I was like yo cuz Congress wouldn't cut a check to him to do his dirty fucking shit down in South America we got our hands in wars all over this fucking trying to take down governments all over this fucking planet man it's it's insane what yeah that Barry seal story is fantastic that's the guy who they that Tom Cruise played in that movie I mean it's a fucked up version of it in the movie I'm sure it's not totally accurate but that guy was selling drugs and he was going to South America and bringing him over and dropping them off in Arkansas while Clinton was the governor and he pardoned him the DEA do it was like I fucking got you yeah call comes let him go guess who it was Bill Clinton yeah that's that's fat dude that's a fucking fact yeah happen and then you get you know Hillary Clinton I'm four black people and this and that no you ain't you and now she's like yeah we have to change the fucking prison laws and the sentencing laws on drugs hell you created those two three strikes which the fucking husband she's a fascinating character because people want to think of her as being this super progressive person because she's a woman and because she's a Democrat she didn't believe in gay marriage until 2013 talk shit I got I got it fucking I saw videos of a talking shit against gay marriage and and like you know marriage should be the unity of a man and a woman and God it's all political it's all mouthpieces they changed it no one can take a stance and say this is who the fuck I am no matter what group I'm talking in front of that's who I look to and have respect I don't change my stance on shit well you remember when Bernie Sanders is trying to get her to release the transcripts of those speeches that she gave infront of the bankers come on tell us yeah yeah things buried long gone like no chance you're not gonna release those that would be some dark shit where she's not making sure that you're gonna make more money you can help me in office I'm gonna make sure you keep making money we're here to make you make mama what I've seen your comments on Trump to some what do you think about it homeboy this I think no one should be president and I think the idea of having a popularity contest I like fucking ridiculous it's ridiculous what we should have is a council of wise people and they should have school yeah there's really should be a group of the most wise across yes but I mean you should you your work should be judged like it shouldn't be partisan it shouldn't be you're trying to appeal to social justice warriors a radical grasses or radical conservatives or you know right-wing Christian fundamentalist it should be you're making sense because you understand law and fairness and ethics and morals and values and you understand like with an objective sense and an educated sense of how to establish a quality community of human beings a civilization in which people can prosper in which laws are fair and in which we we establish what are what what do we find necessary what do we find important what's important community all these different values and enforce those and it's somehow or another figure out a way to make this world a better place than what it is now engineer a better place that's not what we get what you get is some person who says they're gonna do all kinds of shit until they get in there and they very rarely do did you see the a B shit that they just put up for all the fucking Trump like the shitty promise on the campaign he's actually doing it's fun no one's done any different but Obama did the same shit I mean they all get listen he'll you know would have done the same shit they all they all do the same shit and the thing that fucked me up the most is the popular vote doesn't decide who the fuck gets in tradition it's fuckin yeah the electoral college is what the fuck is that yeah what is that what is that if government was a great idea when you had to get on a fucking horse and take your ass to Washington in order to place your votes you'd have to do that anymore you could vote instantaneously people should be able to vote on issues with their phone okay your phones in your pocket all the time you should be able to first of all you should have some sort of understanding what you're voting on you should have to pass some sort of a test did you say look do you want to vote about you know do you want to vote on spending do you want to vote on health care how much do you understand about health care well let's take a test and the people that can pass the test understanding what the consequences are or why they're doing this then you should be able to vote but this this should be something that if you have should have some skin in the game there should be some understanding of what this system is instead you know look I'm not a giant supporter of any mainstream media whether it's right or left-wing but there's something fucked up about these people from CNN go into these Trump rallies and you got hundreds of people giving them the finger fuck you you're fake dudes fucking they got American flag t-shirts on it's yeah this there's a nonsense almost Pro Wrestling aspect to all this is what has become but he's profiting off this Trump is this is for his is his advantage he set this up yeah because they found a broken system and he said oh I just fucking rigged the system I know how to get people to like me I've been doing this forever I'm a cocky arrogant billionaire that's my stick I'm gonna walk up there with my $5,000 suit on and I'm gonna while the shit out of these dummies and I'm gonna have them cheering for me until you these guys are fake news you sit down your fake news and everybody goes crazy yeah did you see that somebody just this video was I think it was might have been CNN and post it and it was like the toxic level of it was his group and they were just yelling Acosta yeah I saw and they were all like fuck you with that chick that was fucking screwed I'll tell you something cuz I'm I'm a native New York and I have friends that are in the unions and they built fucking Trump burned a lot of fucking people and got rid of fucking skilled labor and skilled fucking union people and burned union people and hired illegals to do to fucking work in his fucking bill all this shit this guy says he's you know everybody says what they have to say in order to get the votes and it didn't have a good reputation amongst considerable also not for paying his bills - yeah oh so many lost in school Eddie fucking chump University if you gave that motherfucker your money but you know what that doesn't mean that Hillary would have been a good choice not her she was a terrible choice she's a corrupt politician one of the most unlikable people that's ever run for office she in so many ways crazy she were trying to get it they were trying to get people to be supporting her just because she's a woman there was a lot of that it's like this is going to be a history you know women ladies the ice and with her so there's all these women oh this blind allegiance towards his career politician that's completely full of shit she's been full of shit forever if you watch the conversation between James Comey when James Comey testified about what he did and what they found with the Hillary Clinton emails and then her version of it she's just a straight lighter yeah she she deleted 33,000 fuck do you do that and then and then even worse than that when they rigged the DNC they rigged the primaries so that Bernie Sanders is gonna lose they mean they she had her people the DNC Senate was cray in advance that Donna Brazile book about it is mine yes thing was he he was packing fucking stadiums yeah she couldn't even fill a fucking high school gymnasium right fuck he was pulling all the strings and she had all the favors that she was pulling in and she had a shit ton of money behind her and they were completely arrogant and all the liberal elite and the media thought there was no chance she was gonna lose she's 95 percent shoo-in to win the presidency and she walked around like she was naive already thought she won yeah but you had to Benghazi shit what the fuck is up with that exactly what the fuck was going on over there and you know with the dirt that's on I hope you know whatever Bill Clinton I know you Eevee again sometimes I don't know buddy wait yeah yeah like she get away with that like what like how about shaming all the women that came out and accused him she would attack those women and go after them and you know I mean Bourdain talked about that recently before he killed himself there was a the thing about what she had done to attack the women who were victims of Bill especially earlier yeah we're oh god she fucking represent a child molester some was one of the things that she did in her career she got them off you know there's a there's a videotape that Dave Smith was she was laughing in one of them about the victims like I'm like what the fuck is wrong with but she's laughing about the effectiveness of lie detector test so there obviously don't work yeah she's piece of work she is man she's a longtime lifelong politician and a lawyer and what about all the shit that went down in Arkansas the shit that the whole they were all accused of back in the day what was that the whitewater whitewater fuck yeah the whitewater shit like and just the string of people that have been fuckin whacked who trouble vince foster what though there's a great book I read a long time ago called the strange death of Vince Foster it's like wait a minute what they found the gun in his hand which you never do when you kill yourself when you shoot yourself when you shoot yourself he pulled that trigger blam everything goes the gun goes flying you don't hold on do it his recoil in the gun yes like you know and you blew your brains out you're not holding your gun anymore it goes flying and he was he had the gun in his hand and the blood that was missing from his body was not on the scene of the crime so the researchers think that they moved his body he was dead they put him they rigged the crimes and then put a gun in his head up case closed but what was he testifying he was gonna fucking he knew he had information about whitewater yeah you know I mean what he was gonna say and who knows they killed him you never find out how about the guy that was one of the the whistleblowers for Enron shot himself in the head twice that shit's hilarious you shoot yourself in the head twice what case closed that's clearly a suicide I mean I guess you could kind of graze your head if you pussied out like ah and they like fire completed yeah yeah you could do it it is possible but it's more likely somebody killed ya it's just there's people kill people it's part of the thing when you're involved with billion-dollar deals with giant corporations and they also tied into the military-industrial complex who by the way kill innocents all the time and write it off like all this shit that happened with drones what's the number it's like in the high 80s or 90% innocent people killed by drones they don't worry about that you think they're gonna worry about some guy who's gonna sink Monsanto or sink or sink the Clintons or sink anybody fuck that send the boys yeah whacked yeah clean it up absolutely shut up stuff the head twice press conference we're all good everything is wonderful here's Monsanto with new glyphosate yeah it's gonna fix your corn you'll never have to fucking pick weasels but I read this thing that most of the most of the glyphosate that's being put out there's by people on their fucking own homes they don't know any better they spray roundup it's you know I have a friend who had bone cancer and he lived near a golf course and they put so many pesticides in the golf course that he got into the groundwater right and he said all these people in his neighborhood got cancer yeah he wound up he has a fake femur bone one of his femur bones a metal it's a metal bone they got bone cancer they cut his bone out and they replaced it with this metal pipe well my you know the the history at m2 was Agent Orange and all this other shit and my uncle was Force Recon in the Marines and he got fucking like everyone in his units that got you know they're behind fucking enemy lines and Harry got em s cancer fuckin the shit they were spraying that shit on our own fuckin troops yeah well they figured look there's a bet this is the way we got to get rid are hiding in the jungle we got to get rid of the jungle you just kill the jungle with poison this is crazy thinking yeah they just sprayed chemicals all over the jungle to kill the fucking forest so they could see where the enemy are hiding like and then they'd have the troops walking through those chemicals it's fucking nuts it is and history will not judge them kindly when they step back and think about what they actually did I mean it's in the 1960s where it's our parents generation and the way we look at it it's almost like this unfortunate thing that happened but I almost think we're too close to it to recognize how horrific it is that the soldiers who were putting their lives on the line in their thought to defend our freedom over in America were getting poisoned by their own government look at Iraq where would they put no depleted uranium exactly all these soldiers are coming back from the Gulf War and everything else we're dumping all the fucking depleted uranium over here over there it's a dumping ground for us they're getting fuck just dumping they were using his round yeah and you're using it right right they were in day and they were weaponizing uh-huh and then all the fucking troops are coming back having fucking kids with deformities and getting cancer and all that shit turned down for their benefits yeah they denied it was even nice yeah fucking what the fuck is that they don't care that it's it's all about money for them they're their distantly removed from it the same way someone's distantly removed from factory farming if they buy a burger at a restaurant or a burger at a fast food joint they're not thinking about a pig that's in that can that makes that McRib they're not saying about that and the people disconnect yeah and the people that are thinking about the numbers on the paper look they're number crunchers they gotta save the government some money deny them deny them make them fight it you like the fight that's War Syndrome yeah my uncle gave up did you see detachment speaking of the military industrial comments did you see that the latest movie that came out with Woody Harrelson shocking or have you seen that new audiences about how oh they uncovered the whole fucking thing about how the fucking weapons of mass destruction was just a complete lie every news media outlet except for one lied and backed up the government's claim in the whole shit The Times all times ended up apologizing like we got it wrong yeah so you go in there you fucking send troops in there you fucking kill how many millions of fucking innocent people over there and and to what to cell-to-cell fucking weapons and push another in the eye and then there's a justification after the act well hey it was a good thing to get Saddam Hussein there out of there anyway he was a bad guy CIA worked with him early eighties and gave him the fucking gas that he used so yeah what the fuck is like you know that was just some yeehaw shit cuz fuckin homeboy you know well was it was they took advantage of an opportunity we got attacked you know September 11th the planes get hit by the or the towers got hit by the planes everybody wanted action and this is an opportunity for them to take advantage of this call for action and even though we're going against someone that had nothing to do with attacks on September 11th people felt like something was happening the head guy from from from Department of Defense was like what do you mean that for and you got to see this movie it's all fact-based too it's like what do you mean we're going Iraq didn't have anything to do with it what the fuck are we going into Iraq oh well he you know and then they tried to say he let Osama bin Laden and they said if Osama bin Laden met Saddam Hussein face-to-face he would tell him to go fuck himself that's how different ideologies those two had yeah Salman bin Laden was religious he's very it's fucking crazy they just sold it they kept but what's great about the movie is it shows how they just started force feeding the information out there to create this fucking feverish kill kill kill fuckin mentality that the Americans well there's you know the same thing you're seeing with his people screaming at Jim Acosta yeah you can manipulate dummies mindsets and this is what they do I mean this it's an easy way to pull the strings of the most easily let you got to think who is going to these rallies in the first place most of these people that are going to like Trump rallies or something like that they're morons that's why they're going to these things they don't have shit to do you know if you're a trump supporter if you're an intelligent Trump supporter which I do believe is possible you're a person who's not gonna go to a rally you if you have a job yeah great he's a fucking Iron Man he's a firefighter in New York he's fucking got three kids a lot of the New York City Fire Fire Department police department supported Trump he ain't going to no fucking Trump rallies I mean he's like geeky you know he's a fucking really smart cat and and and those people are lost people and they found their hero and this is the problem with a guy like Trump is he's like he's an asshole but like he's an asshole on purpose like this is part of what his shtick is right you attacked me I'll attack your back you know and he starts to make it fun of Rosie O'Donnell or making fun of this person we knew how to deal with people like did you see his whole shit that they put in the 13th and like you know he was talking to the black people that were in the fucking hood we knew the cops knew how to deal these guys back back in the day punch him in the face get him on a and then they were he's inciting a lot of this shit yeah well he's the only rabble rouser yeah and that's part of being an asshole divide and conquer divide and conquer if they could keep the people fighting each other over stupid shit then you're not going to take the time to sit back I compared those people you know what's really going on I used the analogy of a magician they're trying to tell you look what's in the left hand but what the real shit is in the right hand so by doing all this shit and causing all these problems you're not gonna go back and look at the shit that he's pushing through his agendas he just cut taxes to the fucking richest people that with the billionaire's incorporation which he said he wasn't gonna do he's going back on everything so if he could just get people fuck you and fuck you and getting people to hate each other and keep this country it's the United States of America when the fuck how did we become united as a country like I think a lot of these countries right now who may pose a threat or whatever they're seeing what the fuck's going on and they're like yo this country's never been more fuckin divided it's the divided States of America not the United States of America well what he's doing with these these rallies is he's getting people excited about being a part of a team and a team that's winning you know like we're the team that's kicking ass and this is team fake news over there you tell them to go fuck themselves and everybody gets yeah yeah yeah he's consolidating his support he and it doesn't have to make sense and especially doesn't have to make sense with the people that are going to these rallies cuz they're not smart people in the first place yeah they're people that are easily led but that's the same thing with people that would go to the rallies for Hillary Clinton or people that go to the rallies for almost all these people a giant chunk of them are just they're just lemmings I don't know what to do I do have to and hit one thing and that was when fucking Hillary Clinton was losing and the faces of the crying people who were like fucking losing their shit when Trump won I was like I'm sorry but fucking dude if that's that the fucking truth of your existence that you put every fucking ounce of your shit into this fucking corrupt ass politician whether it's fucking Hillary Clinton or fucking Bernie Sanders or any of them I feel fucking sorry for you I was laughing at those people when she lost and they were losing their shit on TV like they were just fucking stunned that I'm like because you don't realize I travel through America and people may be progressive on the outskirts but go into the middle of this motherfucker and see what you got yeah well there was also people realized that she was corrupt I mean he did a good job of calling her corrupt Hillary absolutely he just kept the mantra was going he loves mantras and he pushes those fucking but they just had yes yeah Bernie crazy bear yeah he's a good manipulator in that sense but she you know she didn't do any service but there was also like a lot of the women that were really upset were like this guy was in that video saying take girls and grab them by the pussy and something they felt like this was gonna give men a license to be sexually abusive and I think that in a lot of ways is what like started the ball rolling with the me2 movement it wasn't just the exposing of monsters like Bill Cosby but it was also the fact that you're dealing with this guy who gets in the White House that's clearly not what you want you want if it's a man you want a man who respects women who's a statesman who's a person who has worked their life to get to that position not a person who did it as an afterthought once they were already famed right see like the difference between a guy like Obama like Obama's probably he's probably measured his words ever since he was in college because he was hoping one day he would be President whereas a guy like Donald Trump's just been banging hoes and fucking flying around the jet with his name on it since the 80s I mean this is what the guy did so then once he's in office people like no didn't believe how could this have happened this is the pussy grabber he's not supposed to be in there and I get their pain I understand it yeah it is also funny no but there's something like the woman's on her knees with the glasses you ever seen the chick with it yeah she's a mean they call it Trump derangement syndrome now because people are literally they're so angry that he is in power and there's nothing to do about it but the problem is that anger and that that going derange that that empowers the people that support him they don't understand when you're on your knees screaming yeah the people on the other side of the Trump supporters they're fucking red hats on they think that's hilarious look this is the liberal left unhinged detached from reality meanwhile we're making America great again and black unemployment at an all-time low and you know it's it's a weird time for the truth because there's so many people that don't want to go any further past the surface that the truth is this guy figured out a way to win a rigged system he did he figured out a way to win a rigged system by pretending to be a Republican guy was a Democrat his whole life Democratic supporter his whole life figured out a way oh just but could be a Republican they're easier to scam weaseled his way in figured out a way this whole make America great again yeah rah rah rah call people a bunch of stupid shit campaign like a motherfucker take diet pills keep that energy high just travel all across the country doing these rallies and one you know and one a system that really shouldn't be there to win right and I think that we need a better way to run our government I think I think your ideas fucking genius how about an alpha male or alpha female that one person the one at the top of the peak running 300 million people's insane running three hundred people's insane you have 300 people one person running shit you're gonna have disagreements you're gonna have people that are upset that this one person gets to dictate for the next four to eight years the path of everyone in this group and your financial future your healthcare your your all these how much taxes you pay all depending on what dipshit wins the popularity contest that's outrageous yeah it's an archaic way of handling things it's just not necessary but the problem with letting everybody vote too is that people are really easily manipulated and they're really under educated people they don't have any incentive to pay attention to the real issues and what's at stake and what the consequences of each vote are they just vote with whatever feels good and they're busy and people are tired because they're eating shitty food and they're not exercising and they're working all day in a job that sucks and they come home they're wives bitching Adam and they're on antidepressants and pills and they're the kids are all fucked up and with you don't have the time then all the time and they don't have the the incentive to be enlightened they don't have the incentive to have an objective enlightened approach to how you handle the future of our society and what our children are going to be left with well that's why the it's the genius of these commercials if you I mean it's I I can't even watch TV when it's election time because it's just like one dude after the next shitting on each other or this person saying something crazy that we should mock them for it's like it's like the two things that you get when that shit goes on one is those political commercials and two was all the commercials for the pharmaceuticals but that's that's crazy every fucking night there's two countries on earth New Zealand New Zealand Americas we are allowed to direct advertisers to customers to patients what the fuck is that what is that crazy and I love the commercials now where the dude figures it out well I asked about warfarin and now I be happy yes people are walking down the street and you see cartoon flowers around them and feel butterflies and now if your antidepressants is not working bailiff I will fix that up side effects include suicidal dog it's like muhfucka a suicidal thoughts before like Rochas rectal bleeding you know some of the side effects are crazy it's it's fucking insane you know abilify that it's an anti-psychotic it's a number one prescribed medication in the country a bit abilify really number one prescribed medication in the country Wow it's an anti-psychotic fuck yeah what's insane I know you like what yeah that's insane pull that up make sure that's true I know I read that but make sure that's true somebody talked about that on the podcast who was it do you remember article in 2015 saying it is the America's top selling drug it's an anti-psychotic yo biggest selling prescription drug in the US a drug has to be expensive and also widely used whole abilify is both expensive and wildly use it's the 14th most prescribed brand name medication and it retails for $30 a pill so biggest selling prescription drug in the u.s. so it's biggest selling makes it who's behind it it's a good question who is behind it Satan Satan Pharmaceuticals America's top saundra guy best like I abilify know it's terrifying official site did you ever read confessions of dukkha did you ever read cyka cyka cyka there probably they probably changed names yeah how they do keep switching up their names you ever well now they they changed fucking what do you call it - they're changing the name on all these ingredients that are in food - like what is the additive the sweetener that donald aspartame aspartame they changed a name to amino sweet now because dude owns the patent on fucking ass on aspartame didn't Donald yeah I mean Donald Rumsfeld Donald Rumsfeld had something to do with it owns that well he had something to do with passing it yeah he had something to do with ignoring evidence but see someone told me that the amount of chemicals they had to give to rats the amount of aspartame they had to give the rats to kill him or to give him cancer was very high I'm like okay that's good yeah that's that's that's reassuring but no but there's a great book about the corruption the pharmaceutical companies and it's can you google this title real quick it's called confessions gwen olsen wrote a book called confessions of an Rx drug pusher hmm and I think it was her niece died of a drug interaction that they knew about and she exposed the whole corruption in the pharmaceutical industry she was a top pharmaceutical rep and they said they know how does a drug get approved by the FDA and then they turn around and fucking they pull it and people are dying and they settle for pennies on the dollar that's the fucking game they know there's gonna be lawsuits and they're like okay we just made three billion dollars off this drug and we settled our lawsuits for 200 billion so that's that 1 million there's a hundred million right so that's the game that's that's but her book is amazing it's called confessions of an Rx drug pusher and that's what she was and she would buy out the doctors half the people that they put on these medications all they have to say is change your fucking lifestyle dude yeah what is what it what is the father of modern medicine Hippocrates what did he say let thy food be thy medicine in thy medicine be thy food there's also an Ayurvedic I don't know if you know about the Ayurvedic system of medicine and it says when when when when you know if there's a whole quote about diet and and many and and and seeing a doctor and stuff like that and it's all it comes back to one thing man dying in lifestyle like the fuck are you doing tell people and and that's what's great about a movie like Forks Over knives where there's anecdotal evidence that says y'all if you stop do you see the change right there that the fuckin diabetes goes away the fuckin heart disease all all of this stuff is is cured by the fact that these people get the ass is moving and they stop eating all this shitty food yeah shitty food is the number one problem yeah this is the number one problem sugar refined carbohydrates your body processing massive amounts of stuff that it's not spoiled yeah oils in everything and you know all these processed vegetable oils like terrible cooking things in all and fucking and people think oh you know even to a certain what he got here Jamie Donald Rumsfeld yeah action FDA actually banned aspartame based on its findings only to have Cyril chairman Donald Rumsfeld currently secretary of defense at the time they wrote this article vow to call in his markers to get it approved on January 21st 1981 the day after Ronald Reagan's inauguration Cyril I guess that's dar el e reapplied to the FDA for approval to use aspartame and food sweetener and Reagan's new FDA Commissioner Arthur Hays Hall Jr appointed a five-person scientific Commission to review the Board of Inquiry decision became clear the panel would uphold the ban by a three to two decision but then hauled and installed a sixth member on the Commission and the vote became deadlocked he then personally broke the tie in aspartame favor what a piece of shit but this is this puts they found evidence this shit makes holes in the brain might induce the the evidence Granger might induce brain tumors well right and the thing is now everyone got hip to aspartate now you have to read because that's why the processed food is so fucking you know any of that she gave that fake sweeteners shit and now they call it amino sweet is the new name that they changed it to so it's like well you ever drink Z via your drink Z via soda you don't have that so to sweeten with with stevia stevia it's fucking delicious yeah maybe it's from plants yeah it's a sweetener yeah and it tastes of stevia it tastes good but I do have too much protein powders that have you know stevia in it and stuff yeah clean machine has a protein powder that's Lentini and water lentils they call them it's real real cleans yeah our on it hemp force protein we were using stevia stevia for that I've called stevia not stevia yeah but that potato it just doesn't taste the same yeah tastes good it's a matter of but it's so potent the problem is like if people have a cup of coffee I would have Stevie out and people put it in there Billy oh I'll be like you put too much in yeah you can't put it in like sugar that's way more potent you just need a tiny - like even back in a day I remember my mom being like oh yeah nutrasweet and let's put all these other like cane sugar is better for you than these fucking fake sweeteners yeah but clean sugar still terrible for you in the body yeah well we're gonna do sugar you should do eat fruit welcome to fibre body slowly digesting it way you're supposed to consume it but did you be able to get like a Gatorade it's got like fucking 80 grams of sugar and they're like that shit's terrible for you all that stuff terrible for you so they got all the pros pushing it then these kids you go to these basketball camps or football cancel whatever or high schools and what are they drinking they're all drinking drinking the kool-aid yeah well you know what if you're exerting yourself like very strenuously you could use some of that glucose and yeah okay but for the average person that goes to a fucking 7-eleven and gets a big gulp and is downing you know 64 ounces of Coca Cola that is a crazy amount of sugar for your body to get in one serving your body doesn't know what to do with that shit so it stores it as fat what forget how many tablespoons of sugar they said is in one of them fucking big gulp dude they did a thing where they showed all the various sizes of soda next up is sugar of the sugar and you see the actual the actual it's crazy this is our number one problem and one of the things that I did when I cut sugar out of my diet there it is there's the the image so much sugar your body doesn't know what the fuck's going on when you take that much sugar it's insane freakin thing is you got kids jacked up on that shit bouncing off the fucking walls yeah and then they put them on ritalin because Johnny's got too much energy Johnny's on drugs yeah sugar drug all along yeah I mean and then on top of that here's the the problems with people consuming that kind of stuff and then on top of its saturated fat like if your considers studies now that are showing that cholesterol and saturated fat are healthy for your diet and healthy for your body unless you're consuming carbohydrates and refined sugars because when you're doing that then your body's not burning fat so your body's just storing fat and on top of that you're pouring massive amounts of sugar in there so you're getting harden the arteries and clogging of the arteries and people think that this is they're conflating and confusing all this and thinking well well this is because you're eating cholesterol and saturated fat nope it's not it's because you're eating cholesterol and saturated fat along with simple carbohydrates refined carbohydrates and sugars there's a chemical reaction that your body has that when you're eating these two things together it becomes toxic it's very dangerous nitrosamines as well when you can cuz that's the average American diet and then combine it with alcohol and the rest of the stuff it creates a chemical reaction in the body that then causes you know problems for you health-wise in your immune system and gut health and everything else yeah there's a there's a ton of problems with people's bodies and you could trace it back to a host of different things you could trace it back to pesticides you could trace it back to a lack of minerals you could trace it back to excess sugar you could trace it back to processed vegetable oils you could trace it back to sedentary life there's there's also many different things that are a factor in people's health issues but one of the problems with ideology is whether it's this carnivore diet ideology or vegan diet ideology as people want to look at one thing there's one thing that's wrong and you fix this thing and if you just do this one thing you're gonna be healthy that's not necessarily the case and there's a lot of people out there on both sides that are spreading misinformation because it supports their view it supports quoting biased positioning studies that were funded by the same companies that are making money off of selling foods that are high in saturated fats or cholesterol or trans fat trans fats and there's companies so you always to look between the fucking lines that's where the truth lies because the milk industries what was the other the the other documentary that came out fuck it was about it started with the cigarettes and the and the chemicals that they were using in furniture day there was this documentary and I always blank on him it's fucking old man brain and I have it was a documentary about how they paid these people to put out false info I know you're talking about merchants of merchants of doubt' amazing fucking the same people that are doubting climate change we're all getting cigarettes being addicted yeah the same human yeah and they're using the same tactics that they've been using to push the chemicals and put they had motherfuckers spraying DDT on their fucking clothes hanging in their closet to stop most can you fucking believe that shit dude they had them spraying fucking DEET cancer-causing fucking chemicals on this shit and it's when you see those guys are the same guys that were trying to say that cigarettes are not they're not addictive and the same people that are there there were dismissing climate change like what how can you be so obvious you don't even use new people they date they did the thing with the guy from Monsanto in the roundup because I would drink fucking roundup anyway I'm gonna go get you fucking clay here's a glass of fucking yeah hey it's like drink it he's like nope what is this Jamie is that DDT wallpaper yeah look at that containing DDT as the active insecticide genuine cedar wood made into wallpaper so these people made DDT closet wallpaper with fucking with genuine cedar wood well the other thing is even the chemicals that they put in the furniture there's a big thing now to remove because it's calming the fucking children do you know that drugs and canned furniture actually will release chemicals into the air in your house I'll give this protect your children's against disease carrying insects DDT children's room wallpaper how many kids got cancer from that fucking crazy fucking shit is so insane but Hill's insects mosquitoes flies ants and you you know one of the biggest one of the one of the biggest ways that toxins into the body is not by walking around the streets of LA or New York and breathing into pollution it's the fucking home the amount of chemicals that are in the fucking home and they talk about that in merchants of doubt' the chemicals in the furniture the chemicals in the clothes the chemicals in the fucking diapers the chemicals in everything in the plastic its chemicals chemicals chemicals chemicals you're bombarded your fuckin child with fucking dozens and dozens of chemicals every fucking day yeah and while it's immune while that child's immune system is developing and then you're feeding it pesticides you're feeding it this fucking animal that's been tortured its whole life and fed fucking steroids in home and you're wondering why these kids are coming out and they're so fucked because it's when they're getting into their teens it's because all that shit's taking a toll not just physically but I you know psychologically it's fucking it's you know then you know there's so much other shit they're doing to to the to the food put in put in there's an episode you know that they put in the corn and the soy now and it's fucking it was done by this company in LA and they will close down in California somewhere epicyte epi C Y T E and it fucks with the sexual reproduction or organs of fetuses and children and all kinds of shit that they're conducting like fuckin mad science on human beings right now what the fuck is going on just for profit evening even in Hawaiian I gotta tell you I have friends that are out there and they did organic farm organic farming do you know that all the world seed banks right now for GMO or fucking grown in Hawaii because of its a closed ecosystem it's closed off from everywhere else so there's no other factors so they go and they spray motherfucking chemtrails in the air that come down on to the fucking ground and they can for instance and I wait a minute what do they do they're spraying their aerosol spraying the crops so the aerosol so what's some sort of so what they do yeah and they do aluminum barium strontium now I'm gonna tell you I have I have friends that actually are doing this they were organic farmers and had to give up their farm and what they do is they make this sit the they making the soil so acidic the pH that nothing will grow except for genetically modified seeds that have been genetically modified to resist aluminum and resist all this other stuff so now they spraying aluminum like where's that coming from it's it makes this it makes the soil very acidic it changes the pH I think aluminum has the greatest change to the soil and what's the benefit of them doing that because they may control the food supply because if you don't buy the GMO seeds the organic farmers are going out of business in Hawaii and this ain't no wait a minute so you're saying that there's brand things out of the sky that poison the ground so that only organic farmers or so that only GMO farmers can grow crops there right that's a proven that's what's going on it sounds crazy though yeah here's the thing and I'm not saying they're going like some of these other chemtrail people 35,000 they're spraying all the cities I'm spraying I'm saying they're coming in and spraying chemicals on the ground but they're not doing it as a pesticide you're saying they're doing it as a grand conspiracy to make the ground infertile for anything you've ever read Monsanto's did you ever see the world according to Monsanto yes okay so what do they say we want to control the world's food supply from seed to motherfucking to farm-to-table all the way through it we want to control them so how do they do that how do they actually make that happen and I see it happening to farmers in Hawaii and friends of mine or I just did Ironman now what do you see it huh what do you see happen because what they're doing to the organic papaya farm is have had to all go either give up their form or switch to GMO papaya because none of their shit is growing it's such that because of depletion of the soil not it's but they say that the fucking they're spraying the fucking chemicals on the soil but do you know how much they'd have to spray on the soil to make it infertile it's much more likely candidate to the same issues that we're having in this country with mono crops yeah that they're just depleting their soil because they're constantly growing on it no but these guys are doing organic studied chemtrails they study chemtrails for quite a while because I was doing the television show on them and one of the things that I found this this there's a lot of malarkey yes absolutely shit and one of the things that they find is they're like oh they're spraying aluminum and then when they do samples of the water they find a limb in the water no they're doing samples of sludge they samples of water with dirt do you know with one of the most common metals you'll ever find on earth is aluminum aluminum most dirt has aluminum in it so when they're testing this water they're testing it positive for aluminum what they're doing is they're testing dirt dirt tested positive for being dirt that's what it is right so when they find aluminum they say oh my god they're spraying aluminum there's no benefit to spraying aluminum on anything it's never been proven that there's some evil government cabal that wants to spray aluminum on everything and that's the reason why papayas don't grow right it's way more likely that these papayas are growing in a place where they've been grown papayas for a long time and they've depleted the soil especially you're dealing with soil that's really coming out of a volcano in the first place well I mean I understand that aspect of it but it's the combination of other chemicals that they're using and here's the thing before these seed banks showed up over there they never had this problem right but there's also before large-scale agriculture made its way to Hawaii as well right so they probably had years and years and years of doing this and getting away with it to the soil started getting depleted just like we have evidence of it getting depleted all over the world right India they have issues with this with mono crops with anywhere in the world where they grow crops in the same area in these massive scales you're going to deplete the ground of minerals and nutrients and it's just a part of the the problem and when they offer up that solution like hair genetically modified crops are better and our genetically you know modified crops or you know they can survive in these harsh climates and you can also add all of our nitrogen and our fertilizers are nasty shit to the this everything else around that will die when we spray except for our crops because we've been genetically engineered to resist we been genetically engineered to resist that glyphosate shit is any anything that kills everything but what you wanted to is like why like what's it doing to what you want it to what happens to that food what is that stuff out of that food by the time you eat it I don't think so and it comes out in the leaves and the bugs eat the shit and it blows their stomach cuz it's a great documentary on it called what's with wheat where they try to break down why wheat all of a sudden became a huge problem in the American diet whereas in the early 1900's it was nothing and there was a slow genetic modification where they started changing the wheat itself and breeding it to make higher yields so it's got more complex glutens in it but then on top of that it's the glyphosate right the glyphosate breaks down your gut barrier and right really so people get leaky gut and the rest yeah issues what's it kills the bacteria I mean this is what they're trying to do they're trying to kill bacteria but they don't realize your body's bacteria your body's an ecosystem of bacteria right yeah it's just the problem with the whole government is evil thing is they're just greedy yes they're evil because they're greedy right yeah but see here's the thing and you saw the world according to Monsanto and it is a revolving door policy how they come out of Masson Monsanto or even what what he was doing Rumsfeld when he was the CEO of Searle and then so they get into the government they passed legislation and they go back to the corporation's to reap the benefits of the laws that they passed you have a lot of that going on so I think you know whether or not Schick could really be what the fuck motherfucker is the same why anywhere else the truth is gonna possibly come out eventually or maybe not but me personally I tend to try to stick to locally farmed organic like I go to the farmers market you get it in New York that this farmers market um upstate and yeah they could they come up they come into the city I mean I'm I'm you know I'm not gonna bullshit I go to fucking health food store and eat shit that's out of season because I like my fucking broccoli and kale or whatever the fuck and then some fruit or whatever but you know how do they grow that stuff ship it shipped in from Cali and Florida I mean you know it's not the best but hey when you take into equation the fact that I've eliminated this this the other foods that use the highest amount of fossil fuels to grow the crops and and everything else that's involved with producing the huge you know these farms that are that are these animal agriculture system than the amount of fossil fuels I mean I have motherfuckers writing me you take a fucking plane to go on tour fuck you like you know that's the thing we were talking about the poison fault every fucking day yeah you know but but it's true though we all do the USDA right we both poison sky a little bit when we fly so hey you know I'll take the hit man the world we live in it's it's a real problem I mean it's one of the things they found after September 11th with the lack of plane fights let's change the earth's temperature I mean it's kind of fucking nuts man Wow yeah a lot also the cloud cover that's created by contrails like that that cools the earth down a little bit it's it's very interesting they've admitted to the government has actually admitted to a program to try to you know spraying shit to try to cool the Earth's well they've admitted to experimenting with weather manipulation yeah and to having strategies for dealing with it whether it is for dealing with hostile foreign governments where we're trying to starve them out or trying to put rain I mean there was space did you see the fucking that video hey guys made on space floor know what it is it funny it's fucking hilarious they it's on YouTube the spoof on on Trump's space it's fucking you know but here's the thing it's like trying to repair it's trying to patch a shotgun wound with a band-aid like let's reduce the fossil fuel if you wanna fucking cool the earth and everything and save the fucking oceans and all the rest of the shit it's why don't we check how the fuck we live our lives but everybody wants to pass the buck and say oh well why should I do it you know let the next motherfucker do it but you know you buy what you put in your cart and how you live your life and you have fucking how many people in America 200 how many 300 300 fucking million motherfuckers passing the buck along you're not getting anywhere right yeah and China is how many billion in India it's like they're not fucking they're not gonna stop fucking doing what they're doing no no they're not and it's again it's like what we were talking about with all the other aspects of gigantic culture there's so many moving pieces it's so it's so difficult because we're we're talking about these pieces that have been in place for decades and so to try to make corrections now yeah you know and some people are they are going to organic farms they are going to raising their own food and having it you know having everything be local and that's definitely better the real problem it seems to me is overpopulation the real problem is when you Jam you know Los Angeles is a perfect example there's 200 million people just here in not just 200 million excuse me 20 million 20 million people just here and then there's Orange County which has more people San Diego has more people as you get north cuz we got like a million there there's more people there's more people in California just instead of just in LA the more people in Los Angeles than there is in all of Australia just out just Los Angeles it's insane so there's so many people and no one's growing anything other than we its just weeds being grown here and that's it so all the food is being shipped in from everywhere else and so you vets fossil fuels being used and then why don't you pay more in Hawaii for a fucking pineapple than you do on the mainland that crazy dude it's fucking insane you ever been there how expensive for food is everything's very exciting insane yeah it's a beautiful beautiful place though and that's why I want to take that hit we live in a place that and humans like yourself and myself and people that are alive today we are stuck in a system that was created many many decades ago it was put into place many decades ago and it wasn't put into place with our interests in mind it was put into place with the interest in mind of profit and it was also to deal with to accommodate millions and millions of people that are all jammed into one place where no one's growing any food right it's a very unnatural way to live you know they started like coming down on all the people fucking growing shit on their front lawns and yeah because urban organic farming the you know I'm in touch with a lot of those people and as a matter of fact there's one in in New York City I ride from New York City out to like Long Island Jones Beach and all that and I pass in Far Rockaway there's a guy that he's doing like a big urban formed in this thing and you know in this crop of land and you know it's it's the urban farming is becoming a big thing because yo if I if the food as it is and there was one guy on ABC and he walked home from work every night and it was five miles african-american guy and he's trying to lose weight and get healthy well guess what every motherfucking night all he passed was KFC this that the other thing 7-eleven he could not buy a fucking piece of fruit or a fucking Apple in any of those fucking places none so then they said well how the fuck are we gonna get food if we ain't got no car we can't go 710 miles out of town to the supermarket so now urban organic farming is becoming a big thing where they're showing these P and now they're starting to crack down the cities are trying to crack down on these people that are growing fucking food that's what it's fucking crazy I had ron finley on this podcast and he's got a similar program in south-central and he helps these kids and people that live there I use vacant lots using medians use all these in Detroit - yeah it's fantastic yeah grow food you're all fuckin fruit food would be free grow it grow it on patches of the land I mean what would be ideal is it every community instead of just having a house jam next to a house jam next to a house every community have one community lot and that community lot we all grow our food in you know not hard to do I mean even in a fucking closet they'd showing how to do like they just had this they had a shipping container in New York and it was a demonstration and they put it on Lafayette and Lafayette Street and Houston and it was a shipping container and they did all and when you walked in there it was a fucking farm right and and I forget how many thousand pounds of fucking organic produce that that fucking farm inside that shipping container was able to grow yeah but it's insane that's with artificial light but you could do that with real life yeah the real streets that you you see everywhere you go what where concrete is it could be dirt and then is is possible that we could cordon off a small section of every community and have a community garden and it would also be a good it would be good for the community in terms of people like interacting with each other and feeling like they're a part of something and taking responsibility for right taking care of your hands in the dirt yeah you know yeah it's it's very like that's one of the programs that we did in this documentary we had the guys going to f----- on organic farms and getting their hands in the dirt and seeing you know people just as a disconnect between like you know farmers man I got it you know it's like that's a fucking hard ass fucking job fucking hard fucking hard man we don't show the appreciation and I think who was the the one black activists used to run the marathons and shit he'll forget his name in the 60s and this burger and dick fucking Gregory man he always talked about you know growing your own fucking food and no dick Gregory's the guy who brought this a pruder film to television there's a pruder film of Kennedy being assassinated looks like he's being shot from the front what yes Dick Gregory brought that to the Geraldo Rivera show Wow years after the assassination it might have been more more than eight it might have been more you know a lot of shit yeah the it might have been ten years after the assassin is something crazy but it didn't people didn't see Kennedy get assassinated until many many many years after when this guy Zapruder who was there on the spot was filming they took his film and he sold it to Time Life magazine they used stills of it and then you didn't show it what years 12 years 12 years later 75 Wow so on 75 on the Geraldo Rivera show they they premiered their Zapruder film footage of the assassination of President Kennedy from like fuckin you know 20 yards away he was right there and he see Kennedy's head go back into the left its you see the spray of blood you're like what I wasn't did they show that it was more than one they can't tell for sure and there's a lot of speculation because there's so many you mean it's black and white and he was shaky back then they've since used computers to stabilize the image but what it looks like to the untrained eye is that he's shot more than once and probably shot from multiple different angles and the reason why they came up with the Magic Bullet theory because they they had to account for another bullet that didn't hit the president they had to account for a bullet that hit they ricocheted under an underpass time hit a guy so yeah the bullet had to go through two people and it had to leave traces of the bullet behind that weren't missing for the bullet from the bullet and it had a shatter bone and not distort which doesn't happen yeah if you know anything about bullets if you shoot anything it bullets get jacked they get they tear up they Bend they get they get destroyed yeah you could take fucking laid exactly yeah even if it's jacketed it's still gonna get fucked up it's hitting bones and shattering at a ridiculous speed that single Bullet theory was also created by Arlen Specter and those fucking guys in the war poor bunch of evil assholes there's a great book on it called best evidence by David liftin David liftin was an accountant who went over the Warren Commission report step by step every step of the way and found all these contradictions in in the reporting's like this is a bullshit document like they were trying to do was just rap this bitch up nice and tight they weren't trying to solve the crime they were trying to wrap this thing up tight and the most ridiculous aspect of it is the Magic Bullet theory but before anybody saw this as a pruder film it didn't look that ridiculous right we heard what we were told Kennedy got shot by Oswald and then Jack Ruby shot Oswald very convenient very convenient the whole thing is ridiculous yeah I don't know why they killed him but it's it's very likely that there was quite a few people involved and not just Lee Harvey Oswald was probably involved too well you know that he passed a resolution he was fuckin with the Federal Reserve oh yeah what was the one one one it was a well there's a lot of problems pea pigs pea pigs yeah there was that he wanted to get rid of the Federal Reserve he wanted to get rid of the CIA printing up currency backed by that he want to go back to the to the gold silver standard he started printing up notes fucking if you could find those notes from when he was in silver certificates and he said why are private banks controlling our money the Federal Reserve it wasn't I think one of the acts that George Bush jr. passed before he left all this executive order on one one one serum to give the printing of the money back to the fucking take it away from the Federal Reserve yeah they whacked him just a couple months later and give it back to the secretary his father said that they're gonna kill you for this his father told him that yeah you fuck with them bankers man it's true it's you know this comes back to you know power it's not about a conspiracy it's about yo it's about they want the ultimate greed it's the ultimate greed we control everything well especially back then I mean the amount of accountability that politicians had back then you can get away with a lot there is a lot of win ever and you know it's most likely that somebody other than just Lee Harvey Oswald and he probably had something to do with it too yeah I mean he was problem Manchurian Candidate man who knows they grab these guys they fucking who knows does what with you know fuckin you know they're still doing it I believe to this day yeah you know a lot of these fucking motherfuckers that's trying to fuckin shoe bombers and this fucking clown and this you know there's so much shit going on like even the shoe bomber like who had a fuck did he get on a plane with no Passport you know it's like there's so much shit to just go home well you remember that guy that they busted in Dallas he was a guy that they'd set up they set him up to be an Islamic terrorist they trained him they gave him the weapon and then as he was trying to detonate the weapon they arrested him yeah it's like you guys talked him into doing this you gave him the bombs and then you arrested him yeah like what would he have done if you guys weren't even there what you've done anything they they thought that this guy was a person who was suspicious so they literally set up and entrapped him entrapment it's kind of going on it's going on a lot man it's fucking like we don't even know the shit that's going on behind the walls and the fucking in their offices man it was fucking scared a fuckin bejesus out he knew you know what the fuck was you know what these people's minds what you know well you get accustomed to making rationalizations that will cost people their lives and I think anybody that can send a drone to shoot down an apartment building because of metadata you know you found a metadata that seems to indicate that the cell phone of a certain criminal is on the 14th floor let the fucking Hellfire missiles fly baby yeah I mean that's decisions that they make about Virginia like you know disconnected from everything mm-hmm if
