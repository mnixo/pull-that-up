the girag and experience but I actually found out about you through kevin boost documentary the the great white hope american drug war yeah Kevin's a good guy Kevin uh you know kept an eye on me when I was in prison you know wrote me I could call Kevin he interviewed you from prison as well he did he did when I met with Kevin Kevin made my life a little easier while I was in prison you know shout out to Kevin booth Kevin produced my first DVD oh there is comedy DVD 1999 do you know I sent the book I read the book that uh he hit his buddy wrote uh Bill Hicks hmm yeah yeah Kevin's a good guy though yeah he he became who he is because of his friendship with Bill Hicks you know he used to follow Bill Hicks around and record them and Bill Hicks as far as stand-up comedians are concerned like one of the top ten greatest comedians of all time for sure you know right up there with a lot of people like Richard Pryor right even though he didn't live very long died of pancreatic cancer when he's only in his young 30s yeah you know but um so he creates this this documentary the American drug war and that's that's how I heard about you you know and that's how I heard about cuz I'd already I had already heard about Barry seals and Barry seal and his connection with the CIA and selling drugs but I didn't I didn't know of any one person like you who could be directly connected to the dude that was connected to Nicaragua that was connected to Oliver North and the whole chain of events absolutely absolutely I think when uh when do when Brandon testified against me he talked about his boss going on fishing ship with a George Bush Senior Wow when the kid went up Barry seal was murdered he had George Bush's phone over in his pocket mmm he read as deep as it gets might have been tracking the Vice in that phone yeah I know where you at meanwhile and meanwhile no one goes to jail no one on that side goes to jail yeah nothing no one goes to jail I should be it's amazing they make the laws but how the fuck did they let you out make that work yeah the only you you went in for twenty years I had a life sentence man and how'd you get out early learning how to read and write and study the law and finally what loophole what was the loophole well what they did is they charged me under the three strike law and what they were saying is that since I had got convicted in all these different states that those added up to three strikes but what they didn't see in the law is that in order to get struck out you have to go to prison get out then commit another crime go to prison get out and then commit the third one in that's three strikes so they can't get you on three felonies before you're ever convicted there are three strikes right it's not three strikes if safe isn't what I use is a guy standing out when I used to stand out on the street I just make hundreds of sales a day right there on that one block so I said now if somebody wanted to they could have gave me 100 convictions right so sort of different people every time right so I didn't believe that the law meant that every sale you may was a separate conviction I believe that they meant just like I just explained right right right because if so then everybody whoever sold cocaine would have three strikes and it makes sense because the idea is supposed to be theoretically that jail supposed to be able to really rehabilitate you exactly so if you are unreadable attainable if you've gone through two separate times and you're still out doing the same shit all right well this dude's a career criminal this is his third offense done that makes sense and that's how the law was rolled up even though I don't believe you should play baseball with people lives right because the person could not be changed at one time and then be changed tomorrow and then his circumstances changed and he may be in a different position right you know before you can start passing judge judgment on people you have to live in their shoes right and you know that's why people ask me now how do I feel about drug dealers and I got into gets them right and they do what they feel like they got to do or what they know they got to do so before we pass judgment we have to get all the facts and living that person's shoes to see if we would do the same thing and you're a perfect example of that absolutely now you you're away for you went away for 20 years you find this loophole how deep into your sentence had you had already figured out how to read how long I started reading immediately right away yeah yeah I took take classes there and put all I know I taught my men my celly taught me how to read he made me some cue cards with my ABCs on him and her cool I went from from those to reading my indictment to read the newspapers to to reading law books I mean you know for the first time when I found out is that I had never wanted to read before my life that was the real problem I never really wanted to read right I mean I didn't see any reason why Jack and Jill went up the hill and why I should know you MCA didn't happen right they wouldn't chasing no money I was chasing money right right right it was it wasn't interesting to you it wasn't interesting to me but then once you realize well there's a lot of information that I don't have access to I got a I got a man advocate reading I read over 300 books before on that prison really yeah Wow you've read more books than I have in my lifetime yeah so you're in prison you're you're you learn how to read at what point in time did you start devising a plan to try to like figure out a way to get out of there immediately I was trying to get out you know I knew that the guys that were going home was the guy that was going to a library learn how to become lawyers you know they knew how to fight the system and then they had like guys that all he did all day was sit down and study the law you know they would sit at the table while other people were playing cards and chess and dominoes they would be studying the law so I got I got in with those guys that's got to be kind of a crazy feeling man everybody's just hoping you can crack this fucking system that's got you locked up we it's tough whatever the head starts to hurt baby you get you got like migraine headaches and you're sitting in this concrete building I'm going to try to draw a picture for you you're sitting this concrete building it's 28 stories high nothing but concrete and steel the windows are about three inches wide open and about six feet long escape looks almost impossible but you know you think about that too like if I had a long rope I could scale the side of the building so it's like a desperation you know and you saying man II gotta be one loophole in these books because you know that if you can show them in the book where they made a mistake or where the book says that they should've did this when they did that then you know you got action so you're getting headaches just from thinking and reading too much yeah that's all you want to do you just want to stand on books you know I got a life sentence you know when you got a life sentence it's like this is forever you know this is all you're gonna see for the rest of your life you know so I didn't think that was fitting for me it's amazing that they convicted you for life on that three strikes law it seems like you should be able to go after them for abusing the law which should be criminal well you can't you can't go at the federal prosecutor he's immune that's amazing come from from prosecution because he's not working as an individual even if it's been proved that he's corrupt well maybe if you can prove he's corrupt but with not because he income from unjustly the year incompetent in your case you know if he does something to you you know you can charge you with a thousand keys even though you only had one you know and if you got a thousand keys you know that gives you a life sentence if you got one you know you get probation but if it's powder that's it that's the thing people don't know about not another good point not crap because crack was in the ghetto and powder was all these you know other people these people that have money were using the powder crack is way more illegal yeah wasn't coming hundred to one wow that's incredible that is is that racist very racism it has to be right and I think I mean and even though they just changed it 18:01 I think that was still why is it I wonder one and that's what I said because they already prove you know I sit down on the couch with the guy who invented the law really yeah it's gonna be in the documentary six six six document after you're out you sat down with us yeah I've been doing that since I've been out I've been doing a documentary since I've been out and one of things that I got mad about even with Obama and his administration is that they didn't make it one-on-one and then even after they made it 1801 they left it four guys have been in 20 years 25 years they didn't make it retroactively meaning that they don't get out they don't get no benefit from the from the 1801 this guy's right now they if they had the 1801 they walk out of prison today Wow so I'm saying if it's wrong today and you did it 20 years ago was wrong in right but they said oh well they're they lost there because you know Clinton signed a bill where you're 2255 you got one year after you're convicted to come up with newly discovered evidence and the law is crazy man like right now safety means if you go to prison unjustly and you do all your pills and everything one year you know one year to prove yourself innocent now after that one year if you don't find it and in a day after that one year you find this newly discovered evidence you can't even submit it to the court oh that's got to be maddening it's maddening they got guys in here that found newly discovered evidence that they can't even submit it for anybody to hear it so when you went to jail for this so when you're finally in prison it was this the first time you had ever been in prison other than the one time you got arrested and he stayed in there for a while no no that was my second time when I got the life sentence I've been in jail twice so you had two strikes you had one strike one strike on like how long did you go away for the first time five and a half years Wow so you're in the second time I was entrapped I didn't go into that part with you I was entrapped because I wasn't selling drugs I was building a youth center because what I did is I figured out what kids in the ghetto need to get them out of gangs and drugs I know what they need so what I did is I'm going to need I bought a theater they need some some some instructions they need somebody to come and walk them through it somebody they can go and talk to when they need to talk to him you know not talk to him once they already been corrupted and their heads are already in the game they don't want to hit you then you know I already got my mind I know what I'm doing I'm all man but before they get like that they need somebody a place that they can go in they could talk to Joe rogue you know a Rick Ross or Magic Johnson or Oprah Winfrey or some of these other people who could teach them how to make money other ways you know because in the ghetto you know the first business you see in a ghetto you know the first business is what the drug man he's going to be the first businessman that you see in South Central sentence is going to be the drug man and especially a black man as a business owner because we don't we don't nothing in South Central so you that's when you got you so you said you got set up this is the last time yeah yeah when I got the life sentence this guy called me I'm not selling drugs you weren't selling drugs are on my heart just I hadn't sold drugs in six years seven years what how did you stop I just quit did you quit after you got arrest the first time in the five years not quit a year and a half before I went to prison I was like man well I'm doing this I got I got eight nine hundred thousand dollars cash I got property all over the place all I got to do now is make this property and stuff work for me and you know I got enough money to hold me off for a while I'm do it so I walked away from the game so I'm confused on your timeline here because when you were 20 years old that's when you started and then when you were 28 you got arrested right but you did five years in jail right where's the five years I did the five years in 89 I went to prison how old were you that 28 like 28 28 and a half you go to jail for five years and then you get out for how got out I got out for six months for six months and then they give you the life sentence right whoa god damn so the life sentence is a total setup total setup tore out my total entrapment I was not selling drugs danilo called me in a method called me today I got a prison whoa he was like man I need to see you I was like man I'm kickin it with my mom you know my mom came and see me and and stuff like that so I'm like I'm kickin it with my mom um coat a hot hatch in a couple days so when I finally going holla at him he's telling me how man I got it to this price I got it at that price I was like what that's a good price I know this is recorded too so you know that didn't help you know they was like oh you were interested Wow so uh this went on for six months that he quoted me you know what I mean dropping the price driving a motherfucker and then a one day he caught me and I was riding with one of my little homies Chico Brown you know I said man I still just told me whooping chickens like me and I could sell all that then that's how I got started so I wind up making introduction to the two of them Chico handing the money and Cody's come from everywhere so you never even got to sell no I never sold it so this guy where is he now Danilo he's in Nicaragua just chillin he supposed to been a documentary - really yeah y'all better check that documentary out it's awesome the now this Danilo only can we know how to comp the planet in two rows whoa it's your proof that he planted the drugs I know he plans to drugs right what is he he went to jail no I don't think he's gone many plans a drug but he went to jail for it he went to jail for planting those drugs for corruption you know beating people planting drugs he was doing lying on police it was a habit so she was doing it well I mean he made money man yeah well that's where the rampart comes in I mean for people don't know most most police officers at this point time to leave that shift night hired cops to kill biggie smalls and that they also he probably also had Tupac killed and that he did it all under this under this rampart division this rampart division was working for him and there's a huge Rolling Stone article about it it's fascinating fascinating shit that the cops were so dirty that the cops were working with gang members they're working with murderers working with criminals and making money clearly profiting well you know comps many just like everybody else you know [Music] they lie cheat and all other things that the normal person go through in life so I'm gonna put nothin past him especially when you start putting all that money on the table you know I remember my first young guy who got arrested by him and they stole his money he was like 16 years old you know he called me he's like wait man the cops just raided my house I was like yeah you are he's like yeah I'm cool I was like what you have he's not gonna have like $40,000 I said what happened he said man he asked me who money was and I told me it wasn't mine they told me to go Wow so when he got out when I got with him you know we called the lawyer in total lawyer hey man it was $40 at that house but with no drugs so he called me a man with no money at that house wow that's super common right yeah yeah that happened all the time there's no one policing the police there's no one governing the government stuff you know that's the real issue they got the beginning they got the guns yeah well not only that they can change the laws I mean we see what the fuck is going on now with this country it was like every week they come up with some new even more restrictive even more or well in law that gets through that allows them to tap your phones with no wire with no warrants rather you know we're listening in on your your phone calls tap your fucking GPS systems they can follow everywhere you go and they can do all this shit without warrants now yeah I mean and they do it supposedly under the guise of terrorism but it's really under the guise of making it easier for them to prosecute you for whatever the fuck they want to because there's a goddamn business and locking people up in cages exactly exactly so that's what they into mm-hmm so you find your loophole and then you chase after it you're in jail right and then once it once you find this loop remember that day when I read it in the book and it was like me and just like popped out at me boom go to jail commit a crime and get released I shot to the phone to call my lawyer see man I found it Wow so what happens then what was discouraging what he said after he read and he didn't see it the same way I did yeah you're better lower than your fucking lawyer I'm Marburg that's why I should get an honorary degree she got something yeah so so I just told him to are put on the books you know then the judge went through her thing oh no mr. Ross not the way you said is and I was like Ann she must can't read if she can't read that she can't read so then the prosecutor went through his whole thing but then I went to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals you know they agree with me totally you know said it uh if they did it the way they were saying do it they would lock up everybody would be career criminals on their first arrest so yeah literally everybody would be in life here on your life Here I am wow so nice sort of Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals they agree with you they side with you you released immediately no I had nine more years to do Jesus Christ why nine more years that's just where it was you know that's how much time I had left okay so you had twenty dollars they cut me now no no I had a life but they light me down to twenty so the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals cut you down to twenty mm-hmm okay so at least you knew there was a light at the end of the tunnel that right right so then we I was happy with that you were happy with that yeah I was gonna need a penitentiary because I was up in Lompoc Penitentiary you know USP Lompoc hell what is that place like oh man that's a dungeon you know everybody in here I got 40 years of better you know they mad at your death you got twenty you know they got to get you out of there with twenty years you know some might happen to you really man yeah those consequences freedom New Year's is you're almost free yeah you got it man you gotta walk on eggshells around here if you have twenty years you got between two years you you better go away me a thug doing they were like mad at you or they be managed did mad at you if you only got 20 years yeah but you got 30 years they might be mad god damn that's hilarious yeah hilarious you can get hurt you can get hurt they're just because you got twenty years how did you stay out of danger well like I said when I got my time cut I only had to stay there like three months and I was out of there so it was it was easy for me and you know I'm a well-liked guide to something jail yeah yeah they like how dangerous was the prison that you were in initially the first prison before they moved out I mean I saw guys get hidden here with Iron Mike ringers fired what Mike ringers a mop wringer wring the mop out where's this great big old thing might weigh about 15 20 pounds yeah you know guys sitting in his chair and the guy walks up behind him and just smashes his skull with it I mean brutal brutal brutal brutal sight I seen a guy get beat with a baseball bat aluminum baseball bat and - his head was like mush you had to helicopter him out in the helicopter I think he had brain damage though he didn't you know was a vegetable I've seen guys get stabbed you know when I'm taking a shower you know you hear this loud noise like just keep bumping up against the wall boom boom boom really violently you know and you know this is somebody's body you know like why would somebody be hitting the wall this hard you know and uh so I wrapped my tile up and I look my head out the shower when I see this guy and this guy stabbed me and so to get off tonight he's just throwing this back and hitting everything up against the wall trying to get away from the knife so it's really violent I mean prison is really violent you know you have to be careful especially in the USPS you know the USP easy but loners and dangerous too but not as dangerous as USP cuz these guys don't have nothing what is the USP US Penitentiary a US Penitentiary what is the difference well safe instance the FCI you can't have more than 20 years and be at FCI if you have more than 20 FCI stands for a Federal Correctional Institution that's like a medium okay so if you have more than 20 years you're going to go to a USP now if you go to a FCI and you got 20 years but you keep getting into trouble fights and you know something maybe you stabbed somebody and then they're gonna send you to a US peak of the hill okay you go up here these guys can handle stabbings so that they'll boost you up then they got what they call a low and for the guys we got like five years six years and you go to a low so they kind of keep it separated like that by your violence by how much you get in trouble things like that so the USP is the most dangerous that's the the most absolutely have the murderers life sentences and then they had guys from all over the country say from you in Washington DC and you've been getting in trouble in Washington DC then they shipped you down to California to keep you out of trouble you know some of those guys from DC are really really violent and what they do is they take all the baddest guys from all over the country and they put them in US s peace so you may have a thing where guys are fighting over territory like the TV you know like the DC guys or the Philadelphia guys might say man we want to watch this program tonight the Philadelphia 76ers of plans so we want to watch Philadelphia 76er tonight because you're always watching the Lakers so that could cause a fight you know it's kind of like territorial you know the way it works did you get in any violent interaction really not absolutely not I stayed in law library really they don't come in a lot I bury and fight so how did you that's how you avoided everything most of the time the only time I really would put myself in a in harm's way is when when football season you know I play flag football with the guys I play basketball with them but I always had a mentality to defuse anything that ever happened I wouldn't fight you know if somebody filed me hard on the basketball court it was my fault because I put myself on the basketball court if I filed somebody hard on the basketball court it was my fault because I filed anymore so I would always apologize to guys when I fought him hard but that's just the type of person I am you know when I play basketball I don't mean to hurt anybody but sometimes I do you know I filed a lot but uh you know I got along well you know people respected me and I saw the most respect baby like did you have to align yourself with any groups in prison I didn't know I didn't even though I am adopted by most groups you know they adopt me most groups you know most of the groups in jail about me you know I mean hey everybody you know the Philadelphia guys that decrypts the Bloods the DC's I mean I'm cool I'm just cool without all of them you know the only one property is not is is a what's the disarray Neos and am brothers are probably the only two groups that but it's this or anything else Mexicans yeah and then the Aryan brothers officers kick your change yeah yeah other than that I got it on and even they got on you know they would speak to me you know hey Rick what's happening but you know we don't hang out but they don't hang out with blacks now the day you got out of jail man what the fuck was that like the day you get out of twenty years and knowing that you got out you know on my hair by the hair yeah I know it was luck cuz you know it was guys when I was in prison it was guys who had the same issue I had that didn't get out Wow it argued it almost the same way you know matter of fact we're trying to get the guy who was the first guy to get a life sentence for selling crack we're trying to get his interviewing his issue was was almost identical to mine it's a little different though but close and he's in for life he's in for life and he was only like 20 years old 19 years old and it was the same situation they used a three-strike rule there's a three-strike rule but he had he didn't have three convictions his conviction is a little different right he did have convictions his was he went to jail when he was 18 years old he got out and the same day he got out he went right back on the block and start selling dope again and he got arrested that day so he wasn't convicted it wasn't convicted of the first one when he caught the second one but they said it don't matter if he was convicted you had been in jail so you should have learned your lesson and you went back out and you did it again there's got to be a lot of that it was mad at me when I won really yeah it's supposed me my man - he was mad man how you win I had to say miss you I said no you was a little different see I'd never got out on mine see on mine they took me from from from from LA they took me to Texas and took me to Ohio it took me the st. Louis all before I ever got released I never got released now when you got out what's the first shit you did you already know man been a long time oh my god me saw me just old girlfriends yeah no no new club new girl yeah new girl did you know this girl make like the girls like contact do you like while you're in prison yeah yeah I got a lot of that is because you were famous I was famous American gangster magazines and they knew you were coming out too as is magazine yeah they knew I was coming home they started to publicize that I had got a date
