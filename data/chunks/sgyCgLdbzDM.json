the girag and experience it's going to take a lot of time to understand it primarily because people don't really understand money as it is today they don't understand how banks work they don't understand how the Federal Reserve creates money they don't understand death based system for money I've read about it I understand it well I've read anything is i watch documentaries what i understand it most of the people when they first face bitcoin they start asking questions about money and it it quickly becomes apparent to all of us when we do this that we don't know much about money than we learn about money we start reading about money but you know it's it's very much part of the culture to the point where i'll talk to people about bitcoin and they'll say well it's not backed by gold so how can i have value the dollar has been backed by gold for like 60 years and and you talk to the average person in the street and they still think there's some gold in a vault and that stuff does it doesn't exist that happened all the goal in the vault watches well well that's a whole other question i mean the real issue is this heath we haven't been on a gold standard for decades and all of the currencies in the world are created based on the productive capacity of the country and the legal system and because they have value because you pay your taxes with them and then they just float freely in exchange rate so they vary against each other and the because the dollar is used to buy oil it's the world reserve currency and all the other currencies are measured against it but there is no gold and and that's fine that doesn't mean it doesn't have value it absolutely has bet that fucks up a lot of old action movies man yeah it really does those movies where you would break into the vault you know a lone ranger the bars of gold it would always be brick shaped well the thing is gold isn't that sufficient for building a currency on because the the rates at which you can produce gold is is fakes then it's hoarded and you know you have certain problems now the nice thing about bitcoin is that it takes it takes the same concept of scarcity of having something that is a limited resource but it does it by algorithm so you essentially have math that says that every 10 minutes 25 new bitcoin is created by the network as a whole with all of the computing capacity of the network and that's fixed and every four years we create half as much every 10 minutes so in four years it goes down to 12 and a half bitcoin every 10 minutes and then it goes down to six and a quarter and it keeps going down until you meant the last bitcoin and then you're done 21 million coins it's done and the idea is that you provide a sound basis for money something that is rare cannot be forged is easily transportable and that is the form of currency so 21 million bitcoins and then it's over well there's are you can divide a Bitcoin a hundred million pieces so it goes down to a digits and that means you the lowest unit is called a Satoshi and there's a hundred million Satoshi's in a Bitcoin so 21 million times 100 million 21 quadrillion coins many coins Jesus Christ why is it so complicated why is it like a hundred million um well I think part of the reason is that it's easier to write a number without the decimal points and just to write a smaller unit with lots of zeros after it it's easier in computer terms to handle numbers that way but but most importantly it doesn't matter because what you see on your screen at today might be a Bitcoin actually on my wallets I use Millie bitcoins thousands of a Bitcoin because it corresponds more to my daily purchases you know maybe a few years from now you're going to be using a millionth of a Bitcoin to look at your balance it doesn't matter what you call a unit the point is what value does it have because someone else is willing to give you that amount of money you know I was Mormon do we have this conversation I'm not sure he was raised mormon really yeah my folks are still my dad still Mormon his whole side of family yeah where are you from Utah no I'm from Texas Wow Mormon Texas there's there's all I mean they're fucking everywhere there ever were but yeah born and raised and electrician is 14 Wow when you were 14 what was it that got you did I just didn't like I was quick it's it's so funny too because I hadn't found science yet it's not like I knew you know I didn't have like all these answers available to me I just probably around like 12 maybe 11 like when you start questioning things I really started questioning things and a lot of things weren't making sense for me and you know just a lot of the answers that they give you in the church like weren't sitting well with me and so I was studying and I was trying to figure out like you know I've been taught this my whole life but it to make sense it doesn't sit well with reality and I remember going my father and saying you know I have all these questions and very confused I'm not sure I believe and the answer they always give you is just to like really pray about you know it's like they give you all of these answers that aren't helping at all they don't they don't really improve your confusion at all and so ultimately I finally just came to them and said like I'm pretty sure at this point that I really don't believe in God and and attending which is a huge part of your life when you're 14 I mean when you're in high school and you're Mormon you go to church for three hours every Sunday you go to youth group every Wednesday night you have all sorts of family things like family home evening every Monday night and then you go to seminary which is either Bible book of mormon and then like pearl of great price and Doctrine and Covenants study every morning before school I would go at 6am for like an hour before school and it's I mean it's really intense it takes up a huge part of your life and when you don't believe it's kind of I mean you have to come out you have to come out like it's it's so painful like you're stuck in this skin that's not you and I mean obviously I don't know what it's like for somebody who is gay who's like you know scared to come out in their community but I would assume that there's like at least a faint similarity to that feeling of like I can't live like this because I'm lying to myself every day so I finally came out to my father and it was like not good it was a difficult situation was hard for the family and I didn't end up like I ended up actually not having a relationship with him for many years it's better now but at the time it was like a really intense thing like as a 14 year old kid to be like oh I need to make this like really intense life decision so your dad didn't wanna interact with you because or you didn't want to interact with him because of the pressure it was like so so my parents were divorced so I went to my dad's house every other weekend and then like I think like a month in the summer something like that but we also went to his house on Sundays to go to church together cuz my mom wasn't attending after they got divorced and so he basically told me I remember the quote to this day I have a moral obligation to God to force you to go to church until you're 18 years old as long as you're living under my roof and I was like I'm not gonna go anymore and he was like well then I guess you're not gonna live under my roof anymore oh yeah so it was a really tough decision it was kind of like me or me or your atheism and at the time I I just felt like I can't not make this decision so we didn't speak for a long time and I like didn't go to his house for a really long time we didn't have a relationship but it improved
