hello freak bitches what do you do with your time these days like what's a typical day for Hicks and Gracie right now I back to teach in close place because I wanted to to have him Morris Dees stress with the how the Academy goes so I pick two times a week to teach they're giving self-defense classes at this point before that I was doing seminars once a month at the most once twice every couple of months to to make my living and also because I feel like the best things in life money cannot buy and I feel like the quality of my my meals the way I eat the way my relationship my sleep those are very very valuable assets you know plus the time I have to do things I love to do that's kind of when this is fuel like when I feel like I'm everything so I feel like I'm happy enough to be my best at service because I always try to be at service helping somebody with jiu-jitsu with knowledge with nutrition with breathing you know it's not about the prices about the service you know and then I put my head in the end up and said yeah I'm a I'm a have a nice day I make a good speech with Joe Hogan I'd have a garage talk with and Bravo was great day so somehow in a purpose for the Federation so I always try to be positive but I have no schedule fixed like I have to wake up vote no because at this point I create a lifestyle which make me feel good to engage in different elements like this Federation now and having classes on crowns and be here to be full of energy you know because sometimes you don't notice but based on your your your commitments your obligation you becoming more like a Robert and you lose the perspective of what you need to be at your best and if you lose that perspective even though you still do in your routine sometimes you just - you're just 80 70 60 % of what you should be so you're not going to be the best husband you're not going to be the best father the best employer the best employee you just you know it's just so at this point I feel like I have to be at my best physically do my if I feel like I have to stretch I going to stretch breathe joke have fun this and party whatever you know and then when I feel like man I'm so happy I could not eat so and then I can go and do my service you know and no because the window of life is smaller and now for me it becomes I don't have too much time so I don't waste time to do what people expect from me I try to do things I really relevant to my soul like this Federation now I when I dream I don't dream small I dream like I make like a very space for a hue day the biggest dream I can dream and I see that moment you know that level of need for the community and the level of position I have to be the reference for that shift in the direction of our culture in our knowledge I feel like I could not be more motivated more happy to engage in this so and that's always life is about is just do your best and and and be excited to be motivated to to to the next day there's such a refreshing attitude your your attitude your philosophy on life because I think it's very easy and I've been I've trapped myself in it sometimes where you concentrate too much I'm making money concentrate too much on being ambitious and you forget the quality of life yes your focus is almost entirely on your quality of life yes you know because like I said man how much cost your motivation how much cost your friends how much cost your health how much cost your intelligence those things is priceless I mean if you take those of your life you take a motivation of your life can be Bugis can be the biggest so if you if you ask me if I want to have do gates life I don't know I don't know him so it's not a base on his bank account is based on how happy is how or here's how you know how how how motivated I used to wake up and do his thing you don't look too horny I don't think so so that's is that's a very essential thing which sometimes sleep to people's fingers and and the priorities in the daily you know in the payments and so I put you in a role where I feel like if you tell me in the past what's the courage what's the opposite of courage I want to say cowardness because either you tough enough to to challenge and to fight or to or in then you coward and you chicken out so that's in the past was like the opposite of of courage it's very hard to measure this in those days and I believe the opposite of courage today is conformity you know as people get conformed oh I don't like my wife the way I used to like but I'm never going to divorce because I'm afraid to lose my house or the situation is so established so I'm going to keep so I don't like this job but I'm going to keep here because better than his so in in other hands if you if you get caught on that kind of compromise to to maintain because you you afraid to risk let's keep you like one step behind from you follow your heart follow the ambition you 18 years old you don't think twice like I say yeah let's go to Australia you think okay let's go poom but when you feel to say Australia what I'm going to do there maybe I'm gonna so it's different you know me and that's kinda hater oh my god yeah so that's kind of pretty much where keep you from be at your best because if you willing to sacrifice if you willing to to broke new new challenges if you willing to you in a stage of liveness and an excitement and unpredictability who make you feel like you in heaven you know every time I was engaging in a compromise or a fight what's something I thank you like I have my routines prior fight one of them is at the day of my fight I wake up and I think you got to be alive and I acknowledge how perfect will be that day if I die today say fuck my was a baby a perfect day if I die because I have you know I accomplished my think I'm in my mission I represented my family so I don't go that you tap I go that you die like I have to kill me it's not I'm never going to tap so but that's not a sport like orientation this is a philosophical owner representation you know it's not something I teach my snow it should not that no it's not like that it's about how I feel how I feed my kids how I follow my tradition so in engagement I'm not going to be the one who gonna quit did I have to kill me my brother he can throw the towel but for me is unacceptable you know I did give up from my life so based on that kind of spirit or guidance my life is very intense my life is very I mean directed to accomplish give up is not an option you know I can I can direct my my my focus I can give up from something to go somewhere else but I never will give up from something because I feel like I cannot reach there I may say okay that's not for me I go somewhere else but if I still focus I will take those Falls I will take those obstacles as a motivation to just set up a new strategy to try again you know I'm very competitive in a sense I like the perfection of things so this is like a situation where put you in a situation where you have no either you go forward or you don't but don't stay in the middle don't try just waiting for people who are waiting for more those are kind of things gonna stack you back in life and and just make you feel like passing through life as you enough you haven't you know you in relevant you know this is very quick
