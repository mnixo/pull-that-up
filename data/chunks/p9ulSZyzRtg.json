Ari Shaffir speed rapping in five four three two one go what if I send it away I got money when I kinda like buckets I cook everything but simple to put the shelf yeah it's we were talking about how impressive Mac Lethal is but then our egos yeah but you got to read the words otherwise you have no idea yes making everything so in that sense and he's gone too far he's like triple F tits you can't sing along with that no triple F do you like this crush beer cans with their fake boobs it's like the most unsexy thing ever it's like this hyper sexuality gets morphed into this weird distortion it's sexual version for your dad cut you're smoking if you like so much do you match of course they're Foster's fucking Bogota Z look at those fucking hair get Steve Harvey Show they just went with Foster's he's Derek cuz she's gotta be Australia that's why they were Foster's that kind of behavior maybe they just wanted a big can be can't smash big cans a giant cans yeah they are maybe Budweiser didn't want any part of it so they couldn't get a Bud tall boy by the way you know nobody Australia drinks fosters no they don't most bars really yeah it's not even like Bud Light where nobody really drinks it but my sneaky was just marketing everything's marketing what is a beer like our beer is perhaps Blue Ribbon is kind of fun uh-huh cuz it's so white trash yeah pull out a can of paps like I'll drink a can of paps at the store sometimes door yeah at the supermarket no carbage white rice flip-flops are boxer shorts fuck it wife beater drink it up gigantic pap smear abnormal Australian life though a quarter of the men would do that kind of shit look while I'm shopping for other snacks yeah I love it over there oh yeah they're great people there if you were gonna ask their beer like that his VB VB yeah that's sir there was another country that I would live in besides America or besides the United States it would be Canada and if there's another country I live in besides Canada it would be Australia for sure and Canada because it's related to cold not Vancouver Vancouver is too cold as well he could handle it son I could handle it you're a traveling man yeah I skipped the fucking winter so Evelyn oh your travel yeah yeah yeah yeah you're right if you just out there in the rainy season which is like nine months I was doing the math on New York days the other day of like saying how many actual months of nice it is and it's really a six and six yeah not even nine if three no it's not six and six yeah fuck yeah it's there's there's some rugged days in those nice months to you know those like those six yeah like if you go like it's really probably nine but there's three months they're super sketchy super sketchy it snow in April we got snow in April this year yeah yeah that's annoying I was in Australia no they were like it's snowing in New York like that's a different song by the way Stone April snow sometimes it snows in April is that real cocoa is more sensitive one snow oh it's no it's about sadness oh listen to it when I was delivering newspapers it was great you know mark Normand had a theory is proven wrong I guess that uh Prince when he died he died of the lasts of the eighties AIDS yeah he said he's been fighting it hard because of the money he died from that stuff kills everybody they're testing drugs now at music festivals they should you're that and they did it in Australia when I was there they do it in UK in some places where you just come in they chip off the smallest amount and they text you if it's okay your stuff is safe or not and then it's way safer to do it than just fucking passing around dammit they need deregulation they just do they just need deregulation you're not saving anybody by making drugs illegal you're just making it difficult to get good drugs that's all you're doing you're not stopping people from doing drugs and in fact when they legalize things often genius goes down because it doesn't become so attractive anymore but people are stupid all right we wired fucked up and tell us we can't do something that's the thing we want to do that's just how it is I will say to be fair I will say legalization of drugs would make more people do it I would have to think it would psychologically they say no when they've done nobody there's nobody there's some people that wouldn't normally do it but like well there's a store right there all right I'll get some I don't know about that man I think it normalizes after a while I think it starts off like that in the beginning but I think what that is is the residual effect of making it prohibited the residual effect but then once it becomes legal like alcohol if you're 21 you don't walk by CVS and go back you just go buy it when I just go get some whiskey dude I mean but people way more people drink than do drugs right but they don't do it because it's like a new thing no no it's so easy to get that it's just there I'm saying you got to think some people that would never would have done I have conservative friends from high school that never would do it but if it was on the same level as alcohol in 20 years they'd be like you know I can ask my friends to do it I don't know if it's worse I really world not worse I won't say it's worse I'm just saying there's some people who would but I think overall you end up getting a lot less people like total numbers to do it well I think things would normalize I really do I think we have a real there's a responsibility that I think society has to this fucked up prohibition that we've know is ridiculous we have too much information now we know too much about people to make things prohibited when you make other things that are just as dangerous legal right so it's all fucking forest yeah it doesn't make any sense when alcohol is legal and marijuana isn't or alcohols legal mushrooms aren't you're talking nonsense people drink themselves to death every day their liver affects every day not just liver effects alcohol poisoning thousands of people every year die from alcohol poisoning so you can't do mushrooms that much you can't die from it you can but it'll just stop working on you won't do anything exactly keep doubling the dosage yeah by the end of the week you'll be doing like a pound of mushrooms and that's fine exactly I would do that your shits will be crazy well Dennis McKenna who I had on last week his brother Terence had that theory about human evolution and it's a very compelling theory and the mushrooms make humans they might have caused it that might have been one of several factors there's several factors one of them was climate change like the monkeys had to move down from the trees because there was no food left and the grasslands had taken over where the rainforests had been that's because the climate change but that was the same period where all these undulates lift so all these cow like creatures shit all over the place the mushroom these monkeys that were experimental the human monkey started eating these things and then started developing language skills more sophisticated hunting better visual because the visual perception especially in low doses it actually increases acuity been proven in scientific double-blind placebo-controlled studies yeah yeah it increases your increases your ability to recognize when things are shifting like say if you have two lines and one of them slightly shifts like maybe 1/2 of 1% angle the people that were on mushrooms could see it you ever see a clock and be able to see the minute hand move like get zoned in where you can like slow to soar to see it move I've done a couple times but it's when I was little whoa but yeah that's what that kind of it's really yeah well you can like my pigeon sucks now dude when I look at a clock I look at like vague numbers like that that clock right now I go look at that that little one right there yeah I look at those are vague numbers you can't see those I can see them I know that's 12 that's look at this BAM now I could see all the dots I could see everything get the surgery no it's not that it's it's no it's too close it's it's nearsightedness it's what happens when you get older it's just macular degeneration this is too near for you no no things that are near don't look as good that's that's like a good medium distance but farther things look exactly as I say it's a slow degeneration of your eyesight due to age my friend who's not remember my friend Steve Graham mm-hmm he's an ophthalmologist he's like there's not a goddamn thing you can do about it dr. Steve with it with the earth yeah yeah I didn't know the US Ski Team he told me some great advice I will share with everyone we were talking about on my podcast or talk with him about um the hours they put in and I was like if you're putting in 10 hours you can't be as good at 4:30 as you are because oh there's you should never make a doctor appointment in the afternoon they're tired they're not giving you their best work yeah he's like always make a morning a point when they actually like just had their coffee like all right let's start dude I had this guy dr. Matthew Walker on couple weeks ago there's a sleep specialist he was talking about how important sleep is and one thing in common with a lot of people that suffer from Alzheimer's is they were getting like three four hours sleep at night they were those get-up-and-go type people know their brains wind up shorting out who's saying that really sleep is unbelievably important it's one of those podcasts you listen to it and it literally would change your behavior patterns I don't know if we're changing behavior for sleep so fucking much shit when I just stay in bed for like five hours so do I wake up almost with the point you live in the life Ari Shaffir in a lot of ways if it's cold out I've told everybody man at all my friends that you know quote unquote made it it became successful you went the full whole-hog you never got caught in any of the trappings you got snip you've said fucking I want to live in New York City bucket I want to disappear in Asia for three months they tell you to do something with your TV show and you're like fuck you it's over I mean you're really doing what everybody wants to do I have one fucking moment ever like that really is when I had a book deal and I gave them the money back and like they were trying to fuck with it too much I was like this is annoying doesn't everybody that felt great once yeah I feel more free that anyone around look around on this matrix level of like why don't you guys have more freedom for yourselves yeah you've got that freedom out of all my friends we're talking about with Bertrand as I see it they were like we were talking my work beat envy of each other's lives you know their family life or smite whatever life and they were like person what do you think I envy about you are in my car I'm sorry it's my freedom and he was like I have just much freedom as you and I was like I was like what are you talking about fuck are you talking man that doesn't make any sense yeah he was like what do you mean red as he had to explain it to me goes Bert Ari could just from here just go away and not call anybody yeah just go from here whatever he's got just go away yeah you can't do that if you didn't tell me you were going and you vanished for a few months I would call the police you would yeah cuz I would worry about you but once you tell me like I'm gonna go to Asia my car I dude I'll uh I guess I'll talk to you when you get back people got so worried though like what happens if you get a rest or like I'm gonna do the time bro I don't know maybe but what if you just vanished yeah you kind of have a little bit of responsibility for people that care about you yeah you don't want to hurt their feelings and fuck just let the word out yeah tell them hey I'm going yeah then they have to deal with they might miss you but they just have to deal with it they not have like freaked out like what happen are ya I told my parents wasn't it disappear on though that's good yeah you got to tell your parents but certain people fuck it let them figure it out yeah my manager got so mad she would say you can't not tell me where you're going and not be able to reach you're like oh I definitely can I'm doing that cuz that's not I was like if it makes you feel better I'm not telling my mom how to reach me that doesn't make me feel better there's something to what you did though I think that's you I felt you felt like a little different to me when came back really yeah yeah like you just you know you'd had so many experiences I think everything fades away responsibility was I'm reading this book the talent code you ever heard of it it's a really interesting book where they analyze performers and different different venues like different things that they do different sports different are similar yeah injections into that who Greg Jackson yeah look I think for anybody and it makes you really realize first of all how many sets you should be doing you should be doing a ton of long sets as many long the most time on stage you have the better it's very critical like the long like long sets because an hour like you're gonna perform if you're headlining right the most you can do those two better because you really there that's a different thing when you do a weekend don't you feel like if you do Thursday Friday Saturday at a comedy club Saturday night late show you're fucking come right I'm ready to fire and and and if I do like the third straight week of five show weekends you know it's like by the end it's like oh you guys are getting a wonderful show right no do you just get smooth yeah I do one of the smoothest I ever got was I did that Maxim tour with Charlie Murphy and heparin and dude we did 22 dates in a month or weird about it oh you just go onstage you're like in the Zen state you just you doing so much stand-up that's how I come back from Edinboro yeah yeah you just 25 straight days per hour a night and then you're like you're just have to tweak it a little when you get home but like it's just like you're there you're just doing it over and over again all the way I think in the beginning of stand-up when you're starting I think lots of sets are good because then you learn how to win over a crowd yeah a bunch of time so different three new crowds is better than one 45 minutes sense really agreeing but then yeah once you're doing it longer it's like look at it like form your hour well this is what I was getting to that talent code book it is on development of skills just talking about how many amazing Brazilian soccer players came out of this one area and they were trying to figure it out and they realized oh it was they have this other game that they play with a smaller heavier ball and it's harder so they do that game and it's like in closed conduit in like a room like a small room like this room they'll play the soccer game and they get amazing footwork and movement because that because they're in such close quarters they're very fast yeah and so they take those skills and apply them to soccer football whatever they call it and it's fucking amazing how much they excel yeah this is what I'm talking to some of those roasts battle guys there's always roast battle guys and you know they're not like as as as develops on stage as I are for those roast battles yeah some of them like Josh people like that they kill those roast battles so then it's like what do you do about song - Eli sayers who's like unified champ and uh we figured out like you just take those those ro style jokes and apply them to the guy next to you in traffic or whatever yeah like you're pretty there's just roasting any topic you know that comes up yeah you just gotta leave that that should eventually ya know I think there's but that's the cross-training yeah yeah for sure I think there's things like that with everything and I think with you what I was recognized I was like oh he's just sort of like data crunched all these cultures over for months like you came back with like you you had like less patience for stupidity and and more like a more expanded it's hard to gauge someone's understanding of the world but the way you talked about things it's like you had a more expand view of things you like well I just you know this is just America you know like you respect that this is the world you crazy this is just America we spend all so much time in this bubble but when you were out there for months you came back it was almost like you were like oh okay and I think as a human is this and I think this is one of the things that happens bad two comedians when they become successful which is one of the reasons why they drop off they get really famous well I really shouldn't miss because they don't take any new experiences in because they don't take any risks because too many people like them when they go on stage you know that plate of your own crowd is a plate it's terrible but also play to your own crowd is your fault here's why you should know if your stuff is good and you should be working on it you should be listening to your recordings you should listen to them and go is this something that I would want to pay to see right and it's not let me fix it because like Oh like I'm in this stage right now or the right and new acts stage we're maxed terrible right now yeah I still have the old material that I'll have to abandon when October comes around the special airs all back on but until then I'm just developing shit and the new stuff is like I've got six new minutes there worth hearing and there are a lot of stuff fucking super clunky but if you don't do it if you don't scare yourself and if you don't experience new things you don't have you you have to know whether your stuffs any good okay and if you if you're not looking at it not paying attention it happens to a lot of famous comedians there are specials as they get older gets softer and softer and and and there's just Kinnison was always my favorite example because he's one of my all-time if not he's like prior and Kinison till you're like that's my Mount Rushmore you know in Lenny Bruce just for creating the whole thing don't have an idea I want to talk to you about like I forgot but when you watch early Kinnison he was a fucking monster yeah he was the bat was the best and it was such a short time but with him wasn't like sustained success weight drop it was like all he might crazy he went crazy he's hanging out with Bon Jovi and doing blow and banging strippers and being that guy he's in that rock star comedian guy and he didn't write anymore you could tell he was getting by on songs and dances you know he was just chuckles a picture of himself exactly the Todd oh yeah yeah so he went crazy right you know that Todd got me into the store really he's the reason I got into the store Wow he told me how to do it too and he told me you're gonna do that for your friends sit next to Mitzi when your friends onstage you laugh hard and admits you go along with you oh did he did that he sat right next to it Wow he told Mitzi goes Mitzi this kids fucking hilarious she goes wrong I'll watch I'm she's sort of believed and I got lucky I had a great set and then but the Todd was probably the loudest voice in the room he was in the back laughing his ass off Wow so I do that for anybody remember you did it from a choir and for whatever else anybody yeah you if you're if you're doing a viewer performer from it see I had to sit next to Mitzi I would used to sit next to her where my friends would show guys just so these fucking cock blocks wouldn't come in and try to talk about that's true too what are you doing in the middle of sets someone performing for their future between 52 minutes of their just leave her alone so you have the block you get three minutes in front of the queen of comedy yeah and these fucking cock blockers so so so oh that's hot okay here's what its gonna say about that terms just like Kinison being a caricature of himself yeah so he went crazy but they would before he went crazy there was a thing he used to do where he would go to the bartenders and take like glasses off and then just like eyes staring them down and just chuck it in the garbage just to like you know and then when he went crazy I mean literally crazy yeah he's sort of half remember doing that but different parts so you just take them and kind of like throw them in the garbage but not kind of even know why he was doing it he was just like a hollowed-out version up that's how Kinnison was yelling right again oh man have rage not just yelling yeah it was it didn't make any sense more there was no point it was just he was just trying to perform and ride the wave but in the beginning he was angry so good who's so angry they asked him how come you don't make fun of men as much as make fun of women he goes because a man is never born and made me drive my car into a tree everybody used to play that song I'll be fine under a gas tracking toaster all blood yeah fine it was good well you believed it he was a short fat ugly guy who was just screaming at the world for all of his pain you knew he was in pain and then he wasn't in pain anymore it wasn't fun then he wasn't in pain anymore that he was like he was just this superstar and it just didn't work as a superstar it's weird yeah so you're saying a lot of these guys don't enter into new experiences you have to have new challenges new experiences you have to be excited yes I thought new thoughts and I think that much like these Brazilian soccer players from what does the name Daniel Coyle is whoo what's the the author's name Daniel Coyle when he talked about these Brazilian soccer players playing this tight room the skills they developed in this really tight environment helped them in the big game I think life is like what the training ground for stand-up is and if your life is the same boring shit calling your agent know what do we got for me you got a script for me drawing from you don't have any where's your real world yeah we really won't talk about that Hollywood shit it's boring people don't relate to us some people get Kathy Griffin that's all she talks about and yeah it's like yeah I mean this but it's okay for her I mean that's her thing she likes to do it like her like it's no big deal but not for me it's not for me and not for you I want to relate to up someone coming to see my show but you want to relate to yourself to write half things to be like oh let me share this with you yes yeah you want to do stand-up that you would pay for yeah right right right it's just hard be conscious of the audience aw yeah man because you know there's you have to figure out why you're doing what you're doing to like am i doing what I'm doing just to get a laugh or am i doing what I'm doing because I would actually like it yeah just because I know it's working doesn't mean it's good yeah and with that with travel and overt whatever it's like half it was like let me get some new experience to draw from the other half is let me just challenge myself in moments yeah so I can practice overcoming things yeah yeah yeah it's a crazy business man crazy business and it unless you're on top of your own thoughts you got to be up on yourself it's like it's like college stuff from high school where they're like look they don't care in college they're gonna let you fail they're not gonna say where's that report yeah you know this is even more intense for some really high-pressure corporation don't even understanding it if least in ecology but I got a Decker to this homework book okay I get that if you're like I can't I gotta go over my set like what do later what do you mean what why and nobody gets what up yesterday they don't to go up again well not only that who would you talk to to try to explain it there's maybe a thousand of us on earth artists know yeah yeah they don't they're real if you can explain that so my thing is what I'd yeah but if you talk about like how many headliners are there on earth is there a thousand every not we're not talking cruise ships no no we're talking about someone who can get a special right so and who Comedy Central would watch or Netflix would walk was a big category of getting a special yeah yep probably not a thousand so that's not a lot of people yeah it's a shit small amount of people for an awesome job so you got to figure out well why why is this a small amount of people cuz it's a bloody fucking catastrophe leading up to success there's no chance of money early on not even a chance and you going I'm gonna make it okay if you were on a fast track it's gonna be seven years it's yeah if you're like it ain't around the corner dude and you're subject to bombing and like jump off a bridge bombing at any one of those years oh yeah jump off a bridge but the cold I'm trying to explain to some what the cold sweats were and how it's like they almost like out of it you feel the sweat but it's but you're shivering at the same time you know was it worse for me laying in bed at night after the show going over it wrenching beyond limits beyond embarrassment just ruthless destruction of your self-esteem just oh fuck you know there's a lot of people that just won't go back after that why would you why would you that's what one theory mm-hmm what's before theory hypothesis because I have proven it of why there's fewer women and stand up because my friend who's a researchers like women's development Rachel Simmons books on it she said that women just don't know if it's I forget what sociologically or physically probably sociologically are less able to accept rejection early on it's just that doesn't go with it who they are um and so they just like don't do those things so you have to push them if you have daughters have to push them to like try and fail and try and fail failure makes you succeed but early on is Theta it's only failure yeah so if your gender is less into that let's taking that like outside rejection or something like I don't want to do this that's not we just want to do it sexist is fuckin after denounce you now publicly that's fair I have to go on Twitter tell everybody you're supporting gender stereotypes a men have forced women to not be able to accept rejection put them in this category where they can't accept rejection perfect which proves that women and women are equal what so when they now when they've been socialized by a patriarchy to not accept that then they go into an environment where it's only failure and they go I don't want to do this I think if I had a guess I think stand-up is at least 20 to 25 percent harder for women this is why okay I think there's subjects that especially when you're starting out men don't want to hear from you in the audience okay men don't want to hear about politics you have a bigger hurdle when it comes to points of view politics or advice anything where a woman is like say like a guy can get on stage and say listen guys you want to fucking get your life in order you got to stop blah blah but and then the joke set up and then go on but a woman would have a hard time giving advice okay accepted by meatheads right if I say this might be true because I when I see young comics let's not make it gender cuz young comics talking about politics what's got to change a part of me go like 26 shows apartment goes shut the fuck up I don't know what the fuck you're talking about so anyone 26 would have to deal with yeah and I think women have some that shit to you and then they have that deep into their 30s and 40s cuz men don't want to hear from chicks about politics oh let me guess you fucking wish Hillary won Jesus starts a shocker you know there's like this gender like biases that a lot of men have about a woman getting on stage talking controlling all the attention they don't like it you know a lot of men have the I'm not saying it's right or wrong but I'm just being honest about instincts there's an instinct to not like it yeah there's another reason to its that Taylor stare which I like is that women on stage early on oh there's why it's harder for men it's just the first six months or so we martyr for men just the first six months women are used to people looking at them and for men it's this weird new thing where it's like why you looking at me strange showing the first like right away and open mics like early on women are way more comfortable on stage than men hmm for the most part and then that it evens out but those first few months it's this thing of like um this is not a comfortable thing women it's a negative that had to deal with that their whole lives but like people are staring at them all the time hmm I think we struggle with this idea of like like saying that I think it's harder for women I think it's harder for men because it's a generalization yeah it's harder for that some men it's waiting for what see that's that's when they black and white it that's when you fucking ruin all the arguments uh-huh you know it's just like 10% harder 15% honor I think one of the reasons it is harder career-wise for I mean almost all women is because success too early can hurt you in the long run if you start thinking I'm good it's something you're terrible you don't work as hard this is human nature thing wife more for women than for men because we're in such a category of needing women performers that we go earlier and earlier in development in order to plug them up huh because I need to put a woman on stick on TV you know and there's you know this developed women Silverman is like I doing that I don't want to Segura's yeah sure okay so you have to get some women you have to have show me show somebody at home your own version of yourself right and if there's women viewers you got to put a woman on huh you know if you have a lot of comics but if I'm getting this as a single individual performer if I'm getting something five years in and I start going yeah I'm pretty fucking good I don't have to work this hard you know when I start getting more and more things I work less and less hard it's another reason why the fucking celebrity comics aren't as good as non celebrity comics but if you start getting stuff you start I don't need to work that hard to get it if you have to study for an hour to get an A you know I mean then why would you study for seven hours right an hour gets you there yeah so if you start getting these successes career well I think monetarily you stop working as hard on the artistic part of it you can make n stuff yeah yeah yeah yeah I think you're a hundred percent right yeah so that's the drop off yeah sort of doesn't just service as he has an individual to get stuff but at the same time you want to so I mean as a former Booker as a Booker all you got to do is look harder to get qualified women go to Indianapolis fine miss Pat mm-hmm I mean they're out there yeah but to prop somebody up who doesn't quite deserve it only hurts them in the long run yeah there's the the problem also is that you want to find a certain number like comedy should be almost totally egalitarian yeah it should be just performance-based yeah I mean I think if a club has a developmental project like Wendy does the Comedy Works in Denver then it might not be a bad idea to have all-girl classes I bet that would give you a bump for anybody who feels uncomfortable and wants to learn how to do stand-up with all that's one of the reasons it's harder for chicks early on is because there's creeps and open mics oh yeah they're not weeded out like there are clubs the clubs where they get out of here we don't hear right I'd open mics it's any fucking freak that's there and man that is not a fun experience to deal with so I think that drives around the most right away early on fuck yeah yeah shitty nobody's good and then also I got this fucking smelly guy fucking leering over me yeah fuck this 100% yeah 100% I mean it's nightclub creepiness Plus crazy people yeah so you have regular night nightclub creepiness and then you have open mics there's always a certain percentage of people that are insane it's literally it's insane yeah yeah yeah and they get to go up well I say Mike it's the same life as you oh I forgot about that yeah who knows what kind of shit you getting off that mic on an open mic night and this store especially back in the day they didn't fix nothing with that mic I'm not clean that that thing was growing all kinds of shit on at least it didn't have a foam top like this does to hold I had to change his foam one cuz it smelled like my breath I was like getting up in there was like smell a person on this we had a mic that smelled so bad at cops this weekend and I've mentioned it to Simone and it was like both like it was taking us out of it like 30 minutes in usually get used to her mic he said he was holding the mic different regular metal when holding it different so we can get it away from his nose who was there before you I don't know I think was all of us just like oh yeah these foam things are disgusting you know some people have those circles I have those circles for a while those spit shields but it seems so pretend all those thing weird they seem pretentious yeah yeah those seem weird hop pop filter pop filters yeah they seemed super pretentious they seemed like what are you doing stupid with that fucking hula hoop in front of your face so I had a couple ideas on acid at this music festival mmm well I want to run by you and then one um it was fun time by the way what music festival Firefly in Delaware nice the bus from New York and then you just go there camp and a fucking good time and I'm fucking oh yeah just like laying down on my back trying to keep my eyes open so I can my friends went off to the bathroom like you'll be here like I'll be right here I'm not coming anywhere right now and so keep my eyes look at you like what's wrong with you you know let's just see a few stars and you'd be out of it eyes open which is out of it and then everyone's I fucking love music festivals man you come out of it and there's some fucking guy dressed like a wood nymph that's great anyway instead I just heard somebody go I never want to get that fucked up Sarris idea you know I do those uh album breakdowns my first album breakdown yeah I want to do one with you on Sam Kinison album just let's listen to it like talked about it yeah yeah let's do it let's do louder than hell do you know louder than hell you can't get on CD because it was so slow mo phobic that the people of Warner Brothers they put it out on cassette but then they never released it on CD when CDs came on them like fuck that fat slob Wow really dude forget let me tell you how much he had to overcome I was around during the PC days of the 80s we're in a PC war right now seems like it's just a battlefield it's just gone crazy like there's more bombs going off PC wise than ever people are so invested in the idea of controlling behavior and telling people what to do but back then it was happening to for a while yeah with remember the music or Al Gore's wife their wife is trying to make her speech but there's some things that go too far yeah she was trying to ban rap music and so things got things got real weird same language over and over again MTV banned Dice Clay for life cuz he told some joke about girls on their periods or something what that joke was and see if we can actually like that's a goddamn badge of courage for a guy like dice just gave him a gold medal that's all it really does for him he doesn't give a fuck that guy legitimately doesn't give a fuck that guy was never going to be anyway he walks around he makes videos walking around the supermarket talking about his haircut I got this new haircut what do you think nothing another video this fucking haircut that guy doesn't give a fuck like literally is just doing whatever dice wants to do wandering through the world hanging out with his kids so like for him like getting banned from MTV's probably the greatest thing ever this is it wow the bravado there look at him come on man oh my god it was the best what the fucking which is a zebra to welcome you to this event my name is dice I'm here to say I was born in Brooklyn sheep says babe come a long way your smile I'm gonna do it different gonna do it dice style what is this is this playing on YouTube or is it not just to rewind that look how fucking nervous he is look it's closed hand around look at shaking I'm here to say I was born in Brooklyn cheap said babe come a long way to make your smile I'm gonna do it different gonna do it nice style you see I'm shakin yeah it's all bravado and then he's like I'm doing this that was the weirdest kind of comedy that he could do it if they knew what you were gonna say they wanted to hear it roses are common a complete original complete original if you just like people look at him like all brutish and disgusting and just the dirty jokes and misogynist all those things are true but but you gotta realize that he revolutionized like he did something he's taken but he broke through a rock star style also if you just look at it completely objectively forget about the artistic merits of what he did he did something very different he figured out a way to do comedy that people legitimately laughed at even though they knew it was coming you know that hadn't been done before that hadn't been really like that never know I agree right never no one yells out the punchlines of fun with no crowd what's in the bow bitch you know he needed the money Oh everybody wanted to hear the things that he had already said which never existed before he could fucking tour with that original act right now and people would be super satisfied let's say along with them shit fuck yeah dice could do 10,000 seat arenas with that original act what's in the bowl bitch that's not nothing comedy was nothing it's the opposite of regular comedy it's the hair there but not much crisis machine thing yeah but he forces that on people I saw Gaffigan in at Moontower once and he did 45 minutes fine was the old stuff like introduce it like that he does yeah I probably should go back to my hotel room when I say yeah when I say Bert forces on people let me explain what I'm saying like he that like that's his signature thing I don't mean it like in a negative way but I mean like he's he's scared to not do that he wants to do that he wants them to know him as the Machine he wants to do that bit everywhere yeah and he feels like they get upset if he doesn't do it so in his head yeah like he's he's forcing it on them they're forcing it on him and it's like he's developed this everybody knows that if you're a fan Bert Kreischer you know the bit it's fucking he's dead he says you want to see this yeah but he's like do you want to see the me and then he's so worried about them getting upset that they don't hear but he's not at all concerned with how they feel about him clutching $10,000 at Children's Hospital and not doing it at all just refusing to pay - I don't get it I don't get it I can't believe you brought that up so one of the best roles about all time him on Children's Hospital I agree let's talk about you Joe do you think that that's a different thing when you when you have a bit like a signature bit you do every time you go onstage people expect to hear it that's a different thing different thing yes then regular standard comedy is like when you're when I'm watching your set like say if you have a new bit and I haven't seen it before I get excited because I don't know where you're going yeah and you're taking me down the road and then Thomas to do that though Bobby Lee it's like it's just goofy you just want to see him do it yeah get a certain comics that are just like I don't know I just like seeing this over and over he's in Boston Boston like all the headliners would do the same act forever I know that's why I fuck all them that's why I fell apart Yeah right it only lasted for a little while like that that's why yeah a bunch it's like you haven't written a case up they had the opposite of an Internet age approach their age approach was you put together a 45-minute set and that's it and some of them literally only had 45 minutes they'd been doing comedy for decades yeah because even with dice let's say you compare that to music where everyone's singing along with it musicians have new albums and then you expand that catalog of stuff you can sing along with hopefully up to a point up to a point echoing stones hits rolling stones put some stuff out today numbers like whatever brown sugar come on you fuck let me see you dance I heard you could still dance dude I went to see a rancid it at Coney Island and and he sits up then he goes uh and we do something off the new album and so he goes buh you know it's kind of like mm I'm like guy hey go and you can hurt it you can do if you want I'm still doing it they don't even like internalize that feeling they want you to react to it that's there's such a different thing between feeling something and then forcing everyone around you to hear it and then forcing the the artist to react to it that's such the levels of douchebag --is-- Nesta takes - boom that's critical level yeah he responded so that guy wins in that world of internet trolls if you could say something for the crowd in the perfect moment of silence you know we're just naturally comes up yeah it's that's audience member fucking Super Bowl yeah yeah you you cracked won over the Patrick Ewing was like I think playing this super Sonics it's just like way after his prime he's just travelling now to get a couple extra bucks and travel it maybe win a title and he went down the lane put up like a finger roll like halfway down the lane and it just kind of went up an air ball went out of bounds was a whistle only because it went out of bounds whatever thought was there a foul or anything and that the breasts could go out of balance and were just a silence my friends had heard that sense let me just go retire oh my it's like sports fans the war there though was they're the worst they're the worst

animal yeah have you ever seen a shoe bill no they're the creepiest bird ever they're they're a bird that lives in the Congo in Africa it's a fucking prehistoric dinosaur bird and there's a video from the Congo look at that thing there's some creepy head on pictures of it where you go what like that oh my god that one that thing is a hatchet for a face man that by the way is pretty much the pelicans logo dude well they should have made it the shoe bills yeah they should've a fucking Birdman there's videos of these things what's it doing oh it's a gift the gift oh my god it's like it's shifting its head back and forth but you look at its mouth its mouth is like a giant pair of scissors or something it's creepy fucking Anna more did they let the Congo Congo they're 5 feet tall - it's a giant ass bird so that's a Bobby Lee sighs bird wow that's a smaller one there there's a crazy video of one bird eating a snakehead they don't weigh that much birds are pretty light even like a bigger bird like a turkey that catch that fucking fish in the air motherfucker was he gonna throw it throw it I just let him know that it's in the bucket he's gonna go for her look watch how they walk man they just look creepy look I got a nightmare little nothing legs there was a thing that was in North America millions of years ago at least 1 million I think they were called terror birds uh-huh how creepy that thing is terror birds yeah they were enormous 7 feet tall enormous birds and some of them were even bigger than that that were predatory the cooler flightless birds that lived in North America huge really yeah like a Bigfoot sized bird that would probably eat people giant huge beaks like beaks that will literally consume half your abdomen there were these creaky fucking animals man and there was a bigger one even before that like one that dwarfed that - yeah that was millions of years ago see if you can find that fucking thing that's my favorite thing when they did time travel and they go back two prehistoric times and it's obviously like fuck everything here will kill me every yeah if there's nowhere to go I saw Jurassic world yesterday how was it it's fun there's definitely some cut the shit moments where doesn't make sense but that's you have to have those to make one of those movies I'm starting to appreciate movies I'm just dumb fun this is what it looked like oh my gosh look at that fucking thing so that was running around I think it was a North American animal too that looked like it was running after a car look so it's chasing after elk and shit but there's we could go to that upper right hand drawing the upper right hand one it shows you how big they were they were fucking enormous oh wow way better yeah human yeah and then there was ones that were even bigger than that those are the two biggest ones I like this one because they put the human like the outline of the human but he's holding a machine gun she imagines that thing run even if you had a machine gun yeah look how many of them there were different kinds of enormous birds that giant ostriches and shit yeah there I mean that fucking thing the really big one that's in the foreground with that reddish beak what a fucking creepy thing that would be if you're walking through a field and you saw this 9 foot plus tall freaky ass bird staring at you it doesn't even fly it's just it's just an armless eating machine I mean you can call it a bird but they can't fly they've done a many wings really they're weird they've giant talons what they are as a fucking dinosaur right there's some weird ass dinosaur that made it to 2018 you know that's like a big theory that's a big things being debated amongst birds are dinosaurs yeah they really think that it's possible that a lot of those dinosaurs had feathers yeah I became birds they are birds yeah like all over their body they were like when we look at a t-rex it might have been covered in feathers oh that would've been cool yeah we don't know they know some of them definitely were though they're finding some of them covered in feathers yeah yeah this mics are great they're not bad it still picks you up pretty good but not it doesn't pick up too much bullshit in the background we've tried other ones they don't like pick up shit in the background really much like if you moved some things over here and it's like yeah it's some of them are Jamie you can explain what are the ones that are like that literally pick up every sound in the room let's pick up pattern and what not just the preamp on this isn't up very loud oh it's up wild but it's not so yeah this this mic needs a preamp because it has a very low nominal level I don't know what that means at all I am in podcasting and I have no idea what you're talking about Fame is dropping some audio knowledge time I just want a mic to be able to do the thing where you talk like you're in a car driving by a line where you like drops off that was a pan I could do that right now actually yeah but but you'd have to do that with software you wouldn't be doing that with just them might make some where not with just the microphone that's the worst what do you think you're fucking get in the line and you like yell something at them but then when you're in the line you realize all you hear is yeah yeah yeah yeah you yeah you have to actually get your body out the window and yell uh-huh otherwise the sounds just coming out in a weird way weird boxy pattern remember dirty work dirty work the movie um yeah we norm and arty yeah it does that too a lot if I can moons them he wants a line arty and then he just pulls over no art he's like I was supposed to keep driving sorry everybody did you see the pictures of arty benoit saying already haven't seen him around his nose is all fucked up it's caved in well I guess he snorted something and he had an infection Oh make sense his nose was huge it was weird yeah it's pretty big he said it's like wow yeah right there oh yeah that one yeah what is going with the arty legs nose yeah something's happening in such a good guy great yeah he's a really good pool player is it really I could believe that he's real good he's more than anybody like refused to accept that he's famous so he just like walks around normal and then people start recognizing oh yeah I think it kind of like goes away but like yeah he just goes into normal environments all the time he's a good dude he really is really good guy yeah he is not making twenty twenty you don't think so no way no no desire to quit he's just he's riding it out did he quit for a while I think every once in a while I don't really know I think every once a while like he gets clean from reading but it's like he doesn't really wait just wants to pull it back a little sometimes right he's never gonna be one of the guys like yeah I haven't touched of stuff in five years yeah I don't think he's interested in that he's enjoyed himself that's a Mitch Hedberg said before he died apparent what they were trying to get him to clean up he's like I'm not doing shit I like it yeah it's like when you tell people quit smoking like what why I'm not desiring quitting right now you guys are yeah that's a hard pill for people to swallow that don't do it yeah you know like oh yeah just quit you should just quit dude when you see those gackt out people on the sidewalk in New York you know just fucking standing up you know dosed out or something like that or just like you know nodding off in their own whatever take day time you're like wow they're fucked up but now that I've done enough drugs you realize like they're loving it right now they are having the best time they're peaking it looks shitty but they're peaking when they come to shit in their pants and know where to go all right the best but right I don't look in Super Bowl yeah that's weaking yeah their experience is amazing yeah they're they're hearing Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds oh just tripping oh I forgot to tell you this what so when I was I was having some pretty good thoughts on this asset washing some different pants the killers by the way I fucking killed it mm-hmm sob Charlie you see stuff in like when you're out there on psycho dogs a truth I call them universal truths well you just like yes that is real that is right 100% and it's hard to bring that shit back into this realm you know to understand it it gets kicked off YouTube faster car so it's hard when you come back to be like Oh solve the truth of something and then it's and you can't express it and when people come back when they're around you they say something you're like what and they're like they realize that get frustrated they're not saying it right yeah and then it slowly away yeah so when I was there in that place sometimes I try to remember like when you get back say this to this person so that state told me to tell you that mm is one of the realest MCS I'm not gonna argue with it I don't know but it was like that could be a funny bit dude there's a funny bit in there like about how like some things are just in the moment they seem so profound fuck is wrong with me Eminem was one of the realest MCS well I would agree with that those he's very very real seems fairly real yeah yeah as I heard it I was like that's gonna sound dumb in the real world but I was like all right that'd be et Music Awards thing he did we're like free stuff out you know be like right well no some people liked it some kind of liked it the anti-trump thing everybody gets old it was artists get old yeah but he was you know he was angry and he had all of his friends around him yeah that was the weird thing like why all those dudes just standing around kissing up no those they're all just hanging around these cars like in a circle they're all waiting while Eminem raps he's got like all these that's what they its the rap cypher that's what they all take turns oh really they all did it yeah but where's the other ones the videos of the other guys too so one guy steps forward I need to understand rap culture better yeah I definitely almost had rape culture BT award show it's like a thing well they find it a fucking parking lot and different groups have different labels maybe yeah would have taken to put up their own guys it's called keeping it street yes sir especially or not street you don't know anything that's why they had to tell you that M Eminem's weather realities I already knew he keeps it Street but that thing was it was interesting it's like when people you know when you create this big explosion this attack on someone from someplace that's always fascinating to me to watch that go down like what's someone doing here like what what's happening here what's what he what did you supported was your take on it it wasn't his best work right right you know I mean I think he's an amazing rapper like some of his shit from the past is fucking incredible freestyle well first of all I'm not feeling that gold chain Jamie's like what that anymore yeah freestyle is just not I don't even hear those freestyle things are free I feel like you made up a lot of those oh yeah it's all practiced man I like the Cadillac in the back I'll tell you that I got a boner for leather right lock on the right yeah that looks like what is that like a 70 something Cadillac that thing's fucking beautiful oh I love those things I don't give a fuck about this rap but that Cadillac just shit I got a boner for old cars dude I'm one of those old dudes that likes old music and old cars did you see that that rap what it's like I forget who it was but it was like saying from the white point of view about what the form of black people and then from the black point of view I was wearing with white people hmm so video is somebody like lip-synching pretty well so I'm like redneck dude so he black people always complain about this and this and then it goes back hmm young but the problem with black people and white people is that people say black people and white people and sedges people yeah instead of just people I was watching this video it's annoying video of this lady calling the cops and this little eight-year-old black girl who's selling water they've seen it viral oh yeah yeah yeah viral vision he's not supposed to sell water she's calling the fucking police she's saying selling water without a permit and her mom videotapes her you know and puts it up and makes it viral and that's one of those videos where it's everything's in the right place the white lady is overweight just angry looking like you want overweight white lady the little black girl is as cute as a button the mom is the mom is talking to her in a way that's like not too aggressive she was she out here calling the police on a little girl all trying to sell water we see you boo like she's not being horrible yeah and everything just fell into place to this like perfect example of like what's happening here like is this racism or is this someone who's just just complains about everything would she be doing that for an eight-year-old you don't know that's why I hear the argument a lot of like you wouldn't do this if it was a man you want this was a woman you wouldn't know this was black but it's like you're not basing anything a set of it's just like one example force one example well you not prude you know there's no proof I whatever Hills Chamber of Commerce and whenever somebody wanted a new seating like like sidewalk seating they had just get through but all it would take is one housewife from the area to get a stick up their ass about the rules and say now no and like it'll be done by 8:00 p.m. there won't be any hurt on the on the people around us wouldn't lean up and if she goes no then it's like 24 more hoops to jump you know it's just because these housewives have nothing to do better than to enforce rules so it could be that could be fuck these black kids I don't I don't I don't have any idea she was on um it's on an interview talking about it which is a terrible idea by the way who the white lady yeah and she put all this makeup on everything which is also a terrible I think me me from Drew Carey Show but the whole thing was she was saying that she was working and that she had the window open the little girl was shouting and screaming she's trying to make it look bad as possible yes she was a victim and she said she apologized to both the little girl and the mom but they won't accept her apology which is like okay well you knows nothing wrong with accepting someone's apology clearly she shouldn't have done that like I shouldn't tell little eight-year-old not sell water on a hot day who gives a fuck like that doesn't make just going hey come on guys don't scream by my window yeah yeah like maybe she was saying that there's a hot day and so she had her window rolled down the kid was screaming but apparently she didn't talk to them she didn't talk to the kid and she didn't talk to the mom she just called the police what else I see that's the problem you're so antisocial that lets go straight to like someone deal with it instead of just saying hey I'm it's like when you get a note in your apartment door saying something it's like just or the front door like just kind of my apartment knock can I ask once just try it humanity once and then go to the other step so they compared her with this white chick called on your barbecue lease on the barbecue and they're the same person she not really but yes they look so similar man like in the way the shape of their body not housewife it's an alleged white housewife it's a fuckin shitty the worst position to be in in the world there's definitely nothing to do look come on yeah come on look at the two of them together they're both on the phone with these like sexually ambiguous forms like you know that that's a woman but you know both of them they're overweight and it's just weird it's weird they're like unclearly you then I'm gonna go out on a limb I don't think most I will say most people that are shaped like that don't feel good I don't feel good they don't feel good right they're upset it's tough you ever ever have somebody screaming about something like you know what is here but doesn't meet them with like what happened to you yeah are you so angry okay so why you so mad selling water without a permit mm-hmm I got a discussion with somebody on Twitter way back about that guy Michael Brown got I can't breathe what's that Michael Brown Eric garner was Eric garner yeah and he somebody's like yet what you understand is I have a business and like I sell let's say I sell cigarettes if somebody's undercutting me with no permits right outside that really hurts my business I was like okay sure I'll give you that do you think the punishment for that should be choking someone maybe til I can't breathe and he's like oh no no that's too much of a punishment okay well here's the problem with that the official version of that is that he didn't have any cigarettes on him they did not know he had nothing he had nothing what yeah I know he had nothing when they they had rested him before for that but he was clean so all that cigarette he was telling him leave him the fuck alone he's like you're all I was out here fucking with me just leave me the fuck alone they started they wanted to frisk him and there was for no reason oh my god 90 seconds is still too much it's like just give me the ticket bitch yes they shouldn't touch him I mean and he wasn't a violent guy wasn't like like threatening them and some sort of a way and and then they try to say that it wasn't a chokehold my bitch let me put you in that dude i pacify these two cops that i wanted to uh they were one was sent right after that in New York that's not a chokehold and I want I wanted to stop ago actually I'm friends with an expert on the subject that he does say truck and choke choke you to death like that yeah I will choke you to death with that listen he's got his hands grip that is like the same ver it's a backwards version of what you call it on marcelo garcia guillotine which means like there's certain guys that are really good at getting the blade of the forearm across your esophagus it's very painful and like some of like a maul easton taught me how to do this in shout out to Boulder Colorado I'm all Eastern is a jiu-jitsu coach and he's got a fantastic guillotine and one of the things about his guillotine is he knows how to get that blade of that bone right into your esophagus it's horrific it feels terrible and they do it like with a high elbow so you can't escape it it's and it it's an immediate feeling that guy has his forearm right across that guy's throat yeah there's no doubt about it if I'm holding that like that and I'm clammed he has his hands clasp together can you make a little bigger so I can see his right hand resisted yeah see but you could still choke someone out even if his hand I can't tell if his hands are connected I think they are it looks like he's got a man inside his Eric Garner's no hundred percent hundred percent and then his arm is behind his back too but the point is the guy who's choking him the way he's doing that you could choke a guy like that with one arm you don't even have to have that right arm and play if he's got that left arm with the neck like that always do is hook the the back of the head or put the shoulder whether the traps you if your arms from San Jose he cut some way energy shields Jerry yeah it's made one on guillotine yeah Jake do anybody like that Tito Ortiz did that in the UFC before he choked somebody out with the one-armed guillotined Luke Rockhold did it to Michael Bisping he got him in a mounted one-armed guillotine I mean here's the problem why don't the other cops ever go hey tell me that's enough yeah you dissin man that's a goddamn chokehold I know choke holds i commentate him on for a fucking living that's chokehold and if you don't think it's a chokehold let me put you in it let me put you in it and see how long you last well it's it's fucking chokehold even I'm a lot of break up here what that guy's been calling you out have you talked about it how's Jones know that fighter which 100 B yeah this is Kobe's funny man co person I know Colby and I also know very well one of Kobe's really good friends as my friend cam Haynes they live in the same town it's good it's good you really got choose to be he'll or hero and I would always go heal he's all healed all right so much more fun go heal you know it's really hilarious Chael Sonnen CeMAT that i talked about what he does that would tell those didn't know that I talked about what Colby does I go he's having fun I go he's playing up the role of the villain and he's selling paper I'm out of here cuz their secrets are the business it's so ridiculous I mean while he's giving up the secrets of the business by talking about me giving up the secrets of the business it's the dumbest shit of all time I can't tell if it's a work I can't tell if what he's doing Gerald's doing yeah obviously if he's doing if he's fake upset there was a point where jail was the best trash talker in sports ever ya know he was phenomenal he still is but the idea that you bring up when I was trans to the Octagon it's thunder when Anderson Silva walks in it sounds like a mouse pissing on cotton I've never lost a fight in my life I've never lost a round of I never lost one second of one fight my love is like what about here we can find stop didn't matter he just kept going I loved it it was beautiful he's a smart guy but he's also getting us to talk about it and getting us to talk about a show which I'll give him a plug right now because I'm sure it's great he's with Ariel Helwani and Chael Sonnen have a new show called Ariel and the bad guy and so you got to get that ESPN show about it yeah he's the bad guy he's great at it he's great at us and he got he ranted and raved about us for like ten minutes then he did and then Brandi responded and he came back with another 20 minutes you don't ever talk about the business first of all I have to because my job is to call what I see my job is not necessarily things I'm calling what I see if I say Francis and Ghana is the most terrifying heavyweight contender ever yeah I see them because that's what I see I see him put Alistair Overeem into fucking orbits inside of it so you just talk about the fighting part that's what your expert that I talk about whatever well listen here's the deal change understand you stick to fighting and promoting and let intelligence leave that here to intelligent people you're out of your class fucking deal with it whoa uneducated you're a high school dropout and you know it you go to trash talk and that's it I think all of your life well yeah I think he graduated from college no he didn't he fucking dropped out of high school early like sophomore year no no that guy's dumb bro yeah Chael Sonnen is dumb are you sure yeah how'd you ever talk to him yes these two points about retarded what are the points what points do you get when you got a real issue but the line that I have medically is like if you are barely retarded you're still not really retarded but I should be more politically correct with our use of that word mentally retarded you can't say that you can't say that it's illegal depending on who's president you'll get arrested for that they're coming for you I liked him I like what he does I have to talk about the fact that someone's talking shit to build up but it doesn't stop someone from talking shit it also makes it more fun to watch I know what the fuck it is and I like it people are gonna like it it makes it more interesting it makes it look ha fel dos Anjos went into that octagon with the weight of not just fighting colby with his considerable skill set yeah cuz Colby beat him from fucking what round one to round five most rounds were controlled by Colby's pressure most moments dos Anjos he's a killer he had some very good moments in the first round but Kobe overwhelmed him there's no doubt about that so he has skill on top of that but part of what was interesting about it was how failed Oh son just came into there with the weight of all the shit that Colby had been talking that stuff you carry that man Aldo character although wise methodical ed vest he's jumped in what are you doing like a let he had a lead vest on up the anger he had he just wanted to smash my god and caught her slid out of the way and just right away what are you doing dropped a left hand on his chin it was it was one of the most artistic expressions of shit-talking manifest looking outside the box behavior you know loss of composure he lost his composure yeah he really did it was crazy she's got room for hyper-aggressive and he ran right into a perfectly place left hand but Anderson and chill had that too I mean she fuck he frustrated Anderson so frustrated or more with what he was doing in the Octagon no saying saying first he talked crazy mad shit see two people for people to appreciate jail as a fighter what I say is you've seen some really good fights and his he's had some recent wins that are very good he beat rampage that's a big win but if you go back watch him fight Nate Marquardt cuz Nate Marquardt was in his prime he would come over from Strikeforce he was at that time when it was he just leaving strike first he went to Strikeforce it became their light their welterweight champion he became their 170 over there with he beat tyron woodley in this crazy fucking ko sequence we blasted with an elbow and hit some an uppercut it's one of the greatest ko sequences of all I please for you let me let me just say this Nate Marquardt at one point in time was one of the best if not the best mixed martial arts fighter in this country just couldn't give us Anderson he never know he never found the the UFC during his his right moments were right he had already had a shitload of fights outside the UFC by the time he got here and I think he's probably a little compromised by the time he got here Jeff's Burnett's like the yeah I don't he never really yeah I said well he won the title in the UFC when he was talking before he's the youngest ever UFC heavyweight champion times GFC during one stint and he got Kayode by Pedro his oh he beat a brand eco-tour for the title Josh was a beast man I mean Josh was a fucking beast he really was but so is Nate Marquardt and chill thought Nate Marquardt when Nate Mart was Marquardt was very close to his prime they went to war man they went to fucking war and shield nominated him but dominated him yeah and he was dominating with his wrestling his wrestling because he talked so much shit and because he seemed so silly when he says I've never lost our second of our any around in any fight so this is the KO sequence with Nate Marquardt and tyrant dude Nate Marquardt was a fucking assassin at one point guys I know guys that trained with him they say dude I never saw Nate lose a fucking round he just it just never came together perfectly in the UFC but watch this ko sequence this isn't set by the way he's fighting tyron woodley boom he catches him watch this watch this elbow boom here comes this is not the sequence the sequence towards the end oh yeah fire Kenny yeah this is not the secrets where it was the KO TV just get right to the ko I had it right this was I by the way very different tighter than Wensley I should say - this is pre Duke Rufus this is tiring when he was just coming off a wrestling here it is so you heard him with that right hand and he comes in and he catches them with a with a big elbow this has been way better if it was just queued up to the ko isn't there just the KO sequence because I know I've seen it like just as a clip on YouTube just scoot ahead a little hear it right there yeah Nate Marquardt is great for a while dude I'm telling you so this fight boom look at this boom video game play that back go that's video game shit that's video game shit cuz what up everyone and again this is tyron woodley he's a fucking stud boom Oh on the way down that shit is insane that's an insane ko so jail dominated that do wow and dominated him when he was in this era tell me what year was this fight and what year was chale's fight against him in the UFC so chill has some serious skill to it particularly with his wrestling so people you know they he but the trash-talking was why he became famous it wasn't just that it was you know it was a trash-talking that's when I became aware of Google Nate Marquardt um he's a leader that manager fired was was like nothing I'd ever seen yeah Anderson I thought yeah you absolutely suck we saw a bunch of Aronson fights and we saw a bunch of pipe before that but it was never it was never that the bass he was like I'm going to take him down and beat him so the tyron woodley fight was in 2012 and when did he fight Chael Sonnen was before that see that's how good Chael Sonnen was he beat that two years before before he went over to Strikeforce it became the welterweight champion so you he fought him in his absolute prime and dominated them so he could people this is this is Nate Marquardt yeah dude he fought everybody he lists her Silva Jimmy Horne no Katie Nehemiah one punch remember me and Maya Chael Sonnen he got lit up by Anderson though Carl Madoff you should know comedy and Ursuline ground and pounded him I think Oh Nate Nate yeah but Nate honestly I feel like Nate at 170 was at his best yeah a TKO time he grounded pounded I believe at 170 he was at his best like can you see him in the tire would they fight because he was big but he wasn't too big he wasn't too bulky and he was he was a very powerful guy for that weight class if he could kept it that way class damn he's lost a lot he lost a lot of fights yeah he's that's the problem and I think he's retiring now but it's like two and six my point was it doesn't take anything away from the skill of the guy when you're talking about it so you're talking it's fun it's a fun aspect of what it is that you have to talk about and that he's not making money off it is preposterous that's a ridiculous not making money off he was saying that I I said that he was that he was doing it for pay-per-view sales and he's like he doesn't get a penny of those pay-per-view sales that's a ridiculous thing I'm saying he knows he's a dumb guy oh his trash talk is just from a bit from from an uninformed point of view it's great because it's like stupid stupidly like into something but like he's not educated on almost any subject other than fighting I think he's a smart guy no I disagree I talked to him I feel like he's very intelligent yeah well you're a Gibby wow I am a Guinea it's a harsh toward that my face when I look at all the Jews that won Nobel Peace Prizes yeah Nobel science project whatever it is yeah but what is it Nobel Prizes for science one buy more European Jews than I think any other race is it surprising isn't that true yeah that sounds right something any other race any other I think another like obvious classification it's never Sicilian Italians yeah the words out man yeah we're smart why are you guys smarter what is that about I think it's just honestly like the stuff Jimmy the Greek was talking about but like in a positive way just were just our brains we're just we've inner first of all okay we're bred for that mm-hmm we don't have any outside genes right so like you know how some dogs are super like loyal right right yeah we're just intelligence everything else is falling apart there might be something to that why is it racist to say why is it racist to say we're smarter that's right just to say something is less morning but less yeah but no we're the smartest ones maybe second maybe the Chinese got you beat well you know Asians this is what's really crazy yeah there's a real issue right now with Asians and university enrollments particularly in Harvard they discriminate against Asians you should so many apply because so many are kicking ass yeah to get them out of there yeah there's there's like real talk about how this is crazy because Asian people for by alright this is a generalization and try not to be racist but generally speaking Asian students are known as working very hard yeah and they're very dedicated and they're very successful and the representation is overwhelming in terms of their numbers in the population and sure they're killing it yeah the killing it yeah and because of that and their their mindset is to just work really hard it's not to protest things and not to shut things down it's just we're in the library during all those protests that is in the library there were the Indians while this is all happening I'm not saying that they're not socially conscious but while this is all happening they're not protesting it the way maybe other groups that felt marginalized whether it's people of color or trans people or gay people whatever it is don't feel represented or discriminated against they would be shutting down you know conferences and speakers and shouting out in the hallway but the Asians the whole reason why they kick ass is because they don't spend any time on petty bullshit like get done because of that the harvick Harvard fucking Harvard is saying hey we're gonna be racist against you because we know you're not gonna complain whoa Wow what look at this let's pull this up pull this up Jamie I want you to pull up Asian students harder to get into Harvard Law suit that's crazy it's crazy and it's not a small amount they're discriminating by they're making their grades considerably higher in order to gain acceptance really yes yeah because of a natural breakdown of different racism you can't you can't slow one down just means whatever will have less less productive graduates it doesn't make any sense it's a crazy way of thinking but it's all in this idea of diversity like instead of treating people as individuals instead of just saying human beings you have to have each class represented by a certain amount of people that's nice but it's not anti-racist it's like it's not a racist idea to want everybody to be treated as one it's just it can be done with an eye on avoiding all possible racism it can be done to jump people purely as individuals here's the worst way that can ever be done the worst way is you tell the most successful people were complete at least that they have to work harder you are getting fucked by your genes you the people in your past in your group your little gene pool too good you're doing too good in school so we're gonna make it harder than it is from my kids that's nuts literally what people are doing there too because if they didn't offer to be like all Asians Asians would be dominating and it's a very reason why they think they can get away with this lawsuit accuses Harvard of discriminated against Asian American applicants in personal ratings personal ratings I don't know what it is men they're making it more difficult it says students for fair admissions has accused Harvard of intentionally discriminating against Asian American applicants by limiting their admissions numbers so they're limiting the nuts that all these oh and this many agents and by the way that's super hard for like let's say like Vietnamese or not the Chinese or Japanese great you know agents which is like we don't know if this is true we should say you know just to be really clear to lost this is a lawsuit we don't know if this is true but this is the argument and this is the argument that many many many people have made now I haven't really personally researched this but I know a lot of like legitimate intellectuals have brought this up and debates and conversations and they're saying look this is an issue this is essentially this is sanctioned racism against one group because they're too effective so you're limping a number you're saying where we're trying to get more of an emphasis on like extracurriculars get in or out yeah based on being Asian or based on being European that's crazy you should get in or out by you having merit and you know being a worthy student and difficult schools like Harvard are supposed to be difficult and if the cream of the crop all comes from Asia shouldn't we look at what the fuck we're doing here that we can't compete with them I mean what is it wow they're do we want Asian students do we want to compete with them I mean is it too much are they were requiring too much of their life to be successful with their schoolwork I mean yeah that's the thing too if you're going to other side you want a normal life you want to like blow up your normal life too if you're going through college and everything you're doing all day is studying and you know literally you might have like some fuckin shitty part-time job somewhere to make some money for food and then you're studying more right maybe you have a part-time job a lot of people don't so if you think about all that that's not the kind of life I want for my kids that's a crazy life yeah I know where you specially with some of the things are just for four years some of the things it's not that anything you're really interested in but you have to get it on yeah you have to be you know you have to have a fully balanced education so if to take classes you're not even remotely interested in it you have to do it and it's this one way and this is how we can assure that you have enough knowledge that we can give you a piece of paper that says you have a degree I mean and Asians are clearly like that's the game okay okay within those rules well we'll just gonna work 20 hours a dude my friend junk sick think I've told you about him before he was a US National Taekwondo team member uh-huh when I was like hmm was like jeongsuk Indonesia yongsik Chang he's Korean Oh check he was going through his fucking residency he was gonna be a doctor going through his residency and training for the national team and he was running stairs running stairs in the school in between study how he would do studying the nude run the stairs how you gonna hold a guy I got back dude you couldn't hold him back he slept 4 hours a night that that's true that's the same shit as like he was always tired yeah he's always tired because he works hard don't fucking give a fuck he was always tired he would just show up exhausted and kick ass Wow and he wasn't physically talented either this guy made it to the to the Nationals and he became a national champion and he wasn't even like really really physically talented it wasn't like some freak athlete that just moves super fast UK he's just fucking unbelievably smart unbelievably hard worker but I saw the way that guy was living as he was like I was a couple years younger than him and he was going through his residency and training and doing all this crazy shit at the same time and I was I was like I'm exhausted just watching you like I can't see how the suit could be worth it to do all those things just do one of those things maybe that's what I want to do I want to do one of those things but you're doing two loads ends he was doing what I was doing and then on top and then I'm more and way more way more he's doing schoolwork that was delivering newspapers and shit yeah do you know what this if that's happening it they're just saying like it's the same thing as like making it so why people get ahead it's crazy it's like laws now you're arrested if you don't have a job but that's this is where you could realize that all this stuff is crazy you're you're you're being racist against a minority I don't think it's okay because they kick so much ass because they're a powerful we can take them down south it's literally racist because if you're saying you can only have a certain number of these people in there it's crazy that's racist it's got to be to say no we're trying to keep a diverse population because I'm representing a population of the best of the best there I mean they should take off any of their names off their applications or something like that and just for like let's see what they got yeah but I guess they'd probably judge you based on many things right you know they try that for the old Daily Show with Jon Stewart just take the names off the application we don't want to see your names just your writing sample Oh that's smart yeah that's smart well here's what happened though they hired only white males yeah and then Jon Stewart was like okay I guess going in blind is not enough I guess he fucked up he didn't even say like well that just shows it's not our fault that's just fucking randomly we had eight people and they happened to be white dudes here's the thing though if you had movers okay and you wanted to move furniture then you tested people for moving furniture is it okay to hire all men yeah it's okay why because they're physically stronger physically right now um is it okay to hire someone who you think is going to be the best of the job or do you have to have a certain amount of women so you wouldn't expect it from something physical like a moving company but why should it be mandatory for something like a creative thing well it's different a little bit because no one except the client is appreciating the movers it's just like if I'm high it's I'm the only one who have to deal with it like say if you were say if you were doing a show like a woman's show a woman's comedy show okay and what am i me know or am i woman you'd have to be alone I guess okay go ahead and you want your old female executive producer and you want to have like a female voice to it so you wanted to tire some really funny chicks uh-huh and then what guy is gonna I know obviously it happens way way way way more often the opposite way where women get discriminated against but what guy is gonna say no fuck that I want a part of this you know I should have a job here you should roll control Patrol should be equally represented male versus female because that's what a lot of people feel like when it comes to men and women like someone was telling bird on his podcast that the Comedy Store should be happenin right now that lady just if she honestly has no idea what American comedy is all about she LA yeah yeah she's speaking in an uninformed way the way Chell does a lot I mean it's ridiculous dude it's not a joke he's just not that smart you don't could tell that whatever but this woman was the same as jail where she was like uninformed they're just going full-bore yeah and she wasn't doing to promote anything she was just doing it because she thought it was right but it's like oh you don't really understand how this works no there's a process it's like I saw a blog one said we need more women in in like hiring positions and it's like oh you mean the head of the calm restore the head of the fucking Comedy Cellar head of New York Comedy Club Colbert like there's plenty of female Booker's like you don't really know something you tell them that then it should go okay I didn't realize that well there's certain things that people love to say when they've done almost no research on what it actually is yeah yeah so that lady do that lady had no clue she just goes I'm not getting in here I'm a big comic I'm not getting in here it must be it's just not causation in causality she goes it must be because of this I've had my agents call and it's like oh no I worked for Mitzi when agents or managers call Sam I can't my client in she go fuck off that's something we do things here dude I got an argument with someone about the wage gap yeah they really believed that men and women work right next to each other doing the same job and the woman is only making 75 cents to the guys dollar I'm gonna put out there no this is a crazy thing to argue like if you're gonna argue that yeah you know you should know what that is you should know what that is otherwise you're just talking shit like which we all do sometimes but you got to be willing to specify change I believe in that so which studies of you read and Oh almost always no zero studies I'd like to believe this versus whatever luckily we're not in charge of making decision people love love to put these studies out you like to tweet them out without having even looked at them at all yeah it's some of these are so they're soaked there's that it proved you everything wage gap who's like so you're telling me I can get the same look I'm a smart businessman who's made a bunch of money and I can get the same level of talent out of this woman or better well let's just say equal but 75 percent benefit so I'm M sorry or or vehicle are probably better there's 75 cents on the dollar and I'm a smart businessman and I'm not gonna go with the lower costs equal talent you're better talent that's that's how can I run a successful business making that kind of decision how can you yeah it would just a would be hired at far higher rates yeah well you can look deeper at it and be like oh it's just like total jobs or whatever it is again I'm raised but I just listening people who have I think you're right I think there's something to that if there really could hire the same people for the same job and get a woman who's just as good at it for 75 cents it's horseshit though they would all hire only women the people don't know what we're talking about it's all based on what jobs you choose it's like it's not the men don't make more money because they do the same job and make more money at that job than the woman does they do different jobs that's where the wage gap is the wage gap is in the number of hours that men work the different jobs they choose what they excel in it's it has nothing to do with like two people that are both you know in the same line on an assembly line or somebody that would the same amount of time and they both make the same amount of money yeah in one or rather the male makes a $1 for every 75 cents that's not how the the wage gap works it's just different jobs okay so hearing that information like I member when I first heard it it was like you can either go fuck you you're just trying to fucking shit on women or you can go huh well let me I've never thought of that let me look into that a little bit and then I'll get back to you instead of immediately acting fuck off well people get mad like that's not what it is like yes it is what it is foolish if you keep arguing with me because you don't even know what it is this is a dumb conversation now I can't argue with you when I know that you haven't read any of the stuff that points to these numbers like look the thing is no one should be like whatever you do whatever it is whether it is you make incredible sculptures or you build cars or you're a painter whatever the fuck it is that you do no one should be able to say that you doing this definitely should make as much money as doing that no things are worth what they're worried exactly we drama dilutes Bowler yeah yeah at some point he was right I think top 15 in the world at his sport yeah which is equivalent of like trying to even think who would be like Carmelo Anthony right I'd say right and this guy Tommy dilutes at his sport made 38 grand and and fucking and and Carmelo makes you know 20 million yeah sorry your sports not as popular it's just not as popular weight classes in his BA how it works that's not fucking sought-after yeah I could see how you would want more money yeah sure everybody does I get that but like there's certain people that there's a harder to do that job and the reason why they do it is because they know that it's more valuable so they work hard at that job to imagine being the fucking CEO of a corporation how will I wouldn't want much pressure would be on you all the time being fucking Tim Cook over at Apple that's why I don't get paid as much as him exactly good horrible exactly exactly well that is the same that the same philosophy is the reason why women approach now and I say some women I should say because there are like super hyper aggressive career oriented women that work as hard or harder than men maybe even harder to prove that they're as tough as the man but they would take the approach that you and I would take like fuck that life I'm not doing that whereas it's statistically more males push themselves by working longer and harder hours on purpose to try to succeed it's just a natural thing they're trying to win a game there's a competition abyss putting points on the board by the way fool's game again personally yeah I see people doing that my friends in high school and I'm like you're wasting your life yeah for what for a digit number it's it's you're not doing anything with yourself the problem is men they get stuck in this loop of obligation they get stuck in the loop of children and mortgage and and then once you have a car and a nice house and you know you maybe want to get a boat dude you get stuck and you have all these payments and obligations and you're not going well because you have a family's plus maybe you always wanted to be a rock and roll singer yeah no and you never fucking got a chance to get out of the blocks and you're living your life in this angry state unfulfilled angry state you know so the advice is for the young the advice is for young people the advice is for people that look at their parents and all these other people that are telling them what they have to do are they right or the other or is there a fucking path out there if you just figure out what you really like to do and just only go that way because if you go this way and I'm gonna take a couple years off and go that way for a while and then I'm gonna like I'm gonna go back to school and get my degree just so I have something to fall back on you just said you don't you didn't get any further down the road you're on the same spot you would have been if you didn't do shit you got it you got to go forward but if you something forward it's the wrong direction you're still getting experience doing something you're finding out what it takes to succeed and the decision on purpose in order to get something you think is right I don't know what it's like I think more and more people are saying no to this whole way of doing it and be like I want to be outdoors I value friendship over cash you know things like that experience is over fucking money and they're starting to go the other way they're starting to ask for like when they get their jobs like okay I'll take this job but I want six weeks off yeah you know I'll take less money but I want more freedom people are going for that they are and they should mm-hmm there's nobody value there's no time there's no time you got to do what you like you got to do stuff you enjoy that's why I went to New York I was like I saw 40 coming and I was like this seems like it's gonna be less and less doable you know to pick up and move at certain age ranges I know yeah but it just seems like that and so it's like go I can do something you know what I'll do get going I want you to exercise more dude oh yeah for sure I want you to you're smart guy yeah and you're you know you're in your 40s yeah I'm in your 40s it's it's super important to keep your body healthy because he's gonna start deteriorating food it just starts falling apart man starpha stuff starts work and shitty and see dudes they have you know what freaks me out my resolutions is here to work out more let's do it come on go on up after this fucking podcast let's get one in Sun lift it's some cardio just do chin up just cardio machines over here I'm aversive clamoring you didn't works in a while but I gotta do it boys just bike for two hours just like you're around yeah but like fast that's why I like running some outside doing something I'm running around schooler yeah yeah there's something to it I'm running around I see things I'm a movement not mine yeah when you're on a machine you just fucking unless you're listening to a good book on tape or you're watching 40 television show or something like that it's boring yeah but when you're running you got to look about where you're staying with your hi and watching like some Cartoon Network shit and running you could go forever we could you really can't yeah music helps you go forever like there's something about having like a badass song you don't you don't hear your own breath put some peaches on it's like you get a nice rhythm that doesn't freak you out like it freaks me out sometimes when I hear a rhythm of me really pushing hard cardio cuz I go god damn I'm going pretty hard yeah I should back off but when you're listening to music you don't even think about it you just keep going yeah it's like a little meditative trick occupies your mind some weird way lets you to put like just a little extra effort in it's pretty fun plus you got to get off your phone yeah you can't really be on there while you're doing that can't be on your phone so it like yeah forces you to go clear for a little bit yeah you can't answer calls shit when you're on fucking treadmill asshole yeah people trying to talk to you here in the background that movie they do that movies but they go like yeah go and they just like they're not out of breath they're able to talk normally they did that and they do nightclubs right wrong Kevin Smith's the first guy ever saw them had a desk that was on a treadmill he had his desk right here well yeah when he first started losing weight he's gone through a few different versions of like dieting and changing his diet yeah he you know he had a heart attack no way really had a hard time when he was filming a special he filmed two shows you're supposed to film two shows filmed one and in between shows had a fucking heart attack and just there was like you're having a massive heart attack we're taking in the hospital in between yeah filming and he had the kind of heart attack that 80% of the people who get it die what yeah it was a big one total blockage yeah total blockage of one of his arteries there to put a stent in him and he's lost like a shitload a shitload weight was this recently yeah no recently like yeah so this is when he last lost weight before when I first met him he was I first he's a sweetheart of a guy you know him well I barely know him I've never met him I just talked him online a couple times that's real quick now super smart like deceptively small we got his speeches he makes a comic on our fucking glorious no he's amazing he's an amazing guy and he's a real real slick a genuine sweetheart so when I first met him he had a a sugar thing he just loved sugar he's eating a lot of candy he just loved candy and then when I met him a sec time I ran into him he decided to go on like a bunch of juice cleanses and shit he was just drinking a lot of juice and eating healthy food he lost that fuck load of weight and that's when he had the the treadmill thing with a laptop on this platform so he would walk and and do his work smart move and say Allah that shit's mental like whenever Ralphie got his stomach stay you know now wow it looks like a mouse tiny little face a beautiful tiny face look how fat he was there yeah you got big soon as you lose that weight you gotta see a therapist they're covering up something yeah there's there's something to it for sure you know it's just people get in ruts man you know you get in ruts with your food you get in ruts with your behavior but the food one is a big one you know that kind of food is just fucking terrible for your body you know just constantly consuming sugar you're putting your body in the state of shock processing this stuff that's never supposed to be in that form it's a patrice with like choke to candy bars and then pass out oh there's a body which I process it but like this is one of the things I want to say to you that one of the things it's fun about you going to New York is you've brought more New York insult style to our conversations and our hangings out this la style is like way less insulting but you like like our group text messages that we have with Burton Tom fucking great but the insults to each other or hilarious now there's so it's such New York style like insult comedy my friends in New York there's a gap between la cama New York comer is always separate before you came there it's true dude you've made everybody more insult e thing is it's fine man I love insulting each other it's fucking fun it's silly fun man and what someone gets you with a good ones like oh yeah it's a it's a but it's like said something about happy I didn't know you know who had a great point Wanda Wanda Sykes said that that was Patrice but she said Patrice elevated that level and she thinks he changed she really said it she's like I think he changed the frequency of that comedy scene more right that's possible why not when I started hugging and he started the hugs in the in LA who started hugs the guy who died in the car accident Josh Josh out of Mars friend I can't read his name now oh I didn't know him though yeah but he brought hugs back he was like I'm doing them and it's kind of spread out for the open mic scene Jerrod oh well we always hugged sort of but he's like constant hugs for hellos where it's like it's not weird anymore I didn't know of him and I independently was hugging for hellos so every motion oh good I think it's great that everybody was doing it Patrice would hear the Rose is an awesome guy oh yeah I didn't know him I don't even think I ever saw Angela Bauer yeah I don't think I ever even saw him do stand-up I think maybe see him at the clubs great guy full of good joke writer no one says a bad thing about the guy so Patrice would do stuff before he was like duros would walk in and he would just start making fun of DeRosa's lack of shoulders he'd be like fucking DeRosa can't wear backpacks fucking fall off my favorite one brother Doug because Joe DeRosa can't have a heart-to-heart with his father because I put it in let it show then he slides off Jesus Christ oh my god I was on the phone calling in the Opie and Anthony once and I was talking about Anthony's gun collection yeah and I said do you worry like you're contigo is I'm strapped everywhere I go all throughout your house everywhere you go you're strapped it was yes absolutely I'm like do you ever think that like maybe you're like manifesting this that like by by constantly having guns everywhere you you're you're manifesting potential gun violence and Patrice goes Rogan thinks that kind of shit cuz he's magic out there manifesting shit manifesting magic fucking dying oh my god he was so good at like jumping on silly shit you were saying like what you are you wearing no seriously what in the fuck are you wear and go hard hard hard I just got to accept it it's a joke or you'll get mad es has his own version of that you know I told me one time Diaz was mocking me cuz I had a notebook because leave weed then with that fucking notebook let everybody know you're right Billy Hemingway over here you know as those fucking things people are all right what I've let everybody know you're right get the fuck out of here with the notebook did the fuck out of here with the notebook he was in love with you could see things clear like that yeah Taylor has this theory that I love because anytime you hear somebody say they're gonna start writing or they're gonna start working out cuz that's someone who's telling you they are not working out for more not writing right like what do you mean you can tell me I've been working out that's a whole separate thing I hear a lot more people say are about to start doing something that people are doing so you know I started using this program for my last special I don't want to tell you about Scribner Jenna surely you know how it's set up yeah it's pretty cool dude it may it's a game-changer it's making me organize stuff in a totally different way it's nice to have like a little column to the left where I put all subject matter and then to the right each one of those will click and I'll show you all the shit you've written on that subject off that sub so it's you could move it around like you can you know you could put your your set in order with something like that that is you know I'm trying to I need that for this I'm doing this out I'm trying to do all Jew stuff oh yeah I do thinking about the demons in the other dimension huh yeah we closing with that yeah but then I have to be real conscious of like how many like stories about two holidays am i giving how many like customs am i giving how much am i showing that I have expertise on this like I'm the team reiterating you know every like 15 minutes or so like show something they're like no no you should believe me because I'm you know put it back in they're not saying what's up top doesn't do it yet to like do a story about me and you Shiva in Israel's right oh yeah that's right this guy strategies but you have you have the deepest you fucking went to Israel and you were studying how many hours a day like fourteen maybe yeah you were the literally the Asian equivalent yeah one percent that gets into Harvard but just studying just text I know more about this shit that it I mean anybody that I know I'll believe him and know some stuff and he law knows a little bit but like yeah I was so deep in that I'm like and I still have friends that are deep in that we like talk about it sometimes and the laws that I just yeah when my friends asked me like what's what's this custom I'm like I'm like and then I see it from a fresh point of view for the first time in 20 years I'm like oh it's just because it represents this well that's like oh yeah yeah like just all the stories all the story so like I'm starting like there's a story of poram where Esther so far back or all these but one of the first feminist in the Talmud in the Torah itself was the story of poram where Vashti that the Queen of the King not Jewish was called to say hey come in front of my court and show your naked body well and she refused she said no I'm not doing that and was one of the first feminists characters Vashti said no and who she was banished and they looked for another princess and it was this Jewish lady that was in hiding about her Judaism forever it was weird but anyway the Vashti we always viewed her as this great feminist leader you know who could stand up for herself and then recently my Sephardic Jewish friend who was deep in there too he pointed I was like no no if she had herpes should a herpes outbreak she want to show her body she didn't just suddenly that wasn't cuz he did more research on it I need to read all the commentary the Rashi and all that stuff on there and they bring him down like legitimately so some stuff he didn't really think about another stuff for like oh oh there was a story of a rabbi who his students were being killed by a dragon and I read this and I'm like it's not supposed to be a metaphor nothing in there supposed to be a metaphor it's also some mean something else act as metaphor but also be real so I'm like what's Ragan are you talking about this killing students I show my rabbi this and he was like alright this is one metaphor it's jerking off it's masturbation but they were dying off at night and the rabbi to kill the dragon oh there's the best part the robber to kill the dragon hid under one of the students beds until the dragon attack yeah it sounds like what is all this it goes it's masturbation I was like oh okay now it makes sense as an adult this makes sense to me in a normal way the only metaphor has to do with that that's so insane yeah so now I'm starting to look at all that shit from an adult remove point of view with an insider's knowledge of it right oh it's so fun to do it on stage when you can make a crowd who doesn't know anything about Judaism understand it and fucking laugh at it Wow yeah I'm really having fun now that's awesome yeah that sounds exciting mm-hmm I want to see her say you you going up tonight no I'm flying home tonight I will be back July in July I think I'm running a preview show hey you're talking about that because we had always talked about that like years and years ago like you should I'm talking about the nonstick I wasn't good enough yeah I wasn't good enough that's it and so that I'm trying to cover all the subjects too so it's like it's not it's weird because I'm not just like building an hour and also I'll get inspired by something else a homeless guy knew sometimes feeding rats outside my fucking building literally luring rats into my fucking building anyway so this bits like that I want to do but like this won't go in the hour was it a homeless guy that was doing after a while oh my god it's so fucking hard enough there's campaigns all over the city stuff in trash cans we need to work together to get rid of rats it's impossible you can lose their numbers you've seen the Netflix thing right on rats you haven't seen them no oh you poor rats in New York oh it's the worst part of that city it's in st. this documentary is insane you watch that documentary you have a whole new understanding of what you're dealing with there's like a little tiny army of creatures that live amongst the New Yorkers that outnumbers in New Yorkers there's more lots a lot and they're smart and they showed how you it's hard it is to kill them because they send dumb young ones out and to eat the poison first and they die and then they avoid it I'm there's many of thinking of getting a cat from my backyard this is it dude and it follows these exterminators cats are good dude cats will help a lot but no way to hear a cat but they've got us pissed all over the piss everyone want a bar a cat for like a week they'll piss all over you you are your yard I'll smell funky but they will kill a lot of these fuckers but the thing is many not gonna kill them all you just not I was walking down the mill the street the middle of 12th Avenue 12th Street this there was a botfly that was in one of them they have all had parasites tell us the story you were walking down the middle of the street not on the sidewalk down the millah street off to the cellar late one night like 2:30 3:00 in the morning and this cop pulls up behind me and was like what and I fuckin moved over he said what do you do good on the sidewalk it was like earlier moved to New York it's like there's rats on the sidewalk and I can't because I think they put the fucking trash out so you're this small space let's go in and the trash starts to move and rustle and it's a fucking rat or more and they just dart in front of you one hit my foot once one of them right in my foot I don't text and walk anymore I fucking keep my eye on him at all time so I'm walking the street and I fucking yelled list level sorry I get into it when I talked myself by yell do this level with a cop I can't just fucking rat who's like oh right just let me go in the marula Street something shouldn't move with and it does that fuck an ivy vine by the store full of rats just start moving you feel like you're tripping on shrooms yeah it's creepy that little vine that's a creepy-ass vine anyway so I bits like that that I put aside I do sometimes but the rest is like I gotta cover this hour I could cover all the deets I can't leave anything out yeah ya can't leave anything out so it's like yeah that shit sounds perfect for like how much to build in yeah you uh we always talked about that stuff but it's cool now that you you yeah but let me get it away a little better as a comic 10 years later well you know I think it's also learning how to write things I don't put them in order you know how to move stuff around and how to set it up when you're talking about something that's act crazy what do you think of it now like now that you know so much about it and you've been and whatever you would consider self agnostic or an atheist yeah for so long what do you think it originally was what do you mean like what started all those religious writings and teachings what do you what do you think they were do you think there's you man teach people whether like the tour or the Talmud yeah there's a way to cut your group going and then you make laws on how to live inside your group so it's just a section of laws really okay really how'd they agree all your drivers agreed that this well they sir bhai is really interesting because they take this if I told you this the Baha'i faith they take the similarities between all religions like do not kill is almost in all of them so they go that must be a truth straight from God and they've the churches sort of disseminate and made them weird yeah the church is what like you take molded those towards your own like its population so like it Christians the fucking with some of the weakest ones so they can't eat meat the whole Lent and they go well we don't like that they go fuck if how about just no meeting on Friday and they go alright well except that for a while and it's fucking weak-ass and non-religious people and they go well that's - how about I just give up something and the church is like well either we're gonna lose you or we'll give in some of them there's no give they're just like this is the rule right there new you're out right yeah like some of them changed holidays yes but you do it to control your own population with laws to help I mean don't kill it helps you live as a society so you might be okay with each other so bhai takes this similar to all of them and so like don't kill the story of the flood that's a real similar thing in lots of religions so that must be a real thing that happened hmm and then the donee Pig is like nah that's just a jew thing don't worry about that I think that's a trichinosis thing that's not the ya know I think that's what it origin right maybe yeah I think they were dying from and also the shellfish thing because of red tide because they didn't know when to accurately predict you know certain times of year shellfish are absolutely toxic oh really yeah yeah I don't know when it is when it what's I always wanted to know what it is but you can't get like clams and mussels from certain beaches during certain times of the year you can because it's tough so humanity that's why I could have started for sure rabbis would tell me the reason we don't eat pig is because God said right and that's the end of it well I think that they probably ate it and probably try to eat it raw and people got deathly ill and children died no that's what I think you know whenever and like don't after enough in many generations they don't say why I took our God you know here's the Sun God as a phenomenon caused by algebra which algae becomes so numerous they discolor ba-ba-ba-ba-ba the release toxins that may cause illnesses and humans or other animals huh so this is for whatever it is it gu red tide shellfish i'm just trying to figure out why you're not is it red tide shellfish air I think they might be talking about a slightly different thing nopes the same stuff so consumption of shellfish that are contaminated by the toxins can cause neurotoxic shellfish poisoning NSP symptoms usually appear when a couple of hours of eating contaminated shellfish and they last for a few days so that is red tide so most likely something like that I could say that is a reason why they should not eat shellfish and trichinosis is really common in pigs because they eat everything me who hats pigs eat everything they can they eat ground nesting birds yeah it for sure see that's why that's why I started up that and obviously like don't fucking know his wife decided move yeah it's like we're all be fighting Scott says don't do that yeah God says stop fucking everybody yeah yeah there's the some of them that are real universals right they travel from every religion it's like people figured out rules that you should operate by to have a harmonious existence with your name yeah yeah but then other ones it's just ridiculous now that I'm step back and now someone asked me about Santa mark oh just our laughing about what the purpose was and how it looks from the outside we've talked about the one that's in the Old Testament where God sends a bunch of bears down to kill kids because you're making fun of this guy being bald what really I don't even know that's a crazy thing this is one of the best ones ever like I these kids are taunting this guy I'm calling them bald and so God sends these bears these guys doing God's work and God protects his people uh-huh God sends some fucking she bears to eat these kids dude it's the creative second right here it is Elisha the two bears make that a little bigger for my shitty from prophets yeah this is their the way it's described is hilarious whereas it off your bald head yeah that is it go up this is what they're saying go up you bald head to him when he looked behind him and saw them he cursed them in the name of the Lord all caps then two female bears came out of the woods and tore up 42 lads of the number anyway that is fucking insane you're supposed to read into that yeah so now here's the actual thing so like some shit was happening maybe maybe a different time maybe not Bigfoot and then fucking bears killed a bunch of these people that happened yeah kind of read in to why for sure definitely people got killed by bears but this lived inside a whale yeah and they didn't say miracle on that they just said the way later but didn't fuckin swallow and he was just there like the Pelican what the fuck yeah just was operating from not an understanding of how things work yeah like when they made star wars in fucking what's name was shooting that rudder mm-hmm it was just open to space because we didn't know yet they're like oh that'll just kill you yeah you can't just have open to space you need like a barrier there yeah that would be like 250 degrees below zero just like it's an open window he's firing out yeah you can't do that but we didn't know any met it's like nuts out that's right what are you just live inside a whale like if you're in space and someone breaks the window imagine if you're in some sort of what because you know that remember that alien that one alien movie oh yeah the bullet hole in the butt what's his face Bezos is gonna offer flights to space do you know that right like I'm a 2019 that's a good question I saw two days ago I went into a launch we should be willing to pay would you really pay 10 grand yeah 10 grand 20 I think I think 20 grand the first number the Kennedy - 50 but that's a lot of these a lot yeah but for the experience I might better be good though yeah it's cancer we get up and go back now you're right what if it's fucking lame you gotta take 10/10 number one Flat Earth conspiracist you should be the first one to go for sure and you got to tell everybody man you gotta be willing to tell tell me what you see tell everybody it's a ball it's a ball there is no rocket it is all CGI everything is artificial we live it it's been proven we live in a hologram hey what questions you're asking about Anthony Bourdain but I wanted to talk to you about suicidal thoughts because you are out of the people that didn't kill themselves as with the one who knows the most about it and you've experienced pression yeah you know and when I wasn't close with the anthony bourdain but i really liked him alone oh you bet I'm going I'm with you once yeah when I hung out with him I really enjoyed it I did a show we did an episode of his show in Montana we went camping together no real I got fucked up by a campfire yeah it was great we had a great great old time it was really fun but I was stunned when that happened and I mean I don't uh I just wanted to know like when you were at your worst when you were having like really shitty feelings like what could have been anything that someone could have done that could have helped you oh yeah I think about this too I lost a friend of suicide it was like see how you want to stop like what what what could you do right yeah I mean sometimes just helpful got me into a therapist that fucking I couldn't afford I mean I've told you this before I probably on here that was like a physical thing to do but just getting me to go to accept like that maybe it'll work but I I knew when I was talking to you that is a hard thing for you to talk about so if you're bringing it up it's a real real issue yeah yeah it's your stoic yeah you're you're not you don't complain about that I'm not happy with my negative stuff he's down sort of so I remember we were playing pool and I was like what's matter like there's something going on sense it right yeah it was like you just seem like just unhappy or and so once we got you into that psychiatrist and then dude you popped out of that thing like a fucking spring under the right pills yeah and running like anybody thinks that pills are all bad I don't think anything's all anything yeah I think I know the black and white problem where they're people like I've talked to Benjy one seems like they're over prescribing doesn't like they work for me and he's sake well I probably did and I'm like no no no just because you think they're over prescribing doesn't mean they should never prescribe right it's there's stuff that works and sometimes it works enough for you to just change your way of looking at the world and change your reality and then you eventually weaned yourself off of them which is really interesting well it's a sprain of the brain muscle it's what's happened I don't it's not like a physical like pull like that but that's really what it is just a sprain and so like until you get off it to get on a cast of some way it's gonna be real hard for it to heal mmm you know this is thing so far this metaphor works no that doesn't stop but I think it works in the most effective cases it's um yours of medication so these pills act as a cast and then at some point you're healed and you don't need them anymore but the problem is the only way to really know is if you just go off and run on it and then you're looking off fuck I'm still hurt yeah and during that get off and run on at time is when your suicidal thoughts shoot up if they were going to so when they do we knew off they're like you need to keep up with me like anything salt you get you need to call me immediately you get you right back on like was interesting with you is your weaning off coincided with a huge success in your career yeah I got off um I know where I got off on was my second apartment in New York so this was three and a half years ago four years ago maybe around the show this is not happening is already on Comedy Central hmm things are going things are going your tours kicking ass everything's great and then you even released my first hour and then my second hour yeah and you were a legit success yeah everything I was getting you were on billboards yeah so I'll be on that I was oh I mean more importantly was I was a working comic I was like oh I can make a real living at this now yeah for the first time so that was like the best part yeah and that hadn't been going on very long right well it was a heart it's fucking the people don't know people don't know it's a fucking crazy struggle the struggle from open mic er to successful working comedian and everybody's different everybody's got their own weirdness that they have to overcome yeah but it's a long ass bloody struggle that's by the way that's why I hate this infighting in comedy it's terrible and it's like you're doing this wrong you're doing it just it's the guys we're all up against the most monumental odds yeah so you write safe to shave show jokes and this guy writes dick jokes like whatever that's just that predispositions but like it's hard we're all in the same boat yeah anyway yeah I agree man and and that that it didn't it's very rarely been the case in the history of comedy that everybody kind of got along and just accepted the fact that everybody does things differently and I make not don't make a big deal out of it you know who'd have to have factions inside of our yeah it's a if you want to have a safe space show I guess yeah people don't want to hear shit like that it's okay that's fine to have everything he put just so everyone's defensive every wants to hold their ground and stand up for their position on things it's like okay you gonna be fine everyone's gonna be it's the best time to be the best time ever Ilya just kick ass just writing just go out there and do it yeah and then it got better but a lot of that was that focus I was able to get because of these it was Brep know I try wellbutrin the problem is some of these pills like the side effects are not worth it hmm so what I tell people like you someone had a problem once of like anxiety you so if I don't care about this shit Nick Youssef and um and he's right now planning on bombing at Embassy and it was like he didn't wanna go on it cuz was afraid it would make him like a zombie and I'm like okay if it does just go back off it so you don't have to commit forever right you know I mean just see what the effects are so on I think wellbutrin I couldn't come ooh it was fresh and I I wouldn't even say was any sort of psychic or anything cuz I didn't know about that as a side effect until I was happening with my girlfriend at the time and I was like what I was like three times in a row is like it couldn't come and then she was like oh maybe it's those pills I'm like why really and then I look times like oh yeah fucking annoying annoying thing that's super annoying there was this one called REM Ron think about don't mention so much in there and I'll think of something that gets in there and fixes this with like you want to take that away yeah I'm think it's like you edit your own component taking those it's almost like you edit your own opera member whenever a PC you get into dass so the side effect on Remeron and these side effects don't hit everybody the same and what you're looking to fill in isn't it all the same so don't just get what somebody else gets you got to talk to the therapist but like Remeron gave me hyper faiza o which is the inability to be feel full well so they said expect to gain fifteen percent of your body weight and I could eat dude if I got high I could eat like eight plates of spaghetti I mean I would eat out my whole apartment holy shit everything it got to the point where I was like well I got one bag left some peanut butter and some a little bit of Cheerios and fucking let's do this it was it was glorious but that it wasn't helping me that was a problem that was a side effect because I was thin then I could have dealt with I could be 15 pounds overweight instead of 10 pounds underweight but like it didn't help me mentally hmm so then it's a knock and then I finally got on one desipramine that was like then it worked I was like boom I'm out I get it I'm free now a little bit but low blood pressure so sometimes I stand up I gotta hold on to something and like it's not fuckin faint but it barely ever happens totally worth it hmm and that still happens now when I get high ah but like do you get like dizzy lightheaded yeah I stand up in my car hold on yeah or early or something like that or if I'm getting sick that'll happen but I used to get that in high school too yeah I think I'm already predisposed to it but they made it a little worse not not a big deal though so I finally found the one that worked for me but it's hard and if you're not having it your brain is lying to you or it's giving you a version of reality that's like I mean I saw this last night coming home from the airport from Burbank Airport and some lady picked up in an uber picked up a guy on the wrong side of the fence and she was sorry it's my first time here but like it's one of those little offenses you can just step over almost you know and he's like well everyone else is going here and she's like yeah sorry it's my first time with the Burbank Airport I can and you could walk ten seconds to where it's an opening hmm and he's like pop the trunk pop the trunk please and I'm like oh you're cranky from flying I know what that is yeah and so your version of this reality is this is a way worse thing than it really is yeah Steve Simone who never gets upset which no big deal I'll just come around yeah and then it's over yeah it's the same thing with talking to Fitzsimmons like you can just not punch somebody and then forget about it yeah but you know if you're if you're thinking that angrily love him it's really affects you and this shit makes you think the worst of everything Wow it's like yeah no matter what it is a little worse than it should be that's an interesting way of looking at it yeah and it just gets tiring after a while and the suicidal thoughts start happening when you're like I can't do this anymore you know is it its effort it's mental effort to just like it just keeps it's like you got a rock on you that you're pulling up pushing off you at all times and you just need the game to be over you just need a sleep feel Vani to have a bit about a thing probably doing a special or something right now but it was like if we want that deep sleep that deep sleep like that's what it is where you just want to sleep forever you just weighed down by it all the time yeah it's like you know how they used to like get people to give false confessions by just keeping him awake for like 30 straight hours yeah until I eventually like that they don't know how to say no the fine I did it and stuff they didn't do they weren't anywhere near it yeah but they're saying yes I murdered somebody let me sleep it's just a version of that you know where you're just like he's just so sick of it after a while oh I will tell you that they have read about it and they say the people who talk about suicide are sort of different the people who are thinking about it quietly who came quietly is way way more often to commit it I think they say the people talking about is a way to seek help so what can you do the question was what could you do to help people is there anything that anybody could have done no it used to make me mad when you told me just get outta bed do some exercise I was like huh I was like you don't get it you don't get it I definitely don't get it yeah Shandra understood it once she was like talking about that she was like like he didn't understand you can't even go to your fridge like exercise is not even it's just so far from like nothing no way mmm I couldn't even get out of bed what do you think was you were also taking propecia then it had anything to do with it it's one night event I sure might of I mean it was right around then and I think I'm trying to think if I was quitting right then on it and switch into the fucking spread on stem cell research what but I think it was either on it or or getting off it you know for sure for sure could add something to do with that yeah I think so too it was also a live-in girl I mean there were so many things right on that so all it takes is a sprain so like here's the weird thing let's say you lost your job and it sends you in a depression it's not that it's not related to something a lot of times it will be related something a mom dies or dad dies but let's say the job situation because you can change this right if your dad dies you'll never get them back you know it feels bad and so like it should feel bad you lose your job you go into depression but now you get a better job you know I mean not that you will but let's just say you did the depression remains the cause of the depression is necessarily gone you're doing better than the thing that made your depressed but you're still depressed because that brain is sprained so you need a way to fight it and pills don't work for everybody so it's fucking disheartening and getting the right but I had a therapist say well I was like this this one pill is not working - Wow I don't let's tell you and I was like and in my head I was just like okay I accept it all work up the courage eventually and that'll be the end of it I was like well I'm not gonna fight you on it I don't want to fight this in the first place it's not gonna work how she was the worst what was it like to get pulled out of the clouds like when the pills that you two were working at first it it's like you don't trust that it's gone it's like right when the hiccups leave you still feel like you're are the hiccups right you know but like a way longer version of that and then what happens weird is you start to miss it ooh because it became so much of your reality and who you were that like it's this thing that's been pulled away from you a part of you is gone hmm so it's weird that you're like missed this horrible way of being because you had to figure out a way to like make it positive at this and you see this a lot in like PC culture we start sort of bragging about your victimization of the things have happened to you but like it's a way to stand out mmm be a special so you end up propping the the negative up instead of instead of saying yeah that was shitty you know we started almost like bragging about it all right so you start feeling like well at least I'm different so that can prop you up a little at least I'm unique in this thing of like doesn't seem like anyone else is having these suicidal thoughts you know it's almost like if you're only only one into a band you feel better than if everyone else into that same band band is the album is the album but you like it more because you're the only one right right we start do dissing your own uniqueness it's like so at maybe it was that I'm not really sure but when I was out of it that was missing it a little bit and then followed by a fear that it's gonna come back because regular decades that's a terrible word depression because it also means just I'm depressed today right clinical depression is different but overlaps you know it doesn't just go away right if I'm depressed because I'm cranky I gotta tell myself don't be cranky say five things you're thankful for you should be out of it got some sunshine you're fine this is like deeper so like then when you do get depressed like let's just say I haven't been outside all day he's been raining for two straight days you know he just a little like blue mm-hmm you're like oh fuck is it back you know and then when it's gone in a day like but when it's like two days like fuck fuck fuck don't come back Wow yeah but the so a bat like a bad weather day could set it off a little bit you know that just gives like a normal depression that everybody gets right that's I think that really should be two separate terms feeling blue feeling blue yeah well you get you haven't been on stage in four days I feel a little blue if I if I I don't know if I haven't got my underwear out all day so I can't live in Vancouver yeah exactly yeah those people get the press they don't got signed Seattle they don't get outside well they get outside where they get rained on yeah so it's just like you just feeling down I remember we dumped in and I were filming something up there we were doing that Bigfoot episode on we were talking this guy was a cop was like the security guy for the set and he was like dude it fucking wears on ya yeah he was he was at the end of like the rainy season it was just starting to get warm again where's Anya that New York my first New York winter was this one and it it wasn't so much middle of March I was like whatever I could I could take it I took the winter yeah it was middle of April where I'm like enough already I put in the three or four months oh so they want though what the thing is you could do what you want you could leave yeah I could leave I what skiing a lot of 16 is a skiing this yeah when did that around like Road dates that's what's crazy about like somewhere like Denver uh-huh like it's sunny sunny it's great it's great so much better when it's sunny it's cold out but it's tough it's sunny like if you have to pick warm and cloudy all the time or cold and sunny I take cold and sunny all day long yeah for sure all day long sunny sunny yes I'm skiing outside in the Sun when it's like wow it's 25 degrees but it's just you don't even walk it around yeah it's brisk out but look how pretty the sky is blue blue sky and fluffy clouds did you know Anthony Bourdain was was depressed no I heard with him a little it was a mixture of mixing drugs extreme pills him an alcohol I believe he was on some sort of malaria medication which is dangerous if some people get silent people get violent I've seen people on malaria medication while they were drinking and I'd hold the guy back from attacking or porter or was at least worried about him attacking a reporter house as a friend of mine is a very kind friend of mine who I don't think would ever in normal life attack a person physically and it seemed like it makes you think not even normal he was squirrely um it was he had to go to Africa he had he had a visit somewhere in Africa and he had to take these pills you know and some of them have violent reactions to people you're not supposed to drink on him first of all and he was drinking it's mixing yeah and you know if that's what he was doing and he's mixing that with alcohol who fucking knows so that could have had one port and where it might not have been long-term depression but I know they they're Studies on people who've got a concussion in football practice and then hung themselves that night oh yeah no history of it but right then everything I mean it's almost like you're on psychedelics where this new reality is real feels real so I the question is is there something you could have done dude I don't know I don't know what the right I've thought about it I don't know what the right thing is cuz you you push away people's help right I saw somebody posts on Facebook once where was like one of the worst things like depression is everybody going Nikki I've been through that too it's like now I'm not even unique give me my props for my individual stuff yeah so then it's like you want to help by somebody's done yeah I've been through this but it's like not even helping them but like mm-hmm okay so who the fuck knows what they're feeling right that's the other thing about a person's feelings what they're feeling it's very personal it's just impossible to describe oh by the way I had moderate depression that's where that therapist said what you saw was moderate depression Jesus I don't know what severe depression looks like Jesus so I don't know man I don't know I lost somebody too and I don't know if I could have said something or like you know um Anthony liked to drink he drank a lot yeah and watching him over the last four years like you could see he'd seemed like he had been living a hard life you know like you looked like it on television - he'd been living a hard life I mean he was out there hitting it traveling from country to country constantly drinking constantly alcohol is a depressant it is if you drink alcohol all the time you're not gonna come out of it with a sunny disposition is the president it is a depressant I mean you can definitely do it and pull it off and we do and you know occasionally you'll have a couple of drinks then the next day you won't but if you're doing that all the time if you're doing it every day five days a lot of people use that because it's a short-term relief from depression long-term depressant so a lot of people use alcoholism to cover up the depression and then when they get clean suddenly all this shit they're supposed to have been dealing with is now still there and not being covered up by alcohol yeah yeah there's like a fun that comes with a couple of drinks there's a fuck it's fun fuck it let's stop worrying you know it spends how addicted yeah I can't I wish I could do that with cigarettes when everybody's smoking yeah go right back to a pack so do you do you do you think like fuck what could I have done no because I wasn't close enough to him and I wasn't there if I was there I would be tortured by it yeah if I was there and I was hanging out with them and it happened in I don't see you tomorrow and then he I was in tortured but yeah that would then with anybody you know it's just such a crazy decision to make the decision to stop living when so many people loved you and you have this crazy life that it's the bravest thing to me yeah I can't imagine something it's it's that's the only thing that held me back is just a lack of courage to be like just do it you think DNA is telling you but stop and think about you what you've doing that you've become wildly successful you know yeah and way happier and you know you're having a great fucking time how about a great time dude I haven't the architect of my own happiness and it is fucking I'm doing it well you're doing it the way you're supposed to do it but you're you know you've been doing it like this for several years now and if you I guess it really doesn't matter in the end but if you end your own life you'd have never experienced all this true if you go back out to it again it's interesting you were at like a tipping point man you're this like weird tipping point and you just went that way and you're free just took a while struggle but you you were free I find when talking to comics other comics now I feel a little guilty you know for success around around people that are also quite funny who don't have it and what I found is that it's you get this frustrating point running around eight nine ten twelve years of comedy where like your skills have gotten better and your monetary career has not gotten better who's your artistic career is booming and then you're just not even making a living and it's the most frustrating because like I'm finally good at open mic level like I ever make a good joke that's a win and so yeah I made a good joke tonight this week or one time this month you know but like there it's like I'm doing so well on stage I'm killing why am i why am I still working this day job why am I not even ever on TV why am i you know it's real frustrating might have been around that time to was getting frustrated with like you know I was less hacky but also just not succeeding yeah interesting how the Internet's changed everything or fur you can support people so much easier before it was like you had the man show you could hire a writer mm-hmm and that's it that's the only help you could do for someone yeah you know take a couple people on the road with you yeah but then it's like hey go watch this guy show hey this guy's got a new special hey check out something's got in a book you know changes everything yeah people are going it's literally no skin off your back yeah it's like whatever well it's great yeah actually it's good like I if Tom Papa asked me to promote something he's doing I want people to go see him it's good it's good for me I want him to do good because I like listening to him I like watching them so I'm not to make more comedy oh yeah then you win because I guess you more comedy person gets to stay in it nothing he needs us but I and also with Tom when you tell people about someone who's really funny whether it's you or whoever it is then they trust you I want to see that guy's a fucking hilarious like both they know that you're telling the truth like if I tell them hey Joey Diaz the funniest guy that's ever lived and you go see him at the ice house one night and come out of it you you're bleeding you know your internal bruising laughing I love guaranteeing people on Twitter or whatever it's like you don't know I guarantee you we'll have a great night there's someone who's an awesome comic just just there's no like oh my friend it's like just they'll be great yeah there's there's people that you could do that with but yeah there was not you know before I was like young on The Tonight Show you know I did a Letterman people talked about you had a build up places you had to travel to places all the time so those people would come back yeah every time they came back you better have some new shit dude I really gotta think about it I like when you start seeing that depression of people like what can anybody do is there anything anybody could do it's like just a little bit like being there for you sometimes is like helpful just be like hey man you're just you're a good friend I know you're going through something but just know that I like you just like a little bit and don't require anything of them mm but I guess everybody be different too but like I don't know you don't know everybody's on a different trip that's the thing it's like no one knows what anyone is feeling telling somebody get over it is not the way to do it that's that ain't gonna help the tough love thing it's like that doesn't work and that works for fucking nothing I don't know what it works for but not that works for lazy people yeah it works for them it's um I don't even think it works for them I think that gets people to move sometimes but it doesn't change the way they think about what they're doing they just get forced into do yeah yeah yeah no it's like the argument well I was gonna say but it's you you want them to act and so they act because of force of your your will right scare I'm into it yeah but if you inspire someone and say to him listen I know you're looking at this way but this is why this is gonna hurt you by approaching it this way you're gonna do the same thing but instead of approaching it the way you're approaching it stop and just for a shift of perspective think about in a positive way like you could do that to people and sometimes you can actually shift yeah they look at something cuz a lot of times it's the way you're approaching something that's pissing you off about it right and the way to get food sometimes to people is not to tell them this is the way you should do it but just to paint the picture and let them make their own decision yeah to be like oh so you're happy when you're run yeah okay is it is it warm out oh it is okay I don't know you're less happen you don't run all right well it was like instead of book you got to get out there and run I you know I have kids raising kids one of the things that I learned that works really good as anytime they do anything I tell them I fucked up way worse than you I don't use word fuck what I said whatever you've done I've messed up way more like everybody yeah don't worry about it this is a part of being a kid and I'm super proud of you for admitting that you made a mistake or that you did this this is great because this is how you learn you're not supposed to know everything you're eight years old are you're 10 years old you're supposed to be learning learning about life and people are supposed to be talking about various things you encounter you're not supposed to already know everything you're a little kid this is great so we learn something that we don't want to do anymore this is great this is an awesome opportunity and nobody I wish somebody talked to me like that and I'll tell them that too I go because I get called stupid and yelled at or whatever whatever the fuck it was when I did something that's how people talk to kids back then they didn't you know it's not even anybody's fault someone does something dumb you know in the 1960s or something like that they threw things at them you know like my parents would tell me about things across the room at them yeah people would stop they just fucking their little the kids were animals back then - yeah you know people are different yeah yeah so I might be that like something help me I don't know if people are listening they're going through it or whatever but like some things that have helped that I was able to take was I had one therapist said one good thing where he's like I'm imagine the good things out of the depression yeah instead of looking at his only negative what's it helped you with and then I was like well I'll try and I was like I'm looking at my stand-up material more realistically and darker and that's actually helpful on stage he's like alright cool that's one good thing out of this and then it just like sorta it might just help you like it's not all bad adjust the way you approach it yeah another thing was say five things and just in the shower whenever you do shower say five things out loud that you're thankful for don't not to be monumental stuff just like it's 75 today that's good I got a new bar soap that's cool my friend John you know whatever Brian I like him that's cool glad I have that in my life just five things to say it out loud and then after a while sometimes that that ended up like affecting my mood hmm you know where instead of fuck because that was the problems the focus I don't know if I ever told you it was a negative things yeah sort of be like a 75 degree day this is the example I use a lot 75 degrees and sunny fucking everyday in LA you know and I would be like instead of going like this is fucking rad it's February you know twelve and I'm fuckin in shorts this is great instead of focusing on that I would focus on like fuck I got my car has no gas I gotta fucking go kick gas I hate having to fucking get gas you got to pull over and so then I'm only focusing on this fucking one-minute chore but I have to do instead of on all the good stuff and so you just focus it just makes you focus on this negative it's just like can't pull out of it so anything you can do to like shift the focus to the positive is helpful do you know Tony vias stand-up comic from Bob oh yeah so since I've heard of them very very funny guy said something me once about he was driving from New York to Boston back and forth like multiple times in a week yeah yeah I go dude that's long that's a long-ass drive and he goes yeah but I just goes in and I just tell myself this is what I'm doing right now right I just do it yeah and but I thought about that I go yeah why don't you just do that just say this is what I'm doing right now instead of like going fuck can't believe I Drive this thing yeah so fucking long and what if I fall so how do you make yourself think about it positively fucking hard somebody when I told all my normal core people about like certain commercials and then they're like how does it work and I'm like any of an agent given ten percent like well he doesn't go the auditions don't you hate cameo ten percent yeah and you probably got this too from people and you're like no I'm thinking like that it's like I wouldn't get the auditions without him you know sums nothing compared to what he does you want a bunch of people to understand so it's like don't focus on the negative shit focus on the 90 percent like I wasn't even like 20 feet sounds like what's not even thinking like oh that's such a sucky thing well he just had a great way of approaching it yeah this is what I'm doing right now so this is what I'm doing if you can emulate those people it's hard to believe it's not like them then it's like help you yeah move the needle a little bit you know so maybe that one day you're like fuck it this is the boulders too hard today mm-hmm maybe if you got like one nicer thing there like I can withstand it and that was the day you were gonna commit suicide maybe it'll just like last you through there's a culture of attacking and trying to destroy people today that didn't exist before that can affect a mood yeah I think we're seeing that with people in the news when people do like the thing about that lady and the little kid the little eight-year-old just calling the cops on him uh-huh other thing that bummed me out the most is that they didn't accept your apology yeah that's a come on that's the thing about me out so what she did was gross for sure yeah but we want people to just suffer forever like the pain that lady must have felt from all those thousands of emails and hate tweets she got from ratting out that little kid yeah no no you don't have to pile on he knows she's God yeah she got it she got and this is good for everybody that's good for everybody but you know what else is good for everybody forgiveness yeah forgiveness is good if someone yeah just you say we forgive you it's I you know you were wrong so nobody locked up and she probably didn't know she fucked up and she probably was hormonal and she's probably not you know not thinking so good and ya know you said you said you're sorry it's all bad she shoulda never done that and who knows if she would have not even to everybody she said it to the people and hate one on one I'm sorry I did that was my bad yeah yeah you people you kind of gotta let people learn and grow you know I don't accept your apology also it's like nothing happened to a daughter right she didn't get arrested is it creepy experience feel okay yeah and me really is yeah imagine some fuck you accept your apology fucking pro-wrestling sighs white lady and with that old lady after that after the court trial and she punched out of the lady in the face oh yeah that was a good way she was like your daughter didn't she's like fuck y'all right rub it in right now so you're sorry yeah be a positive winner yeah yeah accept an apology of the loser yeah man it's just people aren't here for that long and mr. Ronda Rousey was garbage too and that lady was like hey I'm saw a good fight she's like fuck off get out talk about my family it's like you're white trash well she's a super winner those super winners is take me down a notch I'd heard if you lose a game or if Michael Jordan lose a game of pool to you we wouldn't talk to you for two weeks really that's crazy if you heard that you've heard shit like that right where's crazy giant pants just in case someone ever wants to play one-on-one he could pull those fucking pants off you can go yeah that rumor he's the bet with the race well he wears giant ass pants used to those are pull away pants he's ready to fucking so competitive Hughes to bet with the rest of the team whose bag was gonna come out first like a hundred bucks or a thousand bucks and then pay the fucking later pay the people at the airport like hey when my back comes you need to let it come off first I want to win that fucking bet oh he rigged the system yeah yeah he was a degenerate gambler or still is yeah with hundreds of millions of dollars which is a crazy combination why they killed his father that was the rumor right a lot of people say that that's so scary fast true yeah didn't steal anything from him they just killed him that is so scary people I why don't they kill Jordan because I'm they don't get their money Jesus Christ yeah did they ever catch the guy who killed his dad I don't believe they did they did you figure this young guys in jail once somebody was contacting me about this guy from jail no they spoken to him in jail about this if there's a mafia hitman or you think it was a dude if you watch wild wild country it's the best holy shit okay when you're one or two episodes into that I'm at four episodes in look at perfect perfect perfect so you can get this how much of you thinks Oh Duncan could start one of these a thousand its own peace and happiness and fucking wearing the same shit it's a great dude I was talking like these people seem cool I was talking to my friend Todd and he was like dude I I wanted to live I wear red it was like the first episodes of Sons of Anarchy they seem like they're happy they are happy they're having a good old time the Duplass brothers made that those guys are bad I'm yeah yeah that's an amazing documentary it's fucking it's right the story is so insane while I'm watching I'm like how the fuck did I not know I don't know about it it was so good that I thought it was a work for a while I was like I think they might be faking this Oh God so I didn't see Tom Brokaw talking about it you know I call right I guess I guess it's happened I got a friend mine and his girlfriend's parents were in that group really yeah and they still they still follow that guy's teachings they still believe in him the Mogwai osho osho his name was they it wasn't Margaret's grandma this is a picture that I had of him that I put up on my Instagram page of him holding this white guy's head and this guy's like coming in his pants I was one Riki's pose like oh this up Jamie I love it he's just play like you could have money you can have nice things yeah 22 fuckin rolls-royce 22 vs. look at this oh look at the guy the guy they go I'm a why are you touching your so whites he's touching both of them at the same time left handling the dude right hand the girl he's like transmitting through them who they're giving them orgasms look at him he's like oh oh my god they believed in it man fucking go ahead go ahead and piss the crease have you seen any of this Jamie I think it turned it on and fell asleep and how dare you you believe that shit dude it's fucking amazing man I'm I'm on Episode four now and I don't want to give anything away and in terms of like how it goes down but it literally keeps ramping up and getting more and more fucking insane i I'm like what Ari said I can't believe I didn't hear about this how do we know about Jonestown everybody knows don't drink the kool-aid or was this this is an Oregon outside of Antelope Oregon dude I mean I don't want to I can't give too much away but these people bought a town they bought the whole town they got a police force do they have their own police force what are the odds that something like that is going on now it's super low it's super low because what this is is they would the government had stepped in and realized that there's some shenanigans going on and they were essentially there was no separation of church and state because the church was the state right they had a government and police force that was run by the church they called it to peace force and the whole cult basically ran the town except for a few diehards who didn't want to give their houses up so there were some folks who had been living in Antelope their whole life they didn't give their houses up and they're telling the story and there did not care for it it's fucking amazing man up so jealousy of having not seen the whole thing a sex cult and there's another one right this is a different ones one with the actress that got yeah Hilary so that's is that's a similar type cult things that deal with that actress I don't know that you've really recruit people knowing it was a sex cult I don't know if that's the same thing right as many people I don't know much about this sex cult thing with that actresses I cannot go in the whole story she was our branding they were branding people but she was she was a part of it she was recruiting people and take a lead oddly this is what they're charging away I feel like there's more to the story than I can tell I don't know man but it's weird that people are so susceptible to cults and that we protect people from cults but don't protect people from religions it's the same sure the only difference is this one guy is banging all these people and we got to stop that Wells under that alone you know there was sex crimes there was like tundra King and there was there was there was illegal things that were done in this particular one from what I've read I don't know too much about it but then when you go to that Osho guy and it seemed except for church and state see the thing is the church started running the police force all right remember and they had these guys walking around with fucking you know semi-automatic rifles and high-powered machine guns and shit it was very different it was like okay you've got a military force that's guarding this religiously none of that yeah so they have these police people at the compound in the hallways with machine guns these guys are playing assassin and they they are the police force they're not they're not a private exactly what's a call group I don't give anymore away by the way everything I've said is not gonna take anything away from sure with your girlfriend your boyfriend your wife or whatever to your neighbors with somebody together let's just like find somebody but let's watch it one episode every two days let's talk about it all right so fun I think an independent version of that is in little blips what goes on with Burning Man like this independent little blip of escape of norms of regular society and these people get there they wear fucking gas masks and fuck each other and go crazy and do cartwheels in the dirt and they hang out together for days and having a great time and they realize that people can at least in small bursts can establish these communities set up all this temporary art have a great time and everybody's like you know really like like-minded in other ways I'm going out in this one place well if that's if people want that the only difference between that and like a full-time community is that you would have to figure out a way to get everybody to get along forever okay just be a few days you'd have two great kids together get your food together do it by the food have a the jobs you have kyboots is a similar to that but if you try to do that today they would stop you or at least it would become a real issue like say if you decided you and Duncan got together and you two decided by 700 acres in Oregon and you found some place you could all Ford you did a Kickstarter and you guys set up a community out there you grew your own food you had your own well and everywhere and nobody could be married and you could fuck anybody you want this is how we live in ok that's how we live in and then you just you just rent and you like real loosely based rules hey when you eat something clean up your mess giant mess halls filled with people people of these houses all over this fucking ranch and you you basically established a village Wow you just can't go too far yeah but you start getting money from them mm-hmm then when some it breaks the real law like there's a rape or murder you'd have to be like now we need to call it yeah you have to cops the only way to keep it so fun so do that yeah you'd have to keep it legit yeah like you'd have to still be on this jurisdiction you'd have to make friends with the local sheriffs mmm yeah just like we're not we don't mean any harm but when we need you when something happens we'll call you but yeah otherwise we're not gonna need your much yeah we're just go up here banging each other ha yeah just I think saying at each other like crazy it's getting fucking wild up here son that's what we do it's legal right it's still even a fuck in America if I pay taxes yeah so my my my best buddy's wife can slap my ball ass fucking him yeah like okay that girl she likes to suck ball right next to the booty hole I think you'd run into problems people would decide that you shouldn't be living like that they don't want people that's with everything base it's with everything you're not living the way I live so I'm not gonna let anyone be into your shit yeah but it's always like one dude right that's running things and I'm one of those yes compounds and there's always like a main guy who fucks everybody fucks everybody's wife it's like fucking everybody want but you probably want to fuck me on the main there it's the only way to do it honestly is to do at Burning Man style this is my point is that Burning Man style would be no leader no leader yeah no leader so like-minded people no leader and you'd have to feed but the problem is charismatic people could co-op that they'd have these meetings one person takes over look what we need here some organization next you know he's the king yeah you know that's how people do or monkeys yeah if we could avoid that now your crave leader yeah yeah we'd have to somehow or another find a way to not manipulate the way the laws are they yeah they're not those sex cults but they are like everyone has a job we're all working for nobody makes money here already makes twenty bucks a week whatever it is you know room and board is paid for and that makes people feel really good yeah yes you're all doing an equal part yeah you one guy could be running the accounting for the thing one guy could be you know taking eggs you know one person takes care of the nursery of the kids but like everyone joins him do you ever see that a Werner Herzog movie life in the taiga it's called I think it's either called happiness happiness are happy happiness was a Todd Solondz movie that was right we're like the best that was crazy yeah it was crazy I think it's just called happy life in the taiga and it's about these people that live in Siberia they're like trappers and shit happy people they're like the happiest people on earth they're all like having a great time laughing and this is just how they live all the time and all they do is go fishing and hunting and travel life but they all get together and drink in the in these villages they have fucking dog sleds that are pulling them down the road and they're driving around on jet skis and this is how they live like they live in the fucking tundra dude it's madness out there they raise these dog out legs man they were the they were the happiest show exactly right there so there's a lesson in there you know I went to that cave or Ygritte fucked Jon Snow did you yeah you can't swim in here anymore because uh as a Fisher it broke I thought about jacking off and there was people around thought it'd be a thing to do yeah if you want to get arrested for something that's the thing to do you're like hey I'm a fan I'm a fan I'm a lousy old fan I'm a real fan I've read the books know where I'm supposed to come mmm you just get Osho to touch your head hey you know the bathroom where we think you know what is that cave that's some waterfall it's just some pieces show us pretty images look Jimmy's Jaime's eyes fuck with her Shawn that maybe we're gonna say how did you guys feel when I was going through all that like where it was effect on you guys I was very nervous yeah I was very nervous about you cuz I don't I didn't know what to do and I knew I could do I knew I could help you financially yeah I knew I could do that so I did that immediately but I didn't know what to do I don't I didn't didn't know what it feels like and I didn't know what would be the path to take but when you offered that you were having problems with your psychiatrist and the medication and I said okay well let me let me get a hold of Matt who I know will know the right people yeah I see people they don't tell me anything yeah you were like I it was like you were you're such a non complainer that I knew once I tell people this story but we're playing pool and our he's limping around the table I'm like what the fuck happened your leg man fucking spider bite or something I go what let me see your fucking leg and he pulls his pants up like I dude you got to go to the hospital right now you have a very bad staph infection and this could fucking kill you like come on you're joking I'm like I start unscrewing my cue I'm like we're going to the hospital it was so bad but the fact that you're so stoic you will you never complained once while you have this gigantic pus filled sac on your knees it was horrible the jukkalan video and they were he was like do you know that's there and he's like god it's parking you not me what so when you were when you were telling me that you were doing bad and it wasn't you weren't feeling good and you were you were telling me you were suicidal I was like okay stop we got a now this is we're gonna figure this out you know I don't know what to do yeah we're gonna figure this out it may be nervous because I was nervous that I wasn't gonna be there when you needed me to be there and you know and you I would just I just get the call just get the call yeah I mean as a friend that's the last thing you want to do is have some situation when you feel like maybe you could have called them and you could have made them feel better and you they would have just gotten over that hump yeah and then they would have been okay like you became okay man I mean you were my most depressed friend now you're probably one of my happiest friends even after I start seeing that guy it still took months yeah before finding the right pill and the right dosage and then he would talk to me every like 30 days or whatever it was yeah I remember you describing the process and one of the things that was disconcerting to me was how random it seemed to be what I mean which pills they chose and it's like they're guessing that's what seemed insane to me I felt like if you like say you know they got an infection they know which antibiotic works best on that infection boom they give it to you yeah but this one wasn't that cut-and-dry it was they were just trying stuff out on you yeah it's like oh you need ibuprofen you have an inflamed thing it'll take it down but they know generally yeah this is like there's from what I get it gather there's two things could be wrong with you you are there have too much dopamine too little dopamine too much something else or too little something else huh and so each of these pills I think they're into two categories or four categories and they that are that they either effect with your dopamine or they affect the other thing either limit it or push more in and then the other so they don't know which ones doing it to you first and then once they narrow that down they got to decide if it's like getting too much of it or too little if you're bipolars a separate thing they're just guessing and then while you take this shit you've added the horror bubble feelings and then added some awful side effect there's like a this is one of the things that I really wanted to point out when the one Roseann was gonna come on I wanted to really talk about medication and how we're asking this really you know she's an elderly woman yeah who's taking an incredible amount of medication she's taken a lot of shit she takes ambien every night she's drinking she's smoking pot and she's on a host of meds and these things are all doing battle in her head and you know she barely knows what the fuck she's saying some of the times she's saying it she's in ambien Hayes's in and out of it she's open about it you know she's like I need to get them to adjust my meds yeah but everybody's is attacking her like she can never recover she just feel righteous but it's weird because her resume was such a at the forefront of putting on like homosexuals into mainstream media you know she didn't give a shit and suddenly it's like gnats are gone for my joke and people like she wasn't joking like for sure she was joking whether or not you think she should have used those words and by the way that that lady does look fucking Jewish a shit that she was talking about but like you say it's not a joke let me just explain to everybody as a professional comedian as an expert in this when someone says this person looks like a mixture of this and this that is joke form that's not a that's a pure joke that's what that is you see that over and over again you see this person looks like this mixed with this this guy has a work ethic of this works with it that's a joke for that's clearly a joke yeah to say it's racist for whatever but say is not a joke you're being ridiculous yeah it's obviously a joke it just you can't say that joke yeah it's like it's not a joke cuz you can't say that joke yeah yeah a big joke but if she was black she'd be able to hit a joke easy like if Miss Pat said that joke yeah of Roseanne everybody be like ah she does look the plain water in any way from her fucking conservativeness yes in well she's also nutty as squirrel shit mm-hmm she just is and she likes to go on Twitter and talk crazy stuff and she had apologized waiting 200 times a day George Soros for calling him a Nazi and liked it so much in still continues to tweet she's tweeting like crazy it's all insane man you got it you got it if you do a network thing they got it they got your friends got to take away your Twitter and face all about shit I can't you can't use this um you just can't well you have got a hundred people work on that set they all actually they're gonna switch over to they're gonna call it some new show now all right the connors but by the way I don't think doing that yeah I don't think they should have fired her I really don't have this I think you got a letter apologize and you know she explains herself and you realized who she is and she's not terrible person she's not so easy to put somebody as one action this is something I read a biography of her conversations on song Sookie me and Mars leader that was like house arrest for 20 years she wasn't Nobel Peace Prize or Prize for writing and she was talking about the Burmese army who was torture her had uh you know killed and arrested forever a lot of her like colleagues and it was like look they're not all bad you can't make someone into one of their actions so just because even if you've committed murder one of the worst things you can do that is not who you are you're just someone who has committed murder she does now there's a certain point we've done so much murder that you now are really holy a murderer right but that's very rare what's much more common as someone who has killed somebody they're now no longer that person twenty years later of someone who kills you know and if to make somebody to one of their actions is it's dehumanizing to all of us it is and it's also there's targets where people see someone who like is a Roseanne who's like some sort of cultural icon and they like to shift it on them and attack them uh-huh they'd like to go after them when some there's been some transgression they've done something which she did do if you know it's it upset people so they want to attack in a really unbalanced way they want to end it all for her there's no way you can ever bounce back from that yeah they don't want they wanted to pile on you want to kick people while they're down because now it's my chance to kick you it's a terrible lack of compassion it comes from two things I think when it comes from a jealousy there's a natural jealousy that we all have for super successful people when they fail ego haha yeah I know it I knew that I knew it and now I have a patient a queue I think there's a little bit of that and I think there's also when you people feel like shit they want other people to feel like shit too yeah you know and I think this is what I think these attacks on people these rabbit attacks it's not coming from you it's not coming from me we're not screaming for the death of Roseann and even the people that are evil people don't really once the people just go that's fuckin bullshit what you did and then the network hears all these people say that's bullshit yes you know I think it's just a symptom of where human beings are today I think there's so many human beings that are hurting mm-hmm and so when something comes up it gives them a legitimate reason to be upset they just attack it full-force but what disturbs me is the lack of an overwhelming voice for compassion yeah the lack of an overwhelming voice of people saying hey look real real racism is awful but this lady who probably did commit real racism by calling the cops on that eight-year-old girl she's just a fucked-up person it's a what it means what it's all better to just forgive her what happens in like here's I think there's some mistakes that the left and the right makes when trying to like when there's an e mob you know yeah it's they seek to punish over educate they're not looking for to make the person change their opinion they go you're ignorant and then they leave it at that so probably the thing I got the most flak for in my life was the amazing race's videos gee I wonder why yeah I mean over and over again new people find it it's a fuck you you're racist I have maybe gotten three text message I mean I've gotten hundreds and hundreds of death threats I've gotten thousands and thousands of angry fuck yous racist racist ah whatever but maybe only three total I can really only think of two of people going hey just so you know this is why that hurts me because I was an immigrant here and then when I see stuff like this it reinforces the feeling that I mother maybe that's it of the thousands and thousands of the other way ah fuck you so you're not really trying to educate and you want to change their opinion you're really just trying to like shout yeah so what is that why are we all like that because we're unhappy and you find a target and you got a free shot you ever see a guy go down in the ghetto you ever see a fight where a guy goes down the ghetto and everybody runs in and kicks him in the head you see any of those there's a gang of those on street fight videos there's a bunch of street fight videos and some of the craziest ones are in bad neighborhoods where someone gets knocked out and then everyone else wants to people take free shots on them while he's down a free shot there's a bunch of videos like that there as a person who understands brain trauma it's severely disturbing what I've talked to so many of these neuro scientists about the like all these blunt-force impacts on the brain you're seeing a guy who's totally unconscious and they want walk by and soccer kick him in the head while he's totally unconscious just take turns hitting him full blast in the face and a bunch of people do it they stomp them they kick them I mean he's out cold his pants down and they are kicking him in the head I don't think people are less the effects that one of those ear ages can have on your psyche and I think when people they see something like the lion guy or the dude who fucking caught the foul ball and Cubs game or fucking you know Metzger or anything like that or they say this lady with the other girl it comes at you from everything everywhere and then pit the psyched like the the zeitgeist moves on you know people kind of move on and think something else they're still getting hundreds of stuff a day saying fuck you fuck you fuck yeah it's still happening right and so you all move on like it's nothing happened but everyone who's shit on them a little bit has added to their this this overwhelming like this thing you can't get out I still think mats goes flailing off that shit off he still try and defend himself all these fucking attackers from fucking five years ago mmm like three years ago but like you don't just come clean of that so all the people adding like hey fuck you for killing that lion like you've added to their fucking break in psychology yeah it's not an easy thing to get over and you don't see it all but it's so much I mean renders easy start I called him and his wife might get off line right now Ralphie - and that shit was happening to him it was like you need to give this as someone else cuz it won't do you any good even if we know you're wrong myrna's easy apologize to all of us six years earlier said hey fuck I'm sorry I lied and we all made fun of him that was over he doesn't need other people going fuck you you like with you know I already told everybody I know I was wrong you don't need 10,000 people telling you that he doesn't do anything for you when you've already said yes I agree yeah you know they don't care though they just want to get their licks in yeah terrible they are the cultural equivalent to this bar fight yeah it's a free shot sin they also want you to know they're disappointed in you and express their rage at you I'm unfollowing you yeah that's alright just do it don't fuck it tell why are you telling me you know unfollow Alex Jones was right yeah it's it's a it's a nutty time we live in yeah it is a nutty time and it's a time of outrage if there's there's outrage sport out there to be had and there's you know there's legitimate outrage there's a story I don't like both things I'm having my friend talking about these people in DC pulled over on the side of the road decently busy highway maybe Sunset Boulevard type thing but not businesses like that but it busy like let's say three lines here three lines there I saw these two kids walking home a ten-year-old an eight-year-old just on their own just walking and this lady pulled over is like what who are you where's your parents and they're like I don't know I think they're probably at home and not sure she's like well where you going she said we're going home like where are you coming from they're like we're coming from the playground and she was like no no you can't be on your own and she called the cops and they got them you know picked him up and got him to where they lived and their parents were there and like what's all this and like where you saw your kids walking alone and they're like yeah what for the park right and they were like yeah they're like yeah we taught him how to do that and like what do you mean like we taught them we walked with him from the park enough times and we taught our kids enough to where we trust that they can come home from the park alone we've taught them how to do that we trust them with it and then people like oh I guess so and there was a split in the story most people read it 90% of the people who radical yes parents should be allowed to trust when their kids are trained enough to do things like driving at 16 that's a parent's decision you know 10% of the people were like no I wouldn't do that with my kids that's fuck them and those people reached out on Twitter on Facebook and said fuck you shove your kids taking away from you and that 10% even though 90% said yeah a parent should be able to teach their kids whatever that 10% means thousands of people coming at you saying you're a horrible teacher you're horrible father imagine that if thousands of people say fuck you you're a bad father you're ruining your kids and it kept happening it affects you hmm and they didn't do anything wrong baby it's all you where 90% of people think yeah you're on the right here and you're still getting all this negativity well nobody in bridging is shit and nobody ever is prepared for them no one's prepared for it no one agents agencies should have should be on the ready to help their client fucking deal with this when it happens because it'll happen to almost everybody you'll have something that'll get blown out of proportion yeah you got to be right you got to get off line immediately well do you think that some of it comes from people have this feeling that anybody who is in that sort of a situation where they're clearly wrong it's just an open target Oh target fuck them I can go off on them look how easy to do a Christianity joke now look how hard it was back then and the Scientology same thing in South Park broke it up and now you're like you're not brave for making front of Scientology no Christianity everybody's doing it yeah that whole breeze so make it easy now do that the 60s you have a problem did not get exhausting brave telling jokes how much must be funny yeah Tommy right I had a great joke it's only been covered he goes I got a great story he goes how much is a funny one you made up yeah true story true story I got only a true story how about a good one true story yeah way what we just saying I forget what we were just saying Jamie you forget - god damn it fucking marijuana it's got its side effects does have its side effects definitely shouting that yeah we're talking about a rage yeah yeah Matt's crazy rage is pretty rough people hasn't gotten out of that yeah yeah people fuck you man fuck you I just feel like we're stalled out in our cultural evolution in a way then I feel like we're we're in these movements of change and I think I see a lot of positive things but I don't see nearly enough like friendliness and compassion I think we really need more of that as human beings this is not lasting you're not going to last no one's lasting you know you're gonna die we're all gonna die we're here for a certain amount of time it's not permanent and while you're here we can make everything better for everybody just being nicer to each other can be done I mean it's not going to be done so I think but it can be done a little dress yeah I think what you do has got affect your own life say I can't change it for everybody but what I can do is every time every one of these blogs make me angry just go I probably don't have the whole story on this cuz that's happened 20 times already oh for sure so then it's like I'm not going mad you know I am gonna I'm sure people are taking care of this yeah what I'm gonna do is go outside and enjoy some freedoms I have like a fucking Park you know actually enjoy your life I said of letting people fucking take you down this horrible road to hurt them you're hurting yourself yeah and you're wrong or hurting them yeah I can get out there just leave go call a friend go talk about something yeah it's just a strange time for you know just for expressing anger fuck you you're wrong fuck you fuck yeah fuck you you're wrong we'd never had like more of an open forum for debating ideas but people have never been more dogmatic and aggressive about their accounts - and the left gets violent now this is a weird thing that didn't used to happen before Sean Nick DiPaolo get punched in the face yeah by some woman and it shows so self-righteous that you feel like you had to punch him in the face got a giant black eye it's like you can't be violent against someone and and they used to go we'll look who you're let's say it was like a dice type act and then some of those people were like hardcore KKK pepero people like look who your fan base is and you're like that's not my fault I'm like I'm gonna be there right well if you want that logic some of the people following you guys are pretty fucking shitty yeah I won't call you on that logic cuz I'm not a hypocrite but like it ain't your fault but like they are some of them are getting fucking violent now yeah it look crazy so anti-free speech it's it's so change of information it becomes idea wars and when it becomes idea wars they get this anything necessary by any means necessary mentality and they think it's justified that means there's fucking professors out there have been quoted to saying that they believe in violence when there is no other solution supporting an Tifa and an Tevas disruptive violence and to take away oppressors and that frees this is a big one this is one that has been coming up lately more more often even the ACLU changed his stance on free speech and they they're deeming for speech is something that's not hurtful to someone else well that's not what free speech is like what is the most remember they go hurt it's the most recent reading about free speech there's something about the ACLU stance on free speech well you can't in French my belief is you can't fringe on your 3-6-5 as long as you don't fringe in the rights of someone else right so like you can burn a flag if you want but you can't burn a flag in my apartment I don't think I think they're shifting my concern right if you go to what harm is Georges like a physical harm or monetary and physical or not we talked about like a slight mental harm well if it's racism it's clearly emotional harm mental harm you're damaging someone's psyche if you're dismissing them in a racist way or you're insulting them in a racist way I think that's nothing so now I'm not the white people here's the problem with saying okay so I heard this theory they're like wouldn't make you fun of white people and yes missing white because like yeah fuck you white guy you know it's like all right well that's you've just put me into a category do the race human I mean I know you don't like people do that to you so I don't know why are you using those methods now it doesn't make sense to me well it's the tide coming in and out right there the whites owned slaves for so long and it was so fucking oppressive that now has it shifted back there's still economic despair and all black neighborhoods because of racist laws and things haven't balanced out yet so you're like fuck white people yeah so you're allowed to say fuck white people until it goes this way and then this way and then even so we've got to the point where shitting on Christians but I'm not a Christian I don't care for them especially Catholics but like we're shitting on them now it's like hey come on leave them alone they're honestly all they do is take abuse now all they're doing is trying to worship their God and you guys are shitting on them and calling them yokels fucking leave them alone for a minute they're down there down you got them down you're now punching down if you want to punt if you're on a shit on a Catholic yeah unless they're fucking kids no right you said that is I mean that is one of the darkest fucking things that they're accused of transferring people rapes all over the place that was the Pope Pope did that yeah there's an organizer guy who talks to God it's yeah that's so that's what God told him to say and he moved somebody who went on to rape a hundred deaf kids yeah yeah hundred yeah what the fuck man you look into that guy's background Ratzinger look into I mean there's several cases of that there's so many there's documentaries on it I think speak no evil is one of the documentaries of a different priests that were just molesting just scores of kids damn yeah and they interview the guys they're monsters it's so crazy man they were just that's what they did that's what everybody did to them that's what they did and they got away with it forever every once in a while someone will point out some like Jewish rabbi that like has begged a kid or something like that as I see it happens in Judaism - what is this ACL u--'s long-standing commitment to defending speech we hate is this recent good that's what they should be doing is in response to this so somebody publish someone's criticism published in the Wall Street Journal a is different from those challenges to our work her critique is predicted i'll predicated on a fundamental misrepresentation she falsely accuses the aclu of having secretly changed his policy in regarding free speech and of launching an investigation to determine who leaked the secret air quote quotes leaked and then quote secret document that she claims revealed this asserted change in policy in fact the aclu remains fully committed to defending free speech as the document she cites expressly reaffirms expressly reaffirms hashtag fake news so somebody put out some fake news according to the ACLU good I heard somebody say it's hard to tell you should you should not be able to just like I don't know something and say once there's violence committed because of your organization you can no longer say you're not a terrorist organization or you can no longer say you have the right to protest when it causes violence and then this is on NPR actually and then the coast was like okay so just so you know though under the and there are liberal group not crazy but like liberal right I think I got okay just so you know then apply that same thing to black lives matter and like what do you mean like well that guy who killed two cops because of the black lives matter if you're gonna say the followers decide whether or not it's then we have to outlaw black lives matter and their guy was like oh no no no no we can all right well then you can't say Charlottesville people don't have a right to say go home kikes you're taking our jobs they can say it it's fine they can say it it sucks they can say it yeah all of it you got to say all of it you can even roll your eyes and say that guy's an idiot that's your right you don't stop them from talking because then it keeps going to the point where rap is getting fucking boycotted in America mm-hmm you can't put your shit out it goes it will always go to a point where it'd be super super repressive well if one person who is not doing anything wrong can't speak you've done something wrong yeah you could easily compromise a group two and turn it into a terrorist organization by infiltrating it having someone cause violence in Occupy Wall Street exactly but sending some undercover cops done fistfights yeah and then they get broke that I could go home this fistfights now yeah kids that were hanging around and occupy were saying that they would run into undercover agents and undercover cops all day though they guys they knew were undercover and they're like what the fuck so they're just like being overwhelmed by people who are lying to them and for the government to keep the peace like this they're like secret covert agents hanging around with these occupy kids yeah you know you ever see one of my favorites is when Peter Schiff who the the venture capitalist banker genius guy have you ever seen Peter Schiff I've been on my podcast few times super wealthy successful business guy and he went down to Occupy Wall Street and he said I don't know how he said I'm a multi-millionaire come explained to me what I've done wrong or something along those ways are I forget what his actual that's funny put a troll what was a great troll because he's a financial genius who understands the Martineau inside out they don't know what the fuck they're talking about and he's like look I employ hundreds of people I have an enormous business I make tremendous amount of capital why should you make the same amount of money as me and she just fucking tortures these people because he speaks in 350 miles an hour and they don't know what they're saying and he's just he's it's it's very comical to watch and it just shows you how people go into these things with these idealistic ideas of what they think they're standing for when they don't even have like a framework what they're against or the policies in the banking in the corporations and capitalism in general they're not over there's so many people that do most people don't most people that are there they're there for the ride okay you fucked the man man they're gonna fix things so Peter Schiff is the man so he gets out there amongst them with a fucking beautiful $5,000 suit on probably cost more than eyes probably angry and right now I mean you can watch these videos on YouTube they're hilarious that's great really I want to talk to him because he set up shop in Puerto Rico right before the hurricanes came and shut all the power off he was living in Puerto Rico apparently a lot of people moved to Puerto Rico model rich people like fuck this yeah because the tax is there just like stupid low my friend is lives there yes he went to college together and she's like the power like really in the last month or two just came back on and it's being held on by a band-aid and hurricanes and it's starting soon hurricane season oh no it's like it's just going to happen again so how long is the power out for months and months Oh Mike and they got it back in few places and then it kept going in other place people died because of lack of power now we ain't doing shit what but it's where's in the eyes of regular people like most Americans are busy with their regular lives mm-hmm Puerto Rico's not a part of us even though it is yeah I love when everybody's like oh you idiot Trump Puerto Rico isn't part of America is part of America and I'm ever really like yeah you just found this out right now well I knew it was cuz I used to have a joke about Alaska being a frozen Puerto Rico oh well it's not even attached like how is that ours and how was Hawaii arms yeah fucking place way over there but yeah if all the power goes out in Alaska we keep helping them right would we look at a divot it's not a sensei why not a state cuz reporter goes now stay there because they're probably that is part of it their part they always want to do this too in that backlash on things they want to narrow down to one possible thing and it's like it ain't one possible thing it's you have to keep it up for all of it right you know yes perhaps it's because they're not white because if they're Latino ish perhaps it's also mixed in with that you're not a full state I wish I knew enough about finances to ask the question is it possible that the reason why these corporations and these rich dudes want some want to move there and and get such a low tax rate that they have to pay is also why they didn't have the money to recover from this infrastructure being down and so that these two might somehow another be correlated or is it just that the hurricane was so fucking overwhelmingly devastating that it just took forever to fix which one is it because anybody who thinks you don't need government well we have to sit down and talk about how we're gonna fix things we're gonna have to sit down and talk about infrastructure really how some local government but you would what does that mean like there's no government people are crazy today in Puerto Rico nine months after Hurricane Maria 2609 six two thousand six hundred sixty nine customers still do not have power in many cases these homes were more than one or where more than one person lives it may be another months before they get it we're going to tweet about this until the last customer has power and this is David Ben god be n hook not be EG and big nod david i just read his name david p EG and aud no real big ol bail from louisiana david benioff that's fucking crazy two days ago nine months after the hurricane i never looks like how many got that coming Jesus didn't which dude Branson didn't he buy an island that got completely decimated I think so I think the whole island got wiped off the face of the map I think there's for the first time like three hundred years no human beings live on an island damn dude what the fuck you imagine living in a place where the sky becomes an angry monster and just rips houses apart you should see some of these fucking torrential rains and like these Timor and shit like that where it's like it's going and like Oh drop drop get to cover now and if you don't get to cover in a minute your underwear soaked I mean is through you all your stuff is ruined - and then it passes in like 30 minutes do you remember when we were in Miami were you with me when we when Eddie Bravo was doing a seminar we drove down from West Palm Beach to my we had a stop on the highway too much there was so much rain all car stops it was always right oh it was fucking crazy and all I could think of is I hope no asshole tries to drive through this sixty is not three limit I can just fucking coke it was insane we had a stay put and there was a wall of water around us everywhere we looked fuck man that was insane yeah damn that's a crazy thing about this world is that you go to different places and just never see a lot you're at earthquakes and some places hurricanes and others why no they're losing hundreds and hundreds of houses to the volcano the volcano real or anything that dude it was just one time no it's fucking up everything and they say it could go on for months if they have projectiles flying through the air that it likes like a fucking several hundred pound rock Wow hurling through the air and landing on shit lighting things on fire what'd ya do did losing houses left and right they can't stop it they came and slow it down you just have to get out of there so they just have to evacuate this toxic fumes and the airs all we're all around where the volcanoes are look at it which which island can see it from space oh my god that's all right go I'm fucking space bitch look at it what is it the man I want the big one Wow yeah the big Island dude it's huge it's a fucking real problem Wow yeah look at that will go to scroll back up to the last one

weird just watch it consume it like that's it hhor-- so much that kind of nature so amazing that people with that's how you get an island that's Iceland is all volcanic rock and then just sort of went over the top of it and just stuff grew out of it yeah I mean that is literally how the Big Island was formed and being formed right now and you're freaking out I think you're gonna have extension come now it's gonna be bigger yeah Hawaii's gonna be bigger yeah you got to put some tarp while you're fuckin building shit they have this shit there they call vog it's like volcanic smog man it really fucked with my daughter's head she gets yeah yeah she was sneezing and coughing and I was like what's the matter and they said for some people if they have allergies to certain allergies you can get this vog this weird fucking fog that comes in that's mixed with volcanic volcanic either emissions or you know so there's a lot of a lot of stuff that these people are in danger of it's not just the volcano itself but the toxic gas yeah and so that some of those gases that leaked from the volcano get in the fog and some people were particularly susceptible to it yeah I remember that European one where everybody was like all the crops are ruined oh yeah was that the Iceland one with him do you know that's the one that was that was the one that was responsible for that michael hastings guy do you know michael hastings he's that journalist that david's were his career no no he was over there doing a story on a general for Rolling Stone and they had the volcano happened and he couldn't fly home for a long time so he's over there embedded with these soldiers for a long period of time and during that time they got a little loose with him and started being themselves and you know some general said some stupid shit about Obama you know insulted him in some way and they got this they were the iSchool right general no no US general because this guy was doing a story overseas and as he was doing the story overseas he got stranded there because of the variety look a fly over there so michael hastings writes a very bad story about this general and then comes back and you know the general gets fired he loses his job and he's a beloved general and so michael hastings then winds up driving his fucking car into a tree going 120 miles an hour on sunset and the the fear was that someone had merked him that what they had done is they had hired someone to take over his car because he's got one of them modern mercedes where he was hack into and hack any way you could force those things to drive him so you could literally get into the computer and turn shift the wheel hastings found himself on a bus from Paris to Berlin with McChrystal and as entourage the visit which was supposed to take place in two days turned into a month during which time Hastings had considerable access to the general so the the big conspiracy theory was that he was murdered well that was the big conspiracy because his car the engine flew from the car I mean it was like it exploded like there's some sort of explosion in there and then there was also the talks colleagues a man toxicology examination I'm pretty sure revealed we looking for the weed yeah revealed that he was on some sort of amphetamine but all writers are on adderall not all of them but a shitload of them right my clients that were in cut the Cobo festival and uh and uh smoking pot shitty part mexican pot and I was like you want something cuz no I don't smoke pot was like why don't you Mike and he goes yeah I'm trying to get writing jobs I don't want to get tested I'm like oh dude Hollywood doesn't test writers for drugs are you kidding I was like they're all log coke we know they don't test for that bro

for for last year and a half to fucking unveil it at Edinboro so I've watched them for two times now I was out there and it's kind of got influenced by some another style of comedy I think the only problem with their style comedies they give up and we've talked about is they give up the jokes for the sake of a point or a theme so I'm very careful not to do that to make all this shit work on its own and clubs in America I like how you confidently pronounce the name Abra brah Edinboro yeah is what a lot of Americans go Edinboro Google and I'm broke so I'll be there August 2nd through the 26th
