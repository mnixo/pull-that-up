four three two one Ben Greenfield eats ants hmm just want everybody know hey God if I was gonna go to Disney as much as you go to Disney I'd eat a lot more black ants why you eating ants well supposedly I actually don't know that much about ants I'm just I'm just eating it because it supposedly gives you energy I need to pick me up this morning we lifted weights this morning and I needed a second boost of energy but apparently these ants live in ginseng roots and they have something that grows in their heads that acts as like a nootropic it's like some kind of a chemical nootropic and it also supposedly is one of these Chinese energy tonics it's like the whole you know the doctrine of signatures you know the doctrine of signatures no it's the idea that that things in nature give you clues right so so like when you slice open a tomato you've got the four chambers of the heart and tomato supposedly good for the heart or pomegranate is good for your blood and the little pomegranate seeds look like red blood cells you slice open a carrot it looks like an i or you crack open an egg it looks like an eye those are those are good for your vision sweet potatoes which everybody thinks is like it like a sweet sugary food those are actually shaped like a pancreas and they can actually help to normalize your beta cells like your your insulin-producing beta cells in your pancreas so you look at you know walnuts for your brain and people talk about avocados right supposedly they look a little bit like an ovary and they're good for female reproductive function hmm so you can you can carry that over from the plant kingdom into the animal kingdom and say that if you eat ants because there's such energetic endurance driven creatures that it supposedly will make you stronger boys that's a stretch wait till this stuff hits me in the wall arm wrestle find out have you been doing it for a while how long you been taking this stuff that was the third time I've I've actually used it you just and dissolve it I mean I used it for a workout a couple of times so this is your concoction right you took ground diet ants I didn't grind up the ants myself that would have been exhausting to catch you by chance I round up I bought ground-up black ant powder just pulled up some ginseng ass i I don't think they're called that's actually that's where I bought them that's where I bought them lost them part Paulie ratchets aunts a keen tonic of Chinese herbalism but you know what the Chinese people are also into the rhino horn it's not just a pre-workout herb according to the website it's a pre-workout super herb Oh a super-earth supposedly far more scientifically super literally right it's like a superfood exactly I'm a little annoyed with that word superfood I like that idea though of the doctrine of signatures I like certain things that I see in nature being good for you there's there's one called um I forget the the name of this plant but it's called the insulin of the heart and it's amazing for decreasing sympathetic nervous system activation and causing you to relax and it has these beneficial cardiovascular properties and people who are just so driven that they tend to have for example you know a heart attack or an MI and it's uh it's not split Lant these I forget the name of this but but it looks like a heart and it has all these red vessels that kind of come off it it's called the insulin of the heart there's there's an app that my kids and I use to identify a lot of these it's called flower checker so you read about this ant stuff online and then you start taking it and then we mix in some sort of a tincture here it is vodka yeah yeah you beam that stuff nature's yeah but forgotten remedy for heart disease Lulu Bane I interviewed a physician on my show dr. Thomas Cowan and he wrote a book about how the heart is not a pump and he talks about the true reason for heart disease being sympathetic nervous system overdrive what does he mean by the heart is not a pump mineral depletion and dehydration and what he means by the heart is not a pump it's a fascinating book the shape of the chest is I believe it's called like a tetrahedron or some it's it's something like that but basically as fluid moves through the heart the action of the fluid actually moving through the heart allows it to to pass through the heart and not have to be pumped through the body but rather the shape of the heart is almost like causing the fluid to vortex it's alright most readily out of the way oh the hearts the heart contracts but but it's less of a pumping action and more of like like a vortex flow that it creates the book is called why your heart is not a pump it's very interesting is it why well-received amongst science it's it kind of flies under the radar a little bit yeah yeah but it's it's an interesting book short book it's like maybe others ages long universally regarded as a pump yeah I don't know if you would necessarily classify it as a pump as much as a contracting muscle yeah boom but when you die and then they bring you back to life they push your heart to make it pump mm-hmm pump pump pump seems like yeah yeah no she read the book it's interesting it's interesting but this this this flower checker app this flower checker app it's really cool you you take a picture of a plant and then there's a team of live botanist on the other end and within 24 hours they identify the plant for you and you can learn it's it's edible properties its medicinal properties so my kids and I can walk around and take pictures of different plants different flowers different things on our land huh and it develops this online herbarium that then allows you to keep track of all the different plants and what you've learned about them and what they're good for so we use that whenever we're identifying plants there was one time when we were fishing off the off the the North Fork of the clear water so we want on this fly-fishing trip and where's the water the clear water up in Idaho so we were near a Grangeville most people fly into Grangeville Idaho it's a great fly-fishing huge steelhead and the the hike that we went on we didn't have our phones or anything with us to take pictures of what we were finding and we found this this enormous almost like like a field of wild asparagus and my buddy who was with us he had bare broth that he was that he was he was like a bear bone broth that he had in this VAT back at the cabin so we harvested all this asparagus and this was before I went out fishing and I put all the asparagus into the bone broth and then just left for the day and then we came back and we had we had fish we had bone broth we had asparagus and we all ate this bone broth and it turns out this stuff was not asparagus so my kids and our heads were spinning all night the guy that owned the cabin apparently didn't sleep he was just like hunched over the toilet the whole evening and it turns out this stuff is cold I think it was Brassica it looks like asparagus but apparently it has very high levels of nicotine so we were all scared dosed on nicotine for the next two days on this fishing trip we'd be really careful that's that's that's the only time I haven't used that app to actually go go plant foraging who thought it was asparagus we all thought it was asparagus you know it was me one of the chefs who was out of the cabin with us my kids and and twin nine-year-old boys know a lot about plants so he always turns into wild asparagus but I was convinced it was asparagus I mean I kind of tasted it out there well we were we were out in the field and it tasted like asparagus but no it's not asparagus it's Brassica Jesus Christ yeah that sounds horrible yeah but there's another app called a plant snap and apparently uses artificial intelligence you know like a reverse google image search to identify a plant I've used that and it's it's useless anything you take of it doesn't seem to be able to identify anything but this flower checker is just live people on the other end does Google there's there's Google Image searches like some some there's a application that use cameras and if you take a photo of something identifying right exactly they I think that's called like a reverse Google Image Search or something like that but but the AI doesn't seem to work as well for plant identification now would imagine it's looking at the leaves the shape the leaves how it comes up plant you know the veins the opposite versus symmetrical and everything that goes into a plant identification but now when you used it was a real person steelhead yeah you got to go with a real person you gotta go with an actual botanist um steelhead our ocean bound rainbow trout right they come back forth yeah um do you guys do you catch and release or do you eat them this was all catch and release there's a common thing with those there's a certain kind that you can catch and I'm not a fly-fishing expert this is like fun trip with my kids to learn how to fly-fish and we didn't catch any that we could actually keep yeah I don't understand that kind of fishing it's weird you know yeah that'd take a long trip go out into the wilderness go to the river catch that just let it go yeah it's it's the thrill of the chase I get it great for kids yeah you know I've done it with kids bass fishing before yeah but it's just you can't do that when you bow Hans know it's a weird thing you're you know sticking a hook in a fish's mouth and then let me know yeah got him let him go yeah they're hard to reel unless like a 10-minute fight it's biggest fish in there big yeah they're powerful fish those are ocean currents an ocean fish are almost always more strong yeah I mean when you pull them in a freshwater fish they're very strong they're stronger than ants imagine yeah go back to go back to this ant thing and and tell me what has been the reaction like when you take it like how you feel smart just like a cup of coffee you really do feel like you do you do feel more energy do you think it's because of the ginseng or is it possible I don't see but I think they just live within the ginseng and that makes the story sexier for the website that sells see I think just eating the ants themselves give you energy I would imagine that you'd have to catch a lot of ants to get we'd get out of like all the powdered extract but they write they sell you rabbit I mean eating the powdered extract then just that somehow another what's the mechanism for giving you energy there's some chemical that's that's in the ants all right I don't know the mechanism of action again I like I I really don't claim to be an expert in it extract but yet I'm bottle and I'm try haven't I have a bottle of it was using in with all my other supplements and I was packing up this morning and thought it would be an an interesting one it is just to show to you just a giant bottle that says ant on it what is the what's the standard way that people take it do they I think outer or as a tincture yeah I would imagine you could probably put it in a smoothie you know with your with your bee pollen your other insect derivatives Wow yeah yeah yeah what a weird one huh yeah anyway so you should have come out and done the Spartan I know you were at Disney yeah I said I should well did Spartan Spartans Spartans a little bit more interested in Disney's myself yeah yeah they have they have kids you like to but you were doing commentary something's that we don't I was doing the they have commentary all day long with these Spartan right so I was doing the commentary and I raced the next day oh so you did one-day comment yeah so was it a race thing yeah what they do the way they do it they get like tens and probably I would say some of these races eight to twelve thousand athletes in that approximate range so they break it up they go out they break it up there's long races there's short races so the long race was 13 about 13 miles which on a road half marathon that'd be like a 105 that an athlete would do on a on a race like that and so it's so I tell my with the obstacles and the hills and it's not a big bear which is a ski resort which I just found out for my wife apparently used fake snow there's like a pond at the top of the at the top of the resort that they make all the snow with looks real snow but it's artificially created right it's like you make with this yes artificially created real snowman from water at the top of the mountain and it's just a shame it's not yeah it's not it's not foam what everybody's trying to do that to make foam snow yeah to make some snow exhaust estimate the mall and Dubai they've got some they've got something over there snow machine it probably is actual snow at the mall in Dubai they have like a crazy Hill right it's you know they have an actual indoor skier that penguins an indoor ski resort everything yeah so this race though for those same 13 miles it's like two hours I think the winner did it to 16 to 17 something like that so it's a you have to jump a lot slower you got a carry carry sandbags and carry big gravel buckets it's like doing yard chores and then running barbed wire crawling and hoisting ropes but it's good for full-body fitness because I used to do triathlon when I did triathlon I was weak right yeah you swam you biked your run and I had an engine that could go for days but I did my first Spartan Race and I couldn't climb a rope and I couldn't carry sandbag up a hill so I think it's good for functional fitness here it is right here at Sammy's got a video about there that's a stadium that's actually a good way to start that's inside the stadium yeah and you know you don't forget muddy and there's no fake snow in selfies yeah it can be kind of a joke because some people will go out in uniforms with big cowboy hats on and you know dressed up as as spider-man in their lycra and then some people they they have these elite waves where it's actual you know legit athletes this is kind of interesting though but it is you know you can see you move your body in a lot of different ways on these courses so it's fun you know it's fun to train for cuz you got to train all your different body parts and you train for power and strength and there's endurance so it's a good mix of everything ya know they're doing them in stadiums that's kind of cool the stadium races are cool just show up at AT&T Stadium we're gonna race and you go up and down and they will turn a stadium into like a three to four mile event I mean that's how many times you go up and down these stairs and they have an event for the kids where the kids will go up and down the stairs and the kids have miniature sandbags and miniature Spears so it actually is kind of a cool event that's pretty badass that family except for his fucking selfie stick mmm like everything must be documented you cannot live in this life without people knowing exactly what you're doing at all times yeah run a selfie stick I'm taking my kids to one of those trained Hunt competitions this weekend oh yeah and Bonners Ferry so they're gonna do their first actual kids and same thing it's the kids events where the kids shoot they've got 15 to 20 yard shots and they have like a sandbag lift and a run and then they've got another shot and they've got burpees up and over cooler and another shot and there's a there's a grown-up event and a kids event those things are fun too and yeah that's those are really interesting the idea behind them is kind of cool too because it lets people know what like if you're if you're involved in one of those backcountry backpack hunts it's it's very much a physical event very much you're carrying most likely at least 35 to 45 pounds on your back especially if you're carrying your camp on your back and then you're hiking you know thousands of feet of elevation you're up and down climbing over logs and shit you're carrying your bow there's a lot of physical exertion involved like though well there's a lot of crawling a lot of crawling yeah yeah I mean you did that Hawaii hunt yeah what's wrong did you hunt lanai and I yeah I hunted Kona it was like five weeks ago and on the Sheep hunt because the Sheep stay on the in the open plains you'll crawl sometimes for an hour and a half yeah to get close enough for a shot yeah the final day when I killed I killed to access buck out there and the final day we crawled for at least an hour at least an hour like super fucking slow those things are switched on it's frustrating to with with an M or sheep sheep are not stupid they're smart now they're not as fast as an axis but that's the most frustrating part is you'll put on a crawl right maybe you're 200 yards out and you spend an hour getting 60 and then the wind swirls didn't they pick you up and they're off yeah stand up and brush yourself off and you got to go crawl again yeah but you know if it was easy wouldn't your hunting just be killing I got one of those jungle scrub cows that's all yeah you were telling about that so these explain to people what a scrub bull is because apparently just there's feral cows yeah they're not they're not bowls and cows I shot a cow and I thought at first that it was gonna be kind of a stupid hunch in a cow because it you know that the the pigs are pigs they eat really well because they feed on macadamia nuts they're a lot better than the pigs in Texas and they taste amazing we did if we did it's very fatty almost like like a nutty meat so we did a Cinco de Mayo cook-off me and my kids and we took the ribs from from this pig then I shipped back so you know it costs it was like 150 bucks to ship 250 pounds of meat back from Kona so I had sheep pig and cow and shipped it all back which is not that expensive and the the pig was I mean it it ate better than any pork I've ever had in my life really these ribs and you know we blended him up and my kids made a maintenance off with the peppers and they they have a little food podcast so we did all this for their food podcast but oh my goodness it's like the fattiest but but like a nutty flavorful fat because because they feed on these macadamia nuts you know there's no grain there's no corn right and they're just wild and running around out there so the pig was really good but the cow was tough yes it was it was a tough cow I went on the first day we were out there I took the back strap and I soaked that in lemon juice all day and that kind of broke it down a little bit it wasn't that bad but what I did when I got home was I've got a refrigerator out in my garage and I hooked up a temperature controller to it and get this temperature controller that's called a a four one nine it'll keep the temperature of the refrigerator about 34 to 38 degrees so rather than plugging the refrigerator in the wall you plug it into this this temp control unit and then you put a humidifier in and a fan like on that on the bottom of the fridge and then you take all your meat and you lay it out on grates in the refrigerator and I left it in there for about three weeks this scrub cow and it develops this hard grisly coating on the outside of the of the meat and then I took it out and just sliced all this hard grisly part off of the outside and the inside of that meat was like butter so you dry-aging and essentially that's that's exactly what it is it's a dry aged and refrigerator but you control the the temperature you want about 34 to 38 degrees and then the humidity can vary a lot more than that but I kept the humidity at about 60 to 70 degrees and then basically you just slice off all that hard grisly external coating and you've got this amazing me I'm a super soft super tender and then I just have this this vacuum Packer and and it's a cool little unit you can just cut a bag any size you want right for a neck or a shoulder or like a smaller bag for a back strap or a tenderloin and bagged it up yeah I have one of those vacuum-sealed those things are awesome yeah so the dry aging was key yeah I have friends that have one of those walk-in coolers and they could set it to a certain temperature and they hang the meat and dry-aged it out there but that I don't know what walk-in cooler they have because I looked into the dry aging refrigerators and those are like five thousand dollars but you can get a refrigerator off Craigslist that a four one nine thing I bought that was like 50 bucks a big is on the refrigerator yeah just a normal size and so so the the food is on grates inside the refrigerator yeah so I took all the shelving out of the refrigerator and I just put some plywood on other side of the refrigerator and I put these metal grates oh so you constructed your own right exactly then just laid the meat down on the grates and put the fan on the bottom of the refrigerator so it's constantly circulating the air inside the refrigerator and then the temperature controller has this it'll display so in my kitchen in my house it'll display the temperature and the humidity so I know if something goes wrong so not all that meat spoils inside the refrigerator because I'll see when I'm inside my kitchen it'll read that that the temperature is getting too high in there maybe somebody unplug the fridge or the controller and need to be reset which happened a couple of times but you want to keep an eye on it yeah it's a great way though to take meat and I mean make it far more flavorful more tender that kind of meat stuff anyways its gamey yeah these water buffaloes like you see the one behind me buddy mine's shot one of those in Australia and he said that he had campaigns he had a piece of it in his mouth and he was chewing one piece for a half an hour yeah that's how tough it is and this was the back strap which was you know one of the more tender parts of the body yeah this idea that's good for it's good for your jaw it's good for your teeth structure like this I think it's maximu my brother sent me this this youtube video this guy but his whole idea is that that humans jaw structure our bone density or teeth our trigeminal nerves all of that don't work as well as they should because we grow up on soft food mmm we don't have to chew food it makes sense a lot of boxers too like big chunks of bazooka bubble gum it gets kind of hard after a while dig into it and it develops muscular endurance through your jaw Master I've seen machines rather where you take like a leather strap in your mouth and you hang a piece of weight from it and yeah you're doing this yeah people were selling those for a while as a way to decrease rating of perceived exertion during exercise exercise mouthpieces and that the advertising on them was that the Vikings used to chew on leather before they go into battle to reduce pain and they increase their time to exhaustion and so they actually sell these mouthpieces that you bite down on and when you're exercising but they were designed strengthen the jaw as much as to reduce how hard you felt like you were working during exercise and some people swear by these exercise mouthpieces well I know that the mouthpieces supposedly can maximize the amount of effort that you can put forth like there's a difference in the amount of strength you playing down it's almost like when you shake somebody's hand you make a fist with one hand then you shake their hand you're stronger you know and that's that's something that Pablo's at Selene talks about his books you know about how to generate as much force as possible right for as low as one fist I mean if you're gonna do like a bottoms-up kettlebell press right you can do it with one hand open and press and you close your hand and contract this fist and it's it's far easier so what's the idea behind it somehow it's exercises your entire body it's fashio you know their your your your fashion it covers your entire body should be tighten up one part of it it causes you to be able to produce more force so let me try some time with a kettlebell or water bottle or a coffee cup I flex my hand outward but you flex your hand yeah I definitely flex my hand I'd never just like let it sit you know it's alright there's always some tension it's it's it's it's full body tension you know it's the same reason that you'll see a lot of tennis players or I think boxers do this too of I'll solve an Inuvik when you strike so you hold your breath you go - doing that same thing it tightens up every yeah and allows you to produce more force the the other gum you mentioned the bazooka there's a gum called mastic gum and I interview this guy Dean Karnazes who run it he did the 50 marathons in 50 days and he ran the the traditional marathon in Greece which is apparently not 26.2 miles it's like a hundred and some miles that he ran and he would chew this mastic gum which they do use for jaw strengthen but it makes you produce more saliva too so so when you're running you know you can get dry mouth when you're running and a lot of times you get you know be thinking about food you want to eat this mastic gum apparently keeps your appetite satiated and allows you to produce saliva and I bought some and it's you can find that shit it's a I think I got it mastic gum Amazon helps Greeks of mastic gum yeah that's what it looks like Little Rock's and the interesting thing is is you can take it out after you're done chewing and then just like the next day put it back in your mouth and keep you can chew that stuff for days it's like a like an Everlasting Gobstopper tastes like it tastes like ass that's not that good but if you have this this h pylori issue it's supposedly very good for that yeah look that wasn't bad they had a licorice anise E and a fennel so it tastes even shittier yeah but but it's supposedly you know this idea that we grow up on soft food and babies eat eat soft food yeah you wouldn't want the capsule that would I mean the capsule would be good for your that's where you got to be careful as a lot of companies sell it as a capsule right as mastic gum as a capsule but um the each one that's the exact one I have that Cree knows say there's mastic ground yeah yeah and that's that's the stuff that you actually chew hmm to make your jaw stronger hmm and to produce extra saliva huh and do you use this stuff where you work out are you just occasionally chewing no I don't like to have gum like you have so many different things going on so many different modalities that you're experimenting with there's no way you can spits that's my stick that's what that's what I do is I try stuff and I write about it it's not like it's not like I'm doing mastic gum and black cap powder I know and injections all day long um works yeah I would think you'd keep doing it all the time but it's just like you forget about a lot of stuff though you try out so many things you forget about it yeah I tried that out a while ago it's pretty good I need to order some more of that so yeah you start to lose track of all the stuff I try I don't have it all systematized of some big Excel spreadsheet what are you doing with the exomes explain that because I just got some shot into some tears that I have in my shoulders you know it's exosomes exosomes they're signaling molecules so your body actually has them your cells have exosomes and they're used as cell to cell communicators so they interact with cell surface receptors and they'll actually carry a message from one cell to another such as you know you need you need to absorb this into the cell you need to carry this to a joint or you know whatever you'd want to use an exosome for to carry messages throughout the body it's part of your believers referred to as the paracrine system your body's internal cellular communication system so the idea is that if you combined the exosomes with other therapies let like platelet-rich plasma injections which you do for it to increase the amount of growth fast whether they did to a specific joint they did exosomes plus PRP with you right which I I can I can tell you the full procedure that I did but I just got that all over my face my face five days ago was red and swollen because it was covered with exosomes lights your questions it's a it's a beauty procedure beautiful as you are thank you thank you but now I'm a beautiful thirteen year old so the the exosomes can be combined with other things like PRP and also with stem cells or with bone marrow and that's what I did and the interesting thing is that you can get something like a placental cell alright and in my case they actually took placental cells from this lab called chimera labs I had this procedure done in Park City Utah it's guy named dr. Harry Adelson and he he had these placental cells from chimera labs they destroy the placental cell so that there's no actual DNA from some other person that you're putting into your body right which is which is the that's considered to be part of the risk of stem cells even umbilical or amniotic you're still getting somebody else's DNA into your body not your own DNA so the idea is that you would take exosomes that you've isolated from something like a placental tissue and then you would mix those with your own stem cells in this case what I used was was bone marrow aspirate they went into both of my iliac crests they took out the bone marrow they mixed it with the exosomes and and these videos I published both of the videos on YouTube and and it's like a it's like a huge syringe fold I'm gonna see the drawing on my hip how much bone marrow they've taken out of your head a lot I was well I was out you know I was heavily sedated during the entire procedure well not heavily stemming I was under who wasn't general anesthesia it's called full-body sedation so you're similar to general anesthesia with few of the risks of the actual anesthesia I was not conscious nothing I mean all I remember is they said count from 100 down to zero and I got to like 93 and then I woke up yeah exactly so they took the bone marrow from the iliac crest right which is just like bone broth for your whole body's got College and this got peptides it's got stem cells they mix it with the exosomes which act as cell communicators from those placental cells this place called chimera Labs which in my opinion it's just a great sexy name for some kind of a mysterious lab company where you buy placentas so basically they they mix the exosomes with the bone marrow and then what they did you are oh yeah see that's what let's see whereas that crest you asked me how much they took how much they're pulling out holy shit but he did that like four times cuz he did twice - are you fucking shitting me this was five days ago he told me I was supposed to not do anything for two weeks but did that Spartan Race I armored myself up why didn't it well I I was signed up for the race and I had sponsor obligations actually not sponsored by use like four rolls of rock tape my entire body was just taped up because I didn't want to ruin anything that he'd done so anyways how could what do you mean by rock tape what is rock tape and kinesio tape you've seen this stuff before it's like what you see crossfitter supports it supports the joints oh Jesus they're going in for another tube four of those four of those big tubes Jamie's do you think you have in your body you think you have four tubes of marrow floating around some I could pull out of you yeah but well the tubes also you know this when you gives like you can give like 19 tubes of blood but it's not as much blood as it actually looks like because it's inside of that little skinny tube right so he and his partners like quite a lot what they did was he went with with that bone marrow mixed with the exosomes they mix it with ozone which apparently using an ozonator which apparently increases the efficacy of the bone marrow and you're doing this for a no specific injury no specific injury no this is all just for over two reasons number one anti-aging number two just immersive journalism just to write about I think this stuff's fun to write about looking at in a study so and apparently the stem cells stay valves so into is this this is an over-exaggeration but it's almost like he'd be like wolverine or like you recover faster when you get hurt for the rest of your life so round two yeah for people who are listening to the audio i'm not watching the video it's a lot of blood and then he injected my entire musculoskeletal system he did my cerebral spinal fluid he did all up and down the disks in my back here i've got needles no dude I'm totally out I would not want to be conscious I was just box breathing yeah I was meditating because I'm totally out for this Jenna can you can see there I have I have the Ironman corporate logo on my back so I did yeah technically that's trademark infringement man logo I be changing done in my spine like that and bulging discs yeah it was awake so weird they just just a lot of this stuff before mean I had mice I told you this last time I had my stem cells taken out of the fat my back down in Florida yeah and then I reacted them intravenously and then I tested my telomere just how this goes on for hours dude and like I was there for for three or four hours so they just screw it in and pump those in and find a new hole this is your totally out cold I'm totally ice cold my wife's in there freaking out she you can see her somewhere in there cold fuckin hey she was she was doing a Facebook live and answering questions as we went so then so get this his partner comes in she takes those same exosomes after he does ankles knees hips elbows wrists back every part of my they flipped me over wife's cold yeah my wife said that was the nose of weirdest part was they flipped me over I'm loosing limp like a noodle I think she's moving my hand yeah so then his partner came in and she's like a sexual performance and beauty specialist and I don't want this to turn into another podcast about just injecting things into your deck but she did help but she did she injected the the corpus cavernosum which is the the shaft of your unit and then she did the head of the penis then she did my face over and over and over again everywhere exosomes all over my face and I've seen some 50 and 60 year old women who have done this and it actually does seem to have a pretty significant effect I don't I don't know how much of an effect it had on me but I said if they were gonna put me under just he called it a full-body stem-cell makeover apparently nobody's ever in the history of the world done this before so if I if I die that's the one thing I can brag about you love great this is what I understand you don't need this shit no a lot of it like I said it's it's interesting to write stories about and talk about and tell people what it's like um and then they did yeah they did that on the face and that's that's the that's exosomes mixed with PRP what is that injecting to the face she's doing it with what is that thing I don't remember because I wasn't awake it looks like little needles I think it might be like some kind of like dermal abrasion type of thing I'm not shocked in your face up man yeah I mean this was a few days ago and I feel like a heel five days ago Wow yeah yeah so I healed up pretty quickly that's crazy because what I was doing my head where Holmes oh great minds think alike dude that's that is craziness yeah actually what day is it no it's Tuesday so actually this no seven seven days ago seven days ago mine was Wednesday anyway so yeah you know I had I actually had just gotten a concussion because I got in a bike accident when I was down in Austin Texas a couple of weeks ago and so the other thing that this is interesting because you wait for a TBI there's all sorts of things that you can do right like ketones exogenous ketones work really well for that and that's a lot of Dominique D'Agostino research on concussions DHA is another good one hyperbaric oxygen therapy chambers right with the high oxygen plus the high-pressure that's really efficacious for concussions but the other thing is stem cells and so what I did was I ordered the stem cells that they harvested from my body in Florida because I think I told you about that the last time when I was on the show they store I have like 30 injections of my own stem cells stored down in Florida that I can use for four joints for anti-aging and I also one of the reasons that I did that was if I'm ever in a car accident if I ever get some some traumatic injury I can I can heal myself faster with these stem cells and and that happened I got a concussion I was riding my bike in Austin on on first Street and in rush-hour traffic and a car clipped me on the side and I made love to the pavement my entire face got torn open and and I got concussion so I did all these things ketones DHA hyperbaric PMF that's also really really good for the Cushing's pulsed electromagnetic field therapy it's it's it's used for anti-inflammatory for it's it's used for sleep you know it's kind of like grounding and earthing there's a lot of interesting studies on pee EMF also for concussion it enhances your own stem cell production that shuts down neural inflammation so I did that but then also a stem cells won't cross your blood-brain barrier so I ordered up this stuff called mannitol and if you inject mannitol into your bloodstream it increases your blood brain barrier permeability so this is what you're doing in a fight or a football player somebody gets a concussion you inject with mannitol first and then you follow that up with a stem cell injection if the mannitol is already in the bloodstream the stem cells cross the blood-brain barrier and they go in to heal neural tissue with the exosomes cross the blood-brain barrier because they're smaller very small they're very small I think they're like a hundred to two hundred nanometers which is pretty small yeah and I would not be surprised if they cross the blood-brain barrier one of the things they were saying about stem cells versus exosomes that stem cells tend to get pulled up in the lungs they don't pass the lungs and they get absorbed there and they believe that the exosomes being released by these stem cells are the the reason why you generate regenerate tissue they think that going straight to excess is gonna be more efficacious than just going with stem cells I think that some pharmaceutical company or some cell phone company is gonna make a lot of money in the next 10 years by figuring out a way to to make exosomes or figure out and you know some some way to to do it in a way that is more available to the general population than you know harvesting it from placentas and you know some crazy lab so you're not supposed to do anything for two weeks not for two weeks but I asked the DA and I told him I was gonna do his brown rice he said proceed at your own risk and in my plan apparently if you jar the joints a lot when they're already kind of weak from the surgery you can risk tearing a ligament spraining straining doing damage to a muscle that that's kind of weak and lacks from the surgery from the surgery but is it a really a surgery because they're not cut out in the the in gesture and I sprained my ankle within a few hours after after waking him from the surgery like I just kind of stumbled and it was extremely latched almost like a like a pregnant woman creates this hormone called relaxin and they get more flexible and they're able to give birth more quickly it's kind of that same idea is the joints the joints and the ligaments become more Lac so my whole body felt a little bit more like like Gumby that's what that was what I taped up everything you know I had knee braces on and elbow braces and wrist braces and I felt fine during the race and this whole procedure was how many hours it was about four hours four hours out cold chin up yeah what does it feel like when you wake up oh there's a pretty funny video I posted I thought it was funny I was trying to speak French oh my why I feel like I have a confession to make and the doctors like oh here we go like I speak French and then she and she asked me if I speak French nice I didn't actually speak French and you could see me trying to laugh like I'd made a joke because no have you ever been sedated yes yeah yeah yeah you're kind of loopy yeah make up yeah so I don't remember that much but and I still I mean I'll be honest with you I don't notice much of a difference from any of this stuff what six weeks yes a long time before it really kicks in and it flares up old injuries right like I strained my upper hamstring when I played tennis and that's flared up my left knee is flared up like I'm feeling old injuries the flare they almost like brought back not flared up like it's red and inflamed and swollen but I feel it I feel my right ankle which I strained a lot when I was when I was playing tennis that one feels you know it feels like I mentioned weak they told you said that it could flare up old injuries that you'd feel worse before you feel better huh that's interesting I didn't hear that at all but I did hear that six weeks six weeks is the benchmark it's it's a little time before you actually feel better yeah yeah the other interesting one for not only enhancing your own endogenous stem cell production because it actually would you know a lot of this stuff it's fringe it's expensive I mean you know that procedure I think is like a thirty thousand dollar procedure not everybody's gonna go out and do that and this is another fringe one but I want to I mean there are ways you can endogenously increase your own stem cell production I mean and your own stem cell viability and health without actually doing stem cell injections fasting is probably the one that's the most efficacious you know a lot of these things that are kind of uncomfortable for you seem to increase your body's ability to be able to heal its own stem cells so fasting for long periods of time not necessarily fasting with with caloric restriction that's the mistake a lot of people make they try too fast and they feel like crap but the idea is the benefits of fasting don't come from not eating a lot of calories I think a lot of calories isn't that great for your thyroid it's not great for your metabolism you want to live till you're you know 120 and be cold and thin and hungry the whole time because it'd be a horrible way to live a long time so the idea with you know things like you know Valter Longo is research or a lot of these these intermittent fasting type of diets as you fast and you increase cellular automata and stem cell production your own stem cell production by going for long periods of time without eating and the magic seems to kick in at about the 16 hour mark so I do 12 to 16 hours every day and then you get even more benefit once you get up to about 24 hours so I try to do a 24 hour fast from Saturday dinner to Sunday dinner but I'm still eating the same number of calories it's just a compressed feeding window right so so it's not like you're starving yourself you're getting all the benefits of fasting but you're still maintaining some amount of anabolism right because you're still eating as many cow but you're you're almost giving your body your gut and your metabolism a break in between a lot of these meals hmm and that's where the benefit comes that's where the Bennet the benefits are not from you know not eating so much damn food the benefits are going for a long time in between your feedings right so so the idea is you know you'd wake up and in the population for which this seems to be the most deleterious Arlene active females they do not respond well to these long fasts or a lot of time spent doing intermittent fasting it's like the cons outweigh the pro for that population but for for most everybody else these 12 to 16 hour fast preferably up to 16 hours going without eating and then eating as many calories as you'd normally eat with the exception rests the the amount of calorie is a compressed feeding window right so you know what the guy whose house I was staying with is when I was doing the stem-cell procedure Dan pop he's very into this stuff and he's a doctor down in Park City and he just he goes all day and then he has a huge dinner at the end they write like a enormous lovely dinner you know a couple glasses of wine and you know stay thousand cares 3000 calories for dinner and I'm more of like a two meal light breakfast or light lunch and then just two males I've been doing the 12 to 14 hour thing and sometimes I've ramp it up to 16 hours and I do feel better when I do that and I definitely become more accustomed to not eating for long stretches and sometimes when I wake up in the morning I almost think should I just eat but I'll stop and go well I'm not really hungry mm-hmm I mean it's really just a matter of habit a force of habit that I'm even considering eating right now yeah yeah but but fasting is probably one of the better ways to increase your own endogenous stem cell production provided you're going for about 16 hours and provided you're still eating as many calories as you normally eat the only kind of caveat to that would be protein cycling this is why I'm not a huge fan of the the carnivorous diet we're eating four to six pounds of meat a day yeah you were trying that for a while you're putting that on your social media I sort of but yes I was I was eating one of those big steaks every single night for dinner just like a bunch of steak every single night for dinner problem and this is like ten days how'd you feel doing that I felt pretty good but but I love steak I was eating these bone-in bone-in ribeyes I order them up from Missouri I think is where their farms are but they make these French cut grass-fed grass-finished bone-in ribeye steaks I'm getting in there just saying that did I'm guy I've remind me I'll tell you how I cook them maybe I'll tell you how I cook them after we finish the song because because I don't want to get because I'll just forget everything if I start talking about cooking so long as you prepare meat so so really quite a few people that are doing now so real quick and then we'll talk about how to make these steaks taste really good the the idea is that protein cycling right having a meatless Monday or having as a lot of religions would do like the Eastern Orthodoxy Church or the Mediterranean diet they have certain periods of time where there's complete meat restriction or your protein intake is restricted to fish and eggs for example and the idea is that you would strike a sweet spot between not being in a constantly anabolic state right and not having having this mammalian target of rapamycin constantly activated which would theoretically accelerate aging or in a lot of rodent models we see that you know unrestricted protein feeding actually causes aging to accelerate so the idea is on your lower activity days especially for an athlete you could still intermittent fast and get all the benefits of that and you could still eat as many calories as you would mean to sustain a normal healthy metabolism all right so so you're not starving yourself but on the less active days you would shift to a lower protein intake right so you're talking about like 0.5 grams per pound of body weight rather than what a typical athlete would need which would be depending on you asking to 0.7 to 0.85 grams per pound of body weight right so so there's some days where your high protein some days where your low protein some periods of the week such as a meatless Monday or some periods of the year you know such as every quarter you know for a week where you're eating a plant-based diet or you're restricting me you're basically giving your body a break from being in that constant anabolic state and I think that the the carnivore diet causes a lot of people to miss out on some of those elements and then if you look at the blood work of a doctor who does not work or die he published his blood work online and I don't know what else is going on with him from a health standpoint but you know had really high blood glucose and really low testosterone and some things that suggest that it might not be healthy to eat just meat you know and did you have you really low testosterone that's interesting like 200 to 300 it's really close like that's why really low diagnoseable hypogonadism combined with almost like borderline diabetes is it possible you did it after a workout he does a lot of rowing for real science and pressure testosterone not significantly it would increase your HSC RP and your inflammatory markers right which is why you never want it you never want to go to a doctor for a heart checkup after you've done a workout because they're gonna tell you you have a heart attack based on the levels of HSC RP right but I you know that blood work is just one example and I don't want to pretend like that one example you know is gonna paint with a broad brush the entire carnivore diet phenomenon but I just I think that unrestricted protein intake an unrestricted meat intake probably has an accelerated aging effect on the body and well here's the difference dr. Ron Rosedale is a doc who has some good information on that he's got a good video online what's going on with this carnivore diet is there's no science behind it there's a lot of people that are giving it a shot a lot of people finding good results but I find the technical when they just change things there's a period of time where they say they feel great and not that is absolutely 100% of placebo effect it's the same thing as like a vegan diet you feel fantastic and Namie will name me one population one blue zone that eats meat like and nothing else and there's actually very few centenarians who are purely vegan for their entire life because you can if you don't do it the right way build-up fatty acid deficits amino acid deficits creatine is one you don't get vitamin b12 DHA but at least has been studying on vegans right it's been a lot of studies on vegans and we know that if you eat like III live you know you or you can't you can supplement there's a lot of really smart vegans I mean those guys like roll right like they do things the right way right it's lapel G it's a lot easier to see the piece of meat right it's very to get some of the b12 and some of the other amino acid you're trying to free up by soaking and sprouting and fermenting which my wife does a lot of it but I watch her like she she's in the kitchen like three hours a day making vegetables bioavailable visually takes her hours to make sourdough bread you know to actually make a bread where the gluten is predigested and it's actually healthy and the glycemic index is lower she's not vegan she's just a rancher girl and she likes to do now it's definitely goats and chickens and and we eat meat but she she's very into like an ancestral preparation of vegetables you deactivating a lot of these these stressors that dr. Stephen Gundry talks about and you know before we poppies were talk about Tom Brady and how he does like a know nightshade know tomato know potato you know and and I'd rather eat those things but actually figure out a way to render them more digestible and friendlier to the human body yeah that's the other thing too when people talk about food that has protein in it you know like broccoli has so much protein true not really bioavailable to shit-ton broccoli yeah it's just not the same your body doesn't absorb it the same way it does a grass-fed ribeye steak yeah body absorbs that protein instantly you know exactly yeah by the way there was a study that just came out about stem cells they found that carnosine what you find in copious amounts in you know grass-fed ribeye steak with blue berry extract enhanced your stem cell production it was a hugely significant number I don't remember the exact percentage but but this combination of polyphenols and flavonoids with meat is a good combo that's why when I did the carnivore diet on not the carnivore diet that's why I was out when I was eating meat I was doing lots of salads I was doing lots of I had like wild blueberry extract powder I had these vegetable powders you know I was doing a lot of big salads for lunch flavonols polyphenols any of that yeah same thing with the high saturated fat diet a high saturated fat diet like the whole coconut oil thing is highly inflammatory in the absence of plant polyphenols and flavonoids which is why if you're doing a high-fat katatak diet it needs to be a plant rich high fat katatak diet otherwise you can get a lot of your files I mean avocados yes but I'm talking about more like you know doing you know coconut oil and butter and you know your avocado chocolate pudding and all these things your ketogenic fat bombs and all these recipes that are out there but got a lot of plants right even in the animal kingdom you see animals and they rip up another animal like a carnivorous animal they're in the intestines and they're eating a lot of the organs that are chock-full of what grass right plants herbs whatever that omnivorous animal that the carnivorous animal is eating predigested exactly when you're talking about carnivorous diets that the real issue that I have with it is there's almost no research other than dr. Baker doing those tests on himself which according to you are not very promising I have some friends that are trying it my friend Jordan Peterson his daughter had some serious anti some serious immune system issues see autoimmune disorders and like to the point where she's had a she's I believe she's like thirty thirty-one she's had a hip replacement of her ankles replaced like serious arthritis real problems the only thing that's been able to clear that up is meat just a pure meat diet right so it with some people but she might have some I wouldn't say Regis allergic reaction to plants well might be something the meat wasn't the medicine probably the elimination saying she might have some sort of a real serious problem some sort of allergic reaction to some plants or to gluten and maybe a bunch of weight a lot of these diets are right yeah it's the elimination yeah that's not the magic of just eating me mean but Shaun Baker keeps going on and on about how Mead heals and meet this and meet that all carnivorous diet and you know all these people are trying it like man it's got a lot of good stuff going for it but but restriction of plant matter in my opinion long term is not a good idea and eating meat all the time long term is not necessarily a good idea and eating only plants with the absence of some meat based protein is for a lot of populations not that great of an idea yeah well that's the point is that for most people you're gonna have to experiment a little to figure out what works best for you and there are people that especially if you use e3 live and algae and get your b12 vitamins and your fat soluble vitamins you can live off of vegan diet it can be done but you really have to be careful about it but then there's other people where they can't and and and you really have to figure out what the fuck is going on with you and Toni the whole carnivore think to me is kind of tweaking me out because I just don't it's like they start talking about the the the poisons and Fido toxins and all these things that are in plants that are bad for you I'm like okay so the mild hormetic exercise bad for you Sun lights bad exactly all that stuff cuz it's a climatic stressor is that your body responds to that and a positive wave and shows some of the some of the rodents outside of Chernobyl are living longer from the radiation and I'm not saying like go go move your cabinet next to a nuclear disaster website but the idea is that's a hormetic stressor right like mild amounts of UVA and UVB yeah every day I actually every single day I do cold every single day I do hot if I'm not in the sauna then I'm wearing more clothes and I would normally wear when I go to the gym to get my get my heart rate up and actually get myself into the discomfort of hot for the heat shock protein and the nitric oxide everything else that that does for you and the discomfort of cold because it's a hormetic stress or yeah they're doing tests right now at Harvard so it's fast yo guy and trying to figure out if hot yoga has the same hermetic stress response as sauna because they know there's been quite a bit of work done it's very equivalent physiologically yeah it's comedy I mean I don't do the full choreographed 90-minute Bikram yoga but I have one of these big saunas it's like it's a four person sauna and if I go in there by myself I can do fricken you know down dog and push-ups and I take these these cats who blood flow restriction devices in there and do push-ups and squats and those are the research behind those for muscle maintenance with bodyweight training it's very intriguing I travel with them everywhere these are these catsuit training devices and I just you know tie them like tourniquets around my arms and around my legs and they do a lot of studies and seniors for muscle maintenance without the need for as much a joint impact but what happens is you get micro damage to the capillaries you get a big release of lactic acid which causes you to produce more growth hormone after the workout I mean am I paying for a bodyweight training like you at this point katsu training like doubles yeah I've heard that before I haven't really gotten into it but I'm very big on the song that's the point we we have one here at the studio that I use all the time yeah I just think it's you know it's those stressors that they're talking about as being a negative thing with eating vegetables I just don't buy it I just don't buy people have been eating vegetables forever I don't think they're bad cess or in people like your friend with the immune system issue or people with leaky gut or dam there might be a period of time where you actually have to be careful and really careful right with gluten which is a digestive stress or and I get even that in small amounts is probably good for you they've even shown that kids who get gluten restricted when their kids wind up having more issues with gluten later on in life because their guts might be weak right but but yeah lectins and plant phytochemicals and a lot of things that plants use to poison mammals or to cause their their seeds to be undigested and pass out through the digestive tract and the stool of the mammals they can grow elsewhere a lot of that stuff really is you know it makes you stronger you ever have that coffee Kopi Luwak you ever have that stuff is it the stuff yeah the cat yes coffee and shits it out and then they take the coffee and sell it at this outrageous rate it's actually delicious it ferments and it's just remove coffee man it's very nice but just once due to black black ivory call try that shit I don't want to like support the hell I don't talk about lemurs you know I feel I don't it Selina I think it's all missing coffee beans from elephant poop sounds far more laborious than harvesting I get a giant shuttles or lemurs just hose it down get better bang for your buck yeah one little it's like a needle in a haystack right if it's just a few coffee beans elephant shit get jacked uh coffee duh elephant's chasing news you're digging through their shit chasing you through the field plus they probably shit like crazy just like a person to coffee give him some l-theanine air it is where's our coffee turd that's that's almost like a bunch of coffee bean with a few pieces of turd thrown yeah look at that BAM son their stool is almost Balinese Luwak coffee so they just feed them nothing but coffee and they shit it out sort of like we shit out corn you can't really digest it properly yeah there's a fermentation process that makes the bean taste better my problem that the carnivore diet is my same problem that I have with the vegan diet is it I don't think they're being scientific or objective about it I think it automatic it becomes an ideology yeah and the ideology is the meat meat heels and meats this meets that and meat is the thing and like no meat is one part of a good diet one part of a healthy diet and again for some people there's some people that have I'm sure you aware of the Lone Star tick you know about that right what about it do you know about meat allergies no lone Star tick is a tick that bites people and gives them an allergy to red meat it's horrible this is like a Texas yes yes but it's spreading spreading across the country all we have up in my land is a ticks that as long as you get them off within 24 hours that doesn't allow them to produce the saliva that would make them release their hold on your skin and it's that that produces yellow fever not the actual tick bite itself so you don't get a lot of lime up where I'm at but I've never heard of this long well I'm is much more prevalent in the East Coast it's starting to make its way out here there have been some Lyme cases out here in California but this lone Star tick is it's a real problem and it's giving people it's something called alpha-gal alpha-alpha of a short for alpha-gal alkaloid oh yeah that's a sugar so here it is it makes you allergic to hot dogs alpha glucose alpha 1 3 galactose alpha gal's the most of a million cell membranes so the allergy doesn't extend to nomina million meat poultry and seafood are all fine which is really interesting so you you can't you once you get this shit you're just you're allergic to this alpha galactose but you could eat ape and human meat according to the article yeah so you're not allergic to those one of the big I wonder if porn well mammalian that so qd8 yeah so if you want to go to the jungle and have what they call Bush yeah crazy okay speaking of meat ribeye steaks yes this is how to make these ribeye steaks taste really good so what I do on the rub is like a really coarse salt use a salt called Colima salt super high in minerals really kosher coarse know it's different they harvested from the Mexican coast and it tastes fabulous it's really good what's the only salts I travel with and nose is Colima salt and then this stuff yeah yeah I am CEO Li ma and black Kona salt black Kona salt from from Kona from Hawaii yeah I used that when I cook some of the meat from Hawaii just because it seems right does he use salt from from from the from the volcanoes in Hawaii so and I rub a Cayenne black pepper salt and then to reduce the the carcinogens that can form when he cook me either thyme or rosemary or both I just rub thyme or rosemary reduces carcinogen yeah they're notorious yeah they reduced they reduced the formation of I think they call them polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons easy just you know things that form on the meat when you blacken the meat because you want to get it a good crisp sear on the outside of the meat so it's nice and crunchy on the outside she restrict a lot of the the unhealthy effects of doing that when you get some kind of herb in there like that so you take out the meat gets room temperature you put this rub in you take a cast-iron skillet so I'm doing on the girl at all it's cast iron skillet you heat up the cast iron skillet in the oven and then you take it out of the oven and you put it on the stovetop you put the stovetop on medium-high and either use an extra virgin olive oil I've used lard before why do you well has a low flash point gives me a good footnote extra-virgin olive oil has a bunch of antioxidants in it so it's actually currencies it has higher resistance to the heat it's never burnt whenever an issue doesn't burn doesn't smoke but when they sear things well that's one thing they tell you is never use olive oil well I use extra virgin all I'm part of an olive oil Club so maybe it's because I have really good olive oil they shipped me three bottles of olive oil every quarter let's find that out because I've really read don't cook things at high heat with olive oil look it up even extra-virgin olive oil at this point all I can tell you is the shadow use this is speaking you're saying hi he said medium heat and this says medium heat to maybe that's the difference is the high heat maybe but when you're searing I would assume that it's kind of so-so it's it's not on there for very long anyways extra virgin olive oil into the pan you heat up the olive oil and you just you put it on for maybe two minutes max on the cast iron skillet you heat up the olive oil then you put the steak on and you do exactly for a perfect medium-rare three and a half minutes one side three and a half minutes the other side then you take it out this is where you get there probably about that thick what is that yeah we're on audio about so anyways the it's like when you asked me on the last podcast how big my dick got after that big so anyways the then you put it in to the oven you take that entire cast-iron skillet you put the oven on broil and you broil it for one minute on one side and then you turn it over and you do one minute on the other side and then you take it out of the oven and you finish it with butter meaning when you take it out of the oven you just take the steak off the cast iron skillet shove it aside just put on plate whatever and you take a pad of butter and you can infuse the butter you can you can use like garlic infused butter what I just use a plain old grass-fed butter put a pad of butter on the skillet you let the butter just get to the point where it's melted a little bit it's not super brown you put the steak back on top of the butter put the burner back on and you finish it one minute each side let it off let it rest three or four minutes that technique is the best technique for the most perfect steak mmm ever have it sounds really good sounds very good really good mostly what I do is the reverse sear method with a pellet grill I keep it at about 250 degrees you ever use a pellet grill mm-hmm I like about pellet grills is you're getting an appellate so you're essentially getting hardwood that's compressed so what when they cut hardwood like for this table it would take the oak and the sawdust they would compress into these small pellets and there's a bunch of different companies triggers a good one they they make one offering they have good girls yeah they have good girls and they also make one that you could use with an app what I like about it is you can control the temperature completely with your phone there's a thing called the Timberline it's one of their new ones so anyway you get these compressed pellets and they go into a hopper and then there it is right there that's uh what kind of that one a woodwind so see that's what our that's our pellet stove looked like when I was growing up so the pellets go into the hopper and then at the bottom there's a gear like a worm drive that feeds the pellets into that fire at the bottom comes from an element so the element and there's a fan so once it's lit the element shuts off and then the fire is stoked by this fan and it's all temperature controlled like very very precisely one of the good things what I like about this trigger that I've seen is that it seals up like like a Yeti cooler like it's very insulated and thick so it's really good at retaining the perfect temperature and again you can do it with your phone so I get it to 250 degrees then mostly what I'm cooking is wild game low fat content and so you don't you want to make sure you don't dry it out so I cook it at a low temperature I'm cooking at 250 degrees I get it to an internal temperature of a hundred and twenty then once it hits 120 I pull it out and you got to open up the grill to test your internal temp no I have now I have a wireless I have a wire yeah wire wireless thermometer that's connected to it and it's outside that sorry see that's like what my dry-aging fridge has and it's also it lets me know it gives me a beep when it hits 120 so I know you go and get it so I pull it out highly technical yes then I pull it out of there and I use this cast iron skillet as well but I cook with grass-fed butter so I take the cast iron skillet I put it probably the same temperature medium-high heat and again when I'm got the stake on the on the grill itself I'm using sea salt and crushed black pepper and garlic powder that's what I usually use no black can't extract no no I'm gonna try now though so then I take it off of there and then I use grass-fed butter in the cast iron skillet once it's heated up i sear it on both sides for about a minute and a half and then I let it rest depending if I'm ambitious sometimes I'll let it rest I'll cover it with aluminum foil and put it in a Yeti cooler and I'll let it sit in that yeti cooler for about 10 minutes and I pull it out and it is just it's not too cold after 10 minutes in the cooler right now it's in the Yeti cooler the Yeti cool we should have my wife bring shopping steaks Yoder Yoder pellet grill in the back a cast-iron pan yeah I mean that's the reverse sear method the idea is that I'm cooking it to a perfect internal temperature of 120 degrees which will raise both in the Yeti the Yeti cooler and also from the searing on the outside so once I get the cast-iron pan heated up to medium-high heat I throw that butter in there and i sear the shit out of the outside for again about a minute and a half both sides wrap it in foil put it in the Yeti cooler for 10 minutes it maintains its temperature and it continues slowly cooking mm-hmm so that it gives it somewhere around 135 ish which is what I like I take that back this is very precise this is even more precise Amanda this is like the sound effects is like cooking steak well I'm a big fan of these pellet grills because you get this real smoky flavor to your food that comes from hardwood but there's no chemicals mhmmm the compress the hardwood sawdust just with natural sugars the natural sugars in the sawdust and you know there's a bunch of different companies is Green Mountain grill makes a good grill I got a Yoder at home I really like again Trager is really good most of my friends are using triggers because the this temperature control thing and the apps are so good to be able to use it on your phone I'm a big fan yeah Wow it's amazing yeah I like the fact you kids good you said it and you can just walk the fuck away from it too and it's gonna smoke your meat at 250 degrees and it has a good rich that smoky flavor whether it's Hickory or cherry you know whatever you choose the only thing that I have to do I don't know why I'm like this with a steak because I still need to dip it in something mm-hmm you know in the same way that you dip a prime rib in horseradish so I used stone mustard I dipped my statement you know like the stone mustard with a little a little texture to it it's perfect it's perfect I know it's freaking the middle of the day on a Tuesday and I'm hungry don't you want to learn to maestro's last night had steak that's a good spot it was good I had a fascinating fascinating discussion about artificial sweeteners there with one of the guys who runs quest nutrition and who's talking he said no it wasn't Tom it was Ron Ron pennant and and he was drinking diet coke and we were talking about some of the studies out there on acesulfame potassium and the potential for at avner o toxicity or sucralose to cause things like you know microbiome issues and the death of bacteria in the gut and he was explaining how the amount of artificial sweeteners used in that study was just way far in excess of what you get from a diet soda and that what they call the in cretin response like like that that spiking of the appetite that is attributed sometimes to the consumption of artificial sweeteners only occurs in people who aren't used to artificial sweetener consumption and once they've kind of gotten into like a like a diet coke habit that now this is all britain is like 12 hours ago drinking diet coke and i do know they use artificial sweeteners some of their bars and so yeah some of that plane is but he said you could take a shower in diet coke and you wouldn't get sticky because there's that that's such a small amount of artifice it's like a dusting of artificial sweeteners mhm so it actually it's it's it's making I haven't delved into the research yet but it's at least made me think last night about reconsidering my stance because what I usually do is I just use use stevia and like Pellegrino like my refrigerator just full of Pellegrino never tries even as I do a lot I love disease I love that shit yeah I drink this shit oh that's like I'm trouble the other day because I'm someone dizzy I was doing that Spartan live feed announcing and they're sponsored by a fit aide right and they cut to Cameron at a big old CEO there were supposed to be pretending or drinking take the TV adown fitted I don't know it's it's I think it's a god proteolytic enzymes in it I think that's the main thing I could be confusing that would kill cliff let's see how a lot of flies off yeah we got a bunch of those as protein which are great they break down fibrinogen they're wonderful for recovery these enzymes and I don't know how many of them they have just like that a blood orange kill cliff mmm as a marinade for wild pork holy baby Jesus really whoa that's like beer town chicken well that's one of the things I wonder if that's because well proteolytic enzymes one of the reasons they work is they break down fibrinogen and they're almost like an enzyme right that same thing if you have no marinade and nothing and all the tenderizing meat you get your digestive enzymes you're you're on it gut pack or whatever you have around and you break open the capsules and you sprinkle that on top of the meat it's like yeah like a you know pre suggest a almost rightly yeah lemon and lime and fish it's a phenomenal marinade for meat that's poke lip orange some blessing kill cliff is it just so good - yeah it's just so so delicious and you're getting very little sugar yeah no it's just it's just deliciousness I like it yeah yeah but I go with Pellegrino Pellegrino is it's less acidic than Perrier and it has a lot of sodium bicarbonate in it does I don't know if you looked in these studies on baking soda for athletic performance and its ability to be able to buffer lactic acid really it's a potent gege genic aid but the problem is that it causes gut distress when you take as much as they use in a lot of these studies and so more more and more what the studies are doing is you're dosing right with with small amounts of baking soda for two to three hours leading into your workout so my philosophy is this if Pellegrino has pretty high levels of sodium bicarbonate in it which it does it's got more sodium bicarbonate in it than any of the other bottled waters like twice as much as Gerald Steiner and you know any of these other waters out there I'm kind of dosing with a little bit of a lactic acid buffer all day long so anytime I want to jump into a workout I'm able to push myself a little bit harder do you notice it for the rain yeah I know of zero Pellegrino Studies on this but do you notice a difference physically between not feel amazing when I drink that stuff oh really I drink that and I drink this it's it's hydrogen enriched water molecular hydrogen this this foundation called the molecular hydrogen foundation they do Studies on the anti-inflammatory in antioxidant potential of water that has a lot of hydrogen ions in it it's called hydrogen rich water and the cool part about that is that and I the only other thing I know of that can do this are green tea polyphenols is they act as an anti-inflammatory post exercise without blunting the hormetic response that positive beneficial stressful response we were talking about with exercise and so you you can have your cake and eat it too right you get your antioxidants you shut down inflammation and it doesn't blunt in this case the hormetic response to exercise would be the proliferation of satellite cells in the production of new mitochondria which why you shouldn't take a bunch of vitamin C and vitamin E and some of these high antioxidant compounds post-workout same reason you shouldn't do a cold bath post-workout and the idea is that hydrogen rich water allows you to shut down inflammation what's that why shouldn't you take a cold bath pulse workout and is there a there's a certain period of time where they think you should you could but it's just for for is like some people say I'd it don't take don't jump into the cold baths 15 minutes I wrote an hour I wait two or three hours and I don't I don't know if if Rhonda's basing that on research or if it's an extrapolation or what but I wait a couple hours now that the the exception to that rule is that if you exercise any closer than three hours to bedtime it elevates body temperature to the point where it affects your deep sleep cycles right so and one reason for that is because your core temperature is elevated so for me if I do an evening workout and I do you know hard later afternoon early evening workouts quite often I will still take a cold shower I actually have a giant call I bought one of those endless pools you know like those Fitness pools that you swim in and I keep it out in the forest behind my house and it's just chock-full of cold wall yeah we talked about that job in there I love that idea but it decreases your core temperature and allows you to sleep better later on if you do that after an evening workout so even though it probably restricts the efficacy of the workout a little bit let's just lie yeah my reasoning is I'm gonna sleep way better and any the benefits I get from a good solid night's sleep outweigh any loss of benefit from decreasing a little bit of that mitochondrial density and and satellite cell proliferation so when you're doing this late night work how far like how long before you sleep what research is shown is that it's ideal to finish a hard workout within three hours before bedtime if you don't want to if you don't want to sleep to mess up your sleep exactly but with you cold baths you can probably mitigate some of the and I go to bed pretty early I usually go to bed about by usually 9:30 9:45 I'm in bed reading and I'm asleep around 10:00 10:30 so if I'm not finishing up a workout to like 7:30 which is the case sometimes you not finish work I'm not getting into the workout until like 6:45 7:00 like sometimes I'm working out closer to bedtime in three hours so in that case I'll do the cold shower did a podcast recently with dr. Matthew Walker about sleep and it's kind of changed the way I feel about sleep and the importance of it and how much how much you need I used to think you could just power through and get through with like 3-4 hours at night you'd be fine you can yeah well there's there's exceptions to that and some people have this I think is the dc2 gene that allows you to actually get by on a lot less sleep some members of the population have that gene it's a very small member of the population small moon but furthermore there's this guy named dr. little Nick little Hales is his name I could have really messed up little Hales anyways he's um he's got this concept he works with a lot of these European soccer teams and what he looks at is not the seven to nine hours of sleep not how many hours of sleep per night you get but the number of sleep cycles right from stage one to stage five sleep that you get throughout the course of the week meaning you're supposed to get 31 to 35 sleep cycles over seven days and so you might get three sleep cycles one night and five sleep cycles another night and he also I haven't seen research to back this up but this is what he does with his athletes is he counts a twenty to thirty minute power nap as a sleep cycle so technically you could sleep for hours one night and then you could do a eight-hour sleep night on a Saturday and a 20-minute nap on a Sunday and then you add up all your sleep cycles and you can use any self quantification device to if you want to actually measure how many times you're cycling during and during a night of sleep and you look at that instead of am I getting a consist than seven to nine hours of sleep at night look at the total sleep I literally just wrote an article about this this morning on my website you said this is a podcast with Matthew Walker because he's pretty in depth about what is what's recommended and why and the risk of Alzheimer's for people to get less than five hours sleep at night and fog I'm asleep hog but what are you getting every night I am four 24-hour cycles getting about eight hours which means like if I sleep seven hours I take a twenty to forty five-minute nap and that sounds perfect I'm a big Napper and my naps are very elaborate well you're also you workout extremely hard yeah I mean I'm not I'm not working out as hard to some of these pro athletes who are enjoying like ten hours of sleep a night right but for the average person all these normal tech boots that I lay in these these gradated compression boots that kind of move the the compression from the ankle all the way up to the hips yeah and I lay on this bio mat which is like laying on a warm teddy bear it's like this mat that makes infrared rays so it's like an infrared radiation mat almost like a sauna and then I've got these these binaural no not binaural beats it's it's an artificial intelligence based audio that confuses your brain and lols you into this this total state of relaxation it's called brain fm so I lay on my back and I've got the boots on and have the mat on and I notice every time I'm sounding like a like a princess now but I have I have an assistant who lives in my house and she really helps out with a lot of stuff she does the banking and she helps out with bringing stuff to the post office and you know she's just she's just there whenever I need her to do stuff and you know she helps up she's back home with the kids right now so she's just kind of like a live-in assistant and everyday about 12:30 or 1:00 she goes up to my bed she lays out the biomass she plugs it in she pushed it on my temperature she lays out the Norma tech foots she pushed the pillow out with a sleep mask in the headphones and then I just go up there after lunch and I lay down for about 45 minutes and I'm just dead to the world that's pretty sweet setup yeah it's a good setup that's it finally live it's a good person like that the trust yeah exactly so the idea was sleep though is yeah if you if you nap and if you pay closer attention to the number of sleep cycles that you get each week I think that's more important than getting like seven to nine hours a night how would you know how many sleep cycles once you're monitoring it yeah and the rings pretty accurate I mean it's uh it's not as accurate as a sleep lab study but it's it's accurate Kevin Rose try to get me to wear one of those things yeah it's big they've got another one that's smaller but it seems like exactly I need a lot of necklaces and bling to go along with it but it works I found it in Finland like four years ago and I bought it and I've really been using it ever since it does like my sleep there it is oh that's yeah that's that's the littler one the smart I don't think I should get more restorative whatever oh yeah yeah the more o you I wish I'd have invested in the company because they seem to be like everywhere now mmm and how does it help they were I was at a Finland biohacking conference and there was this tiny little table with one guy at its long as a little ring and all of a sudden it's just like kind of diamond now those diamonds I don't what is that light I don't know if they're real what's that ring they trying to say it's bling that's bling mm-hmm what's diamond bringing it up no but it's kind of cool because you can pull up your body temperature during the night so a woman could use this to track or cycles it will tell you your heart rate variability which I used to measure every morning when I wake up I look at my parasympathetic and my sympathetic nervous system score and then I'd be able to tell if I should go hard workout that day or well now the Rings it measures it all during the night right like it does five-minute measurements throughout the night while I'm asleep so I wake up I can get a running average on your smartphone or and then it pairs that with like how hard I worked out the day before my heart rate my body temperature and then it tells me here's your readiness score so if my readiness score is I like 60% then I'm gonna go in the sauna and do yoga right and if my readiness scores like 90 I'll do I'll go out and do the obstacle course in my house and swing kettlebells and and beat up the body a little bit more so it's pretty useful does it ever end up good I've never seen that 100 what would that mean like Wow why wouldn't it be that if I took a two-hour nap on those probably up to a hundred those norman tech boots they sent up to me i said to my friend cam i don't Cameron Haines yeah but he were he runs a lot the Paley good have you seen their haven't armed them for the arms and the hips to you come Marshmallow Man what does it do I would imagine if you do a lot of upper-body activity like maybe you're a pitcher maybe a swimmer yeah boxer someone who's doing a lot of upper body activity that the arms would be efficacious there it is yeah they look kind of silly and they're kind of hard to get on by yourself yeah so I would say be one more thing for my assistant to have to help me with what is it doing again it's gradated compression so it's apparently a form of compression that they've patented unlike a lot of the other boots out there to wear it the first time it inflates it measures the diameter of your limbs and then it bases every subsequent compression to be customized to the diameter or the girth of your limbs and pump the blood in this case if you're wearing the feet or the leggings from your ankles all the way up to your hips you got a picture of them it was at Loma chenko and those those earlier pictures no it was another one earlier than that it works I mean your legs feel lives of feather after you use them yeah and so this compression like as it's doing the the compressing what is it doing to the legs by just compressed just pumping it's pumping blood up up and away from all the extremities and and smoking it around better is that the idea no it's moving it back up to your heart just circulating blood throughout your body yeah hmm so it's almost like an additional heart it's like a massage massage the heart is not a pump then it's not like an additional sure abortion yeah anyways though so it's they work though and they're incredibly relaxing it's a it's almost like someone's massaging you nothing to do watch TV with yeah well you can kill two birds with one stone you can do that oh wow he's got the full meal deal this guy has he cries oh honey he's got legs on now this is a little bit could it could get expensive to do that cuz now you gotta have to inflation units rather than just one because you can't plug them all in at once so that's a spendy setup but that's the UFC featherweight chant one we did well if he's the UFC featherweight champion he can afford the Cadillac of Marshmallow Man suits well he's at a Honolulu cryotherapy get his freak on that's what a lot of these crowd therapy centers have knows they've got the walking cryotherapy they've got the Norma Tec boots they've got the vibration platform so you can lose weight while you're standing there in the vibration platform yeah burn a lot of fat what do you think about those things those ultrasonic things you know I'm talking about what are those called turbo Sonics you ever seen those very vibration plus yeah they go through like a whole cycle I was in Park City I did one of those yeah great day I had to go take a shit right after yeah seriously no I'm serious I was on that thing for like eight minutes and I said excuse me and and I had a glorious dump afterwards so I have I have a mini trampoline at my house and I jump up and down on that thing in the mornings and it gets everything moving yeah that's like my one-two combo for having a really good dump in the mornings there's this herbal blend called tri fela TR i ph ala and i put about a half teaspoon of that into a cup and it's super bitter so I put some stevia in there or something to sweeten it up a little bit then I pour the hot water over that and you have that at night right before you go to bed and you wake up in the morning and you could use a vibration platform you could do the the Tai Chi bouncing that's another thing some people will do or just kind of bounce up and down like this skip Girls movement or you can you can jump on a trampoline probably skip rope too and it that one-two combo just gets things moving amazingly yeah have a couple double espressos before that yeah Hawaiian I do I did a cup of coffee in the morning I don't put anything in my coffee but my my protocol for staying lean your ride is because I used to be 215 pounds and I had to shed a lot of weight to get into Ironman Triathlon so that an Ironman Triathlon for about eight years and the way that I stayed lean for races would get up in the morning and you have a cup of coffee or green tea my because both of those can help to mobilize fatty acids from adipose tissue and you do this when you're in that fasted state that I was talking about right so you wake up after a 12 to 16 hour fast and you take the cup of coffee or the green tea and then you go exercise or move aerobic Li for whatever time you have available at 20 to 45 minutes doesn't have to be that long and the reason that you do it aerobic Li is because when you wake up in the morning you already have a lot of cortisol in your system alright there's there's no need to just stress yourself either even more by doing a very hard workout I like to ease my way in today I like a non stressful morning unless I've got a very busy day and I know that I'm not gonna get a hard workout at any other time I save my hard work out for the later afternoon or early evening when your body temp Peaks and your grip strength Peaks and your post-workout reaction time or your post-workout protein synthesis Peaks your your reaction time Peaks like like your body is very equipped to do a hard workout in the afternoon of the evening more than it is in the morning well the way you can really tell is Jiu Jitsu my jujitsu training in the morning I'm way weaker I just don't feel the same yeah in the afternoon you have much more energy yeah exactly so the the idea is also when you do a hard workout in the morning you get a lot of times post-workout caloric compensation meaning you just want to eat everything in sight until frigging lunch you're just you're just hungry and part of it's probably physical because you empty your glycogen stores more quickly and part of it probably as mental right like I fucking punished it this morning I dress I deserve to you know have have a few extra slices of bread for lunch so the the idea is I get up I do the coffee and then I'll do the 20 to 45 minutes of easy movement and that might be the yoga in the sauna it'll be a walk in the sunshine so I'm getting my vitamin D and I'll do like breath work you know where I'll breathe in through my nose and do breath hold so I'm still kind of making my body better but I'm not stressing it out with a lot of eccentric muscle tissue damage and then I finish up that whole session with a cold shower so I'm getting a lot of those benefits of white adipose tissue to brown fat conversion in the absence of any inflammation right inflammation and calories keep the white fat from getting converted into brown fat which is what you want when you do a cold shower or cold soak or some kind of cult thermogenesis and I did I'm able to stay super lean with that protocol you get up caffeine aerobic exercise in a fasted state you finish up with a cold and I mean even if you weren't working out you can stay pretty lean with that type of protocol and this is what you did specifically to try to lose weight to go from when you were buying bill I did it originally to just shed muscle and then I would do really long catabolic chronic cardio endurance workouts which are not that great for you all right but I was just linked you know I would goes tomorrow Rhys yeah yeah exactly yeah so while you were doing this we you calorie restricting as well like TVs I was calorie restricting you could go to bed at night you'd be staring at the ceiling hungry its yeah trying to lose weight ratio your body starts eating yourself now for these for these fasted workouts if you are going to a fasted hard workout in the morning you can state you can stay anabolic but relatively non-insulin a genic without spiking your blood glucose too heavily with something like amino acids all right so that's like a lot of people will do a branch chain amino acid or an essential amino acid you elevate your blood levels of amino acids it keeps you anabolic it allows you to stave off central nervous system fatigue keeps you from shedding too much muscle and you just spike your blood levels of amino acids and then go into your workout and you could even throw something like ketones in the mix too so that's like a very high pole or Quay to get a pre-workout sup in without actually getting a lot of calories and at the same time we were talking before the podcast about we're talking about different athletes and diets and things along those lines and you were saying that you don't think it's a good idea for a pro athlete particular like a basketball player to be on a ketogenic comedogenic diet yeah I I don't think that a strict ketogenic diet is a good strategy I think that a cyclic ketogenic diet would be the way to go for something like that yeah Zac bitter that's exactly what I do is all eat almost zero carbohydrates the entire day plants starches fats I think I told you about my morning smoothie the last time I was on and it's just you know like coconut milk and bone broth and these precursors to nad which is another very that probably next to stem cells is one of the most potent anti-aging protocols that you can engage in nad stands for now nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is what that is and I can tell you about that in a second after I'll just briefly tell you about this cyclic ketogenic diet basically it's all plants all fats no carbs or very low carbs the entire day and then in the evening and this is where the beauty of that scenario I talked about earlier fits in because you've done your your hard afternoon or early evening workout so your glute 4 transporters are very up regulated your very insulin sensitive in any carbohydrates that you do eat are far more likely to be shuttled into muscle or liver glycogen rather than hanging around the bloodstream causing inflammation or rather than being you know shuttled to the liver and convert it into triglycerides you're basically using the carbohydrates that you do eat at the end of the day to sock away energy for the next day's hard glycolytic ly demanding workout and so basically you're teaching your body how to be a fat-burning machine all day long you're restricting any amount of glycemic variability all day long assuming you're not doing the carnivorous diet because high amounts of meat you know it's it's it's gluconeogenesis I clogged Lou coast but you're essentially doing lots of plants moderate amount of fats and you know some amount of protein but but not a crazy amount of protein all day long and then with dinner you know will do you know just to make sourdough bread and while sweet potato fries I might you know my kids will make rice cakes you know dark chocolate red wine any of that stuff is all in the evenings so that refills your glycogen stores for anything explosive and demanding and then you just rinse wash and repeat the next day so that's a cyclic ketogenic diet now this is cyclic one individual 24-hour session but are you experiencing states of ketosis during the day absolutely sort of absolutely I so I have a device called a level in my office le VL and it's a breath ketone device it's just quicker and more convenient than a blood stick it's also long-term it's a good proxy it's a good approximation le v le VL there's another one called the ketone X and you can get you know just like a you know a ketone monitor a blood ketone monitor but if people don't want to do a blood prick every day you know I type I have the band-aids on the fingers when I'm trying to write ends on my lap tis just it's easier for me just breathe into a tube when I walk my office I'm easily yeah yeah so scared how this has become such a massive part of culture these days is measuring your ketones just constantly hear people talking about and it's so fatty bad now you know yeah I get it that's funny fatty anyway I mean it I just said and I had to explain what I was saying is it sounded weird to me anyways though the the cyclic ketogenic diet allows you to be back in the state of ketosis by that morning easily and then you just basically maintain that all day long then you refuel on carbohydrates at the end of the day mmm and then there was another question that you asked Oh about nad that's something completely different but that but that's a cyclic ketogenic diet that so works so your body having those carbohydrates at night knocks you out of ketosis right when you're when you're eating the yeah your blood glucose will rise you're not going to be shuttling a lot of acetyl co a which is the precursor to ketones in the ketone generation and then you're going through 16-hour fasting so then you have a 12 to 16 our fasting cycle you get up you do the fasted morning aerobic workout a cold shower a little bit of coffee or green tea and it's a perfect scenario ptosis it works perfect I'm telling you you start your day off like that and then you end your day with the carbohydrates that's your the hard afternoon workout the easy morning workout and it like for for metabolism for body composition for for maintaining fitness for teaching yourself how to be a fat-burning machine while still refilling the body the carbohydrate stores it's a beautiful scenario also I just think there's some there's some benefit and enjoying what you eat to not constantly worrying about your glucose levels and ketones and all that stuff I mean I don't think there's anything wrong with having a little bread or a little pasta or sometimes there's nothing wrong with it and that I mean it's also my beef with with the carnivore diet yes you know I like sweet potato fries and I like you know I like cauliflower rice I like you know all sorts of different plants and vegetables now this um this nad you can get these injections or IVs now and it is something that enhances your own stem cell proliferation but it is one of the most potent anti-aging molecules you can put into your body in terms of decreasing the rate at which your telomeres shorten so you've probably heard a lot of these sirtuin rich foods like blueberries and cacao and chocolate and resveratrol and a lot of them work but the most powerful of any of these is nad and your nad to NADH ratio is highly reflective of your telomere health and these are the most horribly painful and uncomfortable injections or IVs you would you'll ever get in your life you can you can do it orally there's a there's a capsule there's companies like Elysium and Nyugen that sell nr I think that's the nicotinamide nicotinamide rai beside it's a precursor to nad but it doesn't hold a candle to just mainlining it into your bloodstream how do you get it we're gonna do so one way to do it is in a medical clinic you can get a six to eight hour IV bring a laptop and you work away and some people do this on a monthly basis just six to eight hours of any it's a long drip some of the guys down on it do it and they'll have a nurse come in and push it a little more quickly that's like an hour long IV is it just beneficial to do it short like that it's way more uncomfortable shorter you get the more uncomfortable it gets because you're pushing this stuff into your bloodstream more quickly and it feels like your whole body is on fire I mean you have to box breathe and close your eyes and meditate painful it's it's like we were done DMT mm-hmm it's like DMT but you're on fire and and getting punched in the gut at the same time and you feel like your hearts gonna explode really and then you finish and you feel like Superman you feel like you have more energy on less sleep your workouts are better I mean it's one of the it's like fish oil where when you take a bunch of fish oil you just kind of keep your fingers crossed that it's working it's not like you can feel fish oil and you want to go destroy the world it's even better than black ant extract so there's you can get it too you can so I get it shipped to my house and I do a self-administered push IV I do the same thing with Meyers cocktails so I just I shove a butterfly needle into my vein and then I push this very very slowly and you can even chase it with the Myers cocktail which enhances the effectiveness of it meaning you can do like a an nad and this is a common protocol in a lot of anti-aging clinics or a lot of you know like alternative health clinics is you do the nad injection and you follow it up with the Myers cocktail and you feel like Superman and Myers cottage that's just vitamins I just like you know vitamin E if you its IV infusion of vitamin B and sometimes a little nootropics and they're like lithium and stuff like that it's too much to remember man oh but it's how do you keep shaking your head I'm a complete idiot about anything except health and nutrition and fitness huh like I don't know I don't watch TV and and I don't follow politics or anything like good for you I just keep the poison out yes exactly it's like Sherlock Holmes when Watson tells us him him his name and he he says I'm gonna work hard to forget that because doesn't want anything cluttering up his head at all right from his sleuthing so is there an nad place in LA where are you gonna do this yes there I was speaking with somebody yesterday about this and he asked me if I could find a clinic and I found one in Beverly Hills hmm and it's probably an a.1 of the long IV so you want to wait till we have some computer work to do and you can sit on your laptop and just kind of get stuff done six to eight hours or you could just listen to pause you can push it in in about 15 to 20 minutes and you can have a nurse practitioner do this and then there's some clinic so we'll do it's called a push IV and nad push IV this beneficial just more painful I'm doing this once a week now and it's painful 10 to 20 minutes of my entire week but you you feel amazing and I'm I'm testing my telomere length with this company called tell o years they there's another one I have forget the name of the other company attest your telomere length there's only a couple out there so it tests the rate at which your telomeres are shortening and the two things that have had the most profound effect on my results from that test have been the stem cell injections intravenously and the NAD injections my biological age right now which started off at an age of 37 when I was 34 and then decreased to 35 when I tested again at 36 years old I just tested at 30 years old on my biological age is 20 in terms of the rate at which my telomeres are shortening and the only two things that have changed I've been the stem cell injections and the nad injections didn't forgive me I illogical age you can reverse your biological age now there is some side effects know that like so the telomere test ISM is a test of your white blood cell telomere length which is not reflective of every cell in your body right so so technically it's it's not like a it's not an ironclad test with a ton of research behind it but it's an approximate corollary to your biological age it's the best we have right now to be able to test telomere lengths but I'm not going to pretend like it's it's a it's a gold standard test and I'm not aware of a gold standard test for telomere length but I can tell you that I feel amazing and that telomere length is shortening and those nad injections just make you feel like Superman so do you think it's a combination of the things or D would you treat it more to have the NAD it's the problem with this shit I do dude yeah and there's and there's stuff you can do to enhance your own endogenous stem cell production we're talking about meat and I told you about that study with the we're we talking about the carnosine and the blue moon extract that's one chlorella is another colostrum is fantastic for that for endogenous stem cell health coffee berry fruit extract that's another really fascinating one you can buy that on Amazon as a powder and I put a lot of this stuff in my morning smoothie now so when I wake up you know I've got chlorella I've got DHA I've got this this stuff called POW d'arco bark tea which also enhances your own nad production colostrum bone broth vitamin C to enhance the bone broth uptake so you can kind of make yourself a little a little cocktail of ingredients you just take in the morning without necessarily spending you know eight thousand bucks on a stem cell and extraction and injection have you thought about like having some sort of an online thing where people could subscribe to a protocol and you would you know what I thought about doing was just making like a like a supplement or something like that like where you could take all this stuff and just combine it into a shake or into some kind of a supplement some sort of a powder or something yeah and and I mean some some people who don't understand the supplement industry formulation so why don't you just put all this stuff in the capsule but I mean did you one compound can decrease the absorptive ility of the other compound or you know one compound will create and you know acidic or alkaline scenario in which the other one doesn't work well so it wouldn't hire a lot of testing but ultimately you know at this point I just blend it all in a blender and kind of keep my fingers crossed and dump it all into my big-ass mug and it seems like you know someone like you who knows so much about this stuff it would be a great resource if people could subscribe to something and you guys could put together some sort of a protocol for people that would fought they could follow but on a daily basis you know you're creating more work for me yeah but but it would the problem is genetic variability right like this whole high-fat diet and you know I saw yesterday that you tweeted out you know my friend Nina Tyco Holtz's you know data you know encouraging the you know high saturated fat intake and I love her and I love her approach I love the idea that she is getting a lot of people you know via the lobbying to to focus less on grains and a high carb diet which i think is helpful for a lot of people but at the same time there are there are genes where I like the PPAR 1 alpha gene which would cause a little bit of an inflammatory response to high intake of fats or to a lot of saturated fats without a lot of poly or monounsaturated fats there I think the last time that we talked we talked about familial hypercholesterolemia right where some people if they shift to a ketogenic or a high-fat diet it screws them from a metabolic standpoint because they get not only high cholesterol but you know high particle count and and oxidation of that cholesterol there's there's there's ways around that you know for example like a Katahdin diet would be what you'd consume if you were if you were eating or if you had this familial hypercholesterolemia where you need a lot of tubers and fish and coconut meat and wild plants and that's technically like a 70 to 80 percent carbohydrate based diet not with a lot of grains you know not with a lot of junk food but that would be a diet more appropriate for someone with that issue someone with a PPAR gene issue they'd want to eat less of the coconut oil and the butter and the cheeses and more of like the avocados and the extra virgin olive oil more of the Mediterranean diet approach you know I mentioned earlier the the fact that coconut oil and a lot of these saturated fats and a lot of people are inflammatory so they would want to eat a lot of a lot of antioxidants and flavonoids phenol rich you know small non sugary berries and dark leafy greens and so yeah again you could have a subscription-based service that teaches people a lot of these things but then once again you got to have either artificial intelligence that screening each person to look at what they actually need or you've got a real person talking to each person looking at their labs and saying okay this is the one that would work well for you rather than just saying okay this this has been smoothie everybody should be drinking this yeah I went to this one thing one so they monitored my blood and I abandoned it immediately because they told me I shouldn't have avocados I'm like what are you talking about yes that's an IgG food allergy test and the problem is that you produce a lot of these immunoglobulins to foods that you eat a lot so people and they do this test they walk out depressed with their tail between their legs because they can't have avocados and eggs anymore just because they were eating a shit ton of avocados and eggs these right yeah there's one called a Cyrax food allergy panel it's a little more you don't get this huge laundry list of foods that give you false positives it's a pretty accurate test license I use knew it was nonsense so it's like I feel great I eat avocados all the time this can't be anything other than nonsense yeah yeah well it's not nonsense I mean they simply add the immunoglobulin reaction to avocados and there's no bodies in the streets and no evidence that that's gonna actually hurt you yeah that's the problem it's just you would have to go on some sort of a very neutral diet for a long period of time get your body's baseline established exactly your bloodwork it'll break away whatever rice for a month and then get it taken you know proteins at all and even then what would that do your blood like a washout like a 5 day fast and that's that new Valter Longo longevity diet is you do I think it's five over the No once a quarter five-day fasts right to clean you out to get all the benefits of cellular automata and with that particular diet you know I was talking before about how long-term calorie restriction is is bad for you you know and this whole idea of intermittent fasting with caloric restriction creates hormone deficits and associated with like gall stones and all sorts of nasty things happen to your body when you don't give it enough calories what about long term like you know when people go on those five-day fasts like Dom long does approach is you do a five-day fast just a few times a year and I think in active individuals as athletes he only recommends like two or three times a year max that you do this five-day fast and you put it in an offseason or a recovery phase or some period of time where you're not training heavily and that scenario would allow you to get a lot of the cellular Tov gene the cleanup benefits and theoretically you could do that right and then go get your food allergy tests right and see what kind of proteins are floating around here and you're doing a 24-hour fast how often what works for me because I don't do well not even for five days I'm too active like I just have too much shit going on all like there aren't many times during the year when I could point out a five-day slot in my schedule where I'm not hunting or competing or working out or doing something that requires me to need calories or all so I'm just gonna I'm already skinny right I can't go for a long time without eating and my metabolism is sky-high so what I do is a 12 to 16 hour fast everyday not a calorically restricted fast but just twelve to sixteen hours without eating every single day on the lower activity days I take in less protein and I restrict meat that's one of the days when I'm not beating on my body too much like a Wednesday and a Sunday which are more recovery days those are the days when I do you know freaking I close myself love day so I like I do clay masks and coffee enemas I'm therapy like so I'm still oh so odd 2 4 4 4 up regulating your own glutathione production your by up it like you feel clean as a whistle plus it's the best way to get coffee up your butt there's no other way you do you need a lot of caffeine absorption to know but I'm I'm serious like if you've never done something like that and experience what it feels like to just be completely cleaned out it's a pretty good feeling so what's the do do the coffee enema not only cleans out your colon but it causes your liver and your gallbladder specifically to increase bio production it up regulates your glutathione production your endogenous glutathione production and so you're increasing your own production of antioxidants and it also causes peristalsis why she just move stuff through that's kind of moving slowly so once a week Wednesday mornings I get up my wife makes coffee every morning I ever make an extra pot let's leave that out in the counter so it gets to room temperature and normally when I'm drinking my coffee I'm going throw my morning research and articles and everything down to my of a standing desk in the basement but instead I go and I lay on my right side on the bathroom floor and I keep coffee in there for about 20 minutes while I'm working and then I get up and you just let it all out and so you lay on you feel glorious coffee in your butt I get a stainless steel and I'm a bucket so you know plastics so you're not injecting plastics but and then you it's about a quart or so of coffee in the back side with this tube it's a lot of coffee Jesus and then you lay on your right side for 20 minutes and then you get up and you let it all out and and of course I have a squatty potty so it comes out quite easily of course you know have that kink and got one of those and everything comes out and you just you walk away just like whistling with a big smile on your face squatty potty is legit I feel wonderful the squatty probably works it really should be shitting into a hole in the ground when I don't have one I perch do my best dump so when I'm hunting or camping or you know you hold onto a tree and kind of do it look at the whole person and it's perfect so so on those days that I'm doing coffee enemas or sauna or any my weird woowoo things that don't involve workouts I do protein restriction because I'm not beating up my body that much coffee enema doesn't cause a lot of eccentric muscle tissue damage unless you've done something horribly wrong so I basically have those days as my lower protein days and then once a week and this would be unless I'm traveling because it's hard to do any travel I do it 24-hour fast Saturday at dinner you stop eating sleep all night all you gotta do is skip breakfast on Sunday and skip lunch on Sunday and then have dinner on Sunday night and that's pretty easy to do and so I get the benefits of the longer fast right because a lot of those cellular automata and in Dodge stem cell production benefits don't kick in and tell you about 16 hours in alright so I get that benefit once a week even though for me really it comes out to about twice a month that I'm actually at home because I travel so much doing that full 24-hour fast and I do a lot of work that day I play with my kids I just fill things in throughout that day to keep my appetite satiated and sometimes I'll do some of those new ketone esters and sometimes we'll do some amino acids or you know a cup of bone but that doesn't count as breaking your fats kinda sorta cheating but it's it's it's like it's a speed bump for a skinny you know high metabolism guy like me to have like a cup of forty calorie bone broth in the middle of the day the bone broth or a fast the ketone esters also break your fast they're a caloric yeah technically you know from from just appear you know very simple physiology standpoint your body would need to utilize those ketones for energy before it would you know turn some of your own acetyl co a derive from your fat into extra ketones but I just like the way I feel while I'm fasting using these these especially like the newer ketone esters and that's why on those aren't you supposed to take them with glucose no no no you are going to get a huge performance advantage by taking them with glucose but that's also it's it's an ancestrally inappropriate state for the human body to have simultaneously elevated levels of blood glucose and elevated levels of blood ketones because traditionally we'd have elevated our blood ketones through fasting and while I'm okay with elevating blood ketones via a non ancestral roots such as the consumption of these ketone esther's designed you know by the US Department of Defense for soldiers in battle have to go two or three days without eating or for you know Tour de France riders have been using them for a while the idea of consuming glucose along with those ketones and spiking blood glucose which can have a little bit of an inflammatory oxidative effect is not something I would do unless I were it like in a race or in a really hard demanding workout that's where something like that you can you can use like rocket fuel and that's actually a very good mix some kind of like a fructose maltodextrin which the Gatorade Sports Science Institute is shown allows you to get a really high absorption of carbohydrates rather than you know just multi dextran or just glucose or just fructose then you adding keto nesters on top of that and then to stave off what's called central nervous system fatigue the crossing of tryptophan into the brain which kind of makes you feel you know turkey dinner sleepy effect during exercise you throw essential amino acids into that so you've got amino acids ketones and glucose and that mix is just pure rocket fuel yeah you talked about that last time you said it was like being on steroids that having glucose in your system with ketones is just fucking crazy yeah yeah it's it's it's pretty amazing mm-hmm now when you go on these fasts if you drink coffee does coffee break your fast coffee or the consumption of anything from a circadian biology right 24-hour circadian rhythm you've got multiple circadian rhythm cues one is movement so when you travel and you're jet-lagged movement helps you normalize your biological clock another is light alright so exposure to high amounts of morning sunlight or using one of these newfangled hacking devices like that like the eye light or the inner light that's another circadian cue eating or really the consumption of anything supplements coffee tea etc that's also a circadian cue there's a researcher dr. Sachin panda who's got some really good research on circadian rhythmicity and what he says is that the consumption of anything can disrupt circadian biology if you're fasting for the purposes of regulating your circadian rhythms maybe you've got insomnia poor sleep patterns inflammation due to lack of sleep or lack of you know the lymphatic drainage and consolidation of memory and everything that occurs during deep sleep your sleep is more or less fucked up right like that would be a situation in which you just wouldn't want to eat anything during a fast but if you're fast is for the purposes let's say like fat loss or even some of you know like the endogenous stem cell production benefits of fasting and a caloric cup of coffee is not going to cause any issues and furthermore if you're concerned about like the cholesterol and the coffee use a paper filter because you're going to filter out most of the straws as well versus like a French press or or steel filter yeah yeah what about water water I think is completely allowed now there are some people who do dry fasting that would be popular for people have like Candida or yeast or fungi they would claim that a moist environment would allow the bacteria to flourish and so some of those people will do dry fasting I know a guy who does dry fasting with autologous urine therapy where he does dry fast in the morning he drinks his urine and and that's some old Ayurvedic cleanse technique that I don't personally do here try I did try it of course I try to do yeah it doesn't it's not the best yeah actually the temperature got to me more than the taste just like the warm hotness so you just if file2 alive yeah it was so ultimately the coffee is not an issue unless you're putting a bunch of stuff in it right and and then even though it is admittedly non-insulin a genic and it's actually quite a kick in the pants as you know you know when you blend fats with coffee you get the coffee stall on the Col they cross the blood-brain barrier they amp you up psychologically you're also getting your body has to burn those calories before it burns a lot of its own calories so that's not something you would do you would do well in a facet stayed bent I gotta wrap this up you you're always a mindfuck dude every time you come in here I have to pause after the podcast and try to like capture little bits of info unstained now that's pretty much my main takeaway from the past couple hours as I want I want a freaking steak I tell people how they can get your website tell people how they can watch your videos don't read that sleep article I just know it's it's good Ben Greenfield fitness calm are just Google bang greenfield and social media is Ben Greenfield yeah you just look there's not a lot of us benjamin green fields out there you find it benjamin greenfield you're bad motherfucker appreciate you man yeah thanks for coming in it's all matter bye everybody wait [Music]
