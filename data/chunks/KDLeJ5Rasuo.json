here we go rob zombie ladies and gentlemen how are you sir good good thanks for being here man push it yeah that's awesome three from hell comes out tonight yes finally it's such a crazy leap that you've made I mean people know you as much now for your films as they do for your music yeah pretty much especially well I've really noticed that would not be like in an elevator like the music fans I can pretty much spot them you know but like when some guy comes up to me an elevator it looks like he's a lawyer or something which I I have to get to grips with out cuz I'm not you know I'm old every time a cop comes up in like what is this guy one like like a fan because these thirty years younger than me well I get with normal people I go man I'm so into this or that because you know I figured like you know heavy metal music is very specific but everybody likes movies right yeah yeah I can pretty much spot them what do you look for metal feel like what what do you see it like what's coming your way well it's change but now it's always a guy with a shaved head and a long goatee that's very nobody has a yeah nobody has hair anymore it's like I swear sometimes about stage the physics that's funny yeah right that was rock and roll synonymous yeah it's like not not anymore what made you make that leap in horror films well I always wanted to make movies that was always my main goal in life really before music well it was well let me back it up I loved everything equally but as a kid it all seemed unattainable so it was all of a fantasy like oh yeah I'm gonna go to Hollywood make movies oh yeah I'm gonna have a band like no you're not you're just living in some crap town you're gonna do nothing is what it felt like her up in Haverhill yeah yeah you're on the Newton oh yes so fine I think when I was a kid and played ice hockey we would play against you I'm sure like 30 seconds like those are worse 30 seconds of my life then oh yeah growing up I mean it's like you can have a crappy band in the garage with your friends but it's not gonna do thing and then we had a super 8 camera so we'd make happy super 8 movies but not enough it seemed realistic I thought my life was gonna be you know world's worst bike messenger New York City that's seem to be what I was destined for but then as the band started taking off and which seemed odd in its own and there was a chance to make music videos like fuck it I'm directing these music videos this will be film school for me and that's what it's what it became did you have this thing that a lot of people have when things start going well for them you have sort of like imposter syndrome like you kind of you you like is this what the fuck are they gonna find out oh yeah my whole life is like yeah fooled them again I think everybody feels like that I think so too I mean I cuz I was always so I was so shy and if I was so shy I wouldn't even like want to talk to people on the phone when I was a kid because I was too much yeah that one day I realized I just this is how I realized it one day like in in high school I didn't associate with anyone like no one remembers me because I was just invisible but me and my friends were sort of like into punk rock like in a place where like no one knew what that was though and then the day we graduated we were at like hanging out around McDonald's and the main asshole jock kid came up who would be the worst your worst enemy who started like hey man I'm going to college what do you guys get like your cool clothes and stuff it was four years of torture from you your douchebag friends and now the day we graduate like hey you guys so that's what I knew everyone's so fucking insecure it doesn't matter and then the next day I was like I don't care anymore oh that's a different person yeah it's forgive those people you know the people that fuck with you in high school it's hard to let that go and realize though they just were probably tortured at home well you can't let it go because that's your motivation I'm always motivated by probably by anger and revenge and things of that nature that's why when people want anti-bullying I go might be anti success later on a life because you know people to get fucked with tend to make it yeah Chris Rock has a bit about that yeah it's true I mean certainly true for fighters almost all the best fighters in the UFC have some story where someone was fucking with them and they're young I mean how to figure out how to fight yep what's the first thing we all do take karate yeah believe it Chris Rock's bit involves Steve Jobs and a lot of other people like do not want Microsoft like yeah no it's super true it is super true and it's also soup it's interesting that you said that you were you had social anxiety so many people that become entertainers also had some form of social anxiety when they're young yeah I had to do this thing last no the night before last I was presenting this award to somebody at this event and you know I'm picturing how the stage will be really big and high you know I can get up there it's super impersonal doesn't matter and I get there the stage is like lower than this desk and it's like all the tables with people eating dinner right they're like oh man's nightmare I can't do this yeah you know cuz you have to sort of be normal I used to freak out when I had to talk to bank tellers I used to like you know you're in the line doesn't make no sense right but the line of like I'd have to deposit my check and I'd be in the line I'm like four more people and I got to talk morley know that feeling I was like that about every I like that was my own not my family that lived in the house but like an uncle came over I can't do a deal and Target Uncle Bill upstairs call me when he leaves yeah and then it's crazy that a guy like you winds up singing in front of fucking thousands of people playing guitar in front of thousands of people I wish I could play guitar but I will sing in front of people um it doesn't bother me it does matter like oh it's a festival it's a hundred thousand people I'm like who gives a crap it's crazy so it's two people out they don't want to say hi oh my god that's weird yeah especially if they're right in front of you like the one of the weirdest shows that any comic ever has to do is shows where there's a really tiny audience like the Comedy Store at one o'clock in the morning and there's like five people that's brutal it's just so weird it's like 500 people no problem yeah five people ah that's why starting like when which people like ha do you ever go back and play clubs and more intimate saying like no no I want the shows to be bigger as in it's impersonal as humanly possible because I hated playing clubs and the people like right in front of you like you know yeah I feel like I know we do kind of suck bikini just go with it getting a break man you know let us get our feet I don't know what kind of music did you guys play in the very beginning well when I started I was living in New York City and when my first band White Zombie started I was working at pee-wee's Playhouse actually as a production assistant for Pino yeah first season did you know Phil Hartman I know I was a production assistant I thought people aren't cuz it's Phil Hartman and it was Paul Reubens obviously it was William Marshall who played Blacula he was the cartoon King at that point there's all these great people Larry Fishburne was cowboy Curtis that's trying to think who else is here wow I forgot he was on it the only interaction I ever had with anybody was Paul Reubens and I was staying in there and he walked by he goes where's the bathroom it's right there that's it yes that was it so I figured oh but it's crazy that white zombie was your first band - yeah and one of the odds it was weird because we didn't play any covers and we sort of nobody really knew how to play when we started we sort of invented sound based upon completely not knowing what you're doing really yeah because yeah that's like any band like The Ramones it's like well we know these three chords but we understand they instinctively understand catchy pop songs even though it doesn't make sense because when you try to learn a Ramones song it doesn't make sense even though it seems like all these really simple songs because I've played them before because I've done this Ramones tribute thing like oh verse chorus wait verse again two courses that are not like they're so catchy but the structure is so odd because you could tell they were just sort of inventing this thing they're doing and that's how I felt with us because I had this weird idea like let's never play conventional drum beats which is like saying let's never make the song fun for anyone to listen to I got over that but but it's just yeah you just I don't know talking about did you take any classes in the early days or did you just well I went to New York originally go to Parsons School of Design for Fine Arts but I got kicked out cuz my grades dropped to low because I went from Haverhill to New York so I was like I'm just hanging out dance at Arial all night I'm not going to school because Dan cetera was amazing cuz one night it would be you know brendi MC like before anyone knew who they were and then it would be like Nick Cave then it'd be this was like I was i stayed that every night till 4:00 a.m. and then would go to school and just you know fall asleep or fall asleep on the train ride home in new jersey then try to get back so you never went to school like like for classical musical instruments or anything no and everyone i i can't learn anything I'm think I'm incapable I just have to do it and figure it out and do it wrong a thousand times I can't I just didn't Capitol even was a little kid if we got a game I was incapable of reading the directions we would just let's just make up our own rules we got a spinner and these little guys let's just know it was like three lines of directions to learn how to play the Happy Days game we wouldn't bother you're giving so many kids out there hope right now listening to this they're like that's me yeah I mean if you can make it you can be you could be Rob Zombie can be an idiot and make it I mean I remember when I got kicked out of school I was sitting in New Jersey I was probably 19 maybe 20 and I was just sitting there thinking well I did it I'm a fucking loser because I had you know I was making like 100 bucks a week I got kicked out of school I was sitting there in this crappy ghetto neighborhood in Jersey City here's two of my life it worked out yeah it worked out somehow isn't that crazy just things just eventually get better yeah yeah oh and you I don't know how I guess I don't know how because it never they would never seemed like it was going to like white zombie was a band it seemed like everyone hated and no matter what we had to be literally the last band in New York City to get a record deal maybe that's why we got it like literally out of bands we have to sign them but even when that happened there's always this weird thing and maybe you could really we got it offered a record deal with RCA Records now we're a band that hasn't got anything and I was like nah doesn't seem right it down and then we got MCA and I turned it down as like I think we should wait hold out for Geffen Records now that we have nothing this is people holding out for Geffen Records because they were the biggest at the time with no reason to be holding out but we got to sign a Geffen eventually did you have those kind of balls because that seems like you well I think it's balls mixed with stupidity at the same time because I I know I could be my own worst enemy because you want to sign the Geffen you know I come up with an album title they're like really you're gonna call it less Exorcist Oh devil music vol 1 is this just to guarantee we don't get any good placement on the album in stores I guess and then like well we're gonna hire let's hire so-and-so to direct the video fag naming you know he just did that naming some bait the Whitesnake video like now I'm gonna do it but it all worked it's crazy though that you passed on to legitimate record companies I wouldn't mean most kids when they're starting out or so you know you're like holy shit this is our chance I didn't think they were good enough you know we weren't good enough for anything either I don't know what that thought was well maybe you just I'm not a believer in fate but it kind of seems to fall into place for you it yeah I don't know it's like I feel like my whole life is just like I could have gotten hit by that car I just didn't yeah cuz I just stopped one second short from actually stepping in front of a speeding car and made it so you always wanted to make movies though that was always some that was always the thing I wanted to do for sure but that seemed completely undoable because it was just like Hollywood and movies I mean it just it feels so far far removed I mean living on the Lower East Side playing CBGB's like and being broke that seems doable like right you know and that actually inspired me there's I would see so many bands like oh well they suck I mean we at least better than they are I guess the motivation I had but like movies just seemed like no way that works for comics too that's one of the best thing Richard Jeni once said that about open mic nights that really bad comedians are great because they inspire people to try it yeah yeah yeah I get I because this is such a me I think I I so many friends that are comics that I've always become good friends with over the years and I think it's so similar I can't imagine staying there trying to tell jokes that people aren't laughing but I also can't imagine staying there playing songs that nobody wants to hear and they're just looking at you like yeah yeah kinda similar well the thing is I think it's probably even harder maybe with songs that nobody knows because people will listen to jokes because they make them laugh but songs that that one knows in a band that no one knows like man you got to figure out a way to rope these people in yeah that's why I always figured like I was always visually oriented so I always would made sure the band had a look a certain way in act a certain way the way I wanted them to be you know so I thought at least there's that at least you can go this is awful but look at these maniacs wear it you know everybody's hair is down here and they're going crazy and no one else is going crazy in the club but they are at least it's you know an entertaining trainwreck to watch at least you know what kind of films did you like when you're growing up I mean when I was a kid I would literally just get the TV Guide cuz we're talking like you know the early 70s and I would circle everything that I was gonna watch for the week like I would plan it out it wasn't random it was like okay one o'clock white Heat's on I'm gonna watch that beneath the Planet of the Apes comes on at four we're gonna jump to that then you know gonna take a break to watch Gilligan's Island then want to come back cuz good and bad news on tonight cuz it's Clint Eastwood week and I would just plan it out the whole week and that's I would just watch everything kids today will never understand TV guides now never understand and then ones that would come with the Sunday paper you get the the guide with the paper you figure out what's what's gonna be on your greatest diver we would look forward to what was going to be on TV remember as a kid like you knew Planet of the Apes was gonna be on like the whole neighborhood was on fire cuz Planet of the Apes was gonna be on outside whatever it's on my phone right now it's always there yeah but I think there's something I don't you think and I don't know how this figures into comedy but I'm sure it does there was something about having to be exposed to everything because there was nothing else that I know as much about John Wayne movies as I do about horror movies right you didn't get to choose where is now everything so compartmentalized that people just like you guess like if you hear a band go let me guess what your favorite band is the band you sound exactly like because you have no other influences as opposed a lot of metal bands I know that are huge they go well my favorite band was actually ZZ Top so we just decided to play ZZ Top riffs really fast and that's how we created this but everybody's just so like I only like this yeah they get in those those confirmation bubbles where everybody else likes what you like and yeah you just operate in the same circles and yeah yeah you can get real weird that way where it's weird like you just it but if you're taking influences for stealing things from everywhere you know you can put them together in new way but if you like I only like metal yes you smell like metal that's the cool thing about the radio right that I mean I've been recently listening to Spotify which I never listened before but listen to streaming services I exposed to you know there's like a channel like there'll be a Rob Zombie channel and there'll be a bunch of other shit on it as well like you know exact one channel here's some weird music that you you didn't expect from some bands you didn't even know of and I've missed that from radio yeah I mean I just want to because you want you want that motorbike AHA whoa what's this yeah yeah that's fucking cool I'm gonna listen to that I didn't know what it was five minutes ago yeah you know and now I'm because even as a kid I mean I hate totally gonna spike you know but it's like you know I just FM Raiders like okay the Allman Brothers then Diana Ross then kiss then ABBA I'll just listen to all of it cuz it's on the radio right right you know yeah I remember growing up in Boston remember WB CN oh yeah sure yeah they played one time I forget who it was my B mark paren toe I forget who it was who was the DJ was Santa yeah who's saying that this look this is not my head mean actually might have been coz it might not have been bcn anyway when whoever the DJ was it was a rock station and they were like look this isn't rock but it's fucking good they didn't say fucking good that's really good and that's what we're playing at they played Michael Jackson and I remember thinking wow this is so crazy they're gonna play a Michael Jackson song but it was really good yeah and so you're like okay I'll take it you know I still it's funny remember that because I still remember the one morning brushing my teeth and they're like oh we're playing this new band the police is song rocks and I thought it was like this reggae band until I saw a picture rest in peace Ric Ocasek I now asked him today Ric Ocasek that cars that's a bummer that was a bummer those guys are so the cars is one of those bands where whenever you don't know what to listen to he can always listen to the cars so many good songs and it's so good yeah he was such an interesting guy too so it's a an oddity yeah tall thank you with the sunglasses and the supermodel and every song is awesome you know there he was brilliant that's a bummer man that's a bummer and he was cool too because I remember when he produced the Bad Brains record rock for light and I was like Ric Ocasek he's hipper than I thought I just took yeah so like news movies wise movie wise like when you were a kid do you in horror films back then I was into everything but I loved that for sure but I like I don't even know if we I we definitely didn't call him horror movies we thought everything everything was a monster movie this monster movie like that's just what we call because it was always like you know we had creature double feature on channel 56 do you remember that sure yeah well that was like the every weekend fuck its destroy all monsters and you know whatever yeah so that was yeah so big time that ruled our world so watching them back then that's when you got the idea well it got the idea that I loved it I wanted to do it but it was oh it was the idea like yeah I want to be an astronaut too like it didn't seem like an idea that was ever gonna happen he's just something that you were really into yeah and it's really funny to this funny the weird things because at one time in high school me and my friends filmed a sequel to Escape from New York the John Carpenter film I don't know I'm getting better and then to be like you know however mint 20 years later that I remade a John Carpenter film Halloween was just so bizarre I guess I've been thinking about it for a long time but you know that is kind of crazy it's weird yeah it's weird shit like that well when your first actual film films well mm 4 mm mm yeah because the way it went down was this is a funny story too I made my first movie house 1000 corpses at Universal Studios and it was 2000 it could have been even the tail into 1999 I'm not sure they won't resent notes mm I had a wrap gift somebody gave me and they put a date I was like mm so I made the movie with Universal Studios and once they screened it we had our test screening which I thought went I thought went great and well I know that the head of Universal at the time came up and was like we have to talk tomorrow and that was not a good tone that wasn't it you're so great we want to give you a 5 picture deal tone of voice so the next day they dumped the movie and you know just basically booted us out and then I blows the conversation they were like we basically this is unreleasable I don't remember word for word but that was the conversation in a nutshell but at the time too you figured there was no horror coming out of Universal they were making like The Flintstones movie and that was not the image they wanted this really vile sort of backwoods hillbilly murder fest where there's and the bad people win essentially I mean horror films were sort of like not even a commercial thing at that point in a way so then which is funny now if you go to Universal Studios Hollywood Orlando there's a huge house of a thousand Corpses thing event going on in both theme parks that's a lair I was there for the old grand opening like that's funny like it's like I get fired from here and now you know 20 years later it's a theme park attraction in the exact place I got fired for him Wow which is so weird what was the conversation like before you decided to do that film I mean how did how did they let you do it I don't you know I'd again I think getting to make a movie for Universal Studios was such an amazing experience but I think I was too naive to understand what was happening it'd be like you did one set of comes lagata put you on tour George Carter like cool I guess it's the way it happens man you know it's after like wow I didn't really appreciate just went down did it not that I was took it for granted but I had I had met with someone at the theme park about doing a haunted maze during their horror Halloween Horror Nights based on my album and then sort of by being in the offices was meeting meeting people and having just meetings about stuff or I just didn't want to leave once I got in the studio I just loved being there even though I had no business being there and somehow I remember being in the guy his name was Kevin Mischer his office pitching him a movie I didn't have a pitch for I had a title but not nothing else and somehow it progressed from there I was like really I told them kind of a cool title with a completely half-assed idea that was making up as I was talking to remember I was weird I don't even I I can't remember it well because it after the fact I'm like how did this happen I don't remember this is like your story's like the anti ambition store it's like the anti preparation story exactly for successful nonetheless yeah I guess the the goal is just be vague with people you don't care and I had that attitude too I remember once the movie was rolling I was like this is what I want to cast and this is exactly what I want to do and if you guys don't want to do it that's cool let's just not work together and they did it Wow like that's my part right and I we shot it on the universal back lot we were like right there like doing the whole thing and big production and it was weird Wow when when it wrapped like final day final scene and that's a wrap were you like what the fuck just happened well the funny thing is like after we wrapped the first time we had a little test screening within the studio like friends like oh we should probably punch up the ending so they gave me like they gave me more money to reshoot the ending that I actually made my newest movie with it was like money was nothing like you know there's throwing money around like it was like nothing else I hung my cousins and saying we were building these giant sets Jonah's crazy stuff it was after that that you know the problem started but I don't I wish I could remember these things better it's weird that I don't but what attracted you to this ultra violent psychopath like outcasts murderous style of movie that you do because you have like these almost like mutant society psycho murder people that you know but people fucking love it man I've always dug like outsider mentality like anything that involved like out I think it started as a kid as a kid because like a lot of people can relate this I didn't feel like I fit in like I was like weird I didn't fit in I didn't get like what were the cool shoes to wear or the right freakin Izod sure I didn't understand I wasn't trying to be you know no one's trying to be weird and like oh yeah I want to be weird and hide away cuz I'm weird no it's like I don't understand and I think when I would watch new monster movies the monster was always that mentality like King Kong's like hey man I'm just trying to get along why is everyone shooting at me in Frankenstein's like hey I was just born yesterday why you're trying to kill me like and I think as a weird kid you relate to the monster so as life went on and you know the I would always relate to the outsider then I would always relate to movies like taxi driver Bonnie and Clyde and yeah and Travis Bickle you know he's the fucking man you know and I would always be like anything anti-society Anthea fuck you fuck everything that's normal right like revenge yeah I was just into it and I felt real similar when I was a kid I was always in the monster movies I was always into something that just just tore all the normal people apart and just ripped apart all the conceived notions of what everybody thought was gonna happen and then around the end towards the end of high school when I discovered punk rock you figure out there's an entire form of music where they're just like go fuck yourself yeah that's what we're here I was like I'm in and so many other people as well yeah and it's just like it just it flips your whole idea of what life is and then when I moved to New York I was like wow this entire city of people don't give a fuck yeah that's where they come yeah nobody gives a shit about anything here it's it's amazing how your movies resonate with people like - like in a fanatical way like the read the comments on just a trailer for three from hell you know just people are so fucking pumped yeah it's it's great and I mean it's been it's been a long journey because like when my first movie came out I think every review basically said something along lines of worst movie ever made I hate this movie and now people do look that's your best movie you know like you've been choosing the river soon so it's just weird how it same with white zombie when our first Geffen he still remember this our first Geffen record came out I saw the first review it was this magazine alternative press who two years ago gave me this Lifetime Achievement Award and I had to read the review while accepting what the review said this is the worst band ever and it said this is the worst band ever ignore this band yeah so there was something and you know there must have been something your contacts the person who wrote that now I didn't hide back then I was just like I mean like I felt like maybe a few years later who was I I used to be upset by reviews until I saw who wrote them mmm yeah you know yeah that's a lot of critics or critics cuz they really wanted to be writers they just don't have a lot to contribute and so they just shit on things and it's just like you as a when you're young and you're new and you're reading you think that the guys writing it frightening all badass you like oh this dude must look like Lemmy he must be this hard-ass guy you know I mean you see I like that guy wrote it off fuck him you fuck everyone else whoever writes I do you think again I don't give a shit yeah but the thing is about music is it's so subjective and you know someone who grew up wearing the right Izod shirts hanging with the cool crowd they're not gonna it's your musics not gonna resonate with them the sound way it's gonna be with other people that felt like they were Outsiders I mean I can only do what I do and I don't know what would be popular I don't understand popular culture in a way because when people are like gushing over something a movie or something I say go I hated that movie I know it made 500 million dollars and it's everyone's favorite movie I go I could barely sit through it yeah there's a lot of those being made same with music like I'd be like I love The Velvet Underground it was like but what about and they'll name something like you know I don't want a minute - anybody but something so popular that makes me want to kill myself yeah that literally it's sickening do you like any films today is there anything that yeah and I you know I mean what kind of shit do you enjoy i watch every everything i mean i whenever there's something that's more like smaller movies i really like like i was thinking about the other day about this time in the 90s where like you got movies like Napoleon Dynamite and American Splendor which is how you ever see that we yes I thought Paul Giamatti of happy cars is like the greatest movie ever made in a gross world does early tear you so I got films like that's where I kind of my head was that just weird movies like that yeah it's some like Napoleon Dynamite to this day is one of the greatest comedies of all time as soon as that movie started in the credits were food I was like this is like the greatest thing I've seen in a theater in like 20 years what is going on here well it's I just don't understand why they never made a second one I don't know that didn't make any sense to me I'm like this is a fucking franchise waiting to happen like him and the other dude the who's the guy who played his was his uncle uncle Rico yeah I mean the fucking guy was amazing they were so like over the top but believable like everything about it when he's feeding Tina [Laughter] it just doesn't see much I just it doesn't seem like he could miss I loved that movie yeah well I could see them doing it now yeah but years later he tried to do that with Dumb and Dumber remember that yeah did it way way way too late yeah that's him carries like 15 ever it's like this is just weird you're not young anymore yeah you can't be a buffoon that's Howard lightning in a bottle to recreate yeah dummer yeah right right right it's like stepbrothers certain movies that just right you got to kind of leave them alone I remember seeing stepbrother it sounds like is it my imagination is every single fucking thing in this movie hilarious well those two just like together you know Talladega Nights just amazing and Talladega Nights I love when a comedies made well yeah so often they're not yes you know that's what I liked about the hangover if you turn the sound off you just looked at it it's a really good-looking well-made film and then you turn on the sound you realize it's hilarious but so many comedies are just so shitty what's that new Seth Rogen produced film with kids the good boys yeah yeah I didn't see this oh my fucking wife said it was amazing she said it was like like piss your pants laughs oh really yeah that's good I got it I need to go see it you don't even see I like he has like a live-action like South Park that's a good way to describe you see it yeah yeah yeah because it's r-rated yeah Seth Rogen can't mess he's hilarious now when you were a kid like you liked all kinds of stuff but did you think if you wanted to make films that you would be making the kind of films that you're making now these like butchers well I guess since the first thing I made was that and I can't I was into it I mean I liked because what happened to was when I moved to Manhattan in like 1982 or something I discovered when when New York City was all second run theaters and double features so I could finally see the laundry list of films I'd never been able to see I remember the first time I liked 8th Street Playhouse was a good example where first time I saw it Texas Chainsaw Massacre was on a double bill with Jimmy plays Berkeley the Jimi Hendrix movie was a double bill but double bills yeah and I would go see like oh my god Ilsa she-wolf so the SS is playing with faster pussycat oh my god this and I could because I could never see him because there was no VHS yet or I was so new that those movies weren't around that I just had books and I was just staring at books cuz back in the day you know that's kinda because with the this new movie three from hell you know it's playing on about a thousand screens so it's not like everywhere like you can't walk two feet and it's on five screens and people fifteen minute drive from my house I was like I would literally drive for five hours as a kid if there was a movie I wanted to see it didn't matter I'd ride my one time I rode before I could drive I rode my bike for like three hours to see night living-dead at a midnight screening cuz I'm gonna see this no matter what cuz if you didn't see it was just gonna evaporate that's one of the things I love about people from Canada Canada they drive everywhere like you know friends in Alberta they'll drive seven hours to go see something yeah cuz that's what you have to do yeah good morning and that's your day you're driving somewhere and when I was younger that was like part of the fun I didn't care yeah that's an adventure so the concerts thirty hours away so yeah did you study or you have you watched a lot of like really old horror yeah I mean I watch sometimes I feel like I'm searching for things to watch because I would try to watch literally everything and I want to own everything so I have like a vault at home that has you know twenty thousand movies in it because I never if somebody mentions something I don't know what it is like fuck and I like write it down I immediately have to go like investigate it so when they say a vault like an actual vault like a bank no I just thought of it's just a room that I built that just is nothing but like a movie library because I want to own everything so you have a physical copy of all these yeah what format do you put them in well now they're DVD I mean they were laser discs and VHS and then I started trading because what happens now it's great that everything's digital but if you go to iTunes 99% of the things I want to see aren't there mmm because they're not you know so you can do that thing now that was nice on Amazon where you can they will burn the movie on CD to own because it'll be like weird movies like I was spent forever trying to find I mean I got it many years ago but like there was a movie called dirty little Billy with Michael J Paulette as Billy the Kid little bit yeah this is amazing movie from the 70s and finally you can get it like they'll you know they or it's made to order CDs I mean I DVDs on Amazon and stuff so when I was a kid I was gigantically in horror films and I used to read Fangoria time and I remember they were into these there were slasher movies from like I guess like the 60s that had never heard of that were like ultra gorefest movies yeah I God trying to remember who was the director but there was a guy who was famous for other Herschell Gordon Lewis is that what you think thousand maniacs and blood fees yeah yes yes like that stuff I never was exposed to that now I've still this day I've never seen one of those films but the magazines were covered with like people with axes and yeah because things would play it at the drive-in and then go away yeah you know that was layout that's how I felt when the first time when I loved when 40 strike second Street in New York was the real 40 seconds right and I remember so funny my friend my roommate back then we'd always go to 42nd Street to see movies could be like Cannibal Holocaust I would just see the poster what the fuck is cannibal ha ha and you'll see this Italian cannibal movie go this is literally the most Viking not believe another human made this movie right blows your mind but where every time I went to 42nd Street I saw a really bad incident happen like you could not go there like would be like waiting line and like oh let's go get some french fries before the movie to guys to start fighting at McDonald's one guy would just pummel the other guy that'd be blood everywhere I go it happened next time ago we'd see guy stabbed another guy in the theater while watching there it is like literally I'd never went there once and even right till I was recording my album before I moved I remember walking to the studio which was like maybe forty third and there was a dead body lying there and they just found him and they were just starting to put the sheet so I actually didn't see the violin act but I saw but he didn't care like New York it was like New York when I moved to New York and 82 still seemed like you know taxi-driver New York yeah well that was when it was it was coming from Haverhill Wilding West so exciting cuz Haverhill so boring in comparison it couldn't be more boring if its goal is to be boring it's gold medal yeah I remember Haverhill was so bad that when we were kids I remember what I don't forget maybe this is maybe the Bison we're on the Bicentennial I think they were trying to drive business because Main Street we can't even blame Walmart back then was dead there was nothing there which is a ghost town you know like they just put all these banners up Haverhill the all-american city but it was less the catchphrase is gonna matter make people open businesses so bad time to sell flags yeah exactly yeah I went to New York City for the first time in the 80s as well I'm trying to remember what year it was it was like somewhere probably around 82 or 83 and when we were in in the city driving around I remember thinking like this is the craziest fucking place I've ever been in my life the buildings were so big it didn't make sense pulling up to it I remember we drove up on the West Side Highway and you see the city coming up in the disciplic see the buildings get larger and larger as you get closer it's mental didn't seem real I remember being on the sidewalk now this is coming from a place where a sidewalk means there's literally no other person on the sidewalk as far as you can see right and they were standing on the sidewalk and must have been uptown somewhere it was like you couldn't move with people it's like what is happening right I've never seen like this is how it is all the time like I live in the street in Haverhill like a car drive drove down it like once a day and it was probably your dad coming home from work like there was just nothing if you could have you view out of Time Machine though and you went from 1982 and you said hey what do you think it's gonna look like in 2019 he'd be like fuck man it's gonna be Mad Max yeah like did it be fucking cars driving with black smoke coming out of them people shooting people right on the street it's gonna be though it's gonna get worse it's not gonna get better yeah the only thing I remember right towards my end of being there there was that Tompkins Square you know downtown and that was where it's just like wherever homeless people lived it was Alphabet City it was like the worst well hey wait on the back when I first moved here like the first night I was there this sounds like I'm making it up and I'm not the first night I was there the dorm that I was in with all my roommates over looked Union Square Park which is like needle Park you just went there to buy dope and that was it there was now you go there first because it's a farmers market it's beautiful and I heard this guy screaming and screaming and screaming as Christ was going on because of like a hundred degrees and of course there's no air conditioning I look out the window and I watched these cops beat up this guy I was like and then they dragged him down to the subway and the next day all these cops showed up at the dorms and it was that it was this guy Michael Stewart it became a really famous case he was they called him a graffiti artist and he had been beat to death by the cops and me and all my roommates saw it and the next day they came and took our statement and we all had to testify in front of the grand jury this is my first day out of Haverhill we I witnessed a murder but again it's like the same thing with like my deal at Universal I was like - not even weird to really comprehend because he bumped like things are happening I'm so jaded it didn't disturb me or seem like I don't know I don't know throwing me but I am desensitized by all the violence I've witnessed as a as a child I guess well that would you see more violence before that well there's one famous thing I remember as a kid besought there's two famous things I just don't know when I was a kid the family business that my mom came from was like carnivals like you ever see that movie carny yeah with Gary Busey yeah that's exactly the life as a kid that I remember when I saw the movie I was like this is this is what this was our life we were as well that makes sense yeah attraction you have these Drifters yeah I was always what I was surrounded by so that was the thing I remember as a kid except and when it was around 1970s everything because I remember kiss love gonna just came out talked about it and the family work that my mom and dad and we my brother had to work and sell food and stuff and I hated I used we used to have to dip the candy apples and handle with people and they've healed now but I all my head burns all over my hands cuz the apple candy would be so hot it would drip on my hand and burn my hands anyway I digress but one night there was the gambling tents which were all rigged of course and someone had some guide getting fleeced for all of his money and came back and lit the tent on fire and then suddenly shit hit the fan everybody that me and my little brother had been around all the time it's like boom all these guns start coming out and you start hearing guns popping up and then the tents just went like nothing was fired for so everything's on fire it's complete chaos and I was probably in fifth grade my brother was probably in second grade everybody screaming to run around and my and this guy was like that I don't remember his name but he worked there he was like hey you guys should come over here and before he finished a sense somebody ran up and hit him in the face with a hammer and broke his whole face open it was just gushing blood and we're like and then eventually my parents got us in the car and we left which was that was my parent my mom's like we're done this is we're not doing this anymore does last time we ever did wow what a great way to go out though but the best was going to school on September like what did you do this summer and that was my story Wow we didn't go to Cape Camp Zuppa sake we we were in a carnival riot what was the gambling tent like what kind of games are they Riggin I don't know I mean everything's rigged like anything from and it's even a great scene in Kearney where I'm the friend of mine who's an Elan my moves meg Foster plays when she's holding all the long strands of rope and Joanie fought she's trained rode if I was like you pull the rope and it's connected to a prize or I or like and everything's rigged like the the weighted lead milk bottles you're supposed to knock down the softball I mean everything's rigged I mean certain ways you know how to cheat them so that when the guys shown how to do it like it's so easy just throw it like this but it's a certain way you can throw it work but otherwise woman I would never be in the gambling tents because they were actually gambling we were like a little tiny kids but it was we probably roulette wheels I'm guessing mmm things like that so it you know the guys spins it and break it something his foot and it never stops on the number that the guys got all of his money on cuz he let him win a bunch times or something so when the fire broke out and people started shooting was shooting at who I don't know what was going just Kate I just yeah we're little kids like you don't really comprehending this going on only fourth or fifth grade just like that guys now got a gun I hear gunshots everything's on fire there's smoke people screaming this guy's now gushing brains out of the front of his head and so fuck I said there were two stories that was oh the second story the second story I kind of put in this the new movie three from hell this was like when I was in high school I was in the backyard rehearsing with my two friends or a band or whatever and we heard this screaming it was a bright sunny day that seemed like a David Lynch movie suburbia and this fat naked guy was running down the street covered in blood even stabbed a whole bunch of times like people are mowing their lawns and looking at and I just remember a bloody naked guy running down the street screaming like a weird scream people scream weird when they get stabbed and um so I put some like that movie but it just yeah what happened to him I don't know it was like granite he was knocking and again I was like oh weird and I just went back and we continued rehearsing whoa like again that must have flavored the music a little bit yeah I don't know that it's like I should be I should be really bothered by things like that but I'm not yeah well I mean there's a thing that happens when you see too much it's one of the reasons why cops and soldiers have some of the oddest sense of humor I could see that yeah they've just seen too many bodies they've seen yeah yeah I mean imagine the guys that have to come scrape up all the stuff off the road and load in the bag so yeah yeah I mean after you know yeah but yeah that was the life I remember I remember my mom's brother he would always uh didn't always use but sometimes he was a biker so he'd come over to the house and he had a chopper with iron crosses on and he kind of looked at let me the big mustache and I was like this guy that's like drivers around the neighborhood so everyone can see us you know that stuff so when you were saying that you collect the films and you have films did you do go back to like the really old ones like Nosferatu oh yeah I love silent movies and now they're easier to get because I always loved lon chaney with so many of the hard to get I was showing my kids lon chaney two nights ago what movie did well I was showing them the the original Wolfman and I was showing them Jekyll and Hyde I was showing him some of the Lon Chaney jr. well Wolffe dad yes and like phantom of the opera' enemies back in noah's day jacqueline hide as well that was long cheney right no Frederick March oh well it depends what there's the John Barrymore silent jekyll-and-hyde but your pregnancy the Frederic March one is great it's so perverted the prostitutes and stuff isn't that the one you showed your kids like from the 34 short of the 30s that was a poor much born well there's the boring one with Spencer Tracy is boring and just compared to the other one the other ones all because anything that's sort of like the pre-code stuff is really we watched an upbeat the beginning of the Spencer Tracy one because it was so strange they there there's actually when you know on iTunes you can watch a preview but it's not really a preview when it's old films because they didn't have yeah previews back then so it's just al scene and it's a scene when he's becoming mr. Hyde but he doesn't look any different yeah he just looks a little meaner you know the Frederic March one is one of the best ones they ever made it's so good but lone Cheney was like it was Phantom of the Opera which is a really interesting one because he he liked that he put on some really painful makeup for that I mean he just invented everything yeah he'd the things he'd do I mean I don't know how much the stories have been exaggerated by publicity departments over the years but yeah I mean it's just incredible and movies like the unknown or the unholy 3 mm-hmm like you can get everything now forever I was like I'm positive I'll see these movies for a long time I don't do it anymore but I used to collect vintage movie posters and that's what I would go after the the Lon Chaney's silent movie posters because a lot of times I feel that there's only one of these in existence and then I realize I'm spending too much money on things those old films you know when I'm trying to show them to my kids I was just trying to we were we're going from the 20s to the 30s there's a movie that's the original horror film that have found that was 1920 it's actually 2 years over the Nosferatu it was dr. something dr. Caligari Caligari yeah that's a good yeah we watched a little bit of that too but I just wanted to show them how weird it is like the progression of film particularly scary films because when my kids were real little I wife was out of town and I said do you guys want to watch a scary movie that's not really scary they were nervous how old are they that's a time I think they were five and three or maybe six and for someone we started throwing down the test do you want to watch it but I knew it wasn't gonna be really scary so I put on the original King Kong from blue is that like 30 33 I think and we were laughs and I was like let me tell you something we're gonna watch this and it's so fake it looks so dumb I go we're gonna we're gonna laugh and so we're cuddled up on the couch they were nervous and yeah then once they saw the thing like that's it that's the monster I was like let me tell you something kid in 1933 this was scary for people they really thought this is realistic they thought this was amazing do you ever have that moment you'll watch something like say I do this like Frankenstein like you're seeing it so many times it's hard to watch it like you've never seen it before but sometimes I'll be watching something and there'll be a scene where like Frankenstein is killing Fritz and there's no music and he's just screaming I was like this must have fucking been so intense because no one had seen anything like this they're watching this yeah creature who they don't understand the makeup because no one knew who I was done like especially because he kind of the first appearance of Karloff is Franklin he kind of backs in and turns and I heads flat yes oh and the Jack Pierce makeup is so incredible that I was just like people must have been like running for the door pull up a picture of what Boris Karloff looked like in that movie I haven't seen that in forever but I'm so good it was so good I mean in the also it's so difficult for us to understand perspective like to put yourself in their place back then yeah look at that yeah lighting was incredible now we're used to seeing that it's so iconic that like or that it becomes like but if you'd never I mean never seen anything like that before I mean I guess going back to always said a second ago like Lon Chaney and Phantom of the Opera and his quasi motor you kind of LaBolt something but that must have just been like fucking chaos for a battery that's so crazy the posts on his neck do you remember when they did a remake with DeNiro I do I don't remember it movie very good I don't neither but I remember of being terrifying looking like that yeah he was updated yeah he looked cool in that yeah it's a tough one though with those movies because they got it so right the first time yeah and the performance is alike when I watch like I I really like Lugosi in Dracula and when you watch it I always feel like he's like Brando of that time because everyone else is like talking like yeah well like like they're still getting vodka bill and they're way over the top and then too much and he's like this in this doing this thing yeah but sometimes you're like you can almost can't understand him because of his accent like wow he's like in this whole weird head trip and they're like doing play hey listen buddy you know like the way they're talking yeah and that's why nobody can remember David manners who got paid 10 times with a go see but but Lugosi is like this iconic thing like Marilyn Monroe I mean that this was so out of time with so special what they were doing yeah even in when in the film there's a scene where the woman had been bit and it's like what's wrong what's going on he's so corny and over-the-top and in that you know the style of that era but Lugosi is on another level and the and like everybody like a lot of those actors then seem very much like they were in the closet and they were trying to like play with the woman and Lugosi has that vibe like I'm gonna fuck everything on this set before I leave this movie you know he just reeks of like I'm from I'm Hungarian and I'm gonna nail every actress in this film yeah and he's a fuckin powerful vampire yeah bought into it like yeah in the role he was yeah in the headspace and a lot of those movies and other good ones like the black cat we're like the same guy was in the Dracula's and he's so like swishing over the top and Lugosi and Karloff together are so intense it's like this two different movies going on this weird Hollywood and this weird thing these other guys are doing man it's like Brando in Apocalypse Now like he's making a whole different movie yes yeah you know it's cool to just go back in time and see the progression of horror to go from those films like I still think Nosferatu to this day is one of the coolest vampires ever it's so incredible there was no there was no of benchmark yeah for him right I mean and he looked so fucking weird with the long fingers and yeah creepy and the way he would rise remember when they had him on a boy I just was like straight it looks incredible and I still and I love them the Hertzog remake with Klaus Kinski oh that's right so amazing yeah and Kinski's so like he's so perfect because he's such another crazy actor that yes reeks of crazy right off the screen yes yes yeah it's just hard to do a good monster movie these days I mean I'm a gigantic Rick Baker fan obviously yeah he's coming on here to I was a oh yeah his new book looks amazing yeah I'm so excited I'm getting him to promote that but I'm just I was when I was a kid I wanted to be a makeup artist it was really I wanted to do yeah so I studied Rick Baker and I studied you know the the early lon chaney days like we were talking about and I just love prosthetics in like Star Wars and Chile which by the way I went to the Star Wars attraction yesterday oh you did is you man it's the shit ooh that fucking Star Wars ride the ride is incredible man it simulated though right yes I I won't throw up but I'll feel like I want to for the rest of the day it's awesome it's awesome so Mike my kids we're steering they got a chance to steer that they were the pilots and you slamming into fucking doesn't have to coordinate one goes up one goes down left and right so up and down is one kid and left and right yeah they're next to each other in the cockpit are they separate like next to each other Hahnemann close but they're like asteroids when they're hitting shit but but uh just the ride is fucking incredible I mean you could see there's so much money poured into there and apparently there's a bunch of other ones that are there they're in the process of developing - oh really but I loved those movies and a big part of it was like like the cantina scene if you if you went to that now you'd be like oh my god it's obviously a mask oh yeah like their faces really like that weird weird yeah no but they're not moving yeah laughter that data but back down I was like this is amazing oh my god I can so clearly seeing that remember seeing that movie for the first time because I was like it like you come out of I remember coming out and be like shell-shocked like everything I thought about everything just changed yeah it's like I'll be the second it's another movie that's so hard to put in perspective I've watched it with my kids now and it's like you gotta bring them back to the 1970s and this movie came out you don't get it like back then this was fuckin insane how good it was yeah people would want me I watched it like I think we had like little competitions with our friends to see who could watch it the most amount of times I think I saw it like 13 times yes I mean it's crazy and I someone gave me a laser not a laser for a blu-ray of the original before Lucas did all the extra stuff and ruined it somehow they had cut together somebody went to all the trouble of getting like a Japanese lasers and they cut together a blu-ray of exactly the movie as it was in 1977 what did you do differently in the new version enhance some of the special effects he added that scene with the digital you know Jabba the Hutt and just like they'll be like the tauntaun that's like what there's just little robots and bullshit everywhere that wasn't there in the original I did and now what seems so badass for effects and whatever was 2000 now looks super bad stuff from 77 still that's why I always want to like you watch 2001 you go like how can this still look better than everything yeah these are literally models shot in 1968 or some book you prick knew the limitations of the visual format and so he he shot things in a way where he didn't he wasn't willing to compromise the way something looked to show you something that like like sort of like the King Kong animation like that's as best they could do back then yeah but Kubrick figured workarounds they I just read this new book that came out well maybe six months ago that's all about the making of 2001 and it's the book is so detailed I wish you could remember the title of and it's amazing the amount of time like it's stuff you take for granted out just how they had to make the digital readouts on the computer screens mmm because that stuff did not exist it so the amount of time that went into just simple background things that nobody cares about it is just mind-blowing just the weightlessness scenes and how they did all that stuff which still look amazing no it's still an incredible movie and it's also a time capsule right it's like it's one of those films that it's great but it's also great and of time caps yeah it's I love it because um I love all of his movies for the same reason because they take over the viewer like most movies they're like you watch it and it's doing what the movie thinks will make you happy whereas Kubrick's doing stuff like well this is what it would be like to be in space yeah this is the pace it's gonna unfold that yeah like which is painfully slow at times well you can't get away with that today no because people are too the rolled up they don't have the attention span I don't think and same thing with Barry Lyndon her clockwork orange' doesn't matter what movie it is his - The Shining yes like now someone made the shine and go it's great you got to cut the first hour out of it you know we're gonna start it with the Red Rum scene ya know the opening shot would be and then go three hours yeah yeah they would do that they would go three months earlier you know they would do that it's um it's it's cool to see though like those films they did what they could do with what was available whereas with now the problem with CGI is they use it and they overuse it and I think that I don't I don't I haven't CGI can be phenomenal for sure but it's a tool and it's turned into a crutch and I see it with actors like you see actors a lot of time and I feel bad for the actors you sue the actors there you go I know these guys are great but they're awful in this movie because I didn't train to stand in a warehouse that's green and pretend to look at stuff yeah right so they really like when you watch The Phantom Menace you go why does it suddenly seem like Liam Neeson can't act right because he's like they're like look at that dot on the wall I mean and you know these guys are incredible actors I was talking about somebody wants to kid those in my movie was in all the Spy Kids movies and he said it was so hard because they'd be on a green screen you're looking at that we're not sure what you're looking at but just stare at that dot and react you so what is it yeah is it a dragon or is it my mom what am i reacting to like we haven't figured it out yet and he said he was always in a constant state of confusion as to what he was reacting to well it's hard to when you go back and you look at some of them like you know what movie got it right that sort of didn't get enough respect in its time but in in in time like as time passed it's become more respected as starship troopers yeah I know I don't remember that movie that well it's a you know it's all you're gonna kill her we're slugs Oh like they like removing major Dan's legs I mean that's like when see Jesus I thought oh shit they found a guy with no legs he's a great actor because I don't know Gary Sinise was back how about the ping-pong scene yeah a lot of shit yeah the was getting uh with with monster movies though it's um Pat McGee he's the guy who did that werewolf the one that's out there yeah he'll make them for you like he makes power and we had this conversation about it we were saying that you can see CGI and even if it's awesome your brain knows it's CGI that's funny they I have that same thought that it's something subliminally your brain knows it's all fake yes like Godzilla where's like yeah like Godzilla like when you know it's a guy in a rubber suit crushing things like well if you watch the original one wouldn't like when they cut in Raymond Burr there's something so dark and fucked-up about them yes because everything's that's real fire there's actually three dimensional objects blowing up but when it's so big and fake like I always say like what's scarier a giant CG creature that you know you will never see or like a maniac with a pillowcase over his head holding an axe coming at you like your brain goes that could happen I get it yes yes things like well that's I'm not gonna that's like Roger Rabbit that's not gonna happen you know it's not it might be cool there might be but it's not like one of the scariest horror movies of all time is alien yeah and in the first few encounters they have with the creature you don't even see the damn thing because it's you couldn't show it that much like the you know like the shark and jaws but when you see it it's like it's actually there yeah you can feel that its jaws are right in front of Sigourney Weaver's face yeah it's not like she's looking at nothing in her eye lines a little off because it's a you know tennis ball and a stick she's looking at there's something about it really happening in the space that I think people can feel it and Sigourney Weaver is surprising Sigourney Weaver an alien is the greatest female action hero star ever because you bought it hook line and sinker she was a scientist she wasn't supposed to be this heroine that's out there just fucking things up and killing everybody and she wasn't supposed to be super hot and sexy and young but she was hot enough because she became tough and it made her but like like the whole I remember when alien came out it was kind of like when the thing came out and all the reviews were bad if you remember really yeah I mean the Bruce are everything a bad when you go back a little oh these there's no redeemable characters are there all cartoon keys cardboard characters they rip everything apart but but like it's like Harry Dean Stanton Yaphet Kotto is on a every great character actor doing great roles but it was like now if they remade that'd be like everybody reviews but that's the thing the reviews never mean anything that just like so crazy the first was it Harry Dean Stanton that saw it the first time who was it this saw it the first time where they could they climbed down into the they climbed down the stairs and it's it's right there I don't see it for like a second but it was a physical thing but the point is it was an actual guy in a suit yeah and you knew by the way it was moving that it was an actual guy right in front of and it took up three dimensional space in real life yeah you could feel it you give yes and you know yeah I mean just like when the chest first thing yeah it's a it it's actually I can bizarre or an American Werewolf in London say exactly you see brief glimpses of this thing like really quick like one frame one second of it you know and then at the end of it you you see it even when they merge they kill it in the hallway or in the alleyway yeah that's you know you only see it for a couple seconds when when it stares at her and then they gunned it down yeah that was like the heyday for effects every I know who does effects it was like the thing American Werewolf in London or a howling whatever and Fangoria when that started he started really getting articles and stuff and like labo teen and Rick Baker became my rock stars to the horror nerds well the Rick Baker scene when he transforms into the werewolf in the chicks apartment we have the in the nurse's apartment for the first time and he's like I'm fucking and it's like bright it's a great apartment that's what makes it weird ass in the hand stretch fucking wild man to this day weird just and then he tried to kind of recreate like the actual makeup style werewolf with the Wolfman with Benicio del Toro yeah but it just wasn't there the movie wasn't there just wasn't wasn't quite good enough but there's one fuckin badass scene where it becomes the Wolfman when they're in the insane asylum doing tests on them you remember that film I don't remember that film that much I remember I don't I hate saying things cuz this was my thought at the time I remember watching it thinking Benicio del Toro seems like he doesn't want to be in this movie which is such a stupid thing for me to say because I don't know what the fuck he wants it was I think he's a brilliant actor and I really like watch it but it just had that feeling like I don't know what it was and I I've talked to people connected with that movie and I don't think it was a great experience for people for some reason maybe there's a lot of meddling probably a lot of meddling is that something that's a difficult thing to manage or do you not have to deal with that anymore I had to deal with that a lot when I made the two Halloween movies on Steam company because they're this gigantic franchise well there was weird meddling it was just like kind of psychotic meddling how so just weird like like my phone was ringing all the time when I'm on set working and it'd be like we think it should be this I'm like why you're working yeah well if I did that then everything we shot doesn't match and it makes no sense it's just like doing coke and just coming up like I don't know it's just weird thoughts all the time and but I mean a lot of times I don't want to like name all these names of people but I'm working on one movie that never happened and whatever was the number one movie that from that weekend was exactly the notes I would get for what we were working on it didn't and I swear it was around the time of private parts and private parts was number one I go I guarantee when I walk in the office is gonna say can we get Howard Stern in this movie and they did know it didn't matter what it was if it was Starship Troopers ago can we get giant bugs in this movie suddenly wasn't the Halloween movies is another movie that never actually happened but and you just like the little insanity the uncreated executive that wants to be creative is that is a classic story in Hollywood I mean that's that's really like a villain in a film about a movie about a guy trying to make a movie yeah I mean I thought we thought I will give credit for things like I'm remember working with Bob Weinstein and I always thought like the first thing he would say was spot-on like they love movies they have a good sense of movies and he would say something you'd be like yeah then it happens between the second and the third act it's a bunch of bullshit that doesn't work and you go yeah you're right it is but like when he went to the next level of the detail of what's wrong with it it's kind of like someone going like that jokes not funny here's how it would be funny be nothing right the first part of your sentence was all heated I don't need you now to tell me how to make it funny and that's what happens I like when you I don't do them anymore but back when I would be forced to do test screenings with an audience you could just sitting there you'll know you know okay they're bored during this part it's boring or they're not laughing it's supposed to be funny I don't now need that kid to get up and explain to the studio how to save the picture because you watched a movie once so that the process is like half good and half insanity do you get any people upset that in some way you might be glorifying violence maybe but I never hear about it because I don't think that's true I mean or if it is true it doesn't I don't think it matters really because it's fake it's not real right I mean it's like I don't I don't think the rules of real life apply to to art mmm I just don't write because that's why art exists just like you know that ages and you just have to feel that way because it's like okay well if we're gonna run every movie through the PC filter then in American History X Edward Norton can't be racist sure you know how we actually we don't have a movie or running out you know Travis Bickle can't kill anyone he just has to save Jodie Foster because he's a nice person all right you know yeah we're just they have ruins everything I mean but the rules of real life are different but for fiction I mean they can't be rules right and how else are you going to depict these absolutely possible scenarios like if we're saying that there isn't suicidal maniacs in real life like well that's nonsense so if you're allowed to make a depiction of real life yeah of course it's going to have to include racists murderers Psychopaths and I just think it's you know it's it's art and it can go anywhere and it's always if it's shocking that's probably good and it won't be shocking next year like how whatever you're showing your kids at one point was shocking now they're like seriously dead yeah we were talking about jaws that yeah jaws today apparently would be PG it was PG then what's it can you believe that no yeah was it it was oh my god it was just shocking especially scare the fuck well that's because I bears took us to see it which was awesome but I was traumatized for sure yeah that was a crazy movie I didn't want to have anything to do with the water after that movie yeah I still don't but the special effects as well man when that shark rises out of the water for the first time he's thrown the Chum in the water man come on down here jump some of this shit was gonna need a bigger boat like it's hard to believe those lines were like once just lines in a script yeah I know they're iconic yeah they're a part of culture now it's amazing yeah do you think that there is there a style of film or a kind of movie that you want to do that you haven't done yet that you're thinking you'd like to get into I mean there's two different projects I tried to develop for a long time and they both failed to get off the ground one was this movie called the Broad Street Bullies and it was about the 1974 Philadelphia Flyers and the movie is the true story is so insane that you can't believe it's just the way that they decided you know there are a fledgling team nobody cared so they basically built a team of tough guys you know which is kind of like slap shots almost like won the Stanley Cup twice based on just being so scared so in so terrorizing other teams would be scared to play them know be like oh you got the Philly flu cuz major players be like I have to sick to play when we get to Philly cuz then you go back and you watch the fights that took place during those those seasons they literally go into the crowd and they're fighting with fans they come off the ice they break up I mean when the guys are fighting it's not and it doesn't seem like good natured like okay we're gonna go we're gonna go it seems like gripping someone's hair and punching them in the face till their teeth are all gone type fighting cops are breaking up the fights on the ice cops cops with skates no pull uniformed policemen come onto the ice and start breaking things that but they're sliding around with her yeah trying to YouTube it's amazing I mean I just I research this for years and um and then they just you know and Bobby Clark at that time was like the most hated man and hockey I don't know if you're a hockey fan at all but he's just like another one those guys who was he had I don't know I could go on forever for a movie didn't make but but I kept trying to make it go and go and she could just never you could just never and I wasn't went to Philadelphia I was hanging out with the team and I was in their archives and having access to everything I love this is gonna happen and just couldn't it wouldn't move why I don't know I don't know I don't know if the team and the team owners want to glorify that time in the in if there's an amazing documentary on it that was on HBO maybe like five years ago you got to watch it what's it do minutes it might have been called Broad Street Bullies because it was you know the spectrum was on Broad Street mm-hmm so that's how they good thing but it's nuts and I was like you know the Dave Schultz these weren't like a Nazi helmet he was the tough guy on the team that everybody pitch fried of and these guys are like had really long hair and big beards I mean it is not like hockey look like a maniac and they'd get stuff like you know you'd see them get stitches get hit get stitched go back on the ice with the stitches there's jerseys covered in blood and they don't even change their Jersey they're playing covered in blood well that's such a crazy something you'll never do now well the sport still to this day is such a throwback because it's the only sport we are allowed to fight in the middle of the sport imagine if they had that with basketball hockey players are the toughest motherfuckers because I always loved hockey I want to be a hockey player when I was a little kid and that was one thing and for a long time me my wife we had season tickets for the Kings we'd go to every single game for year after year after year and we'd always hang out with the team and they'd come to our house and then party and we'd always be with them in Vegas and they're like football players on skates and they're all for like these like guys I'm like Moose Jaw Saskatchewan and like teeth out and they get crazy in the bar and like mental and they're just like who else is skating 90 miles now crashing into boards yeah that are just to have no give but it's so interesting that it's the one sport where it's written in that you can fight they fight I mean it's so funny it's so crazy like that would make so many sports so much more interesting but nobody would ever do it yes it's literally the tough-guy sport it is the tough guys poor and the thing that always drove me crazy like drove me crazy like it involves me but they would always advertise the LA Kings as like it's like this family thing like oh come on down and cheer for the Kings and be like a girl in a hockey jersey on the billboards around town like you should just put up mug shot style portraits of the players like smiling with their teeth missing and it just says you think you're fucking tough right Kings because yeah and it's not like the old days where they're kind of like skillful they're like this guy's like six foot five and you put them on skates and they're huge in the you know they they're all jacked up and big like football players except their own skates Marcel for a lot of people putting up but it's not a hard sell as MMA which is weird right because that's like the darling of so many you go to the fights and Matt Damon will be there and Leonardo DiCaprio and everybody wants to be seen there and Kanye's in the crowd and it's one of those things where people have decided like that's okay meanwhile they're smashing their faces open with elbows on the ground mental man heads traffic and they're pummeling each other it's okay and he watches the they break it up like I'm pretty sure that guy's already got brain damage you needed to stop that punching yo seconds earlier well it's this Oh crazy sport because it's become accepted like like that's what I'm saying it's weird like a fight in a basketball game is it giant be okay oh my god it's like crazy yeah if a guy you know like judo tossed a guy and landed on his head somebody did that recently in a hockey game was awful like Robin black to the breakdown of it where some guy got a guy in a clinch and hit him with a hip toss and slammed his head onto the concrete is horrible it's weird what I mean I could see why they they want I think they probably like hockey being more family-friendly because the arena's are so nice you bring the guns and they don't want a bunch of maniacs beating the shit out of each other but they could still fight they could still fight but it is just watch this this is crazy boom oh that's bad that's horrible that's an asshole move because like that's not even fighting like and Plus that guy ended with both of their weights guys on his head he's out called I mean that's like serious serious fucking brain yeah I remember one time one particular incident at Kings game where the guy was out and it went on forever and the vibe was so heavy in the arena cuz boy is he dead because you know we don't when someone hits and they just stop stiffen up freaks you out you pull up some Broad Street Bullies fighting from 1974 pull up some of that yeah I've seen Dave Schultz oh that's this thing yeah this is the documentary it's amazing oh look at the way they look back there yeah everything it's like back in the day it's just such a weird thing to see people from that era yeah they don't this is like early days before they became insane oh so it built up because what happened was when they were starting as a team they got really manhandled one time by a certain team and they're like this is never gonna happen again and they rebuilt the team would basically like thug type guys I'm always amazing anybody could punch while they're on skates and that's I can't skate how the fuck do you maintain your I don't know these guys are amazing athletes I one time I went I went down and got skate at practice with the LA Kings with that guys were injured and then that rink seems small when those big guys are all get on their ice it seems like wow there's no room up here but it's also they collide into each other against the wall which the amount of shock on your body I know it's amazing that I mean they just go and go and go then the angels reignite some interest with this conversation because I think that would be it well he's pulling his fucking hair yeah oh it wasn't what it was it's amazing so have you tried again recently or I I try li think that this is like they just don't want to be connected to this story well there's this guy ed Snyder who was the guy who started a whole team and that's four and I met with I thought he was the reason it wasn't gonna happen and then he passed away because I mean he's pretty old and then we started talking to the newer people and it just I don't know how many years my my life I got addicted you know right you don't know and someone said to me one time well you got further than anyone else ever did I'm like how many times are they try to make this movie I need to warn me about that five years ago is there any other kind of movie that you're interested in other than something like that well yeah there was this other one that I worked on for a long time that never went either I had bought the rights to this book called raised eyebrows which was a light that about the last few years of Groucho Marx's life this guy Steve stole you wrote it and he was a 19 year old college kid who started this petition drive do you like the Marx Brothers yeah and because animal crackers had been lost that was the loss film and it you see I think was at UCLA sorry Steve I can't remember your college he started this petition drive to get animal crackers released from the vaults and released because they hadn't been seen since like the 40s or something and he did this was in this this was in the early 70s and through that he became Groucho's assistant but Groucho's final years are really dark because he kept having strokes and he was ill any of this woman Erin Fleming whose post abused they kind of played it like it was his girlfriend but she was with a caretaker and it was turns into Sunset Boulevard inside his house you know and Steve eventually is put in charge of Groucho because that it's a really darn set-builder how so because she guard she was being abused and drugged by this woman she isolated from his family and it's like happening in his Beverly Hills home and it's just dark it was dark towards the end for Groucho yeah and cuz the guy wrote it Steve who's you know still alive and we're friends I was just like it was one of the books you're reading like five seconds and I just happened to find it by accident I like this is an amazing movie but again years and years going on and trying to get at me and just can't get it going Groucho was such a controversial character and one of the greatest lines ever and you bet your life he's talking to this guy and he's asked a guy like you married yes how many kids you got this cigar like yeah he's got a gang kids it he goes Jesus he goes he goes oh I love my wife because I love my cigar too but I take it out of my mouth every now and then yeah that is that was a hugely controversial line yeah he's amazing and he was like and he was very high brows yeah there it is he was very outspoken he was like on Nixon's shit list and stuff and my give me an inside Groucho's house yeah it's really fast if you get that book you'll read in like two seconds that's it's always sad when some iconic old figure like is being taken care of as he's older and you know he's getting fucked over and someone's waiting for him to dies they can get the money yeah and she kept kind of doing saying like we're gonna make you come back Groucho and we're gonna do us TV specials enemy you know like you and Frank Sinatra and Groucho's like you know had on his like third stroke and like can't really talk or you know oh it was just like and a couple of the final appearances of him are pretty rough because he was pretty sharp and good even when he was old early for watching my dick cavett or something but then it got bad and then how did this lady get into his life she was uh I mean I think she was a secretary at first and just kind of weasel their way in oh I can't remember exactly I should I should be able remember I read the book so many times there's so many stories like that of like oh I think there was a Stan Lee story like that and his last few days that happens a lot yeah people were trying to get his money I remember remember that Martha Raye yes that was like the end with her like who's like oh and her boyfriend she's like this and a wee oh that's right shit oh yeah that is sad shit and their kids are done with them and so someone else is taking care of her they're so old their kids have all died of old age you know and this is like you know so you wanted to do that film yeah what happened that it just be just couldn't get it going and we thought we'd every time it seemed like we were on the move it just would stall and then I had a falling-out with the producers and I was like hey you know five years spent with this I'm out oh my god the drain at time yeah that's the thing like for every movie I've ever gotten made there's probably five others that I tried to get made they couldn't get made something it's a real time suck yeah that's that's a fucking huge drag man now when you when you do get a film made is it generally that you come to the studio and you have this idea and you bring it to them and yeah it's usually like well the Halloween movies were different because I remember I did I had no thought I wasn't thinking about Halloween I was think about anything like that and I got the thing like oh you know the weinstein company wants you to go have a meeting with them Bob Weinstein he's in LA yada yada yada so I go in to meet him and he's just like Halloween what do you think it's great fucking movie I mean I didn't know what he was getting it he's like we own the rights and we want to do something with it we don't know what to do because they didn't know if they want to make another sequel or just call it Halloween but not have Michael Myers a nothing like there was no preconceived idea and it was my idea to basically try to reboot it start over with new people playing all the same roles and do that and that was came out 2007 so as per 2006 when I did that who was involved in the more recent one Lionsgate is the company that did the three from hell because I had done after Universal booted me with house 1000 corpses it was eventually acquired by Lionsgate and Lionsgate made the sequel Devil's Rejects and then which was already 15 years ago and a couple years ago I got a real bug to make another one I just went into Lionsgate when it was the same executive still there I was like what do you think about doing this and they're like they were saying you know what that was the last really fun time we had making movies let's do it that's gonna feel good yeah it was great I was like wow that's sad but okay now do you have long-term plans like in terms of like what you want to accomplish as a guy who makes movies well yes and no I mean I don't have a I'm not trying to gear up towards making bigger films because I know I wouldn't work in that system because it's just now I don't want to make things by committee I was like this is the fucked up crazy thing I want to do and I don't want to water because I know so many people that'll be like like our friend Tom Papa I remember him telling me about his TV show come to Papa that it was like this certain idea he said by the time the TV people watered it down and changed it he gets on the airs like well so far removed from the original idea yeah that I don't you know I don't want to do that and you know and so I would rather my goal is just get it made whatever it takes I'm worried about don't try to be blockbuster guy I don't care I mean I've you know had the Halloween movies we're on four thousand screens it was like the number one movie made oh but it didn't make me any happier it's just about making the thing where I can look anyway I love it I'm done cuz you know that's at this stage that's what I want to do yeah that the genre is still so attractive but there's just not a lot of those examples other than like well your films are probably the most prominent currently well I mean if everything's meant I mean horror movies are big business but if they look at it that way then they start making them overly palatable to a wide audience this types of horror movies though you know there's like supernatural horror movies there's monster movies but then there's like homicidal maniac movies this is so much shit redneck homicides that I mean who's that's my job you know it's like The Hills Have Eyes yeah right and you there you go right I mean it's like that kind of psychopath Chainsaw Massacre type shit I love white trash type stuff well the carnie because that's just yeah I was that typical kid who worshiped Evel Knievel I mean that he that would be a that would be a movie the happy a fuckin movie man I worked with his son I work with Robbie Bobby Knievel and during the Fear Factor days alright yeah he did something on fear factor yeah it was cool he's a nice guy but you know I was like damn dude your dad was a fucking psycho yes shit that guy subjected his body to it's crazy and when you watched that shit and you watched the Philadelphia Flyers that this fucking mental it was not just a little kid watching Evel Knievel and listening to Alice Cooper and watching hockey fights and that determines who you become Knievel was just I mean there's a I think it was a Rolling Stone piece of his body where they showed all of his x-rays and all of the Railly bone breaks and steel rods that were various bones that were screwed together and like fuck man what kind of pain was this guy in I don't know I mean did you see that there's a fairly new documentary I think it's called beam Knievel I think it's amazing well it's maybe a couple years old actually but um yeah just any one of those crashes I think this is a famous one in London and he jumps over the double-decker buses and you can see him land and the bike looks like it's made out of rubber and he looks like he's made everything like it looks like every bone in his body just broke and that's you know it's gonna do it again and do it again oh god I mean that was his thing imagine that being your thing your thing is you fly through the air on something that's supposed to stay on the ground a full-size Harley that's not made for jumping or doing anything at all and landing for that manner doesn't have any particularly like like bouncy shocks or anything it's just hitting like cool Katan and just oh my god yeah it's it's a weird thing to be that guy because there was I mean there was some people in the past that had done some pretty interesting shit and risked their lives but he was doing it consistently with an engine that was a thing about him it's like and he was like one of the most famous people in America yeah with the like an American flag suit yeah is like the Fonz and Knievel I know area being Knievel you gotta see that a fancy wow that's amazing Wow and there's stuff in there that kind of blew my mind cuz we all remember the Snake River Canyon yes but they were showing how out of control it was with the people that showed up and were so drunk and the crowds were fighting and crazy just on there oh it's it mental like just what's going on around the the event that's one of those things you can't really do today the same way like if someone jumps over things today it's like so many people are jumping like you're not gonna get famous that way because they think about the just the bananas shit those BMX guys do with their pho yeah three times in the air it's commonplace ya know watch an Evel Knievel's like watching the original King Kong with your kids it's like oh that was a big deal once he jumped seven buses whatever I did it on my bike yeah that would be a great film I don't know what you have to do now catch bullets with your bare hands bullet man you know well now there's people doing parkour and climbing buildings with no ropes that's like you ever watched that kid Alex Honnold do you know you know he's the free solo the free solo guy yeah oh I still haven't seen that yet better he's so nice and so normal when you talk to him I've had him on the podcast a couple of times and I'm like how are you the guy that's wanting to climb the faces fuckin cliffs and some of them weird they're they're not straight up and down they're holding on by a finger let's get like hands wedged in these crackling look at that picture yeah that's my that doesn't make you shit your pants and he's getting older and he's starting to get injured now too and you know he's for the first time in his life he's had you know like you know for a long time he had no injuries no problems and he's I always been doing this a long time now his body's not holding up the way it used to when do you retire like when do you retire little Knievel and you know it's time the finger slips yeah when you retire I mean that's what all of the people that have done it before him think they think look this is gonna end badly yeah you know it's it's crazy to be known as the guy who's doing something that scares the fuck out of everybody yeah you're the guy that everybody's watching to eventually fall look at that like a look at the angle that doesn't even seem possible well he's incredibly strong his hands like he's a slender thin guy but he has gorilla hands yeah the fat ass fingers and he just can shove them into these cracks and hang on in place he was telling me a story about how he was free solo climbing this one mountain when he realized you know like fucking 300 feet up that he forgot his powder so he's got no chalk so he's you know things are getting slippery he's climbing and he finds these guys that are connected to ropes halfway up and he says hey I don't have any powder can I borrow your chalk that's the guy that's trot bag he makes it all the way to top and leaves the chalk bag at the top for the guy it's like one of those guys like ropes he's going by no rope so much fucking chalk like you know like if you ever lifted weights like with that bar gets slippery it sucks like you need chalk yeah to grip things right so you can you could really get a hold of stuff but that's just weights you could put the weights on the worst fall is gonna be three feet to the floor fuck I can't I can't even watch his tongue I'm like my hands are sweating right now anything about it I haven't watched that but I got two and everyone's always talking about no it's an amazing documentary but he said just a fascinating guy because it doesn't make sense he's not like some steve-o type guy there's a maniac and just like always trying to freak people out and do the next thing no I'm gonna rock it on a sharpened car yeah crashed into a brick wall exactly exactly like when steve-o comes up with ideas like he'll tell him to me I'm like don't do that don't do that man like stop doing that oh but I get it that's who he is he's an he's a legitimate bona fide maniac yeah Alex Honnold guys so calm and peaceful you know he said like he's like well you know I'm pretty Mel you know it's like when the whole thing is pretty mellow it's like when things go wrong that's when it's not mellow oh God yeah yeah I know how everything is yeah so do you see things like that like current events stuff or like personally came and think hmmm was that movie is there a movie in there like sometimes I see things I'm trying the last time I thought that and I'm always late like you'll go oh I just saw that hello it's already in production I've never ahead of the curve enough to be uh that's a bummer you know yeah but no there's all kinds of things like that that I would love to do but it's like it just I don't know it's time sometimes I just I've tried like I said I told you two projects that took so much of my life I mean I sat there and watched the because the whole flyers movie ended with them winning the cup the first time and I watched that series I got all the games on with all the original commercials which was incredible Herschel's a Salvador Dali selling house paint like weird shit and I had them I had the whole series I memorized I could have called the commentary on I watched thousands of hours of watching this hockey because I was like if I'm gonna make this movie I'm gonna be the number one Phillies expert on everything I don't want anyone to say anything I'm like oh gee oh no now I can't remember anything and then it was all for nothing oh but that's so that's the way things are anyway though but so you invested too much yeah but you kind of had to because it's like I figured with a topic like that they have such the fans are right I mean they're like that they're like gods in Philadelphia I mean the best thing about this just think of this as a movie ok just these one scene when they introduced the team in Philly I think was 1967 they had a parade to introduce them because of hockey was coming to town they said they had a parade with the players and it was like maybe no one there to watch the parade and even then one of the guys goes all I remember is a guy leaning on the lamppost giving me the finger as the parade went by and then when they won the Stanley Cup they had a parade two million people showed up in the streets of Philadelphia in the foot that if you can find it while you're ho there the entire you know like a hundred thousand people show for the Lakers hemos crazy two million people is for Woodstock's in the streets in the streets of Philadelphia to watch a team drive by and like in the back of like you know convertibles and they're all good they all look like porn stars cuz our fur coats big mustaches and big afros they were amazing it's like just the and that was such a short period of time that was maybe like seven years from go fuck yourself to like you guys are Philadelphia wow it was all during that time period of like you know when they made Rocky so Philadelphia like the shithole of them America you know and then every sports team was bad and the the the the real-life story just reads like fiction I mean holy shit and that was the entire parade road people are hanging out of buildings it was just it was the that's when they won the game was just incredible well showing up in Boston believe it or not I wasn't a hockey fan I didn't I was just into martial arts and I didn't even like sports I just was I found out about martial arts really the school that I want up going to because I was coming home from a Red Sox game I was in a baseball at the time and I went up to this gym and this martial arts Taekwondo school and I happened to be going there right when this guy his name was John Lee was practicing and he was national heavy and light heavyweight champion at the time and this is incredible and I got to see him hit this bag and I remember thinking I can't believe someone can do that yeah like he hit it so hard he was kicking this bag I was like fuck I want to learn how to do that but what year was that this was 19 I was 15 14 15 so 81 82 somewhere around there ok and when I was 19 years old saw but really wasn't paying attention at all to support those balls into martial arts but I was working at the Boston Athletic Club and Bobby Orr who was long retired used to come there to work out all right and he had had so many knee surgeries I was terrible that I used to have to help him I mean everybody was like holy shit ba-ba-ba-ba-ba I didn't I kind of knew he was Bobby Orr but it did it wasn't like I was meeting Bruce Lee or something I was meeting Bruce Lee I probably fainted but it was yeah it was this hockey player guy and I used to have to help him to get on the verse or climber you know diverse climbers know there's one of them out there in the gym you you climb on it it's an amazing cardio machine but you put your feet in these things it was in rocky like petrology Drago was working on it but Bobby wanted to get on this thing so I used to have to help him because he couldn't bend his knees his knees like the range of motion like here's here's a leg here's a normal range of motion right his knees would go like this they wouldn't lock all the way out they would Bend slightly and they would move from this bent slightly to this that's all he had that's crazy he had a little bit of Bend in his knees that's it yeah he would play racquetball and he would just fall over so he like you play rattle but the ball was over here fall over it was like he was on these legs that weren't legs it was like he was on sticks they just didn't work you know and I remember seeing the scarves up and down the sides of his yeah I've ever seen those as a kid like that you'd see pictures I have followed the Bruins how I was always into Bobby Orr and yeah he probably always was back on the ice too soon another injury yep stitch him up rip oh yeah no I didn't know how to fix things back then either and he's so incredibly or was like at that time like if young Brad Pitt was the greatest hockey player of all time I mean he didn't even seem real right you know I think the Golden Boy and I'm keeping making you Paula party clothes but like you see some clips and it's like the way he's skating compared to everyone else it's like did everyone else just learn that day like he's just skating around I'm like they don't even exist it's just as like and as a kid you're like this is the greatest person alive well that's next thing people Knievel also why he blew his knees out right because he was just it was taking these crazy risks and moving so probably yeah I mean he was just people are probably trying to take him out left and right - yeah I mean he and the well the thing with him - he was a defenseman not a forward so he play like a Ford but he would be a defenseman so he's supposed to be the tough guy defending the goalie yet he's like a leading scorer so he was sort of too good for everything so he's like yeah so he's taking all the hits and scoring all the goals he was such a nice guy I remember thinking that too when I was a kid I always used to be intimidated by people who are really nice guys how's he so nice cuz I was kind of a prick drive me crazy like that he was so now I felt inferior I was like god I wish I was that nice you know yeah every I get I know you mean we know it was a mean kid because I was fighting and I was like the fight is to be mean yeah you want to get good at fighting you gotta be fucking means yeah by then I'm five years into fighting and all I want to do and so I'm around this guy I feel like he's so he's so nice and he's like the greatest hockey player of all time fuck yeah it's funny I remember in high school the kids that would always be in the fights and kick everyone's ass feel like you can't compete with that he's just born crazy he likes to fight you punch him in the face it'll probably make him happy after he smashes your head into the sink and you know kills you it's just like it's a different way people well I never got into I wasn't really a street fight person at all I was scared of it that's how I got into martial arts because I was scared of fighting but the the the difference between people that were like a Bobby Orr or a regular player always fascinated me I was like how is one guy Michael Jordan yeah all right how was one guy how's one guy you know Reggie Jackson what is he doing different how does this guy rise above everybody else they're just special because I would read about him and be like you know they knew he was good when he was a kid the bet come watch this eight year old I was skating people like he was I think I forget I'm I don't want to I'm not a Bobby Orr expert I can't remember things but I remember the like you know being scouted at 14 like he was an adult he was so good but that's what you have to be I guess you know I mean they're just some kid I mean we all remember kids from high school that's like why are you right you're like a professional athlete and we're like stupid kids yeah you know right like why are you shredded just like dopey kids like what's going on what kind of musicians to write remember when Prince first came out wasn't he like 19 when he came out with I want to be your lover yeah some people are just special yeah they're just Mozart but in fighting or it's so humbling yeah well that's what goes back to the thing we said like an hour ago fooled them again guys like those guys are so special well there's always gonna be people like that right they just put it all into perspective for you and make you realize like wow just okay I'm a regular person it's fun watching people like that but yeah but then there's people like that sometimes that they just self-destruct because they don't care that they're good right you know and I remember people like that too and like they do nothing with it that's true too you know which is weird yeah there's sometimes people can be too talented where things come too easy it doesn't mean anything yeah there's a thing like you know you were talking about earlier about being bullied like maybe if we get rid of bullying we're gonna get rid of a certain amount of success to mean something I don't want anybody to hurt their feelings but I understand that there's something that comes out of that right well there's something that comes out of it being really hard for you to do that when ya figure I gotta do it you've developed this indomitable spirit because you've managed to make your way through the hardest levels of the game to get to the top it's not like you were just faster than everybody yeah have bigger muscles and your fucking heads thicker or something yeah I mean yeah you can't be like Pro bullying because that's weird but I but there is something to it because like real life just bullies you anyway there's something to adversity like you have to be able to like like where people like whenever someone says like what's your advice for like you know doing this like being in show business or something I go if being told by complete strangers that you suck all day long does not bother you in any way you know then maybe it's the business for you yeah maybe it's not because I think it bothers everybody who wants to join there's a difference between bothering like that's a drag or like right this is always funny whenever someone comes to me in a silly he wrote this short story be brutally honest I mean brutally honest that person's like secretly saying please say something nice above course yeah come watch my show be brutal is brutally honest you're hideous to look at you the least talented person I ever seen in my life that's such a request like I've had people ask me to read their scripts I'm like hey bro you're asking me for an hour and a half of my time yeah I don't even know you do yeah a valuable an hour and a half is I have children and three jobs and a lot of hobbies I don't have an hour and a half to watch move I don't want to read a script when my agent sends it over I don't want to read yours I mean they think that I'm suck if I could just get this Rob Zombie if I could just get this Rob Zombie he can make it then it all work out it's so funny the people that always make it never talk about themselves know people that can't telling you about their great idea it's very rarely an idea it's very rare that ideas actually great yeah yeah I think there's certain qualities that someone has to have to make something that's truly exceptional and very rarely do they want to tell you that it's truly exceptional yeah I mean it's weird like maybe it's the insecurity thing that you don't want to tell anybody what you do because you don't ever think it's good enough as opposed to people that are not good enough and they always want to tell you about themselves right yeah that's a problem the wrong people are talking about themself well it's like it's human psychology but I think the thing about like I was saying about Richard Jeni would say that looking at shitty comics is what inspires people to do comedy there we learn from all of the psychological disasters all the people that think like all the guys that think they're better looking than they are like then they walk up to a girl what the fuck you talkin out of here like it's something there's something to be learned from that like you know I had a friend growing up that would swing at every pitch this guy would go up to every girl and he didn't he wasn't a particularly good-looking guy he wasn't smart he wasn't funny he but he was bold yes and you know he and I would learn from him like girls would be angry at him like angry that he had the balls to ask them out and then they probably would go right because they were really you got to very few his strategy just didn't work it didn't work at all not out find girls with something wrong with them like there's something wrong whether they have a screw loose I that story was going to be his boldness paid off no he says disaster I've lost touch with him 15 20 years ago he's out of his fucking mind but I remember when we were kids Jesus Christ cuz I the one of the things about getting the show business that helped me is I was always super insecure to talk to girls but then when you wouldn't you would I would do stand-up you would do work at clubs and you'd be the guy on stage making people laugh like they wanted to talk to you like you actually want to talk to me this is crazy you know I couldn't believe that that's weird that guy would just fucking anybody like he would every flight attendant there's but you can learn from people that fuck everything up yeah you can't you learn from everything though but I have this theory that nobody can learn from other people's mistakes really it's written it's the maybe it's just the way you think and I think but it's the rare person who learns from other people's mistakes yeah it's rare but it's possible because I always think like heroine right didn't Lou Reed finish that one for everybody we're still gonna give it a go but it's different when you do heroin or just anything I mean I never know anyone that learns from anyone's mistake because you can even if you're in the business and you go look here's my piece but don't spend that money on that because that's the only gonna see put it away do this cuz that's an advance that's not coming every month right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then you know two months later they're broke right you know it's like I have stuff I don't give people advice because they don't want to hear it I don't care be the people who want to really want advice and they're gonna use it it's like one out of a hundred but they do exist yeah but it's rare yeah and those are the people that are smart knowing aha yeah I try to learn as much as I can from other people's mistakes but if they don't feel as bad as they feel to those people mister - yeah the fucking hurt man like bombing like bombing on stage is suck in a thousand dicks in front of Maya it hurts so bad that you learn like okay I am gonna figure this out I'm never having that happen again I gotta I gotta get better that must be so bad relate to it because you know I've done a different sort of bombing in front of people on stage but you can't really learn from other people bombing I think you kind of that's one of those things you kind of got to do yourself how long does it take because I'm always fascinated by how long do you feel it takes I mean this is not really a question I guess you can answer but till you find your voice and you go okay this is me I'm this guy I'm not I'm not ready liar I'm not Jerry Seinfeld it depends I mean some people maybe never find it I guess but a lot of people never find it there's impossible comics whereas like you you see them and you go oh my god this poor bastard was trying to do something that he's never gonna be able to do there's people that just they're never going to be able to do it for whatever reason whatever whatever psychological ingredients that they have it's not enough to make chocolate cake like you don't have any eggs you know I mean flour yeah you're fucked yeah I I know yeah but then there's other people that their ego protects them where they they believe that they did well when they didn't do well they're delusional and that's the worst thing because they they're trying to protect themselves from the bad feeling but they understand the bad feeling is your friend because that's it sucks hard but yeah that's the fucking medicine that you take that medicine you gotta go okay what did I do wrong this is what I did wrong I cannot do that again you got to put more time and focus and effort it's really dependent it's almost entirely on how much you do that objectively and your focus like how you can look at it some people just don't ever wanna no matter what they're doing whether they're painting or write making comic books they don't want to ever look at it the way other people look at it they want to think that everything they do is amazing you know mm-hmm like a that's true my kids will show me something and sometimes it'll be funny like you know my daughter will make something on an iPad sometimes it'll be funny and sometimes it's like look they think it's great why cuz they're she's fucking nine okay but you're 28 and you think everything you do is amazing it's like okay but do you think that's worse now because of things like Instagram oh for sure your everybody puts up anything and you want to go you look like an idiot but your friends like you are so or something you know like everyone's can they can feed their delusions that's that's certainly but you also could take the sting of criticism and you get it from way more people like if you someone you put something up on Instagram you think it's funny and then that people come at you hard like whoa like you might you know if you're a comic and you've been doing stand-up for five years you're never gonna work in front of none normal circumstances you're never gonna work in front of 5,000 people but you might get 5,000 people saying you suck if you put something up on Instagram that's true you know yeah I mean you can tell and I mean I'm sure you can tell when somebody's funny almost instantly you can tell but some people surprise you like some people in the beginning like wow this guy's got it rough but then one day they it just clicks and they just keep working at it and but it's a matter of whether or not they're willing to put the building blocks in the right place and whether or not they're going to admit that the structure that they have currently is not viable right and some people aren't but some people are it's like it doesn't and also well it's it's just like movies right which like everybody's got a different style you know your films are your kind of films whereas like there's other people that are doing like these really simple sweet you know chick flicks and that's for them that's what they like and there's people that find that and they think it's amazing it's so good it's like you've got to find whatever the fuck it is that you do that you would like to see yeah because that's hot that's the only way you can judge it yeah I mean I do what I do because that's what I like so what I'm doing I go okay but if I was trying to do something else that I'd what didn't get imma go what do I judge against like what you're telling me is good then I'm lost well you'd be like the executive asking you get Howard Stern in the movie like I don't know why they want him in a movie they just know he's famous movie just get him and that's what happened when when I was doing the Halloween movies a lot because they'd weigh in so often that it can start messing with you because you don't know which end is up because you just want to go Jesus Christ can I just fucking focus for five seconds before you send her another 18 pages of weird notes fucking with it and you really don't know which end is up anymore there for a film and I've been there on TV shows it's a drag it's very confusing because you don't know anymore because you're so spun out from too much information because most of find most of the time and that's why I'll add offend likes and like a filmmaker like Ed Wood and why people still talk about plan 9 from outer space because yes technically it's inept ended but there's something so specific about this guy's bizarro vision that you're still talking about it and that something like Tim Burton makes a movie about it there's a million far superior made films from back then that nobody gives a shit about it's just like there's something about keeping that weird bizarro vision alive and not having the committee ruin it yeah if enough people know that it's going to be an Ed Wood movie they're gonna go see it there's enough people that find out about the like yeah that's weird shit yeah you'll see it's weird how did he make a movie more entertaining in six days with like $300 and you made with two hundred million dollars well especially in the teeth after the test the taste of time because if you look back at it now I mean people will gather round and watch it especially after the giant Depp movie yeah because when Johnny Depp was such a weird rate in that so fucking strange that's like the phrase I think Edie would and like Young Frankenstein at two times were like that's like the perfect combo they're just such perfect films Ed Wood is so weird that the Johnny Depp version of my kind of character are you right now yeah I remember right when it came out of nose right it was right when Martin Landau got nominated for an Oscar I ran into him at a newsstand and I couldn't I never go up to people because I don't bother anybody but I couldn't resist and it was like one of those cases where he was so nice that of like you know which was great but he was great in that and he seems so shocked there like some young weird dude was like so excited to see meet Martin Landau because you know he's pretty old and yeah that's cool what a movie like that sort of reignites people's appreciation for someone tonight always been great yeah I mean cuz I was like a space 1999 dork and stuff back of the day is there ever a guy that you like you you are such a big fan of as an actor that you would kind of try to like make a movie around them probably I mean on the sad part is so many of the people that I love are gone mmm you know like I've tried to put a lot of people I really love in all my movies a lot of like just weird character actors from the 70s that you'd see in like Clint Eastwood movies and stuff but like Jeffrey Lewis you know who's in like you know sidekick in every which way but loose and was in high place Juliette Lewis is dead Jeffrey Lewis oh yeah and he was like the greatest I worked with him twice and he would have huge a Joey the funniest story once he goes this is what I learned from them I can't imitate Marc but it was what I learned from working with Clint whenever I was in a scene with Clint I'd make sure I put my hand on his shoulder that way I knew he couldn't cut me out of the scene but he was he was an amazing guy I remember when I did this animated movie with Tom papa called the haunted world of Hell superb Easter and Jeffrey Lewis's and he had just come from boxing at that point he was in his 70s but he was like little but he was like he had that Eastwood body where he's still like ripped you know Clint Eastwood you don't think him is like but then he has that Charles Bronson body back then were boxing in the 70s yeah he came back and he was like don't be fooled I can still kick your ass oh yeah hilarious guy you know a movie that I fuckin loved that it hardly gets talked about anymore it's bad lieutenant yeah Harvey Keitel you don't hear from Harvey Keitel anymore for whatever reason well I fit is he is he in the new thing that Irishman the Scorsese I don't know he sounds like he should be that fuckin guy has depth he's amazing when he gets there's scenes in movies when he gets angry are you like Jesus Christ like this this is real like he's he's hit this weird place where he might murder the person he's in the I know he's I always wonder what this I've heard different weird stories of why because he was in Eyes Wide Shut right and Kubrick filming for a long time and then replaced him with Sydney Pollack why I don't know but I would always hear these different weird like that weird that there was weird shit that he did and I don't know it's true so I don't repeat it but I was wonder because he's so great yeah but to shoot for six weeks or two months and then be replaced it was a weird thing well he is his scenes there's something about him like like pulp fiction he's so authentic like you believe he's the cleaner you know he's so great as like sport in like you know taxi driver yes I think that might be the first thing I saw him in so I was he just seems so authentically sleazy I used to have a bad lieutenant poster I thought fuck happened to it but somewhere along my travels moving from place to place I lost it but I remember he's amazing that fucking movie was so crazy cuz it was like a bad cop he's a movie but probably fairly realistic probably until did you ever see the documentary the 7/5 no it's a great documentary about corrupt cops in New York oh really yeah and Michael Dowd who was one of the guys who was one of those corrupt cops one up going to jail and now he's out and you know I had him on the podcast we talked about and the pot it's fucking all of it is true all of its documented in all of its insane what year was that all happening was that like was the 70s right what year was I always assumed corruption happened in the 70s it seemed like he was showing up at the precinct with a fucking Corvette were knocking over 80s and 90s Oh was Wow Serpico time period yeah but he's out now man and it's um it's just one of those stories that's so fucking crazy just you know knocking the drug hits out on him and they were putting hits on other people it's like it's like poof it's it's just maniacal who's that in New York yeah yeah yeah yeah he's like the West he but he talks about like first on the job being exposed to corruption like they threw some guy out of a fucking balcony you know like like this guy jumped right I think I forget what the exact center was but some ridiculous shit like that where they were he was aiming is like it was corrupt long before he got there yeah he just sort of stepped into the the mess of it you know it's like what you're talking about like your early days in New York City like seeing that guy get beat to death by a cop like that was kind of how police had total autonomy they mean they they had so much power and authority back then yeah it was crazy I remember another incident this is right before I left that I think I start talking about in finish it was like they had Tompkins Square Park and they were trying to that's when it was that area was getting gentrified that was the big word and there was like kind of a riot there was all the people protesting the gentrification of the Lower East Side this was probably like I don't know maybe early 90s late 80s and the cops showed up on horseback and I was I wish I had just walked out to go to the deli I didn't even know this was happening I just walked right into the middle of like what's going on here and then the cops just started racing through the crowd and I just started running and I saw a friend of mine he he died um he was a singer this punk rock band Reagan youth and I saw this cop just jump on him and start pounding on him so bad he had really long dreadlocks the next time I saw him his head was shaved and was all stitched up because he just had so much damage to his head he'd been like a coma or something and then it was a big scandal you could probably find us use it because the cops all put black tape on their badge numbers so that no one could tell who was who while they did all this shit and it was like on the front cover the New York Post a picture of like a I think the post the badge with the black tape that shit was wild deck back then see if we can find well then the Chicago elections and the riots during the 1960's yeah was like a turning point in Hunter s Thompson's life because he was there and he watched these cops just beat the fuck out of people and he said that he saw far worse beatings by the Chicago the ever saw for the Hells Angels because you know his first book yeah the Hells Angels look so he was around those guys for a year watching them get into biker brawls and shit he's like this fucking paled it pales I mean it's yes why but uh it's crazy too but sometimes I being a cop must be a crazy job horrific because I can't imagine I mean I'm doesn't justify stuff we're talking about but I can't imagine how you couldn't go crazy in that job right you see every day and what you most of them I think of PTSD and you know they don't it does it's not addressed most people have disdain for them almost everybody they meets a liar yes you mean a guy oh I didn't know how fast I was going oh this is my house I just can't find my keys like everyone's lying to you and you're the enemy you are a professional enemy and you were an enemy outfit yeah for all these criminals enemy it's a terrible way to live yeah I need them badly right it's in its I don't know can't win on that job I don't think no no you can't and it's and people don't you don't get paid enough people don't respect you they don't appreciate you you know I want you around no they want you around yeah and then you're not there fast enough exactly yeah yeah it's uh I mean and cop movies that's what's crazy is like cop movies people love people love cop movies and the cops are the good guys yeah so strange but like their interactions with humans in real life like boy if people treated them the way they think about them in the movies it would be a wonderful time to be a cop it's weird though because I remember that time here in New York like so strict like I have a different relationship now when I see cops but but as a as like a bum kid at 19 like I remember walking down the street and a cop would cruise alongside roll down the window and they'd start taunting me saying shit like you know cannolis and but they're just like waiting for you to say something back right and it was like was weird you know I was just walking down the street I wasn't you know even J walking down the street now whatever cop comes up to me like oh no what's happening like dude I saw you in Slayer it was fucking awesome I as weird yeah it's gotta be super strange yeah I mean they're more accountable now than ever before I think that's one of the great things about body cameras and cell phones cops are you know you just can't rock it that way before but I don't think they get enough counseling and I don't think they get enough money and I don't think that's I don't think it's a stringent enough screening process I think there's a lot of people that are there you know there are powerless twats when they're young and they want all just wish everybody's gonna fuck if I could be a cop and they become a cop for all the wrong reasons and then there are the ones that give the good cops a bad name and if you think about the amount of interactions that people have with police and this is what perspective is so important there are fucking 320 million people in this country and cops have millions and millions and millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of interactions with people yeah all the time but how many of those interactions are positive the vast majority of them are not police brutality the vast majority of men are not shooting someone implanting a weapon on them or planting drugs on them of course vast majority of them are cops doing a really hard job and doing their best but nobody gives a fuck about that you only care when the cops go bad you know yeah you know it's just perspective which you know nobody has no that's too nuanced to have a conversation with the world no no it's a perspective on anything well this a man I appreciate you coming in here and you film is out tonight tonight tonight it's three from hell three from Hell tonight and everywhere well somebody will tell me they couldn't find it but it's trying to be everywhere so and then when will it be available like if someone
