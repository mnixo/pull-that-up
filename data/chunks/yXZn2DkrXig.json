three-two-one Vancouver April 20th we're doing a 420 show Chito Santino Andrew Santino 20 Hinchcliffe and me that's some big ass arena go to Joe Rogan calm we're doing every year hi Jimmy hi buddy I do a 420 show no headphones you wanna do headphones are no harmful I don't mind as well no I don't I don't know a weird thing with what I have to have claustrophobic really yeah it feels weird you feel like the headphones are tramping you I don't know I did I feel like I'm underwater like I don't like the way that sounds and now I know that's better I look like an asshole but it feels better a lot of people do that yeah a lot of musicians do that they do like one in one out it's the air it's feeling the air I don't know why the pressure of the headphones I just don't like it I like to be trapped you do trapped in the headphones I don't care for at all I like hearing the other person's voice right next to mine so I don't talk louder than they talk we don't talk over each other that's what does that's professional but I can't like Howard I heard would do it we're all I got they wouldn't even look at each other like I have to be in the room looking at the person's mouth like I don't like to do it and look no meaning there's the way they were set up for the camera sometimes you're facing both kind of the same way because of the cameras they weren't always I don't think face to face if you look at his old set up wasn't like already sitting behind him at one point you already was sitting to the side of him and and then the guest was like over there yeah yeah I could never do that well you know Howard also runs a board that's a difference look he's got a bunch of shit in front of him he's actually a trained radio guys he knows all the Jamey shit he knows all them switches all that fancy stuff yeah yeah I have no idea what the fuck's going on over there I can basically set I can I can start and stop and I hate I hate on the board it's distracting and I don't like doing it it just it doesn't feel fun you know it's crazy they have full setups now for podcasts like a podcast board that you buy like it's set up for podcasts just plug mics into it it's all kind of there is they they have audio compression on those things to you it's called like the pot podcast or pro or something yeah a name yeah you can put a phone into it for calls and yeah yeah Wow yeah someone take calls I like being live we're live now - oh yeah I like right now on this note we're not live anymore oh you don't do like you're always like the feeling of live because if you fuck up it's out there no there was companies that were they were taking clips as we were live and uploading them immediately and building these huge channels with hundreds of thousands of subscribers and you could use that for anything they're selling things links to stuff they're basically building a business off of your clips so you got to be a little bit more you can't let that happen you know you also don't know what they're gonna turn that channel into you know they could turn that channel into anything right its YouTube is still a little bit of like a Wild West sort of situation then there was also copyright issues like you get three copyright flags in a row they take your whole Channel - yeah and we had gotten a bunch of them we've gotten them four clips that we show we got them four pictures like you have to try to figure out like what's what are you allowed to do what are you not allowed what's fair use and is it fair use mean they just don't come after you for it like I don't know what that what it means either it's it's not that clearly defined unfortunately but it's also you know like the Internet in general you know at one point in time you can kind of put it like eight one point in time with if you went to YouTube you would find all kinds of shit that was on people's channels that was copyright protected stuff TV shows movies music all kinds of stuff and they've slowly started you know not not really slowly this is accurate to say they've come eliminated a lot of that stuff now but they're operating at an insane scale like the amount of people that upload stuff to YouTube every day is it's probably unimaginable like if you could see it you can't keep up with it but if you had a giant screen in front of you and you saw all the videos that are being instantly uploaded to YouTube at any given moment you probably like what ya like this is more there was some crazy quote that there's more content created today like I think what is the number it's it's almost like in one day there's more content being created than in all of human history before like 10 years ago Wow yeah well how many podcasts are there are there's like a couple hundred thousands highways grown widely seven hundred thousand seven hundred thousand podcasts yeah it's also I don't know how they keep up with what you're allowed to put on what you're not if somebody doesn't complain do they catch it and pull it off or the algorithms catch it and pull it off time's yeah here what is this website of the day there's like all these things are happening every minute of the day four million 166 thousand users like posts on Facebook but what is the guilty right here 300 hours it's uploaded every minute Wow but what about the thing about data like the amount of data that people produce today it's about it's something like that I think it's like one days where the data is equivalent to the entire human history up until like 20 years ago or something like that uh-huh adblock they gotcha what does it say here does it say you know what you're talking about yeah yeah it's a nutty quote Oh more than three point seven billion humans use the Internet god damn it yeah who's it there are people out there no internet you know do you know Don Gavin is I funny you say John Gavin I literally I know who he is from all you guys that Boston guys love them I just got him on Spotify because I've seen clips mm-hmm and I'm like Dane Cook put something up that Gavin is releasing an album yes something I want to hear him really do stand-up so I really never watched it be so fucking funny really good oh he's great yeah by never I never sat down watched him to a set back in the day he was the king like when we were in Boston he just sit back and you go oh my gosh it's quit you quit doing yeah he was so good and he'd never sent a text in his life until he texted me to be on the show really yeah that was first text was to you yeah he's like it took me about an hour and a half Oh looks like I'm doing here yeah he's uh he's so old-school like he doesn't just calls people and he had never sent a text Bob Kelly's like that though like some guys her phone got Bob Kelly's a phone guy like gyul texts them and you just won't hear back and he likes to fucking talk on the phone I hate it Joey Diaz does that - he's a phone guy yeah Joe but Joey has a logic to it he goes I want to hear your voice it was I'm sick I'm insecure I don't want to see no fucking text message because I know what that is what are you saying I want to hear your voice I want to hear the love and you okay that makes sense it's also a great way to not have things recorded if you don't want them actually in print but yes Bobby just liked the phone like I hate it tries to be nuts to come you know I never my phone's always on silent one too many times I was in a relationship fucking three in the morning huh you're getting a vibration I'm like fine so my phone's been on silent for ten years mmm yeah ten years of silence yes ring-ring errs they're gross like when you hear someone in a fucking restaurant do do do do do do do do do I get the fuck out of here with that thing but isn't it great watching somebody panic and go into their purse yeah never watched somebody panic and be truthful like that's a justified reaction when you're fucking panicking and going through your stuff I kinda I kind of appreciate that dude I'll just think it before you sat down we've known each other for so long and now we're like these old men on the radio we've known each other since we were kids yeah like when I first met you we were both in our twenties early twenties young comics hanging around in New York and now we're old yeah we are all I think the men we did a gig together and I remember it specifically I think you featured actually I think I was the host to do with the feature and you were doing to the bit about Tyson of Robin Givens and and I want to say was 1992 up in the mountains in Jersey for a guy named Pat Guarini I could be incorrect but I think it was around night like a pack on it might have been 1992 but I'm pretty sure that was the earth could be did a lot of gigs yeah it's hard to remember and you were close with a guy named John Tobin who I remember well yeah yeah yeah it's um the passage of time is a strange thing then it really is because most the time it doesn't seem like it's anything significant it's just life you get up when the alarm goes off you you know eat breakfast you put your clothes on but then one day you know you're hanging out with someone like like you that I only get to see you like once a year maybe twice a year and then I'm like oh yeah look we're oh yeah we're fucking the world keeps going yeah keep you keep on keep on aging but do you mind it like I don't mind it because the more people you know that die like as you get older they start dying not just from unnatural causes but natural cause and you're like fuck I guess like whenever people die now as much as it said I'm always like okay that's one more person I lasted longer then and it's not that I'm happy to see them go I know what you're saying but it's like I know I wanted things count your blessings me I'm winding my life down yeah yeah you gotta count your blessings it's it's one of those things where it's so easy to get complacent it's so easy to not you know to not appreciate things so easy yeah I look around my life sometimes you get depressed and you look and you're like what am i complete have everything I want it like if you told 18 year-old Jimmy Norton that he would be complaining about this I would spit on myself well it's like what we were talking about before the show that there was these people on a show and they weren't making as much as the lead guy who was this famous guy and they were really pissed off at him and complaining and then they eventually fucked the guy over in the show got canceled now they don't have anything yeah like you don't realize like how good it is because everyone's comparing themselves to other folks they're comparing themselves to other people that they're around other people that they're with or I remember I was reading something about Iran Berkeley do you remember who he is do ya boxing champion bad motherfucker Iran Berkeley went broke even though he made millions of dollars because he was hanging out with all these pro athletes and everybody's just out doing everybody everybody's getting a Lamborghini or a gold chain that's bigger than the other guy's gold chain or a bigger house or bigger that's everybody that next thing you know you're broke you spent it all yeah you like fuck and it's just this it's all relative like even though you've got things great you don't have it as great as that guy over there so comparatively you feel like a loser but you gotta know where you're at - like getting fired from me we got kicked off Opie and Anthony in 2002 best thing that ever happened to me because it showed me they could all be taken away from you so long before this whole culture of just canceled culture and all this shit happen I had had that moment of life is good and then you're out it was a cut the Condoleezza Rice thing right no that was on XM that's when we almost got fired from satellite no this was a sex for Sam on terrestrial this is wneud uh-oh that's when you guys get fired because you had the people and they had sex in a little section st. pat's yeah so that was two years off the air but that showed me that they can take anything at any time yeah so I've never thought I was irreplaceable I never think I'm I got it forever anything I have I know yeah can be fucking yanked me ya know it definitely can that was a weird one to me because the big thing was that these people had sex in a Catholic cathedral that was the the big reason why they got fired right because they didn't ask these people to do it in there did they yeah it was kind of a contest it was known like you would get what they call a two-point conversion if you had anal like there was all these weird things and it was a bad move to go into st. Pat's thing when the st. Pat's and there was an arrest and there was an arrest it became real and it was so avoidable on so many levels like so many things yeah you look back you know why did we just shut the fuck up and it would have stopped you know you know why do we push it but you know I'm glad it happened now in hindsight well you know in a lot of ways it's there's this thing that people do you know we're talking about re before the podcast where it's you do things you're not supposed to do so people go I can't believe you're doing that and then there's just like thrill to that there's a thrill to it and then what happens is you have to keep upping it yeah you have to keep upping it yes and it's almost like you get a fear like if I don't top last time the people who like me are no longer gonna like me and I'm gonna lose this momentum I've picked up you become afraid that the people who like you are gonna go you're a fraud you're not doing what we want you to do you so then you keep topping yourself and keep topping it's like the kid who eats bugs you know what I mean you know then he's eating a roach and the next thing you know he's fucking he's doing this because he's afraid of not topping himself then all of a sudden being ignored Brian like Pat like the intern Pat Oh Pat Duffy Pat Duffy best PK cat shit he drank people's vomit he was literally an indestructible fucking man look if you if you have to build the guys and like in a military he's a type of mentality you want oh yeah for sure you want to get him when he's 18 yeah turn him into a full salvage yeah what is he doing these days I don't know I haven't talked to him I don't know what about Pat from Woon Aki you know I thought of him recently he on Twitter I don't know exactly dude I would love to have him yeah Pat Philbin his name is I would love to have him on to our radio show because I miss Pat from Moonachie a lot dude that day where he did the baby bird the day where they had the eggnog dream contest it was you and me and and re and there was a couple of the people in the studio as well yeah that was one of my most fun times ever on the radio she's so ridiculous the whole floor you could never do that today never never in a million years we're in Opie and Anthony in the studio the floor was covered in plastic bags because they had an opening and opening Anthony had an eggnog eating contest and everyone would throw up there was you get to a certain level of eggnog we just couldn't take it anymore and Pat had to throw up because he was diabetic so he shouldn't been drinking that anyway we should so he's drinking gallons and gallons of eggnog and when he threw it up we said like he was ready to go and I said let's get Pat Duffy to lean his head was that your suggestion yeah I was doing fear factor back then I might my head was all full of sick things that was like what year was that mm I want to say q18 seven wasn't really together on that was on k-rock that was in a terrestrial studio was it seven yes I'm thinking it was yeah it definitely wasn't three cuz we weren't on the raw on the radio then oh right right right um so he leans his head over this garbage pail and Pat from Moonachie blows judge like a fountain like the most insane Stephen King like it was that movie stand by me remember the kid had the pie-eating contest the kids throwing yeah yeah that's what it was like literally didn't seem humanly possible that a person could have that much fluid in their body and then when he was injecting it was like a cartoon he's doing it in Pat's face 2006 2006 2006 Wow and I can't believe I forgot you I used to forget that that borough was there that day yeah we're all there moon it's one of those things you're glad you were part of right like I'm happy I was there for that I was happy I got to see that it was so fun that show when it was in its prime when it was in its peak was so fun yeah and it was it was a hang and it really influenced in a lot of ways the way I do podcasts because it's there's no structure it's just hanging out with funny people just talking about stuff no structure yeah just bullshitting wherever it goes it goes I mean it always go somewhere I mean these people having a conversation it's always gonna flow somewhere exactly doesn't have to be controlled and regimented and what do you wanna talk is there anything worse when you go to a radio show what do you want - dude I've done radio shows so they tell you they want you to bring up certain subjects where you have jokes you know there's blood not even that long ago man like less than 10 years ago I did one of those national radio shows in the Midwest and they asked me to do that and I was like what and the producer got upset and I go I don't do that I'm not gonna do that and like we need subjects well I think I was like pissy with me yeah it's hard to do because you feel embarrassed it's like price you feel just you feel dirty like when someone's doing your bit and you know you're doing it there ah they're fake laughing who's enjoying this that's what radio used to be though what radio used to be like you'd go on WAAF in Boston and you know you would talk to the guys and you would kind of work in your bits yeah you know and like everybody did it everybody did their bits yeah I guess it was a part of it but I was never good at it well cuz you're authentic but Opie & Anthony was the first to me like Howard show was much more controlled you know Howard's behind the mixer he's kind of controlling everything there was a certain amount of time that he would talk to you and then other people would come in and then you know he had like a more more of a structure whereas ona you would go in there and Anthony would have a gun and fucking you know Oh Opie's behind the mixer just sort of watching all this chaos go on different comics come filtering in and you know every time Marion Barry walked in yeah he was going on swaye next door and we he was like a little out of it and loopy and we fucking we just hijacked them and it kind of walked in like he had no idea who we were it was really uncomfortable about crack you went right into you it was in that pipe it was like nobody knows what's in that I go nobody knows what's in that plan I'm like you knew what's in that pipe the fuck you talking about man and the publicist would come on let's go they wanted to get him out of there wanted to get him out of there immediately yeah that was fun Marion Barry he died not too long after that I don't think right it wasn't that long after that yeah it was funny man I remember there was a an interview they did where there was a news station they were talking about to people about his arrest and all this stuff and they interviewed this guy goes come on man everybody smokes a little crack every now and then like everybody smokes a little crack every now and then that's a great quote from a mayor that's a great mayor's who wasn't him though he wasn't saying it someone else okay in defense of him all right if it was him saying that that would be hilarious yeah Mike having this no it was another guy that was on the street who was like everybody smokes a little crack every now and then did he get reelected after that Jesse did I think he went to jail came out and got reelected yeah yes people DC very forgiving lol yeah yes forgiving it strange fucking placement so how do you handle this man this whole culture were in it's a it's it's it's not it's not scary it's more irritating like anything you say people who are looking to I don't mean if you say something horrible they're gonna react like you said something horrible yeah anything you say people are looking for a reason like they're looking for something because the high that they get is by going after you and they know that they're high doing it did you see that lady that was talking about the Kobe Bryant death and she accidentally said the n-word oh she said makers yeah makers yeah she was trying to she thought she was either saying the Knicks or the Lakers yeah and she said the makers yeah I think she said the n-word but she said she said she said makers but I you know I I think she said the n-word I think it just it's almost like it's so taboo that it's in people's heads like I'm Martin Luther King's birthday there's always an anchor that gets fired because he can't remember that Martin Luther King jr. are all separate words and you should not conflate the last two or you're gonna get fucking fired King and jr. they put it together too fast and it comes out wrong yeah yeah that's what happens all the time all the time the word the word Coon is such a weird one too because who the fuck calls black people Coons that's a really old-school old southern one yeah racist ones range it was a known insult when I was a kid but I don't even know if that was one I even heard when I was a kid I definitely have heard it I definitely heard it in pool halls I definitely heard it was from old dudes it was like an old dude thing like guys and their fucking 60s and shit but I had a friend who has severe anxiety issues he has panic attacks and he eventually had to quit doing stand-up so he was he he was doing the warm-up for the Bill Cosby Show okay and he is doing the thing and talking to people in the crowd and Bill Cosby is obviously super squeaky-clean show and the warm-up has to be squeaky clean and while he's walking around the crowd he has this unstoppable thought in his head don't say the N word don't say it don't say it don't say it just don't say that word and he said I am sweating he goes sweat is pouring down the sides of my face my hands are shaking and I'm so terrified all I could think of his don't say that word don't say that he goes I never say that word yeah I never say that word but his brain because he has anxiety issues and he's got OCD in a bunch of different like he's got mental issues he was paralyzed and feeling he had a full-blown panic attack so here he is doing a warm-up he can't even talk and he's got a microphone he's standing around these people and then he's becoming ruthlessly conscious of the fact that all these people are watching him he's like holy fuck I can't do this and he's like his heart is beating out of his chest and he's like the only victory was that I didn't say the word yeah the only victory that was what I was really hoping his story and I was I was hoping that was in the introduction and he lost everything but yeah sometimes if you focus on something that you can't say yes and I think these anchors get caught up the woman when Kobe done I also think that she was just panicking but it's to give your panicking and that word drops out like Lakers what years gee I'm sure I don't want to give any more heat on that I don't want to make that lady feel bad it's okay we don't have to hear it I don't you know yeah poor poor lady she I don't like she meant it no no no no anger means to say that unless live I mean imagine like she leaves that and then she fucking dons a hood and she's like this is me all along yeah yeah yeah I had this guy in here the other day Darrell Davis who's I think I saw his picture yeah this is his music he's converted 200 different KKK and Nazis to leave the organization 200 by just hanging out with them being friends with them just getting to know them and a lot of people were like I know never really sat down had a drink with a black guy before he's like how is that possible yeah how is that possible and so just and he's a musician by trade I mean that's what he has a really good musician and just by doing that just by getting to know these people just kidding they were like they just were afraid they didn't know any people they just felt like they did and he's super articulate as well so like talking to him you realize like oh this guy's really smart and then if you talk to him time after time after time hours after hours after you realize like it's guys fucking smarter than me so when you're doing that you realize I'm like oh there's no way black people can be inferior this is nonsense this guy is a black guy right in front of me right now and he's talking using words that I barely understand that's how the guy in the Klan would say that's ugly yeah and the Klan felt yeah and after a while he asked him to come to his house and he said I'm quitting I'm cleaning the Klan he gave him his robe really yeah so he collects robes now he came and he brought like Grand Wizard robes and grand dragon robes got a Nazi outfit he had Nazi flags the guys have given him yeah do you know when I was a teenager I was so I was very you know was y'all was drinking and I remember I was so anti-klan I had read some book on the Ku Klux Klan and it was the preacher for the Klan his name was in the book so I called the information I called the FBI and I tried to stop a Klan rally but I called this guy at home this this Klan preacher and I started you know that's wrong you're a racist you know I was 14 and and he told me like you know I left the Klan I'm not in the Klan anymore and he actually talked to me for a few minutes Wow yeah but I was before you could Vic you know I was fucking just 14 and drunken trying to make a difference how cool is that though let he talked he did talk to me yeah and I'll never forget it and I my father I think knew I was drinking afterwards cuz he's like he heard some of the conversation I think it started with me calling the FBI or the CIA I could you called me I've got a few times back then you called the FBI that's what I would do it I drank yeah it was a fucking crazy person okay I called the FBI yeah when I met you like oh fuck we're probably early 20s right yep and I was like why did you quit drinking and you're like yeah why did you quit doing drugs yeah and you're like I had to yeah I pulled a bomb threat in my high school I remember I cleared the high school I did that when I was uh I want to say I was 17 or 18 and we used to get drunk in my friend's house and there was a there was a some number you could call for like help from nuns so I would have my friends sitting around and I would always call up and pretend that like I would make up these horrible incest stories and terrible sexual things that were happening to me my fucking friends would be laughing and the nun to be trying to counsel me on the phone oh Jesus and then I called a bomb threat I did it a couple of times it didn't work and the third time I did at the final time I did it they actually had people leave the school and go outside while they searched the school drunk bomb threats didn't fucking TJ Miller do that recently it was something with him on a train but it wasn't a threat he I think he had something with a woman but didn't he call a bomb threat in I don't know who is a threat or if he thought she would have one like I never got the full story I thought she really had one I bet I don't know I remember I don't remember what the conclusion was if you're really fucked up and you think someone you might have a bomb like paranoia like real like full-blown paranoia like I remember um you know Jim Breuer course it was a legendary pothead and one time he quit and he quit for quite a while and I said well why why'd you quit he goes dude because I started getting really paranoid like paranoid that people were listening to me and the people were following me and watching me it was not healthy it was not good and you know I wonder about that like when you perturb normal states of consciousness when you take like the normal way you are and you start changing it a little bit with a little bit of booze a little bit of booze a little bit of anxiety a little bit of depression a little bit of bad things a little bit of this a little bit that I'll take a little xanax take the edge off then I'll take a valium so I can go to sleep time take an ambien if the valium doesn't work and you keep going and going and going and going you're you're like you know how like there's certain things you could do that can give you arthritis right there's certain things that corrode your joints there's certain things you can do that that make you tightly the more chemicals you insert in your body the more things you do the more you shift from like you're comfortable baseline of who you are when you're at your yeah and your healthiest you change you become a different thing and I think pot is just as likely to do that as anything if you're doing it the wrong way if you abuse it I think alcohol can do it I think pot can do it pills speed I think all those things can surely do it but it's strange to see when someone starts to slip away and they start to go Oh towards it's like very strange version of themselves that you know they don't have control anymore yeah is that how you felt like when you were a kid yeah from a very young age it was a weird but I was very addicted it was like sexual addiction firstly that was the first one and sexual addiction yes you you were drinking when you were 13 you said yeah but I mean I was a child I was sexually active as a kid like fucking i-i've 10 sexual partners before fourth grade what I've never told you that yeah yeah how was that possible I was blowing all my friends I was a fucking couldn't stop how did that get started you know I don't remember the first one but I remember there's a picture I can date it because I there's a picture of me when I was a kid when I split my head open and I was I remember I split my head open running from the boy who is a year older than me and I used to blow him but I was scared of him he was abused I terrorized me but I would I remember I'm trying to fuck me once too but I was I couldn't do it like I vaguely remember I was in the hallway my pants were down his fucking dick oh he smelled like I fucking mothballs cuz they would do any more fucking Budweiser's bathing trunks they had Budweiser on them and he were Budweiser bait but I was anything so you have like mothballs in his drawer as dressing he must have but that smell is is a visceral memory I have of that he's the kid that pissed in my mouth I fucking I was in a public pool in Edison New Jersey this is how young I was I didn't know that so I went and he I was blowing him underwater and then he goes I popped up because he he pissed in my mouth so I popped up I'm I don't do that anymore anyway I put my foot down and I went back and I did it again so I stopped blowing him at that moment because my Wystan pool dude that is hilarious so you were blowing them in the pool yeah I didn't think people could see the water I was so young if I can't see them they can't see me at the photo I had with the split of my head is 1973 so I was five so I know at that age I was already involved so I have an absolute photo that dates exactly so you were blowing kids when you were five yeah so what do you think started that off don't know it must have been you know just one kid one kid opened the door the rest of us fucking ran through it I mean I don't know I just don't know what started I have very vague fleeting memories so at five years old you were all sexually active you and your buddies yeah and then he got a little older six seven eight like you know it was uh I I don't remember who was first who was second I remember with my one friend got erections and I didn't get him like I didn't know what they were it was five he was he might be six or seven trods six years old but I remember not knowing that we used to count sucks that's what it would do like alright I'll give you ten and you give me ten and you would fucking develop technique did you figure out like what's the best way to suck a dick I don't know at that age I don't think so cuz I think it was all about getting you to do me after all right I think that was kind of the goal right of course there was a lot of it man and I have it again I can date it because I moved Halloween a fourth grade to North Brunswick so any experience that happened within this place I know it happened before that mmm yeah wow that's crazy so do you think that this kid did you know that if this kid was molested don't know I mean there had to be somebody had to be getting fucked because there's no way all of us were that sexually active for no reason yeah I just don't remember I have too many memories like being in a basement and they're not exactly remembering I have weird memories possibly with adults like it's kind of like watching uh it fades in and out and I wish my memory was better but it's just no one's really is you know that's the weird thing about memories when it comes to being you know a young person no one's memories are very good you have like flashes I have like some things that I definitely remember like because they're like facts like when I was seven we drove across the country you know I remember those yeah I remember we got in an accident on Lombard Street in San Francisco you know that's like the crooked Street in the world right I remember that because I remember someone tried to pass us and I remember scratch the car I remember that but like there's little tiny things like sometimes I'll talk to my sister or I'll talk to my mom she's like do you remember that thing that also it's like I open up a folder like oh yeah I remember that guy whatever happened to him you know it that guy didn't exist in my brain until a couple sex right and then I'm like look at this old folder let's open up my old memory of that yeah you know sometimes those are scary though and like I'm gonna know III many times Drive back to that area cuz it's in Edison and I'll Drive back when I'm doing the stress factory or a gig and I'll just I'll drive through that neighborhood and I'm like what the fuck happened here well something happened here and it might not just be one moment but something happened here that kind of shifted me because I don't know exactly what it is and dr. drew told me I was molested I mean maybe he's right I don't know well at the very least you were sexually involved with someone else who might have been molested yeah well I mean without it did the odds are it had to be wonderful that was another thing that came up this article that I was saying that the origins of homosexuality were saying that I was homophobic cuz the origins of sexuality homosexuality is them people being molested when they're younger that's not what I said and let me explain that to people if you're gay if you read that you feel bad that can happen to people who would not be inclined towards homosexuality if they're molested when they're younger mmm-hmm dr. Chris Ryan the guy who wrote sex at dawn was explaining it to me is that there's a you you pad like what is the term not necessarily patterning imprinting that when you're sexually active like if someone's sexual with you when you're young and that person happens to be a man you can imprint and you can develop sexual feelings in response to that like you get your your brain triggers sexual feelings towards men or you might not be inclined so like even if you're not actually homosexual you're still turned on by men in a certain way because you were molested it's one of the reasons why they say but they don't really know why people who get molested wind up molesting people but it's really common it's like you know somebody described it best like it's almost like a vampire bites you and this thing like you're passing it on to the next person this this creepy thing but that you know that this is another thing where people took out of context saying that you know I'm homophobic but for me there's all kids of my age group that I remember I I have vague adult memories but not anything concrete that I can say was sexual like you I mean like it just kind of it's like a smoke that comes by and it leaves and that's kind of how those memories are but with their with the kids they were all kids in my age within a year or two of each other so it wasn't like that's why I don't like being a victim so I feel like you know I dive Ahlan tiered man I showed up there was a lot of times I wanted to play the game and well you were five you know I mean I have so few memories when I was five I mean I bet you probably don't know why you were doing or what what happened before that that started it and caused it I bet the person who you're doing it with they'll mate you know when people get molested when they're really young one of the big issues is they block it out yeah I don't remember a goddamn thing they their brain protects them from all the darkness yeah I think so and I've heard that enough so I'm almost think I always try to find something to explain but maybe it wasn't that bad maybe it was just me and my friends and then it just kind of developed into something that was fun and it felt good I mean good yeah again I can't I can't say there was any ominous force behind it I just don't remember but it's weird because it's like most kids don't blow their friends yeah that's a great name most kids don't blow their friends that should be your next comedy on my new tour but it's so something we assume something happened but not necessary right because the first kid that blew his friends I mean there had to be one guy somewhere in history that was like I got an idea yeah like people do who's the first guy to pierce his septum right yeah who's the first guy to tattoo his face who's the who's the first guy know to butt-fuck their hands first well that one might have come simultaneously two places at once you never know that might have been a couple of thoughts at the same time what do you think buttfucking started like chimps clearly but fuck right like bonobos they must but fuck each other they fuck do you know what bonobos have they only have one taboo which is the mom won't have sex with the son Wow and then interesting yeah like the whole culture is filled with with sex like chimp bonobo chimps all the the males breed their daughters the they exchange sex it's like a social token like they resolve issues with sex like their their one animal that like clearly has massive amounts of recreational sex and they don't have any violence and the anal I don't know where that comes I wonder if that's just because of a position where somebody's on their stomach and the person behind them the or the creature behind them is just like this your ass is easier yeah I don't know yeah I'm not a big fan of ass fuck you I like a little bit but I'm not crazy about it yeah I used to like it more when I was younger well I mean it seems messy it has been yet time at times yeah there's been a few issues could be painful it's not really supposed to go in there no it's not but some people love it they love it I can do it once in a while I can't you know I can feel yeah I'm not not a lot yeah it's a little sloppy well it's you know it it's if someone's trans and they don't want to transition and they don't want to have a vagina they just want to keep their penis then there's not a whole lot of options so yeah you fucked them or they fuck you yeah there's there's two you know it's two option you know so it's kind of I you know you switch off yeah it's uh it's interesting how the the just the amount of people that are just people talking about trans people has changed you know like what the numbers you never heard that when I was a kid yeah I never heard it when I was in high school you never heard about no one was trans no no one thought they'd be trans in high school now kids in high school or trans like a lot of kids are trans you got to wonder like what what is that you know I think people are gentle or with it now and that's one thing I think the younger generation is a little smarter with is that they don't just judge you for it and people can kind of be comfortable being who they are yeah the people I mean I'm sure trans people existed but you just I'm you didn't know what to call it nobody know I didn't know what it was when I first saw it or encountered it I had no idea what it was well there's a movie or a book rather that I read about Custer and one of the parts of the book is about this guy who went somewhere and came back and his wife had died and it turned out that his wife had been a man and everybody found out and so he had like this this thing he said you know if anything happens to my wife you know like don't touch her leave her alone wait till I come back well they didn't do that they did an examination they found out that she had a dick and the guy wanted killing himself but so this was something that was going on in the 1800s in the Wild West this guy was in like this wild west town and he had a trans wife and he just they had to keep it quiet and when people found out about it he wound up killing himself yeah there's so much shame it's funny I just talked about this somewhere else too but there's so much shame around it for the man not just for the trans people but for the men who like trans people this isn't just Shane of course that's one of the things I really appreciate about you that you don't give a fuck you talk about everything that you like you talk about everything that you don't like about yourself and I think because you do that on the radio and because you do that freely and openly I think you help a lot of people man I really do because I think you make it cuz everybody loves you right so like you can come on this podcast and you know you could say anything you know I love you and there's no way if your sexual desires or interest is gonna affect that in any way and so you could be free and then we could all talk about stuff and then it's probably some kid out there that's going I think I'm okay yeah I think I'm okay I'm not think I'm a freak fucking everybody loves Jim Norton like it's okay I get emails from people a lot of guys have sent me messages to go hey man thanks for talking about that because it made me feel like it was alright to like that or made me feel more you know everything we're a culture that likes to scold each other yeah because it you know it's like you have to be comfortable talking about it and realizing hey you might not say this word right you might not express it right we're doing the best we can to grapple with this whole thing but it's about self-identification for men am i homosexual that's why guys don't talk about it cuz we don't know who it makes us I think the scolding thing is a big point what you just said that people are worried that people are gonna scold them and you know one of the things that people do when they're worried about that is they scold other people first yeah you know that's what what bullies are when people go around beating people up the reason why they go around beating people up is because they're afraid someone's gonna do it to them they're insecure so they want to have power over those other people because they're terrified someone's gonna want to have power over them because they're weak and this is like that expression hurt people hurt people yeah like when you see online bullying or on like people ganging up on people online I guarantee you every one of those people that's doing that it's terrified that it's gonna come back to them yeah and they're just throwing rocks and hoping no rocks come back their way hoping the mob doesn't look at them hoping and praying yeah hoping and praying be a part of it as opposed if you're not a part of it you could be the one that they're doing it to yeah and I've chosen particularly over the last few years when I recognized like there's a difference between my reach and my influence and other people's I don't do that I don't retweet things that people say that they're mean to me and say once you eat shit fuckface or you know like what a cute person you are I could easily and then millions and millions of people would see that and then this person would go into a fucking panic attack and look at the Twitter and their feed the phones blowing up and yeah although in inbox coming in then they have to go see their counselor their psychiatrist they get doxed you're dead right yeah that all that stuff is people skin and this is one of the things that I think is a real problem with social media in general and Twitter in particular the that method of communication of just doing texts out there once it gets personal like it's one thing if you like look they just discovered a new city under the ocean that's what I use it for or maybe a joke or two but when you get personal with someone like you're getting personal in a way that you're not connecting with them you're throwing a text out there and you're also doing it publicly for the whole world but you're not communicating with that person one-to-one like a human being and because of that because you're not communicating with them one-on-one like a human being you don't feel them you feel like you can say mean things yeah and go after you you almost want it you almost want people to go after them you almost want bad things to happen just to see if what's your what you're doing this game is effective yeah you don't Jamie kills team right I do yeah Jamie talked real openly on the podcast about who he used to be and who he is oh yes do that he used to do that go after people and he's real open about how he was just completely 100% virtuous signaling yeah he was just wanted people to like him he said he was I would be walking on the street and I just had to check my phone constantly because to see what how do people respond to my texts or my tweet how do people respond you know attacking some senator you fucking bigot you homophobe and I'm just checking constantly in that yeah and then afterwards they came after him because you can never be virtuous enough never never there's no one out there that's virtuous enough and if you're gonna be cruel to people get ready cuz it's coming back at you it's coming back to you and that's the beauty like you know I like I mean yeah I never want to shame other people for that shit like just if you make a mistake you say something fucking stupid so be it like who might have sit there and get mad at somebody I mean believe me and people come at me I mean my preferences are not always fuckin popular online either I'm you know of course I get called horrible shit I just don't it doesn't bother me but I mean I mean I'm 51 year old man - it's a when you know when you're 51 and you come to the environment of stand up for 30 years it's a little easier to have a thicker skin sometimes - yeah whereas somebody who is 19 or 20 who has been raised in this fucking this psychotic fake polite culture because it's not polite it's vicious what's fake polite right um and when they start getting insulted I don't know if they a lot of times know how to process that no most people don't and you know you also understand what it is it's causing people to behave the way they're behaving whereas a 19 year old just thinks they're terrible and they need to die yeah I mean this is one of the things that's so awful about kids that get bullied online and wound up killing themselves like you didn't you know you had to just get through that you got through that you would understand what it is you know you'd understand that these people these are just these anybody that's saying that to you that's a damaged person they're all fucked up themselves and if you were around them personally you and them alone in the room I guarantee you they wouldn't do that to you know most and most of them you wouldn't even want to do it just like you you've talked to people most of me like oh you your hands feel the same as anybody else when I shake them like hey and you realize they're okay yes the separation that social media gives us along with the connection like you get this connection where it's like you can send a tweet out and maybe it can reach people and they go oh that's kind of cool and that there is this weird connection but the disconnect like the emotional and the social disconnect the lack of social cues between two people when you're just communicating online that is that's not good for us we're not supposed to communicate like that ya know it's bad it's impersonal it's it's kind of dangerous to a lot of people because it gives you this false sense of you know you like you're like you're not saying something that's gonna hurt someone you you like if you were in front of that person you wouldn't want them to cry but you want them to cry if you're not there if you want to say the most vicious mean shit when they're not there when people like you know and again we mentioned re you know I know you I know you love re I love re I've known him for many years when you when someone says dumb shit and people do say dumb shit and then there's people get there are times people are justifiably mad at you like hey look you said something really stupid publicly so people hurt that in the middle of their grief and they're like hey fuck you pal like people are angry yeah but then it gets to a point where those that day is past and then there are people who just want to hurt you for it there's people who just want to punish you there's people who just want to see you suffer so how do you tell all the time who's just reacting to something you said because it's a comedian I say public things people who in the public with me have the right to say something yes yeah well I think what already did you have to come up with a new word I don't think dumb is good enough we need a better word it's it was so stupid but it's also what you said earlier that you got to keep ramping it up you know do think we were talking about earlier was that before the podcast it was before I not I think yeah what the the thing is when you do outrageous things just to get people to like ah look at Jimmy's crazy yeah you gotta you get caught in a trap and you keep doing it more and more outrageous and with Ari he's always done this thing where when people die he would make the meanest comment even about someone he loved like Tom Petty he said some horrible shit about Tom Petty and Aretha Franklin and all these different people that died but he just did it for shock value yeah and you got to keep upping that every time like every time someone dies people like his sicko fans would go straight to Ari and want Ari to comment on it right and you know it's a trap and that's a that's a terrible try and you you see guys lean into those right like it becomes a part of their persona it becomes a part of their identity well the trap is also when you if there's something you don't want to say or if you like nah that's too fucked up to say but if I don't say it they're gonna think that I'm selling out or I'm not the same performer like you have to be willing to disappoint people that want to hear that too if you're gonna survive in that kind of a in doing that stuff yeah I don't know how what's gonna happen with Arie like how he's gonna get through this but in some ways you know I never want to say is a good thing that he did that but he needed to know that there are are consequences for just just saying ridiculous shit that you're not supposed to say when people die you know and he's this really fucked up thing about Arie is he's a really good guy but in his persona sometimes he's a heel and he doesn't on purpose yeah you know and so like you see that video and he's ain't you know he's like smiling and laughing cuz Kobe Bryant's dead that's his heel persona yeah and he thinks he's playing up like all there's gonna be great people gonna be so mad but he had no idea he had no idea he misjudged the country's grief oh yeah and obviously I think there's he didn't know who else was on the hell he didn't believe this explanation when I read his explanation I believed it like I don't but I first saw it I didn't know if he was serious or not I mean I know what he does but I just saw that clip I'm like maybe he hated him I didn't he didn't I didn't know what he was doing but then when I read his explanation I believed him one part of me feels responsible this is why I convinced him that he could have an iPhone and that he could be okay just put a timer on it I go just put a timer on it I go my daughter as a timer on her phone she couldn't use it for an hour a day just put a timer on your phone and he should've stuck with a fucking flip phone man yeah I had a lady that was posting for him a friend of his like I think he gave her some money and he would he would send his tweets to her stuff like that and then she would post him for him I think that's not one and that's way better cuz then you got a filter system they know where she could calm up what the fuck is wrong with you and he but what we're gonna talk yeah but no I'm not saying that asshole ergo you what should I say you know like and there was like a humanity level look I also Ari is legitimately insane he's definitely got layers of it's insanity that he battles with he does and I'm and I it's funny when I hosted down and dirty with Jim Norton and there was a bunch of comedians on our he was one of the comedians I had on and at the end of his said he took his dick out if I can pull his pants that took his dick out on HBO and they were furious and no one knew who's gonna do it and I had to go out and shake his hand with his fucking pants around his ankles he waved at the crowd and I don't even remember if that made the final cut but that's 2008 so you know somebody who has a reputation of just doing completely crazy shit yeah it doesn't surprise me when the person does something that is crazy no he's always gotten a certain amount of attention for doing he was that he's the wild man you know he's you know he doesn't have any responsibilities he lives like a vagabond he's made a ton of money but he lives in a tiny apartment yeah that was always a reputation now I guess he lives with his girl but uh he he'd never bought a car he had the shittiest oldest most fucked-up car it was a manual transmission car because that was cheaper like Ari's like so frugal like he would he would get mad at people like why are you spending your money what the fuck is wrong with you like like why you buying a nice car like that - Ari was like the dumbest shit you could ever do he wanted to like hoard all his money and then not have any responsibility he wanted to make sure that he could just disappear and go to China for three months I just hang out not on anybody anything not owe anybody anything and be free be like legitimately free so like any time he felt like he was trapped in any sort of corporate structure or anything he would fucking panic you know like and that's one of the you know it's it's one of the parts of his personality that where he kind of leans into this like sort of outside a role you know he he doesn't want too much success he would get mad when people started taking pictures with him after the sober October shows he's like you fucking arseholes made me too famous because I can't even go anywhere I'm like that is the most hilarious thing to say he was actually mad that he was going places and people wanted to take pictures with him no but is it really that he didn't like it or is it like sometimes you get afraid of it because then taste it and you're afraid it's gonna go away - that's one thing with success the more of it you get this more scared you are that they're gonna bother you so with Ari with Ari I think he actually didn't like it like he likes a certain amount of anonymity it's one of the reasons why he like going to Asia that's why he went there on vacation cuz no one knew who he was he got recognized like twice in four months the entire time he was there he loved it yeah he loved it he should go there right now yeah it might be a good time to lay low might want to move there I just don't know how often I mean or how how long it'll take before this if it does at all blows over I made that little sort of explanation on his Instagram but it might almost be better if he did a video yeah you almost have to humanize yourself and discuss what happened because it's very hard to explain that to people because then they're like yeah there's dumb friends that are defended him well like that one's defending him no it's the only ones head no one's defending him you know I would never defend what he said but what I would say is this like I'm not a moron I'm friends with him I love the guy it's not because he's a bad guy he's a great guy he's one of my smartest friends he's very interesting but he's also we're all crazy I don't know a single goddamn funny person that's not crazy yeah but his crazy is a different kind of self-destructive crazy it's a different kind of crazy you know you have you're crazy I got my crazy Robert Kylie's got his crazy everyone's got their own crazy you know there's there's something that compels you to want to be on stage in front of all those fucking people talking every night telling jokes doing it on a podcast doing it on the radio it's a real weird personality that causes people to do things like that yeah and you're around people who are doing it and who are doing it really well and then you see them getting more and more successful and then there's like oh like you know you don't want to watch everybody pass you by either right so you're like oh this thing works for me let me just keep doing this thing and then you kind of get married to doing that thing that works for you are you lean into it you lean into what you love and we I've seen that happen with people where all of a sudden they seem like white nationalists like what is going on I realize oh that's where they're getting attention from they're getting attention from all these people that are like you know Kyle they're kind of like into white nationalism and so they start leaning into that I'm like that was that guy always like that did he hide it from me I kind of mind that's right I thought he was conservative and then I think what it is is like that's where their breads being buttered that's where they're getting attention and so they they like yeah yeah go tell them go get them yeah Dwight people have been the one the founding people this country and white people this white people and you see them start to repeat those sentiments and you go oh okay you're leaning into the attention that's what's going on here there's people there like you and then show that showing you love so it's kind of hard to risk losing people who love you as a performer we're terrified of it especially when you start developing an audience and that audience is like you know that's those are the people that actually like you they actually love you they actually will come pay to see you there and so you go okay what do I have to do to get them do you meant like here's a good example like my early act when I first started to in stand that was terrible but what I realized that there was three stages of stand-up in my career the first stage was I was doing anything to get a laugh yeah and it was basically like a tool like I was like I had a ruler or a hammer or a nail and I had no connection to that material I would tell jokes jokes like Street jokes someone told me a street joke I would tell that onstage it was no there was no art to it I was just terrified and I wanted to get laughs then once I started doing pretty good and started I would work professionally and I was getting some gigs and stuff then I started doing stuff that I thought was funny and I was remember being so happy with that because I'd be like instead of being so scared of like just being out there and could I get a laugh get a laugh girl laughs what I do get a laugh instead of that then I would get into like what do I think it's funny right and then then let's go here's what's fucked up to me like why is this and then like people go that's really smart like I remember people say like oh that's good material that your new stuff I love your new stuff like okay finally I'm doing stuff that other people that I like like people that appreciate things that I appreciate would think are funny then once I got better at that and I became like a real like a headliner and established then I started turning ideas into comedy then I would turn ideas like a guy had some complicated ideas that I've worked on for years to try to turn two bits and one of them was the the the D evolution of man like I put it on my 2005 Netflix special I don't know it's on Netflix anymore showtimes just called joe rogan live from 2005 and it was a bit that i worked on for years about how dumb people outbred smart people and that's what the pyramids are like we out fuck the smart people and they just left us with a bunch of shit we don't understand and it was this long it took me forever to work that bit in and that bit to me was like there's like okay now I understand how to turn a concept into a into a bit not just things that I think are funny but things that I think are interesting and try to get those interesting ideas and put them into stand-up form and things you want to say like the key for comedians and where a lot of comics go wrong is like it's got to be funny too like we have to be funny while we're like I never go on the stage and think I'm gonna teach the audience a fucking educate the fucking audience hate them if they learn anything from it or if they like it's got to be funny first or it has to be fucking funny and I look at my old stuff man mommy - fucking how was your character you happy-go-lucky you know how we doing like oh it's repulsive dude it's fucking impulsive what isn't it so nice you got through that and now you're something different thank God I got through it yeah I just started standing there and talking and being more comfortable yeah we used to do that thing I know pian Anthony we would dissect your old stand-up and I brought in a 1993 stand-up tape and Colin Patrice Voss and I think Paul Mercurio is the other comedian dissected it on Opie Anthony I've got some old videos but I can't even pull them out they're embarrassing right how they're terrible cuz they're revealing if they look how hard I was trying oh I wanted to be liked so bad do you ever go over your old writing yeah I never joke ever written I used to write them on packing slips when I worked in a fucking uh when I worked for Christophe silver I would put a stop solar it's a very high-end silverware place I worked in a packing I would be like shipping and receiving so I would write these on the back of fragile stickers all these jokes and yeah I have all that shit do you know who Owen Smith is yes dude he's one of the best comics in the world he's one of those guys I'm working with him actually tonight at the improv but he's one of those guys when he's on stage I'm like how the fuck to people not know who he is because he got a lot of writing gigs he was writing for a lot of sitcoms loved a lot of different like really well-paying writing gigs and he has a family so he didn't do the road he didn't really travel a lot but he's a fucking murderer yeah he's funny anyway he had this concept for a show and I filmed an episode of it I don't know what he's done with it yet but it was bring your old notebook so I found all these notebooks that I still have and I busted him out I was amazed I mean I have no books from the like 91-92 and it was so bad though I even had built-in ad libs and built-in reactions from the audience then someone from the audience would say this and then I would say that like and I'm like I didn't I I would ever I remember in the beginning trying to sit and write and literally being such a moron I had such a piss-poor grasp of the English language first of all and then second of all just sitting there no idea how to write things just no idea and so I was just write and hope a joke would come out of it and it never did I kept back in those days the only time I came up with good bits was literally either talking to my friends and laughs and usually when we were drinking or on stage like occasionally on stage I would come up with an idea and then I would you know sort of foster it or feed it and try to make it grow but going over that fucking material was so painfully embarrassing it was so bad it's humiliating the old stuff I don't mind reading it though because my persona is what I hated more than my writing so watching myself perform those old bits because I had like bagi workout pants like bodybuilder pants dude I was such a cunt I was so awful when I started the writing I can look at because it's detached from the fucking little character I would do on stage it's funny how there's some styles that just don't make it but for a while everybody has them it's something everybody wakes up like what the fuck are we wearing yeah remember cavalry cheese I do of course I ate gigantic plates of shit one day on stage wearing cavalry and I'll never forget how stupid I felt there's these tight they're tight here and then baggy and the thighs out and I'm wearing these stupid things and I'm on stage and I'm bombing and I remember like looking down at the way I was dressed and I had a button-up shirt and I was I followed Jim Breuer it was a pivotal moment in my career because I bombed so hard I really like tightened up my act after that really got to work because it was the most painful bombing yeah but I'm standing there with cavalry cheese on with a nice shirt like a dress shirt like I'm going to the club yeah just like an entertainer dickhead what a dickhead and then I'm looking down these fucking terrible pants and those pants were this shit for like two years or three years and then everybody was like what the fuck are we wearing and they just went away what don't let do it there was like a Members Only jacket with it or like Capezio shoes do the Capezio shoes or anybody don't I can't picture them in my head Jamie Paul Capezio shoes yeah I remember them from I want to say early 90s early my bed late 80s but I remember a guy I knew a sober guy I knew we'd I screw these sober dances which were very fucking depressing like you know when I was 18 and 19 just to go try to meet girls on their sober - yeah they're all suspicious of you you just want to fuck me I know what's going on here now I just kind of stand there just kind of stand there that's a Capezio no that's not well the black one made oh yeah there you go that's kind of that lee bollinger oh yeah yeah yeah yeah with cavalry cheese yes Oh like your ballet dance yeah they were not good um you're private I want to get a Ladin shoes go up right there click on that note lad and choose the curly tip ones look at that I was of dads you got to bring those bitches back elf shoes somebody who's somewhere war elf shoes right with another court jester thing though that was it to make the King laugh you can't do dressing an asshole right if you imagine being a fucking you're basically a bad comedian dancing around for a murderous dictator yeah and if you did anything to piss them off they're just cut your fucking head off in front of everybody yeah you probably another one you probably came a good comedian fast cuz you knew you read the room you knew exactly what you could say what you couldn't say you know who to go after who not to go after I would love to have seen what it would be like to be a court jester in front of like Henry the 8th yeah like some murderous fucking ruthless king who just just didn't Henry the 8th kill like a bunch of his wife when he divorced he just cut their fucking heads off yeah and was he married to Anne Boleyn am I remembering it different for something I remember her name Anne Boleyn yeah I want to say that was one of his wives but I could be wrong I don't know I'm a dropout so it might have been something I'm conflating two stories well I dropped out too I didn't drop out of high school but I dropped out of college how many years did you second all three what is it his second wife and Helen was right balloons Judy behead her she fell on a sword yeah this mistake no big deal I thought he killed her I could be he killed a few of them I believe yeah yeah but you wonder what the bombing was like for those guys like oh like there's a certain a court jester the the pressure and wood bombing get you killed or would you have another day well imagine right how many times have you set a joke on the air and it didn't really go well like he tried it took its wing and everybody's like Jimmy what the fuck I fucking tried sorry yeah but if you do that in front of a king yeah you know there's one there's an Opie and Anthony clip called Jim Norton's epic carpet bombing where it's a fucking it was one day well I just had nothing like I was on no sleep and I come in I was wired and I bombed for the entire for our radio show and there's a good probably a 12-minute clip of just me bombing throughout the four hours the more comfortable you get the more freeing it gets to you know what I mean you get more comfortable bombing and you can kind of embrace it and so can you know and what it is Oh God yeah I love those old clips we are so lucky I mean you were a giant part of that show but I feel real lucky that I was part of that show I really do I feel like with guys like guys like me and comics that to us was the most comfortable environment we could ever find yeah like I I enjoyed doing Preston and Steve and you know and doink a rock and you know Kevin and being and doing all these different radio shows I really enjoy yeah no doubt but there was something about Opie and Anthony where I would get so excited when I was good when I was there when I was in New York it was not a question of whether or not I was gonna go like if you guys were gonna have me like fuck yeah we would get up early we'd smoke we haha come and barbecued we'd just be so happy to be there take edibles I would always have like edible lollipops I couldn't wait to be on air with you guys cuz it was it was you could be what you were if you were hanging out at the store yeah like we're if we're hanging out in the back bar of the Comedy Store and I was just talking shit laughing that's what it was like an Opie and Anthony there was no other environment we could just be just just comics being comics just hanging out yeah going back and forth being mean to each other I mean it was some vicious boss the boss must have skin like a fucking rhino he does he doesn't oh but he was also richest so fast - oh yeah that boss was a guy that you could hit him you can hit him but like as soon as you turn around when he hits you back it was it was a fucking killer line yeah watch this really really Bobby is great at that oh yeah just fuckin what we viewed walking in the Comedy Cellar and there laughing before

named Johnson Schneider Papa John's like they say some stupid oh you definitely can yeah that definitely can happen yeah yeah as soon as you involved I'm just kidding about that I would not want Jerry stock and we're Bob levy had a girl over his house I got laid so infrequent in the in the old days and I he had a pretty girl at his house who liked me and my father drove me there that has probably 22 years old and you know what was the worst snowstorm of the century at the time and my father drove me eight miles a snowstorm during the snowstorm to Bob Levy's house to get laid and I fucked this girl in the bathroom Bobby's bathroom and I was standing in calendar ha what a good dad you have yeah my dad's a great guy yeah but he knew I told that there's a girl there you know God and I think he's wanted to he was happy I said that so he was just like I'll take it I don't miss driving in the snow but I do miss this certain parts about driving in the snow that I do meant like when you actually made it like it was hard to do too hard to get home but when you got home boy did you appreciate being home you felt great yeah we actually got where you had to go holes the door yeah you sit down fucking make some hot chocolate or something watch TV you like felt so comfortable I'm home it's warm uh do you don't appreciate good weather unless you experience shit weather that's right but I don't miss doing the gigs I mean I still do them but when you're driving like in Lancaster Pennsylvania where the two and a half hours over the hills to get to the gig and it was like panic-stricken I'm afraid I'm gonna fuck it up and I hit black ice I remember one I was so bad the driving that I had to park my car and call my girlfriend to come and pick me up at her sports car it was such a humiliating moment as a man to have to pull over and you know I can't drive on the ice oh my girlfriend to come and pick me up and then she's a sports car that's right yeah I didn't realize what I fucking oh my god my father's Taurus I remember driving once and the snow was so bad I was having a hard time discerning where the road is yeah I couldn't figure out where this the road what's the side of the road because the snow was so deep it was getting to the point where it's hard to see where the road was you know that's where shit gets weird yeah when you drive away through the Adirondacks to upstate New York but there's no light it's black it's black and then there's fog and then there's a snow coming at you is really and you're like I'm 51 I've been driving since I was 19 I'm still it's like shut up just do 20 you got to do 20 you can't blow through this like you're an experienced driver well every time I used to be on the highway and I was be driving slow and carefully there always be that one dipshit that goes flying by yeah just goes flying by like he knows how to drive in the snow better than anybody and you're a bunch of pussies you can't handle it he's fucking bleep and you'd always hope to see him wrapped around a pole about a mile down but you never did I saw a car carrier fall over once that was wild with wind no he jackknifed jackknifed in the snow and wiped out and fucking cars scatter all over the highway it was wild it was wild it was but he just he slipped I saw him losing it and by the time I got there he was tipped over and the cars were hanging out he just lost control of this you know those fucking things they don't there are so unwieldly you know you got 13 cars stacked up on this crane thing behind you and this guy just lost his shit and it was just so snowy I was heading to Western Massachusetts to try to get laid not even for a gig was for a girl girls date I wasn't doing comedy back then I think it was 17 17 or 18 I barely could drive terrible driving and I remember this long trip to Western Massachusetts it wasn't long normally you know hours normally but now with all the snow and everything it was brutal did you make it I made it yeah yeah it's crazy what we do to get laid back in those oh my god and now it's like look if you don't hit me up on Instagram that's just not fucking happening I'm gonna tell you I can't do it anymore well you know this is what I was trying to explain to someone once that when you know a woman actually when you are an 18 year old boy you are a drug addict okay and you're you're you're a drug addict for sex and you've only been having sex for a little while for me it was like two I think I got laid when I was 16 so it was like two years so and just you're a straight-up junkie and sex was the most exciting thing of your life like it was so much more exciting than anything else I did so much more interesting than anything else I did and I wanted it so bad and then you're so horny you knows that like you all you're thinking about is how you could possibly have sex yeah and so we're not gonna wear what do I gotta say what do I gonna do where do I got to drive what do I mean you don't realize what immense power it has over your life and I think it has a lot of power over women's lives obviously I never been a woman so I don't know what it feels like to want dick but I would imagine it's it's probably pretty similar which is why there's so many fucking people on the planet yeah I mean it's definitely a 50/50 Pole I would I would say but a lot of times it's not even the sex I remember being a teenager and I would pick up I would go out and get a hooker and then afterward my favorite part would be talking to her on the way back like I loved talking like I really I think a lot of it was i misidentified being lonely with wanting sex like there was times I was horny but there was times when I would come or I would I wouldn't be able to come and I would just jerk off and I'm like no I can't come but then I would just sit let's talk for a little while like Billy always my favorite part was talking to them driving them back getting to know them how many did you talk to every girl I had picked up and so you would have like long conversations did they enjoy the conversation when they were willing but again they were people I knew because I would see them all the time okay or they would see me driving around and this is Gil commercial Avenue New Brunswick in the mid 80s so yeah they would yeah I think they liked it a little bit I mean it was probably different I wasn't aggressive I was pleasant right it's probably you they're probably happy that someone was being nice to them well you can always tell when you drove back to where you got them if they just jumped out okay they just wanted the right back and then there was time they would just sit in the car there great drive around the block will smoke and you know sometimes they would ask you to do that so they could have a cigarette and a conversation yeah man it's gotta be so weird to find yourself you're a girl yeah you I look back on it now and it's like I do think it should be legal I don't think people should tell other people they don't have the right to do it but I look back and I'm like how many people were they in situations and I didn't know of like were there people being forced to do shit that I didn't know we're being right for us to do shit and that's kind of something that's been a little yeah it's been fuck with me a little bit well you remember they tried to pin that on Robert Kraft the guy who owns the Patriots yeah went to a massage parlor to get jerked off yeah and they were they were saying they were charging him with participating in sex trafficking it was a just a completely fabricated not accusation because the women that were there turns out no they're just regular women that massage guys and then jerk him off afterwards yeah but they put that out there so it was out there no matter what like it hit the press it hit this guy and so he had to sort of like deal with this even though he's like this fucking guy's worth billions of dollars which is thousands of millions for yes just think of owning thousands of millions of dollars still couldn't keep the shame of getting jerked off you know it's not like a 69 70 year old man or some they're coming back at him with something else now Joe for the same case yeah there's something else that just it just got talked about again I don't know exactly what the prosecutors thrown at him but sometimes a prosecutor I think sees something that hey that we can get a lot of mileage on this yeah and because nothing happened to craft the first time I think they're coming back at him with something she updated well I also think that this is what I've said this about law enforcement too when you play a game and here's the game I arrest you I want to convict you here's a game you try to get out of it I don't want you to get out of it now we're in competition it's a game yeah it's not a game obviously it's the law and obviously you know the people should be arrested don't yes construe what I'm saying but whenever someone is trying to do something and the other person doesn't want you to do something people get competitive and people withhold evidence they lie I mean there's been so many fuckin cases of prosecutors yeah withholding evidence that could have people released and if only I in the Duke rape case was it wasn't he didn't get disbarred for that or he did some shady shit well there's a lot of those cases it's not just him I mean how many different detectives withheld evidence prosecuting attorneys and withheld evidence there's like you know you know was fuckin amazing at helping people with this shit is Kim Kardashian yes she has Kim Kardashian has gotten some fuck I think it's like the ladies can was like 18 people you're not least who were unjustly accused of crimes yeah fucking insane man yeah well she Anna has I mean they they kind of have like a direct line to the president so they at least gave some resource to go to if they need it but she shouldn't have to do that that lady's worth fucking hundreds of millions of dollars she could do whatever the fuck she wants what she's doing that with her spare time it's it's really incredible I've completely stopped making fun of her yeah I respect the fact that she did that too it's like she could be doing a lot more stuff with her time and she's just she's helping people so yeah yeah I didn't really fucked with her that much Paris Hilton had a bad interview with so I don't really care for her well yet about everyone oh yeah they told us be nice to her yeah we promised we wouldn't be confrontational so I remember I watched Opie fell or supposed to film it but don't be in a camera going and I was just getting really annoyed because she was being very distant like so what happened so you go to this store right just like you have to watch it and I'm like that's not a way to promote to tell people you have to watch it so this is once you have a television show yeah sorry I keep fucking with them like it's a terrible habit I have my OCD just keep moving keep yeah and it's really it's irritating me that I'm doing it but it just wasn't a good interview she was we want it to be really cruel to her because I think she was being nice I thought she was being not nice to us but he promised we would and so it just came off as awkward and weird I forgot that she had a TV show she's she's one that sort of slipped into obscurity on purpose it seems like tronic line she's making a fucking billion a year like she's making money doing her private I think she's got like a whole bunch of stuff that she that's got her name on it so right but it seems like she's taking herself out of the public eye yeah for a lot of them they realize like hey this isn't good for you you know the sting of all this scrutiny and people hating you people fucking hated her man yeah they did he represented this vapid you know sort of trend I want it to like her too I wanted to be I did not want to dislike her for that reason I'm like it's too easy like all these guys hate her but then she came in I'm at I get it no I get it because it wasn't Pleasant I hate her I just feels like come on that could have been better I wonder like what's margin just look she's got documentary coming out it just came Oh super important to hear what's that documentary oh you don't have heard it's amazing the Aaron Hernandez documentary it's good I heard it's incredible yeah I saw his three parts probably could have been two sometimes Netflix will do three when they could do two but it was very good interesting to hear I'm talking about the sexuality and the whole I was under the illusion and it's funny because I talk about his hanging I do a suicide hug I get this I'm on Netflix out of this than the DeGeneres and part of it until suicide and hanging and I reference his and I get one other part of it wrong because I thought I thought he was in jail for killing I didn't realize he didn't get convicted of killing those first two people no no was he in jail for ah the one guy not the other two I didn't realize he was acquitted of it so I got that part wrong so I'm saying what killed three people that's right that's what he was believed to but I believe it was only one person and the two people he was acquitted for I was shocked to realize that I was like well fuck I already did the bit god damn yeah he really ought himself to like he really committed to it they didn't go into the hanging as much that was I wanted the details of that because I read the details about what he did to prevent himself from being saved I'm like I hope I got that right because I read that he put detergent on the floor so the guards wouldn't be able to get their footing mom he put like cardboard in the fucking in the in the door so they couldn't open it so it would Jam like I heard he get all that but the documentary didn't go into that I kind of wish they had unless I'm wrong well they said that he had extreme CT yeah extreme and I think there are a lot of people out there like that and there's a lot of people out there that are playing played pro football fighters anybody involved in like extreme contact sports that have extreme CTE it scares the fuck out of me man you know I felt skiing recently banging my head real bad I was skiing going around this corner and this lady she seemed like she was new she was like on a slope trying to get her skis back under her and she slid right into the trail and I saw her and I was like fuck and I tried to get away her my my leg went sideways and I fell back and bang hit the back of my head off the ground I have a crack in my shin bone it's called an insufficiency fracture it's like right where your where your car cartilage meets your shin bone the bone it's like a crack and my bowie knife it I hit hard can you do anything or just heels just heels it's actually fun I mean if there was probably a month or so ago and it doesn't cost me any pain anymore I knew something was wrong and I got an MRI but what I was really worried about was my head because I've been hitting the head so many fucking times so many times I don't know how many times I've been hit in the head kicked in the head punched in the head you know head butts knees to the head just so many times and you wonder like what is what's in there you know like when you see a guy like Aaron Hernandez who was 28 years old I think and they said he had the brain of like a fucking 80 year old Alzheimer's patient like his brain was fuck decision makes in the front I think Aaron Hernandez suffered from the most severe CTE ever found in a person his age ya see I don't think I have CTE like that so he was 27 I don't think I have it like that but I have it you think you have it a hundred percent yeah did everybody get it though is everybody who take shots yeah I think everybody gets it you get a little bit of it don't you know that traumatic brain injury when you fall like that like with Liam Neeson's wife died up yes that's fucking scary for a fall yeah um I mean you know once I was okay you know a few days later I wasn't necessarily worried about that but I definitely I think I had a concussion because I was real dizzy afterwards and I was I felt weird like I felt off and then I was with my daughter my 11 year old and we were getting on the fucking ski lift and I spazzed and I I got a little too far ahead like when the ski lift comes and then I tried to go back because I was in the wrong place I I moved too you know I should have waited for the next one to come and then I didn't and I fell down and then I couldn't get back up so I was just that was dizzy I was like a little bit out of it and my daughter didn't know that I fell down you know and then I'm like I'm a little out of it I hit my head and she's like when did you hit your head you didn't hit your head and my good not now I'm like just I just then had hit my head to hold rest that day I was like not talking that good I was like a little out of it yeah like I got rocked it was up bang like my head my legs went out and it was just back of the head on hardpack snow I got knocked out by a baseball when I was a kid I was so dumb I'm monkeys my sinuses are so fucked up and I partly thinks I've taken two baseball's like one really hard line drive to the middle of my face like I was a underhand pitching to my friend Rob tri from here to your TV and he drilled the line drive into my fucking face and I will I woke up and I was on the ground and he was standing over me panic-stricken that I was dead and then there's another time where I was a fly ball and I just misjudged it and split my head open and did you get your nose checked uh yeah I've got sir I gotta go back for surgery I'm going Monday to actually see somebody I'm a fucking because you had the surgery before yeah it didn't do much it was I don't know if I dated septum surgery yeah but it's just not enough didn't work no plus I take say Allah so that might fuck me up with your turban it's open it's swelling a little bit yeah I don't know it changed my life I had it done I know you're the one who got me on the whole mouth guard thing yeah was that I don't have the one you have with the bone that pushes the tongue down I have one that forwards work it makes it possible to fall asleep but it doesn't keep me asleep but you get the tongue down one man next time you're here I'll bring it to the doctor's office it does though yeah I really do need that but I don't think get used to that you can imagine I sleep like a baby with it I just shoved that fucker in there I've had one for years and you don't need a mask no no I don't need a mask but that's Nora I don't snore anymore but if I take that fucker out if I go to sleep and I don't pay attention to me my wife punches me just like wake up your snoring college doesn't punch me but you know she was you actually got wake up you're lying because I'm you know I've lost a lot of weight recently I wonder if my snoring would be less because I lost weight in my face I lost weight in my neck I lost weight everywhere on purpose yeah I went on this carnivore diet I lost 12 pounds in a month just eating only meat well it doesn't scare you no dairy meat always scares me because I've always heard the cancer loves meat so that's always frightened cancel of sugar yeah that's what that's whole 30 is what I I put weight on I probably put 15 pounds on I'm so angry at myself because I have to wear a suit and my pants don't fit like I want them to wear a suit I'm just presenting something tomorrow and I just what are you presenting it's fits it's a sort of war show but it's not televised it's like an art director award or something so they asked me to do it and I never had asked to do that shit so after wear my suit I have to buy a new suit after this come on oh boy I've never I won't buy clothes I just rather be uncomfortable but I such a fat twat I look at myself yesterday like you fucking really had a meltdown last night I forgot my pants all I have is super hands I don't have regular jeans with me do you spiral like when you like decide you fucked up do you start spiraling like hate spiral it's crazy how I I I don't do it as badly anymore cuz I've caught myself so many but that takes me to a very dangerous place like it's taking me to a really bad place so I like I try not to do that because the next thing you know you're walking around the house fucking putting a belt around your neck just kind of test not buying it but just holding it and just see what it feels like to have a belt in that yeah Adams have you done that uh literally hundreds and it's it and anyone call me I not do I'm not gonna do it I would never but call me yes sir I I'm uh I'm just saying it's some things like anyone who's ever gone through with it and done that you know like you know Robin and fucking Bourdais I would love to sit with those guys yeah and just like I guarantee that was the 508 time you did that not necessarily tried it but that put it there guarantee you a hundred percent 100% you've talked to other people that have the same sort of thing no I just know the process I just go to process like you can't just one day tie you you feel it you give yourself a shot you see what that feels like you hate yourself like your fucking piece and then you let it go I mean you take it off and you don't tie it to anything I would I would I would guess well guy like Bourdain man that that one was such a bummer to me that was the was the biggest bummer I mean Brody was a giant bomber too forgot about Brody yeah Jesus that was a huge bummer did you see it coming no I didn't know him well enough no I knew he had bouts where he wasn't doing well everybody loved him though yeah everybody he'd see him he's just I never didn't hug that guy every time I saw him I hugged him he was such a good guy everybody loved him like nobody didn't like Brody except Brody yeah you know well he was sick you know like he's he had all kinds of different medications that they had tried on them and all sorts of different issues but he would go off the reservation sometime that's a that's a bad expression right I think saying that was a race it who said that well oh it was Darrell yeah it's a racist expression apparently he would go haywire and you would didn't know what was going on but like he'd be on stage yelling but it wasn't funny like he you know Brody was hilarious yeah and his style of comedy was so uniquely him like if you if you wrote it down on paper you wouldn't understand why it was funny yeah but then we saw him in real life you'd be fucking crying laughing he was so funny but then I'd see him sometimes and he would be there was no funny it was just him complaining about stuff I'm like when is this gonna turn silly because usually it turns silly but it didn't turn silly and then people like all Brody's off his medication Oh so yeah you wonder how many times did he dry run it did he dry run it because you can't be that again maybe there's exceptions to the rule but you cannot be in a depressed person and dealing with that all the time and not have dry run it hmm I mean I don't think anybody ever puts a gun in their mouth and shoots themselves the first time I'm sure it's something you've walked through a bunch of times and just couldn't make yourself do it yes that it's the time you kill yourself is the time you can finally just not stop yourself from doing it but I guarantee he had done through that a bunch was just know too many people too many people that have done that now I think I know I mean it might be seven or eight comics that have killed themselves you know the time guys had never made it to most of them we're not as known as Brody or Richard Jeni or Robert you know there's a lot of them were guys it just didn't ever get out above into I never really knew Jenny you know I said Heidi didn't always Tommy died with him yeah you called me and I was in Pittsburgh I was in the green room and you called me he was a giant influence on me when I was starting he was so good I talked about him too much to the point where people get annoyed but I just want people to know in the 80s that guy was the fucking man like you don't know how good he was when I was an open mic er in 1988 I went to see him at catch a rising star in New York and I was like this guy is fucking brilliant yeah he was fucking brilliant but you know I forget talking about the other day I don't even know if it was on here but they were saying that he liked two things that was it and he would tell you he likes comedy and porn that's it that's all that's all I care about and like literally like we didn't really socialize you know maybe had a girlfriend or didn't have a go you know on and off but comedy and porn didn't have any hobbies didn't you know we always wanted to be like Seinfeld always wanted to have the sitcom or be Jim Carrey yeah the movies but it never really happened he was such a great comic I think the last time I talked to him he called me about and I didn't know him that well but I knew him just from the business and he was unhappy because they had been attacking him like online about something like bashing him not saying he wasn't funny or whatever it was just one of those things where a site trashes you he was really upset by it really I'm like you're so much bigger than this like your side like he did almost understand how influential or powerful a comic he was right that that would bother this to come on that's why I wish he survived to podcasting I wish he survived yeah to realize like how much we other comics appreciated him yeah I tell the story but I'll tell it again east side comedy club in Long Island in like the late 80s early 90s he did Friday and Saturday two shows Friday to show Saturday four different hours murdered they said that everyone was standing around afterwards like he just did four different hours like we should fucking quit yeah we should cool we were we're here pawning off the same shitty forty minutes you know just trying to pretend that we're a headliner and this guy just merked for different hours it's weird to that Club I never did that Club here's my experience which team intervene he booked me at that Club and then I get there and there's a lock on the door like the only time I was there I fucking showed up was like the we get is fucking fucking shut down his britches brother was a mixed martial arts commentator who's a sports guy he did world combat championships I think it was called it was like he was like one of the the he was the play-by-play guy or the color yeah he was the play-by-play guy and it was like the early days of fighting when the UFC had just started and hen's Oh Gracie fought Oleg Taktarov and Richie's brother was the the play-by-play commentator yeah like he did the Jon Anik Mike Goldberg yeah I remember thinking this is so crazy because I I don't think at the time I had even done and he worked for the UFC I think at the time I was just a fan and I was just wait you started them that's 97 okay 20 years 20 years nuts I started at UFC 12 in Dothan Alabama how was your first broadcast um I they didn't give me any instruction nobody told me what to do nobody told me how to do it nobody told me shit they just said do you want a gig interviewing the fighters after the fights I was like sure you know I and then it was so rinky-dink like we were in this weird little fucking hotel and this weird and you know that's we were staying we flew in there on a propeller plane the gig was supposed to be in Buffalo New York but New York state banned it at the last minute so Bob Meyerowitz who was the owner of the company and Campbell McLaren who was the guy who hired me they told me you're going down to Alabama instead like what so I flew in to one part of Alabama and it took a Puddle Jumper and landed in Dothan and that was like the place where they were allowed to do the show there and there's this little auditorium it wasn't very big at all and the first show I ever worked at marked the hammer Coleman beat of Dan Severn for the UFC heavyweight title UFC 12 Vitor Belfort made his debut and I was obviously training at Vitor school I was a white belt Carlson Gracie's in 97 and that's where he and I had been there since 96 I started training there in 96 and then in 97 Vitor was making his UFC debut and just by sheer luck I happen to be at the actual gym with Carlos by hetoh and Mario Sperry and all these like just assassins back then and I got to be the post-fight interview guy yeah it was nuts man that's me yeah my earring ooh so cute a little cutie pie yeah so that was way way back in the dizzy man 1997 Rio Medeiros there Vitor when you think in 97 you like fuck I was doing comedy 7 years by that point like it's a long time ago and I was already in the business yeah I was 9 years in at that point in comedy because I started in 88 yeah and I didn't book gigs long I actually had to quit because it was costing me money because like if I would go to do a UFC I remember how much I made it wasn't that much to do the interview stuff but then if I could do a comedy gig I could make like 2 grand for a weekend right so I was like why am i doing that when I can make 2 grand like what am i doing I'd make him like 1 instead of 2 sorry it was just costing me money anything that kind of a comedy was difficult - it was but for me my life started with martial arts I mean that was also you know I started in 88 and the last time I fought was 89 so that was probably you know somewhere in the neighborhood of you know eight years since my like serious competition days so I still loved it I was still into it and I was loving that this new thing was around so I was happy to be there even though it wasn't like it wasn't affecting my career in a good way in fact the people that were I was on Newsradio at the time and the people that were the producers were like what the fuck are you doing like why are you doing this like why would why would they they treated me like I was going off to do like porn right what is this fucking violent thing enjoying about and being a part of and putting your face on but yeah and I was like an expert like I was the expert interviewer asking people questions doing things like you're attaching yourself to cage fighting the fuck is wrong with you but I loved it man I loved it I was so excited to see this happen because we had always wondered when when I started doing martial arts you know I started in karate I did like a little bit of kung fu then I did Karate Kung Fu was like one lesson and then a little bit of karate but then I got balls-deep in a Taekwondo but we all we ever everybody always wanted to know what was the best martial art and I switched from Taekwondo and I started doing kickboxing and boxing because I realized like my hands were terrible and then I'm like man I mean I thought it was good because I was good at Taekwondo but this boxing stuff is more important to learn I need to learn that and then I started doing jiu-jitsu and getting strangled my fucking ah no anything and I remember thinking when the UFC came along finally we're gonna figure out what works finally we're gonna know what works you know and now look at you work for the UFC now how crazy is that it's fuckin crazy cuz I love it so much and I love just I'm a fan so I just I love the fact I just get to talk to the fighters and hang with Matt like it's a really I love Matt I love Matt to that Sarah is a fucking gem of a human he's 100% genuine yes he's exactly the same on the air yes as off he's the same guy he's beautiful he really is hello that's an amazing guy and yeah being a part of it it's just an even in the way I am which is a peripheral way I just I don't fight I don't train you thought about training a lot Kaitlyn Chu Kagan keeps telling me like I'm gonna go to your first class I want to come to Enzo's yes she's been telling me for two years but I get so claustrophobic and tired from not sleeping but whatever I people the UFC unfiltered fans want to smash me for yapping about it I want to take it you just got to do it I know if you're tired from lack of sleep and everything like that but just do it and you should go to the doctor and get a real Mouse you can't sleep with the CPAP right it bothers you I need I need I need a mouthpiece but I also I can't do CPAP anywhere I need ASV which is both types of apnea it covers but yeah I want to either go to hens O's or hens those is great there's ago I think you may Rivera has a place around there too doesn't I believe so he's like a showman's well yes where I live and he's invited to go just go just go just go I know it just make yourself do it yeah it's fun you look at it it'll be okay course everybody sucks out in the beginning I sucked at it I can clearly remember being just tortured raped by this dude oh my god this guy just destroyed me do you get used to the sweat on you like I think that would always bother you do you used to it used to anything it's good for you not the sweat but the physical contact it actually there's a camaraderie which you Jitsu that it's like very different than any other martial art it's you're trying to kill each other but you're also looking after each other you know like the guys who you really care about like tenth planet guys or John jocks guys when I train with them nobody hurt you if you got hurt it was by axe guys were you know you're trying to kill each other but you knew that if they got you in an armbar that they were not gonna try to break your arm there they were gonna hold it and and you know give you an opportunity to try to get out of it if you could or tap and no one was gonna like just fucking yank it no one ever does that no one it's there and you appreciate that it's like a good feeling that you know that if this guy does get you in something you need tap they immediately let go they stop yeah and then you slap hands and you go damn you got me you motherfucker and you laugh and then you go back and do it again because I'm fascinated but like I want to do it I honestly my own laziness is one reason I just haven't but because Matt loves Matt loves talking about choking like Matt loves the idea of strangling somebody with their own coat with the coat that's a gift you know oh it is I mean I always said like if you were fighting in the street against a judo player and you had a winter coat on oh my god you're so fucked yeah cuz they're just gonna fucking grab you and use the world on you because literally slam your head into the world just especially in New York City like the streets just fucking shit boom well the worst you should be naked and greasy ya ever think about getting in a fight with somebody I would have to train with clothes with Aggie I think if I ever do it just because like you don't how many on the subway no one's gonna be shirtless I'm gonna ever have to fucking defend myself they're gonna probably have clothes on so yeah but you'd learn how to use the clothes I'd do both you'd learn how to use gay know guide learn how to do both it's no big deal someone has clothes on it's not like you don't know what to grab because they have clothes on it's it's simple and they're all nice I'm not I'm not worried about I'm not afraid of it like cuz I like the people so much who I've met involved I've never met anybody involved in who I didn't like yeah they're nice people right all of them are nice people none of them are dicks none of them give that energy off like they all know they could strangle me like there's nobody nobody makes you feel that way well that's why I guy like Matt Serra is such a good guy because he's got such a good character you know and then you kind of noticed that from a lot of fighters right they have great character and one of the reason why they have great character is they're they don't have a problem with their ego they're controlled they understand who they are they feel good yeah never uncomfortable around any of them yeah like never for that reason at least no matter who they are or what position they're in they're all kind of the same none of them none of them come off like with that alpha energy that other athletes give you I remember on ona you know if everybody choked you I used to do that yeah BJ was the first guy he was coming off a loss and I wanted to see what it felt like like I knew wouldn't be the same but I had seen arm bars and I wanted to know how what does it feel like when somebody grabs your arm that way so they were all pretty gentle phaidor put me in a fucking good one yeah yeah yeah his hurt he laughed again he was but I to feel those things you like it gives you such a respect for the fact that there's guys that are doing this for real oh yeah this is a guy just showing some fucking idiot on the radio didn't John Jones like gently leg kick you too no John Jones fucking put a hard leg kick because it was like he was like wait cut wheat weak so he might not have been the best of fucking moods he put me in kicked me across the leg it hurts so bad no but I'm being honest I think he did it like I'm sure he hit let me say let me hear this look at my fucking my hands up put your dukes up that's light it what compared to what he could have done that's light but I almost threw up look at him look at you I almost vomited I had to go to the bathroom so I thought I faint okay but I'm telling you right now that wasn't even 50% oh no not even close that was probably wasn't even 30% all that was was like the weight of his leg ya know he could have really fuckin levelled oh my god Jones tells me I've had a few guys do things who hurt you the most John yeah I do a price I'm not exactly how long it was it might need weighed been fucked up so I put one on for three months after that but the face that you get ready good - yeah this fader got you in an arm lock Oh who's got you in a heel look Brock Brock Lesnar no you let Brock Lesnar touch your knees yeah oh it's so terrible yeah yeah they'll be shot punched you yeah there's a whole series of people beating on you but it was never dude it was never like it was never like hey let's see how the her Oh John yeah punch you a different time Oh Uriah punch you the army there's a whole video series of you getting beat up by UFC fighters so har Brock's were oh yeah yeah yeah was that Frank or Ken Frank oh Anderson kicked you yeah not hard though he anis is a nice guy he wouldn't kick me that hard that's good for him man I'm glad you you we're gonna have them kick you in the arm yes oh you could break your arm easy yeah I didn't want but I always trust these guys like I know that none of them are gonna do it so hard that they do anything to me that's gonna damage because they all know I'm not fighting right but I all know that they could that I just trust them for some reason I trust them to be gentle I don't know why well they aren't they're nice people plus they know it's the radio yeah I'm not trying to hurt you John got you to choke to yeah this is so crazy yeah all these people fuck you look fader if I wouldn't let go he wouldn't let go now he enjoyed it oh do you know fate or just got you again yeah he tap-tap to you like three times yeah you're shot getting you in a triangle oh my god that is hilarious yeah yeah Rhonda arm Barbie I had some really fun ones but I wish I had done more of these because it was really a bit done out of respect for what they do right just to feel what it's like to watch someone who's world-class and one of the best alive at doing that and it almost sudden to have them do it to you felt like fuck man this is how good this guy is at this how did she get the gig with the UFC how'd that work Dana had asked me one time you know we known each other a long time and he he'd say one day we're gonna work together we're gonna do something I don't know what and I was like alright you know and I would see him in events and whatever and I just got a phone call one day he's like hey man we're doing a podcast with Madsen everyone do it if I could just called me and goes here's the money do you want do the podcast it was a phone call from Dana free me the podcast he didn't Matt was already in place and I said yeah I would love to so we worked out a couple of things with my job where I was able to do something else with my name on it and he just hired me Wow I'm not hired like you know I hired as a comedian who loves UFC like mad guy who can of course a by play call who can analyze jiu-jitsu so beautifully and you know that's not what I do ya know it's it's interesting that the UFC has a podcast you know yeah UFC unfiltered yeah I mean it was I it was they could have just got to analysts to do it but I think Danny just wanted a different tone to often you guys do it once a week twice a week twice a week I see Matt every Monday and Wednesday really and you meet in the city of the studio in the city in a studio and they beat a lot of fighters on usually they're not in studio a lot of times they're skyping yeah that sucks I prefer in studio however every time I don't like I've only done a couple of skypes to a Snowden Snowden and John Anthony West who was a my favorite guest ever he's an Egyptologist who this incredible understanding of Egypt and the hieroglyphs and he had this great DVD series called magical Egypt just he just passed recently amazing guy but him and just cuz he was sick and he couldn't tonight in here and then Snowden obviously because he's on the moon yeah yeah yeah where he is he thought that was weird it's a weird two deuce I don't like the Skype interviews I prefer them to the phone though these guys would call them their way to practice like you know what I mean we have cowboy on the phone a beam they just drive and going to do something and hear the wind and you couldn't get anything done well the weird thing about the Snowden ones too was wasn't just that it was remote it was also like what what we're talking about like who he is and what would his situation is that he's trapped and Russia allegedly I mean he might be in Cleveland who the fuck is where he is but that he's you know got this situation where he's never going to really be able to come back to the United States unless they you know work out some sort of a deal and even then he's not gonna believe them you know I mean I wouldn't believe them I probably wouldn't either didn't he say know about UFOs though they didn't you asked him and he said he hadn't seen evidence hasn't seen evidence but how much do you look into and how much was available to him and you know where where is that kind of evidence sure if there is any of that stuff I don't know maybe on a closed system to I don't I don't want to not believe in UFOs I resist it I resist it hard I'm not rational about it dude I'm trying i-i've tied if I got pissed real bad I'm gonna go ahead gonna uptick in UFO stuff recently yeah I wonder why I'm don't know what that is spaceforce you know what I think honestly it is that's when the New York Times had that thing where they were talking about all the different reported UFO sightings that are reputable from people like David flavor and you know these Air Force guys that are like otherwise rock-solid individuals who talk about their experiences but my problem with it my legitimate problem me as a human beings I want it to be real so when people don't think it's real like oh that's all bullshit I'm like no it's real like I'm not I'm not objective I'm biased like legitimately biased and I know it and I'm I come on man wife why so biased about this it's a weird one like I want it to be real so much like talking to Bob Lazar like god I hope he's telling the truth I'm sure this was a theory cuz it don't wait to be proven but I saw someone online pot like postulate that the uptick in alien stuff could be like us coming from the future I've heard that too that the idea is that what what the greys are and this is something I've personally thought I think independently was that if you look at human beings and you look at say a gorilla right you look at a gorilla was this big hairy fucking animal thing and then you slowly turn that into you know I guess we didn't really come from gorillas we came from chimps but chimps you know monkeys lower hominids Australia Pittacus you know and then you know ancient man right and then all these different versions of what we are until we become right now homeless ap in 2020 well what are we how do we look different well unless you're someone who works out a lot you're losing a lot of your musculature you're not as dense you're not as hairy you know when you see like that fucking killer wrestler from Russia remember when we showed videos of that dude god damn it up I'm trying to remember his name Roose tom ruse Tom fuck is it GF Roose Tom chief he's this fucking tank of a man that's covered in hair but he looks like someone from the past you know when when he's throwing people around this fucking giant hairy back and hair all over his chest and arms he always this is that guy but that dad almost he almost looks like a normal human there but there's some some videos of him when he's grappling I mean I like that one right there always get the double flex the red one right above that yeah like look how hairy that motherfucker is that guy's that's from another time yeah that is from another time I mean that guy you could comb his chest hair my we were talking about aliens and I was saying if you look at people like that like real hairy fuckin testosterone-filled savages like this guy was like an elite wrestler he's a killer grappler and then you look at aliens well if you look at chimps - that guy - aliens what's happening well what's happening is we're getting less hairy and we're getting smaller and weaker right we're getting more and more like what an alien looks like and aliens have no genitals they have no mouths they're just a smooth skinny thing with this big head and these big weird eyes like when we get rid of the need if we evolved past the need for physical strength if we evolved past the need for you know sex if sex is the note we don't reproduce any longer through just normal biological male female sex if they've you know who knows a million years from now a hundred thousand years now we might decide that one of the biggest problems that faces human beings on earth is our emotions our desire for sex biology all of our animal instincts that we still hold on to and we could evolve past those just like we're so much different than chimps are we're so much different than we used to be when we were lower hominids we've evolved we evolved to the point where we're communicating with words we're using phones we fly in planes we have technologies are softer and our bodies are less they're less they're not as strong they're not as animalistic and explosive and if it continues along that path especially aided by technology when we don't have any need especially we have these big ass giant brains and we can use telepathy to communicate we can communicate through some other way maybe even electronically enhanced maybe you know something in their brain but when you look at an alien with the big head and the little tiny body that's what a person is probably going to become our heads are way bigger our brains are bigger than other hominids and other other primates our bodies are softer and weaker and if you just keep going with that that's what happens the head but do they have no genitals though that's bent like or is it something that the at least the photo other people say they are are they just wearing something that hides our genitals like I don't know if they have no child I mean that's like pushing hard for it also it could be no genitals but it also could be those aren't even biological things anymore it could be that human beings become some sort of cybernetic some sort of cyborgs look if you think about body parts right like if we start replacing body parts like I met a gentleman the other day I did this benefit pull the guy what is the guy's name the Australian gentleman who was a soldier who lost both his arm and his leg in a shark attack I did a benefit the other day with him for the Australian waffle he's got a carbon fiber arm and a carbon fiber leg it's crazy shakes your hand like grips it with his carbon fiber hand and you know right now you can tell the difference between his carbon fiber hand this electronic hand and his other hand but maybe a hundred years from now you won't be able to and maybe in the future it's better to have one of these artificial bodies than it is to have a biological body that can break and get all fucked up and you feel pain we're replacing things all the time we're replacing body parts all the time with operations and we use organic substitutes Paul de Gelder yes that's the man shout out to Paul yeah we we did this Australian benefit with Jim Jefferies and Monty Franklin and Whitney Cummings the other night for the Australian wildfire for wildlife relief there was a billion animals that yeah a billion Jesus it's crazy yeah anyway in the future maybe they'll get to the point where they'll have limbs that are better than the limbs we have like what are you doing with these biological Wims Jamie up gray a case of a fucking alien body you know I want to believe dude I you know I saw the Lazar documentary you had him in I enjoyed I didn't see the whole interview but I saw I liked a lot I just I I there's always that one place with conspiracy that I there's always a gap I cannot cross course and for me it's the degrees I just can't get beyond the degrees being gone that is degrees laws I can't get beyond it and I want to I want to I would much rather believe in UFOs and not believe in them well he's clearly educated and he's monk I he says he worked for Los Alamos labs and they sent him to MIT to work on top-secret projects there's clear evidence that he worked at Los Alamos labs Ashley do me a favor go to Jeremy you go to Jeremy's I think it's on his Instagram page he has this thing it might be on his Twitter he has this thing where he has George Knapp explain all the different things he went through to prove that Bob Lazar was legit one of them being that he definitely worked at Los Alamos he was even in the employee registry even though they said he didn't yeah play that and give me some volume the central question for me about Bob was did he work at Los Alamos laughs if he worked there on classified projects it is plausible that he could work at array 51 at Papoose Lake on other stuff did he work there I can tell you flat-out he did a hundred percent certain that he did I found his name in the phone book I found his name and an article in the Los Alamos newspaper I talked to people who were there and finally Bob took me there he took me into the lab waved at the security guys who brought a camera along this guy was familiar was like a rabbit running through a burrow that he had traveled every day and he's waving at security guys and walking into all these buildings he knew his way around he'd been there before they knew him they'd let him in they left me in I interviewed people he worked with they said he was there we proved it and yet the paper trail ends at a certain point we don't have any records we can't find anything they'd already told me they had the records as soon as I think I'm getting close they yanked the out from under me he took lie-detector test he passed all of them I sure doesn't mean anything but look this is we're talking about the 1980s they get away with a lot back then in terms of erasing your history and his his education is undeniable in terms of what he knows he's a brilliant guy when you talk to him he's not faking anything he's not like he doesn't have any holes in his understanding knowledge ethics or you know I don't know if he's telling the truth but again I'm not I'm not objective I'm biased I want to believe I want to believe as well I can't get beyond the school things that tie in to me that says he's not being truthful well the MIT thing I'll tell you this he told me that they sent him from Los Alamos labs to there to work on something and I'll tell you what it is off air but I told them I wouldn't I wouldn't talk about it during the podcast because you're gonna hear when I tell you you're gonna go holy fuck and it'll make a little more sense it's um I don't know you know it's again I'm a fucking loser I want it to be real no but it can be real I I just but I mean I want it to be so I'm not looking at it yeah I'm not you're very buy-in you care about yeah I'm invested I'm not I mean I'm not invested anymore like even the the the the three naval videos I'm like whenever a pilot sees something that tic-tac video but now that there's something that they're saying that's making me go that might be man-made because they're saying something about if we were to reveal this it would compromise national security no no they could reveal all the files they have on these UFO incidents it would compromise national security first of all because it will compromise their if they reveal how they know that something is blocking radar that object whatever it was was actively jamming radar I had commander flavor the guy who owned that thing the guy who was there and who reported that thing I had him here he said that thing went from 60,000 feet down to 200 in less than a second there's nothing that we have the not or not he said that the thing moved so fast it made this this travel in this radar you know radar as a blip right it's like BIP BIP BIP in between one blip to another it had moved in a preposterous speed you couldn't even track it it was it was moving so fast they don't know if it did it in less than a second or if it didn't once but whatever was the amount of distance that has traveled is impossible what did they have the laws of physics as we understand them could they see it could they see with the naked eye as well yes they can see it with the naked eyes this is on the other water yes you can see the video you can see the thing on video you can see the thing on video move off you can see that it's actively jamming radar you can see that they're trying to track it and stay with it but it's moving too fast see there's something they said recently that made me think oh that might be man-made and I forget it was something to do with compromising national security or whatever the quote was I was like that sounds like something that there's man-made they're worried they'll compromise well here's something that they've created I know what you saying but here's the thing like whatever it is someone made okay if it's not man then it's something from another planet maybe it is man-made maybe it is some project that the government has but whatever it is it's something that moves at an insane speed that we're not capable of understanding it's in terms of what what the average person who understands propulsion and engines and combustion all those people well pilots see when pilots say stuff I listen to it because they understand those things I don't like for me I don't know how things are supposed to move but they do so when they're confused by something that's what got me interested was when the time is did the article on those so I really started going like I started you know watching and reading and I'm like I want to believe I just can't find anything that doesn't have a gap that I can't cross well you should talk to flavor he's a fucking rock solid guy he's very it's very compelling when you talk to him in person because he doesn't want to have anything to do with publicity he's not interested at all he wanted to tell a story because he felt like they're not being honest about it yeah and that people really should know that there's some things that we don't understand and that these guys that are down in San Diego that were at this Air Force Base they were seeing these things like fairly recently before his his experience right they had seen one like four in the last couple weeks I think it was and then they find him on the East Coast two same thing and they move in the same way that Bob Lazar described these things that he worked on area s for the same way where there's something called element 115 that Bob Lazar described in the late 80s early 90s they didn't even know it was real until 2013 he describing it long before it was ever proven to be an actual thing long before they ever created it with a particle accelerator he what he reminded this was myit again I'm basing this only on opinion I have no facts for this when I listen to him hyrum he my first thought was after these things that don't line up oh he took somebody's story what he's saying is somehow true but he's telling somebody else's story and there may be a total blight but that's just what that's was my head told me was because he knows so much and yet how do they make your education disappear like I'm not hard not hard in the 1980s I went to school with him have talked about it that's what I want to hear from oh yeah I wanted to school them well he they have records of people that went to school with them who talked about it that Evan I will they have records of people that work with him at Los Alamos labs they've talked about it have a sonically because that's what I haven't heard talk to George Knapp I know that and I want to hear who these people are not not in acquisitive but I want it to be true like I want people to go I'll go Yankees in my fucking like class I know I talked about it on the podcast where he went back and found these guys that he worked at the lab with he worked at los alamos lab for sure and he worked on top-secret nuclear projects and he worked in propulsion and that's one of the reasons why they sent him to this area s4 because he put a jet engine in a Honda in the 1980s and you know he's the guy's a fucking super jock guy and so when he did this they were like well this guy has a very intense understanding of combustion engines and propulsion and all these different things that he's creating and so like let's see if this guy can crack this crazy nut yeah and so they were just bringing scientists to try to get a different perspective on these crafts and the one that he was working on or one of them that he's working on they said they had found in an archeological dig that's where it gets really crazy like they found this thing what he was working on they think what he read was that what the government was telling them when they were working there when they were briefing him was that human beings are the product of science projects that human beings were created when many many thousands of years ago hundreds whatever millions of years ago however was the aliens came down here and did experiments with lower hominids they did experiments with primates and added their DNA and manipulated the DNA to create human beings and it's one of the reasons why if you see like the only thing that's like us is dogs in that dogs can all breed with each other like a pit bull can breed with a poodle but they don't look anything alike right but they breed together perfectly you would assume those are two different things right but they're not they're the same thing that's the same with people like Shaquille O'Neal could fuck bridget the midget right they're the same thing or a tiny little asian girl like a giant man and little who doesn't look anything we look so different some of us are red hairs some of us are Asian so you know we we vary so much we're almost like dogs in that way and we know that dogs are a product of manipulation we have manipulated dogs and turned them into what they are through selective breeding and through all the you know the different methods they use to try to achieve you know whatever a bulldog is or whatever collie is and 20 by the way why okay they can't breathe okay I feel that we've created this thing and put a stick in its mouth it's fuckin vicious it's sad well even English bulldogs those fat boys with those black yak there was lying down they can't breathe well even my dog you just you met Marshall he's like that used to be a wolf like wolves are what all dogs come from how all dogs even Khali's even chihuahuas the origin of all those animals is a wolf so we took a wolf and we slowly turned it in to whatever a sheepdog is we slowly turned it in to whatever a fuckin Shiba Inu is all these different dog species they're all they all emanate from wolves we didn't even know that until just a few decades ago when they started doing DNA scans of dogs they thought they were gonna find all these wild canids and all these different things that are the origin of dogs the but no it's not it's all wolves everything came from a wolf I have a Bible as our question it's not that I don't know enough about it to convince you otherwise I but I just don't but I'm kind of hoping you can convince me if they made the school records disappear right why do they leave the records that we just saw from that place didn't know they were there that that's someone he had a copy of the the registry for that place someone who worked there during the same time he did how to copy the registry do they they didn't just eliminate as the eliminate his social security number they eliminated a lot of shit dude in the 1980s they can make you effectively disappear yeah I'm sure they can I mean the India is paper trails were a little bit different yeah but it's just I I can't get beyond the two degrees again I want I wanna I'm sure I've heard him interviewed he's a very compelling guy not not to harp on it I just attuned to these two degrees are not hard that's not hard to get past that's not hard to to eliminate what's hard is understanding all the things he understands when it comes to science without an education the way he talks about it have you ever seen the videos where he's describing it in the late 80s yeah it's exactly the same as he describes it now exactly the same no variation whatsoever that's kind of like tell a story forty years ago and then I asked you again today to tell me that same story most bullshitters are gonna have some holes in that story and change it and doesn't mean he's telling the truth but he's been insanely consistent I would almost think too that a lot of times truth tellers have things change that's why I witness testimony is so unreliable because even a truth teller will make mistakes over time yep if it's a if it's a story that I've created I think I'm less likely to forget details if I've created it because I have a beginning middle and end to it right but it's very complicated what he's saying yeah I saying it's very complicated in the descriptions of them descriptions of these crafts and the way that propulsion system works and the fact that it uses this incredibly dense element that doesn't even exist on earth in you know 1989 or whatever it was but now they found actually as a real thing like that element 115 that was that was people were saying that science fiction you're making things up but now that they have created it in particle accelerators like Oh okay this is a real thing now what if there's a planet that has a completely different atmosphere completely different relationship with its star and element 115 is common like they find things in asteroids all the time right that are very very rare on earth but very common in space it's one of the ways that they know whether or not we've been impacted like one of the ways they know that the Yucatan was hit with his gigantic asteroid that killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago is a layer of iridium at 65 million years iridium is very very rare on earth but very common in space and this layer of it this dense layer at 65 million years ago shows that that's when it was hit that this giant chunk of space rock slammed into the earth and killed everything yeah I know lookyou I like the fact you're skeptical I'm very scamp I wish I was more and I don't I don't want to be because I really want to believe it because it also gives us a hope that we have some kind of a possible immortality somewhere believe me I'd fucking like rayker as well as much as anybody does he gives us all hope but I just I keep getting to a sticking point every single time there's something I can't get beyond when it comes to that conspiracy I know what you mean I know what you mean it's look I thought it was all horseshit for a long time I was I was like I was mocking it all for a long time and then Jeremy corbels documentary really flipped the switch with me I was like god dammit is this real and then Kennedy no Jeremy and talking to him and then getting no Bob having dinner with Bob and then getting Bob to come here and sit down it was very hard to get him to come in yeah very hard very hard he was super nervous he was getting migraines he didn't want the he didn't want the scrutiny and then meanwhile while he's doing Jeremy's documentary they fucking raid his business they raid his business and go through all his stuff the FBI did they caught it all on video it's all part like this is not just a regular guy they're going through all of his his data they're going through his all of his emails they confiscated his computers they didn't find anything he's he's free and clear but they were looking for element 115 he thinks because he had some apparently and they had done some tests and there's video of it with George Knapp where they've got like they've got fog there usually some sort of a fog machine and they're showing how this gives off a certain it gives off a certain field that makes it almost impossible to grab and touch and this fog is rejected by this field and what they're saying about that element is and I'm gonna butcher this I don't really understand the science but this this gravity intensifier this gravity multiplier or whatever the fuck it is gravity projection thing with that 115 it distorts gravity and that's how these things are able to move through these insane through insane speeds and the way he described it is that it's like if you have like a real cushy mattress real soft mattress and you put a massive bowling ball in the center of the mattress everything would just go zoom and Bend around the bowling ball well that's what element 115 with that craft in that propulsion system does to space-time it bends gravity if it bends space-time he lives in truth I don't know the answer to this I always walked I've heard of that doesn't everything else get fucked up like if you're bending space-time there's everything else just kind of come closer together and I don't know I don't know maybe doesn't maybe does maybe doesn't I don't know maybe it just does it with whatever's around it and maybe we don't understand what you know how spaced we know that gravity bends things for it bends light that's why you know when you're looking at the Sun you can actually see things they can see things are actually behind the Sun because it wore the massive gravity of the Sun because it's so enormous it actually manipulates light it bends it so you can see things that are actually behind it I want to know like if he had done Neil deGrasse Tyson bunch times yeah he's fascinating you know and a skeptic um and he's an interesting skeptic because he may I mean he saw he can base it in what he knows or believe scientifically right but I you know guy try on our show went at it with him you know who went on Troy Oh who's Troy he's our fucking uh he's a DJ and he's our fucking like a guy who works our computer wait wait Troy went out with Neil Tyson oh yeah about what cuz he thinks he's a full-of-shit government agent and hiding you a hose no I was great that was a fun video no but Troy thinks that Neil is an agent an agent that agent I mean like an agent as in as in representing the point of view understand is he one of those flat earth guys no no you just said he thinks that there's UFOs there's a lot of things we're not being told but it was a great video that day but if they're not being told do you think that they tell astronomers and astrophysicists do you think they tell guys like Neil deGrasse Tyson like why would they pull him aside hey hey guy who works at the Hayden Planetarium we're gonna we're gonna give you secrets and we definitely want to make sure you don't tell him two people on the Opie and Anthony show yeah sure I thinks that he he knows really yeah come on no it's legit yeah he really does okay all right Troy but he said we always going back and forth was it entertaining Sonya or did he get weird he was okay with it you know we had deal on UFC unfiltered and him and Matt wrestled it was really funny cuz Neil is such a big dude and people forget but he was a heavyweight wrestler where do they wrestle there was their mother floor no they were talking about some kind of a joke or something or a submission and as a video of it yeah I filmed it and I think he was trying to show Matt something he was a legit wrestler he was he was stacked when he was young you ever see him no dude pull a picture of Neil deGrasse Tyson when he was in college dude he was fucking jacked like like a UFC fighter yeah he was built really well built Matt did put him in something that he was unable to I think of course yeah champion Neil wasn't sure if he could do it yeah I don't know if Neil was as familiar with Matt oh good lord look at him yes dude Jesus come on man he's fucking jack yep John shoulders the sweetheart of a guy I really like him I love deal yeah he's a he's a really that picture up there up in the left hand corner right above that one fascinating guy look out look at that stud it looks like the Mod Squad isn't that amazing him as a college student Wow I would never know that's him I know look at the fucking sideburns yeah that's very 70s sweet don't you wish you could grow afro I wish I could grow any real facial hair it just doesn't look right looks wispy and shitty it's getting gray now anyway so I keep it short but eventually it's all gonna come off yeah I keep mine short my my beard hair but when I grow it out it's depressing it's all white yeah me too have like little I mean out you could see this I know they have some now but like all around my sides is all white now it's a sign of 10 do you care about it though like it Boz it bugs me man like I'm like I live with it and again it beats dying but I'm fucking a little like goddamn man you're 51 and it's not gonna you're not going backwards it's not going backwards I don't enjoy it like this is great I'm getting old I don't but perspective I'm a extremely fortunate person extremely yeah like insanely preposterous ly blessed and fortunate I I can't complain about shit I'm a lucky lucky person yeah yeah you get to I mean people you do it you love but I think about this shit I complain about and it's luxury problems because I'm doing the job I want to do yeah first world problems I have three awesome jobs you know I mean my side job is the UFC I'm the color commentator for the UFC that's my side gig I just do that for fun you know I can't wait for in Ghana rosin strike I can't wait goodness can't wait for that fight and is that scheduled for which I want to say it's April tickets just went on sale March 28th March March 2000 Rosen strike what he did to ouster over his face with that fucking leaping right hook yeah when he split his fucking mouth open that guy is a fucking tank and what was more impressive than anything to me in that fight was not that he knocked him out with the last ten seconds to go but that he absorbed all the shots now star hit him with and he kept pressing forward almost like he was invulnerable to him I never saw anybody do that to Alistar he was losing that fight though I think Alex yeah oh yes Alistair was winning that fight for sure roses truck is a fucking tank man yeah he's a tank and he's a legit 265 right unnatural 265 as is n gan Oh so I think this is the first time in Ghana has ever fought a guy who's a real world-class kickboxer who is also his size naturally and is also a vicious knockout part puncher I still think in Ghana hits harder I think I still think in Ghana is faster but if I was in rows and strikes corner what I would be concentrating on his leg kicks in particular because Junior dos Santos even though in Ghana starched him in the first round and gun starches almost everybody else but in junior was able to get off a lot of leg kicks early in the round and was able to at least affect him in some way I was like okay this could be an issue of a real good kickboxer now we didn't see Rosen strike used that sort of strategy against against Alistair he was really looking to put hands on Alistair he threw some kicks but really I think in if he adjusts with in Ghana and tries to move away from the big shots and chop the legs he's a better kickboxer he's got real experience with Muay Thai you know but he's also a ruthless knockout striker and he has a crazy chin Rosen strike has a crazy chin man didn't you feel bad though for Overeem at the end of that like the fact it was almost like he kind of just jumped up and walked off like it was a walk-off home run and and the ref was like all right like I just looked at his face was hanging off do you think they should have stopped it yes to his cut went like all the way up to his nose like if if Rosa strike punched him more it would have probably fallen off and then they wouldn't had a stitch-up take a patch off the canvas and wash it off and glue back to the case that he was done like just find that ko find rose and strike Kos Alistair over him the UFC does a thing that I really wish they wouldn't do and I don't understand the thought process behind it and this thing is they don't show finishes online you can't see the finishes like you'll see a guy pulling off of the guy like when they stop the fight he walks away right yes but they don't show the actual finish what do you think that is poor thinking I just I don't show it I'm exciting people want to see it'll make more people watch it is that to get you to fight - watch this watch this yeah I mean look see a flop up but watch him go down look that see that stop the fight teaches it does it is that it at the end of it okay I wanted it to play out more because you could see how he's basically helpless I wonder if they'd do that to get people to go to fight pass like maybe if they if we show you part of it it took up like an automatic promotion for fight pan I get this - thank you I can't hanim ajan that's true I think they fight pass is awesome they should you know just go to it if you're a fan yeah I mean it's fight pass is great and it's not just for fight pass it's got you know quintet Eddie Bravo's combat jujitsu zon that a bunch of different Muay Thai organizations on that all the UFC's fight passes the shit okay here it is look there he's a little bit yeah he's wobbly there but by then wouldn't it have been boom how much time was left when that happened mmm see ya baby yeah he walked away yeah if he had jumped on him and they stopped it I would get but you could see he died and touched him Dan touched him watch Dan touch roses Rex he touches him there yeah he walked away and then he waved it off after Alistair walk yeah you're right no you know it's a good point it's a real good point I'm gonna still maybe is this the cut was so nasty it was so nasty way interesting mere seconds from the final but that's why it made me feel bad for over because if he went down to hit him and he stopped it I'll be like he had to stop it right but him walking away might have fucked him I know that one more time one more time to know one more time watch this he's moving to our hands down gets caught boom gets dropped yeah no you're right got right back up no Ashlee's a good point okay no I changed my mind I changed my mind yeah that when I saw it I was just so stunned that he caught him in the last couple say now but it really does prove it's like you have to watch the fight till the end it was an exciting way for a fight yeah I mean it was like Rodriguez Korean Zombie it's like the fight ends like that how do you ever watch a fight for you know you you can't not watch till the end that elbow was insane that elbow was insane the way through that like a look away elbow and the Korean Zombie just flatlines you're like holy shit it wasn't Rodriguez losing that fight to remember yes and then the Korean zombie just knocked out Frankie Edgar he's an animal yeah he is in zombies a tough motherfucker he had to take two years off to serve the South Korean oh yeah military military makes you it's mandatory it's like Israel you have to do mandatory military time you are and your thing with that have you talked to Steven Avery uh Steven a Smith yeah no I like the way you handle that you're really honest dude and you didn't get caught up in the fact that he liked you and he's a big name in sports I love how you how you spoke about it listen I I'm I'm very good friends with cowboy I love that guy love him he's awesome he's not quitter he doesn't quit he got smashed he didn't quit that's my only observation and Steven Naismith his thing is talking shit he's a master at being this entertaining guy who talked shit about sports and I don't think he's a bad guy I just think that's where that's how he butters is Brett that's his thing right that's how he talked he talked shit and but fighters I feel like it's a different thing it's not just a sport it's a sport where you're literally risking your life you know knock on wood we've been very lucky in the UFC we haven't had any loss of life but it's a hundred percent possible and it definitely has happened in other organizations and it happens in boxing every year yeah and if it happened in the UFC would be it would be horrendous and if it happened at cowboy if cowboy died in the hospital that night and believe me that's possible cowboy had a broken orbital bone and he had a broken nose and he got beaten down by one of the biggest punchers in that division in any--in you know I mean then 155 pounds really but the way Conor cracked him like Conor like I don't I don't care who you are he hits you like that you're in real big trouble he fractured Cowboys face if cowboy died in the hospital after Steven Naismith or someone else was it was chastising him and mocking him and saying he quit he folded yeah imagine well he didn't do well but there he's got a point there cowboy did not perform well and the reason why you didn't perform well is because Connor perform spectacularly that's what fighting is all about Josie Aldo who is one of the greatest fighters that's ever done it and at the time was the greatest featherweight of all time kind of flatlined him in 14 seconds with one punch that doesn't mean that Josie Aldo didn't show up or Josie Aldo quit it means Conor has a fucking brand for a fist and he throws it perfect he's got massive power massive power and explosive speed and he's a killer man Conor McGregor he's a goddamn killer you know I like him more than I used to - I was never a Conor fan I liked him more after I saw him lose and how he handled a loss you know I just liked him like I watched him talking like yeah I kind of like I like him and it seems like this fight with cowboy he went into it differently than he has publicly in the past and maybe that's just because he likes him and in the next fight with Habib he'll be the same as he was but I like him more now than I ever liked it he definitely handled himself in public better but I also think honestly that he probably didn't feel like he had to play games with cowboy that you know he felt like cowboy style was tailor-made for him he felt like cowboy was stiff and then he was going to be able to take him out and catch him and hurt him and he did he was right he probably didn't feel like he needed to play psychological games yeah when you're fighting a guy like kabhi kabhi was such a destroyer he's such a fucking destroyer I mean I have seen him take guys with like extensive wrestling backgrounds guys like Abel Trujillo just ragdoll just throw them around man Michael Johnson throw them around it's like you have no business in there with them it just beats the fuck out of people malls Omaha FAL dos Anjos world champion grab some throws him to the ground helpless you can't do she's claustrophobic looking watching it like I think if I remember that Michael Johnson fight the wrist control he's just his arm tied behind and he's punched him in the face I'd quit quit yeah quit you know I deserve title shot quit you know if they were always talking about Conor McGregor and he's like send me location send me a location where are you tell me it send me a location like he's like dude I'm coming for you he's a he's a monster there's only two guys in the sport that our world champions destroyers at that level who are undefeated one of them's John Jones the other ones could be yeah no one else's like that where they just smash everybody John Jones has won bullshit loss where the referee decided that the elbows were illegal and the referee was doing his job but it's nonsense that fucking elbow rules stupid he smashed that guy I wonder if that in a way to that loss was years ago I wonder if that because so many guys become undefeated and all of a sudden they lose one and then they lose a couple you wonder sometimes if an early loss like that takes the pressure of being undefeated never been beaten but you still have that one L so there's not that that whole thing on your back like I can't lose I can't lose I can't get that one out John almost lost his last fight I want to see that to Santos rematch more than I want to see Jones fight anybody that thinks I'm fucking crazy that's the fight I want to see I think if there was a Santos rematch John Jones takes him down and beats the fuck out of him if I had a guess I think John Jones decided to try to stand up with him and Brendan Schaub had an interesting take on he said John's playing with his food they say he's bored he just he's just side in the kick box with these guys but at the end of the day after five rounds there was a split decision one judge scored it in favor of Thiago song yes I don't necessarily agree I'm not saying I agree I watched the fight again last week and it's a great fight I didn't score it though you know I just enjoyed it I think if you if you really want to score that's why I don't score fights when I'm watching them but sometimes you just know you don't have to squirm like if there's a bunch of knockdowns or someone beats the shit out of somebody and it's clear you know but that fight was not clear there was like there's moments where Thiago Santos Rock John and hurt him when did he hurt him sign that first I know the leg kicks in the first round were really I thought they were being really effective and then when did he hurt himself was at the end of the first router in the second round but don't remember I'd have to go back and watch it again I think it was the second round I think we isolated it on the camera the truck because I was saying something's going on I'm noticing the way he's moving I'm at to ACL blowouts so I'm particularly sensitive when I see somebody moving funny on their knees you know and when I was seeing him do that I'm like something's going on and then the truck isolated a moment where you see his knee do this where the knee the bottom part of the knee pops forward that's almost always an ACL because it's there's an instability to it where it just gives out and that was like the second round and turned out well he blew out both fucking knees but at the end of the fight both his knees were shot he's still throwing bomb yeah haymakers and just look nothing was bothering him I mean he's in there with the best guy in the light heavyweight division unquestionably ever and he got to a split decision on two blown out knees that's why I want to see a rematch with him I think he earned it I think that was considering how he hurt himself I that's the fight I want to see is the rematch between Santos and jump although George might be a heavyweight by the time he comes back yeah he's gonna be a long time is you know his knees been bolt the knees or reconstructed I mean he was walking with crazy crutches with both knees like embraces and shit he's fucked yeah and who knows if he's gonna come back well you know when you blew your knees out like that man that's no guarantee cuz your tear in the meniscus so all the the soft tissue that separates the two knees the two the two bones rather all that's been chewed up so they had to do a meniscectomy or whatever the fuck they called him minutes ago P what do they call that it's a house Kofi but what is the actual operation c35 dog oh yeah not sure I don't think he's that old he was a middleweight for a while yeah yeah David branch stopped him at middleweight guys guys beat him at middleweight I think was just training himself cutting too much weight but he's um he's a fucking dangerous puncher man that's for sure and a real good striker for that and he fought disciplined in that fight which was interesting he fought sneaky and disciplined yeah has anybody done that to Jones's legs before no I can't remember seeing anybody leg kick him that no well his luck it's devastating - I know yeah and John has those little tiny calves - his body is crazy it's almost like a cartoon right because he's got these big-ass feet and this big wide back with his calves that like my forearm it's weird his accuracy doesn't work the Marisa's by somebody's just won't junetta cold large ones no it's just genetics but listen it's a fucking for combat sport ya body because he's so long and he's so strong it's not only skinny and weak he's thin and ridiculously strong like when he tucked Daniel Cormier down everybody was like holy fuck he just took down one of the best wrestlers to ever compete in MMA and he did it in the first round yeah when both of them are fresh you know you're like wow John is strong you could see it when he gets a hold of guys he's the goat he's the greatest light heavyweight of all time and man maybe the greatest fighter of all time you know there's only the only guys that are close is in my mind it's Mighty Mouse is one of them fade oars another one but I think John has had better competition I think John's had the best competition yeah he has for everybody and Cormier and I wants to fight steep a but I a third fight with those go I would love to see Cormier in gone oh that's a fight that I would we're gonna happen never do it I don't want to see that I love DC I don't want to see him fight that guy I always thought DC would you know cuz cz is so good at getting in I always had a feeling he'd be able to take him down save it save all that shit that's this to me that is the scariest man in MMA is Francis he is yeah the scariest when he punched Alistair over him and Alistair Overeem was literally looking at the back of his heels his head snapped back so far he could see his feet it was terrifying it was also what he just did to jr. and to curtis blades okay after two losses game yeah it was like fuck yeah he fixed whatever it was that he needed to fix yeah well you know those guys just couldn't stand with them the question is like what steep a is that those guys aren't is first of all steep as an excellent wrestler he also was a world champion in the most accomplished world champion ever he's the first guy to ever defend the title well I think defended it three times or four times I think four and the fifth one is reversed four times yeah he's ste pays the most accomplished heavyweight champion of all time and now he's won the title for a second time and the way he beat DC in the third fight or the second fight rather with those left hooks to the body oh god damn those were nasty third or fourth round right and he again he was I think losing that fight just couldn't make it happen and DC was honest though he said that I liked the idea of punching him in the fit like he didn't want to just listen to his corner he felt too good to punch walking out on the first fight yeah but I've speculated that one of the reasons why he knocked him out in the first round in the first fight was two things one it was a beautiful punch where he set it up while he was pummeling and I don't think steep I saw it coming I think it was a perfectly placed punch he hit him on the job perfectly and also I think steep a was probably still a little hurt from that Francis and Ghana fight because Francis and Ghana and him went to war for five rounds and particularly in the first two rounds Francis hit steep a with some fucking bomb yeah steep a weathered a storm but it might have made him more susceptible to being knocked out because a couple of their shots yeah man when you get a fight where you get beat up like that even if you win he took some hard hard hard shots that takes something out of your sails man and especially you know to fight him just a few months later right after that big crazy fight with in Ghana like really a guy like that like steep a especially he's like 36 I think at his age you know you fight have a war like that with in gone you should have one of those a year maybe yeah and then for like six months you shouldn't do jack shit you should go in cryo chambers and fucking hyperbaric chambers and get massages and let your body heal up you you were in a car accident yeah you know you got run over by a truck and you survived what do you think of I'm looking forward to our to Sonya I kind of wanted to see Paula cross to get the fight but I I'm the fact that he's doing with Romero is still is still a great fight I'm happy it's you all Romero for two reasons one because Paul cost they can do in the future the Holocaust is only like twenty nine years old he's young guys like Adesanya and too stylistically I want to see I still want to see Paul Acosta I mean Paul Costa is a monster man he's he's a monster I'm really I mean especially after he beat yo L like that really interested in seeing him fight Israel but stylistically I'm interested in Yoel Romero vs Israel because of the wrestling because yo Elle's wrestling is crazy he's one of the most powerful guys that's ever fought in that division he's enormous for that division and he's so fuckin explode and he can take it credit and crazy shot I mean if you look at the two of them together yeah I mean is he is taller and longer and Yoel is just fucking jacked he's not even built like a real human his waist is this tiny thing his muscles are fucking preposterous when you see him you're like oh that's a comic book guy that's not a real person he's a comic book person he's 40 years old 41 years old he's 41 still jacked super super jacked and I think honestly he should have already been the champion I think he beat Robert Whittaker in the second fight my feeling is that he hurt him more he was more effective and there was two rounds that easily could have been ten eight rounds where he had Robert Whittaker fucking staggered and if that was the case he would've won the title if he was it a split decision I don't remember I don't know I don't remember you google Yoel Romero versus Robert Whittaker I don't know I mean split decisions are so crazy right it's like what if Thiago Santos is the UFC light heavyweight champion now because one judge says he should be two judges say he isn't split decisions are real weird I think there's not enough judges there should be at least five judges it probably should be ten and I think we should also have an online judging I think they should have that and maybe that they don't take it into consideration in term but but for us was this a year unanimous unanimous decision what by one point on each judges scorecard and I disagreed with that but you know that's okay very interesting yeah I'm looking forward to that I don't remember when the fight is but I'm looking forward to it yeah that's all when is that when is Izzy oil is that March in Vegas I think it's yes it yeah March is that I guess and what you think Aviva's in Brooklyn right yes you going to that I don't know it depends if I'm working that we take that weekend off Jimmy I got a bunch of dates I'm not now up so I may be I may be working I don't remember I'm super pumped for Dominic Rhea's and John Jones yes that is a dangerous fight for Jon Jones Dominic Reyes he is not getting enough credit he's 12 and oh he has a fucking a ruthless left hand he's super athletic and he's really he's really tall and long and he's a young guy he's 30 years old you know and John you know John has to take that guy really fucking seriously I did think if I remember correctly I remember thinking it was Damir won the fight I thought it was Tamir god I thought he should have gotten a decision over done Reyes yeah really close yeah look at that stats again the the Taylor tape Jamie look at the difference in the reach John Jones has an eighty three and a half eighty four and a half inch reach and then you look at Dominic Reyes is 77 that's interesting that's the width of the shoulders John is so long yeah you know you're measuring tip to tip like this and one thing that John excels at is keeping people at distance but he's fighting a guy that's his height that guy's just as long as him I mean not as wide obviously the reach is different in terms of the width of the shoulders but Dominick Cruz's footwork and movement is excellent as kicks or excellent he's got nasty power in his hands and he's got a lot of confidence man he's undefeated coming in at 12 I know that guy is a killer well he did the Chris Weidman I was like holy shit yeah I was a rougher to watch it's hard to watch was that am I crazy to think that Gustafson had that kind of reach - yes he did right he was close to Glaser - Jones - most guys Gustafson although he has fantastic combinations in excellent boxing does not have one punch power the way Dominic Reyes has right Dominic Reyes sets things up and when he moves in boom he drops things on you and dudes fold like when he fought OSP he knocked out OSP with no time in the fight it was basic like a couple of seconds to go in the fight he cracked OSP and they didn't give him the knockout which I don't understand he mean it was way worse than Alistair and Andros and strike I mean he he had OSP out he was gone and they they didn't stop the fight and I'm like I don't understand this this is like it was confusing to me because he walked away like it was over and it looked see if he could find that Dominic Reyes drops OSP who was waiting the fight at that point Dominic Reyes was but OSP gave him some trouble he gave him some trouble what I mean Dominic was definitely winning the fight but OSP had his moments definitely had his moments in and I've watched that fight about a month ago or so and when I was watching I was trying to find moments where I think John could capitalize that OSP couldn't but OSB is distressed very strong guy he's just a lot of guys struggle with him including John Jones John Jones struggled with OSP it's a powerhouse man yeah you can't fuck up with OSP you know he kikyo's guys he can kale people with one punch like he ko'd Shogun with one punch he killed Corey Anderson I think wasn't and I think that was John's first fight back yeah after a while he's taking that layoff and that was his first fight back after a suspension or he had been gone for a while and they had no one thought that I was choosing to go the distance I didn't he didn't go five and get the decision yep they did so here it is so here's Dominic Reyes what's this he's moving boom he dropped some look at that he's out look at that he's just lying there out and down a greatest moves off like that's it and they don't stop the fight and the referee stands over and lets him get back up to his feet in the bell rang and they didn't call it a knockout I'm like okay that's a knockout man you could you know you couldn't justify keeping that fight going but that's what I bet your Overeem wishes would have happened was if they were to let it just walk away 100% and that if listen if Dan murgh leotta and Dan did his job because Dan supposed to be the guy that calls the fight right I think he should have called the fight but Dan is supposed to be the guy that calls the fight not the fighter so when Dominic played it again when Dominick Kayo's him all he had to do was follow up with a couple strikes and then the fucking show's over watch this but it's beautiful footwork I love how he did it - so osp's moving because he's behind so he's trying to move forward and press and trying to catch him and Dominic's move in and OSB presses him and you know and he uses good footwork to avoid this - it catches that left kick which is osp's power side and as OSP is setting it up you see go southpaw again so he's looking for that left kick again there it is boom counter took step over bang left hand and then referees waiting for him to follow up so if he just jumped on him there and followed up instead of walking his hands up the buzzer may have gone off somewhere around then I don't know when the buzzer went off yeah it was like 20 seconds 21 seconds when he hit up yeah but Stern account Dan Burghley see if we can get some volume on that oh no it's a lot less than that yeah lot less right at the horn so he dropped him at the horn I still think they should have stopped it but I don't know whatever he won the fight but look he basically knocked him out with a second yeah you know but he's got a different fight in front of him this weekend with John Jones John Jones has such a history of success against the best fighters on the planet John finds a way to win he does man he finds a way and it's like that was the good thing about that Gustafson fight the first one it was such a boy if I remember right Jones really turned it on in rounds four and five like I thought Gustafson was ahead maybe two to one and then rounds four and five Jones won yeah again I don't know if that's a correct recollection but I remember being like fuck that's why he's a champion he won the final round five or sure and he wasn't even in shape he didn't train for that fight they said he just fucked off and was partying and having a good time he just thought he was under be unbeatable and he said something really interesting to me when he came in here he said he always gave himself an excuse so that like if he did lose he could always say well you know what at least I didn't train right like if I trained then I would have beat that guy but he was still beating people even though he wasn't training hard and then he started ramping it up and actually training hard and when he almost lost everything you know when he got arrested and all that shit that happened to him and he almost lost his career then when it came back he had much more of a sense of urgency because he realized like what a gift it really was yeah I'm happy he's back too and I honestly after that when I was out there with Matt and after they they told us that God man the fights not happening I thought like he's never gonna watch him fight again he'll never fight again I thought so too when he crashed in that lady's car and took off I was like oh my god he might go to jail and you know I just felt bad that he was doing that in the first place just all of it everything was wrong yeah there's too much partying but sometimes someone needs some sort of a giant scare a horrible series of events where you realize like oh I can't I can't do this anymore I gotta live my life in a better way yeah you have to almost have everything taken away from you but I believe the Dominic Reyes is the most dangerous fighter John Jones has faced since Daniel Cormier I think Dominic Reyes presents a very unique series of challenges first of all the length the undefeated record he's 12 and oh there's confidence that comes with undefeated fighters Adamic is extremely confident he's he's a believer in himself and that belief in himself has led him to stop guys like Chris Weidman to knock out OSP with one second to go he's got belief in his power he's got legit one punch knockout power he's got great footwork and movement he just had the opportunity to see John struggle with Thiago Santos he has a style he can mimic that kind of success that the chopping at the legs I think this is a dangerous fight for John but I also think John knows it's a dangerous fight for John and John is a champion a real champion the greatest champion the light heavyweight division has ever known unquestionably and I think he's gonna rise to the occasion I think we're gonna see the best John Jones I think John Jones needs a real threat to scare him and work him up and I don't know if Thiago Santos was that for him maybe Thiago Santos was a title defense a chance for him to fight but I don't think I don't think that's what he gets scared of I think John needs someone like a Dominic Reyes a real threat so that you see who he was in the second fight with Daniel Cormier and when he head kick DC and knocked him out the second fight with Gustav and Gustafson when he smashed down that's the real John Jones John Jones when he when he's pressed and I think that Dominic Reyes presents that kind of a problem and I think you're gonna see a fucking killer John Jones next weekend I think he's gonna be on fire I can't wait that's a week from Saturday yeah I can't we're so pumped at the moment I stopped feeling like this I'll stop calling fights but right now man I fucking love it there's always fights I want to see always fights I want to see there's always something I'm looking forward to there's never not two or three fights on the horizon that I want to see look at this Dana White says kymaro Oman vs. Jorge Maz with all planned for international fight week John ton yeah they just had a little shit the Super Bowl I thought I was wrong too I'm a fucking idiot I thought it was going to be Connor against MOSFET no that's how I thought the next fight was gonna be that's a great fight that's a great fight I think Connor really wants khabib and Dana's keep saying they're gonna try to make a rematch but I don't know why they're saying that when khabib has to fight Tony yes motherfucking Ferguson yeah Tony's the boogeyman that nicknamed el Cucuy that's a perfect nickname for that guy that guy's terrifying he never gets tired no he never gets tired everybody who fights it looks like they fell off a train it's it's crazy that's the fight everybody has wanted to see and again is that March or April cuz if kind of roll okay yeah that's still a ways away and then who knows how that FICO is how long it takes to get better it bent khabib doesn't want to have anything to do with Conor he's like fuck that dude and cubes dad said give him a hundred million dollars we'll fight him yeah yeah so I don't think you can make a hundred million dollars the only way it could make a hundred million dollars is if it gets the kind of numbers that Floyd Mayweather vs Conor got or if the UFC decides to bankroll it and gamble and give him a hundred million dollars I mean they might do that because here's one thing we have to take any consideration about khabib he's not just an enormous star in the United States he's a huge superstar in the muslim-held huge huge he's a super religious guy I mean he celebrates Ramadan he's you know that's he's very respectful this is one of the reasons why Conor's trash-talking all that was so infuriating to him he's a different guy man he's a man of virtue still drives a fucking Toyota he's worth millions and millions of dollars he's not he's not a flashy dude he's a fucking warrior and he doesn't want to have that kind of situation again in his eyes they fought once he smashed Conor and he got him he got him to tap I choked him and he's like good I did it fights over I did what I want to do fuck you you know and then when they were saying god we need to make a rematch no no no we had the fight I fucked him up he can suck my dick I'm gonna go do other things I know that's that's that's what he's thinking I think not the suck the dick part yeah yeah just yeah I think khabib versus tony is the toughest fight of khabib career I really believe that I think Tony Ferguson is a nightmare for anybody especially right now when you watch his fight with Anthony Pettis when you watch how he busted up Donald Cerrone I think Tony Ferguson is the scariest guy for anybody at 155 pounds to fight he doesn't get tired he fucking has bricks for hands and I had Josh Thompson in here the other day Josh was saying when could when Tony Ferguson grabs him he said you can't believe how big his hands are he's a gg wraps his hands around his wrist I couldn't get my hands-free he goes he's fuckin hands are so big and strong in his presence I don't know Halloween yeah he's a spooky dude there's something about Mikey ain't normal he's not a normal guy he's eccentric but in the good way yeah like especially when it comes to being a fighter he does all his own training he teaches him so like he's got all this crazy shit he does where he does like Wing Chun dummies and break dances there's a lot of shit that nobody on the video did you see the video he put out kind of a Tony Ferguson tribute workout video and the gyms very music Tony's a he's a unique individual there's no other Tony Ferguson there's no one that I could even think of that reminds me of Tony Ferguson no one he's so different you know that said khabib 'he's the fucking man I mean no one runs through people the way khabib does he smashes people he drags him to the ground he out wrestles him he pummels him he beats him down you know he's an undeniable unstoppable force the two of them together it's an epic fight but I would not be making any plans if I was Dana or if I was anybody else I would not be making any plans because khabib can win that fight yeah could be I mean a fortune yeah Tony can win that fight too either one of those guys I mean to be ten win that fight but it's not guaranteed Tony can win that fight too Ferguson can win that fight they both can win I just want the fight to happen this is is this the fourth or fifth time they get since terrible I just want the fight to happen I mean everybody knows you're telling me I'm just begging and pleading that these guys keep it together could only hope only hope and pray they keep it together it's a fucking amazing fight man amazing and Kaitlyn is fighting what is she fighting Valentina God but I'm not gonna do it till yeah she's a-comin for a jump yeah that's a dangerous fight that's a dangerous fight for her Valentina scare yes she is she's a killer that woman's a killer she has nasty power when she knocked out Jessica I would that head kick I'm like holy fuck yeah she's frightening I mean I want to see Kaitlyn cuz I know or so yeah it's hard to root for people when you when you've interviewed all the fighters you like all of them it's eating by rooting for someone you're kind of by proxy rooting against someone else yeah hard to root against someone who you've liked interview it's hard to be objective when you go all the like me well as I'm calling the fights it's very hard you know especially if it's someone like Donald fighting who's actually a good friend when I watch him fight you know what do he was a really hard one really hard was sharp cuz shop and I are tight yeah dude when he would fight was so hard for me because I knew he wouldn't shouldn't be fighting anymore he was getting knocked out I was like god damn this is it was painful like I couldn't sleep after the fights I'd be I'd be just thinking about it going this he's gotta stop gonna get hurt yeah he's getting hurt he was getting hurt he's getting knocked out and and he's getting knocked out at heavyweight you know with guys like Ben Rothwell putting those giant mitts on him and Travis Browne pummel him I'm like fuck you know it's just like this this is not good you know and I I'm so close with him he's you know he's one of my favorite people so me watching him getting beat up I was like fuck it was so hard to call his fights so hard yeah cuz you're watching somebody you care about get hurt yeah and I have to be excited you know when Travis is putting it on them I mean I have to treat it like I don't even like Brendan like we're not even friends I have to treat it like it's just a fight you know it's hard but it's also you know just hard personally not hard in the moment but hard on you after it's over it's like you know when you're watching someone fight that shouldn't be fighting anymore whether it's someone you're close to like I was close with Brendan or whether it's you know there's there's fighters that you know fight towards the end of the career like BJ Penn some of his last fights oh my god damn it you know he was a legend and in his prime he's like one of the greatest of all time guaranteeing like a real phenom I'm a freak and to see him just be a shell of himself or in the street fighting in the street yeah that was awful what really was off when Frankie Edgar beat the fuck out of him most like someone's gotta stop him he's gotta stop when Frankie got on top of him was just smashing and I was like someone's got someone's gotta stop this he can't do this anymore it's hard man you know it's it's the greatest thing those guys ever experienced in their life and something that you are you are I will never be able to appreciate we've never experienced that kind of glory yeah it's a it's a it must be a high that's indescribable I'll never feel it but it must be to be a world champion like a BJ Penn fuck man it's gotta be hard to chase that for the next 30 years trying to find anything it's like someone who stops doing stand-up on a lesser level what do you do to make you feel good or to bring you that nothing well the beautiful thing about stand-up is we don't have to stop no George Carlin died in a hotel room didn't having a heart attack but you did you're the hospital I'm fairly sure you went to the hospital okay but he died when he was staying in a hotel room yeah and on the road working yeah yeah he drove and that's like Ralphie no-tell room right or Jean died someone's house Pinet might have died in a hotel yeah I believe John Pinette died no tell Ronie I saw he had lost so much weight and I saw him I was like how you doing there like he was trying to get off all the stuff he was on yeah and then jump pills I heard he was yeah I didn't know I was calling like he knew I was sober so we talked briefly about it but it wasn't a long conversation when I was first starting out when I was an open mic or Pinet was one of the favorite guys at Nick's Comi stop in Boston and you know he was established when I was just starting out I remember watching him just murder one night he had this bit about going to an all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet and they're screaming at him you get out yeah yeah you eat too much those leaks you go now yeah yeah you go now yeah that was what it was very famous bit and he murdered we did a fucking Montreal one time it was a good gala and all of us were bombing Anthony Clark ate his dick I ate my dick nobody was doing well and this was a gala in Montreal and we're like that his crowd sucks and then fucking Pinet went on and blew a hole through the stage and you know like it was us he had so much power he was so good yeah he was so good he had so much power and I think the only thing that ever held back was his health you know I think if he was healthier well I you know he would have been able to kiss he had energy on stage like he was fuckin going yeah I was on stage and that's you know real Boston style that aggressive attack his style and just murders really funny yeah it's gotta be hard to when you're when you're fat and your whole thing is like I'm a big fat guy and there's so much material built around it and it's who you are right it's got to be scary to lose the weight oh yeah it is it is hard well you know Kevin James when he was young he had a different manager and we have the same manager now but he had a different manager and his manager literally told them if you lose weight you're losing roles like roles and TV right and I was like Luke don't fucking listen to that guy like what are you talking about you don't think you're gonna be funny of you're thinner the fuck outta you're funny dude yeah you're funny all the time like but they don't mind fuck you you know they wanted him to be the jolly fat guy and like there's money in the Jolly fat guy like do you want do you want this guy to stay alive you fucking asshole but you wonder too if you chain like I always want if I change the things I hate about myself or that I don't like about myself am i funny anymore nothing to talk about call me if you don't think so you're funny man but funny period it's not rational I think a crazy thought you have like what do I do without this well I'm very lucky I don't have that thought process but you can get away with it too you can get out of that thought process you don't need that that that thing if I if I do that will I be any good you're good you're a great joke writer you're a funny comic you kill you make me laugh hard you want a few guys like when I was in Austin I was doing some shit with on it remember that time we were working there and I came to see at the gun club I had a great time you made me happy it was fun you know it was fun sitting in the crowd and watching you kill it was great you're kind of comedy is my kind of comedy so like you know it was a treat I was like this is great so if you don't think that if you got healthy or something like that you wouldn't be out on it you're crazy but it's just that crazy thing that you think it's like they get not a rational thing if the tape that plays it's also a defense mechanism like your your brain is trying to trick you into not getting better because there's a lot of pressure and improving yourself that why junkies a lot of times fall back you know alcoholics fall back they fall back on it because there's comfort and failing because they've failed so many times before the pressure of not not 99 days you know drinking it can't believe it that happens with gamblers too with gamblers men oh there's the fucking rush that gambling habit good man I've been good I ain't playing the cards I ain't doing shit I've been jogging a lot and then one day you see them all fucking eyes wide crazy and looking like they're exhausted been playing cards all night and shirts untucked yeah talk to you the gambling one man I never got into that one gambling scares me that terrifies me because I know I would lose every show it's like sex it's like everything else it's like drugs or anything anything that's a compulsion where it becomes your main obsession more than positive things in your life yeah that's what are you willing to sacrifice for like because people think else with sex is not a dictate but it's like anything else what am I willing to give up to get it right and what am I willing to sacrifice or risk to engage in it yeah you want to risk your freedom are you willing to risk your whatever right there's a lot of things that addiction makes you do and yeah they're just not normal people behavior yeah it's not normal people behavior and you wonder like what is the root of those kinds of obsessions like what what evolutionary benefit is being obsessed with sex or being obsessed with gambling or being obsessed with drugs like what is it that makes people gravitate towards those things where just everything else seems so secondary and then now like I gotta get to the casino gotta get to that fucking casino I knew people like that especially for my pool hall days real gambling junkies that were always chasing that track yeah always trying to score playing the lotto and look in a gamble on games and cards and you know like RD Laing who talks about it I mean with RT the gambling thing was really similar to him to the drug thing you know the gambling the addiction to gambling like he just loved being in action come on what do we got and that was a thing a lot like the drug thing I can't do it with sports it just seems like such a fucking waste of money like I just can't put that kind of energy into hope-a come on two outs to go laughing and I can't make myself do it and I'm glad I can't because I know I would like it like rich Voss was a fucking horrible gambler so I kind of learned a lot from watching boss and how out of control and how obsessive he was and I'm like I know I would be it makes watching fights more fun I don't gamble on fights I used to I used to gamble on the old days of the UFC cuz nobody told me I couldn't I'm like I can't affect the the outcome sure I'm just calling the fight but then when I stopped Albury my partner on it I I would give him tips we'd sit down with the the card and I might fucking 89% man are you real my god yeah he winced and there was a few that would come out every now and then where I'd be like bet the fucking house you know there's a few with the the people that are making the odds they don't know you know they didn't know who and they knew Anderson Silva was good they didn't know he was that good that one I was like what is this I mean was it three to one a bit but what do you how much do you own push it all on the Brazilian push it all baby there's a this is always a few fights where a guy comes up from another organization and I'm like listen to me right now that guy is a motherfucking murderer you got to put all the money on that guy and then you know we were like one-time RB and I with me you know as a pic I think he was at 89 percent over a period of like a couple of years I have such a shit record of picking fights me and Matt used to do a thing at the end of our filter where hey let's say let's just try to guess the car I was fucking horrendous at it it's really hard to hard Ryszard it well with some fights you just you're just guessing it's some fights you're literally guessing he just like I don't know I don't know Tony Ferguson and khabib I'm guessing come it's hard to bet against khabib but it's hard to bet against Ferguson the last time Ferguson lost was when he got a broken arm versus Michael Johnson and he's run through world-class fighter after world-class fighter since then I think he's a fucking monster but I don't know I don't know who's gonna win that fight I mean it's really hard to bet against kabhi kabhi its undefeated 28 no smashes everybody yeah but Tony's got an interesting style he can fight off his back he fights on the ground he's not gonna try to get back up he's gonna attack off of his back everybody loses some time I mean most guys don't haier undefeated so the odds get what that's why I thought that one lossless Jones might have taken that pressure off him look at uh tied to a Vasa you know what was he was he I want to say ain't no one point and then he's lost three great fighter but it might get in your head a little bit there might be something that happens when you lose that first fight well ty you know Ty's fighting the best in the world you know at heavyweight and in heavy way you can't make any mistakes man those giant dudes big-ass fists come slamming on your head especially the in Ghana can't make any mistake that fight I'm so curious me too I would lean towards in Ghana but I don't know how much Rosen's trike can fight man he can fight he's nasty I want to see what it's like you know look I thought in Ghana had an edge over Derrick Lewis Derrick Lewis won that fight and I know that was in Ghana dealing with the worry after he had lost his DJ and he was really psychologically had an issue didn't fight his fight but Rosen strikes a different animal man Rosen strikes a different animal than Derrick Lewis because he's he's a real seasoned professional kickboxer I'm gonna taking God knew only because of what he's done since that lost those three I mean III thought blades actually stood a chance cuz he had that one fight where was I think a doctor stoppage in the second so like he's taking and got his punches before he maybe in his head a little but fucking ran through him Kane and jr. so I can't ever pick against in Ghana again until I lose again well he's better now than he's ever been before and I think the loss too steep a ultimately I know he struggled a little bit in the Derrick Lewis fight but I think the loss too steep a ultimately ultimately has made him a better fire yeah he just understands what it's like to lose he understands what it's like to face the best heavyweight on record ever in Steve Bay you know he went five rounds with the goat Steve pays the goat me is means that he's defending the title more than anybody that's ever done it in the history of the heavyweight division and having that kind of experience against a guy like Steve a I think is fuckin hugely valuable so I'm gonna train the next time I see well I will have trained I'm committing to it I mean committing for two years to Napa I'm committing that I'm going to do bourdain didn't start till he was 58 I know now you know I'm obsessed with it loved loved loved it loved it dude when I did his television show he and I were rolling around in the dirt I was showing him positions and I was like you got long arms you like Darcy's he's like yeah I go I got another move for you you know what the Japanese next time we're going all these in the grass like I'm like from now from here you got a turn and we're doing all this to heels like amis ass he loved it he loved it yeah it was it was amazing to see because I had known him before when he was drinking and smoking and it was fat and out of shape and taking statins because his high blood pressure his Colet his butt cholesterol blood pressure was statins for cholesterol right so what it is yeah his body was very unhealthy and the doctors gave him an options like look he's changed the way you eat or take these statins and he decided to take statins now because he loved drinking and eating and stuff but then he got obsessed with jiu-jitsu and he did he got off the medication and didn't eat it anymore lost all this weight look ripped you know it was interesting and I think a lot of people that have addictive personalities and he certainly did they can benefit from something that you're addicted to that's really good remember you saying that your mom used to say that to you you know replace it with something better she left me a message because I had talked about getting prostitutes on the radio so she quoted dr. Phil that's right and I made it one of my message on my second CD about go you meet some nice people but she was right I met nice people I felt better about myself when I went to the gym mother was right yeah she was right you just you know you got to replace one thing with the other the thing about going to the gym is sometimes you just go to the gym it's fucking boring and people quit they don't feel stimulated enough but if you take classes that's when it's fun yeah like you take yoga classes or kickboxing classes or someone's teaching you things then it becomes fun I just have two trainers like I like having a trainer because it makes me go I have to show up come on I'm fucking worthless that helps that helps classes are good too though because a bunch of people are doing it with you and like there's a bunch of people in there you struggling I like yoga because of that because we're all in it together you know we're all struggling together I've done some yoga but I just did I get a little bit I gotta know the patience for your breathing focus on your breathing my breathing sucks so I can't breathe deep I don't do it right yeah okay you nose fix homie I got to wrap this up oh great ma'am it's four o'clock listen man always a pleasure yes that we did this me too buddy a chance weekend can I ask people to watch the degenerates yeah on Netflix on season two and just go to my site I got a whole bunch o and the Irishman they asked me to plug the Irishman are you in the Irishman yes I haven't seen it yet yeah yeah I played Don Rickles oh shit do you really yeah yeah I got one scene ah I gotta watch that movie um Jim Norton on Instagram Jim Norton on Twitter Jim Norton calm you got it all right love you buddy I love you man thanks for has been here bye everybody [Music]
