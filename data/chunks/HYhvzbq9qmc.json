hello freak bitches so you've got a quash sex because the end and gluttony because those are reminders that we're just primates but meanwhile the depictions of God he's always ripped he's always ripped and he's always wearing a robe because he's modest he's reaching over and touching people as fingers go he's got giant traps yeah great yeah it's true God looks at as his son is looking great on the cross beaten to death yeah and he's got abs and really white for a guy for a guy was living in the Middle East 2,000 years ago put skins of wool yeah bullshit the the other possibility of a black planet Chuck D was right there you go that look at that God beautiful the dude on the left hiney little dick on the dude that's what I'm saying just not even I mean why even draw it you might as well make him an alien with no genitals people back then just had little or dicks is that possible it's possible but I've always just assumed that that's the modesty of the artist like it kind of changed the frame of the picture of God reaching down and touching man if man had a massive schlong just hanging down his leg yeah be distracting if you're just giant John Holmes hog but look how big the muscles are in these guys like these guys have to be fuckin CrossFitting all day as well as being divine I mean that guy on the left is doing a lot of fuckin weight lifting there's not a regular body that's a body if someone who's picking up heavy shit all day long it's got a skinny neck I bet he's never been choked maybe he's an act that's not guy who knows how to get out of a choke no little dick skinny neck but giant fucking biceps leave his forearms yeah it does a lot of there's a lot of weight lifting for sure Michelangelo's ceiling of the Sistine Chapel I look at the bizarre image of God being supported by cherubs so weird people are religion is fancy God's dick though notice that no he's got a robe on that other dummy yeah there's a little tiny dick God looks kind of I haven't really noticed this before but God on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel looks a bit like Meryl Streep like Meryl Streep with a beard cuz I think he's kind of got breasts and he's wearing like a nice white robe now to a guy like you Google Auto drive cars have to be the devil yes that's the devil it is what's gonna happen are we gonna we gonna not be able to drive our own cars in the future is that a possibility you know I've been thinking long and hard about that and it's been something that different people in my subculture have openly been concerned and discussing and there's many different takes on it but I think I'm pretty centered on it I think actually it's a positive thing in that cars like the Prius and stuff you know started the generation where people don't have an emotional relationship with their vehicle it's a tool it's literally like an app on your phone it gets you from A to B or even more dispassionately screw it you over around and you don't care you don't have that relationship so I think culturally as autonomous vehicles and all that continue to grow and evolve you are gonna see them eventually become predominant and I think we're going to start to see lobbying and federal support of that direction because there's a lot of rational reasons behind it that being said I think it will further strengthen the demand for the freaks and the geeks the outliers such as my brand because people are going to yearn for that relationship that attachment and I think there's always going to be people even the guy who's got the autonomous Mercedes that that's his commuter but on the weak is like no I mean this thing's got a it's called a manual transmission and there's there's there's petals by the way and there's three of those petals and you have to push that one down to get it to do but you know I think there there's that visceral relationship that is always going to be part of mankind and I'm not worried about if I was trying to start a big car company then I would be worried about this is difficult thought and there's a difficult subject but did you after this is all said and done a horrendous moment in your life many moments in your life did you try to figure out what would create a person like the guy who did that to you yeah you tried I did how much time yeah and I can tell you what created him he was taken out of an abusive home he was put into foster care and abused many more times and he was gone and he was gone there was guy and he was succumbed by the agony I was put through by him I survived somehow I made it so call me lucky I'm not I didn't become him I didn't become one I resisted I didn't I didn't pass along the poison maybe I did in some ways when I was difficult or whatever but mostly I didn't mostly when I'm mad I'm mad because it's like Hendricks cry of love it's a cry of love that I make it's a cry of love my act has been a cry of love it's like I don't want the innocent hurt anymore I don't want people victimized because of greed and cowardice and bullshit you know I don't want that and so I do what I can to stand up to it did were there moments where you wanted to talk to him what do you want I would love to talk to him I would love to talk to him to show him that I've been didn't become a monster like he was I would I would have I would have almost become an advocate for him in the sense that like well maybe let me know if they're mistreating you in here but he died in prison no one claimed his body and I don't know where his grave is if I knew his grave it was like go put fucking flowers on it not for him for me so the Solomon Asch conformity study was framed to the people coming into it as a visual perception experiment basically they'd be brought into a room with several people in a semi-circle and there'd be a person in the front with a card with four lines on it a sample line and then three other lines of different sizes okay let's say a three and simple line a three inch of four inch and a five inch but everyone is in on the experiment except the person in seat six and after going around twice giving the correct answer everyone competently starts giving the wrong same answer and the test is how many people will start to conform to giving the wrong sir even though they can see with their own eyes what the correct answer is and that's that he's been replicated thousands of times and the answer is 2/3 start giving the wrong answer even though they know intellectually that it's the wrong answer because it feels too uncomfortable to be in the room and is that the the the testimony they give when they are asked would they I'm sure assuming they interview these people absolutely yeah I say it's unconfident I even show a Dateline an old Dateline episode where they asked Anthony Pratt Canas is one of the foremost social psychologists to actually do the study so they could film it and this that they start out with this Asian woman who is the heroic resistor who gives the correct answer but she's grimacing as she's giving the wrong answer even though she knows it's the right answer but because of the social forces we are have mirror neurons we want to fit in to the people in the room it's just human nature without people survive it's exactly clan behaved exactly but it's hardwired so I showed that video that that experiment and I always like to ask people so tell me a something you could do if you were in that situation to scientifically reality test that situation scientifically reality test meaning meaning what you're in this room everyone's saying a five inch line is a three inch line let me ask you what would you do because you you have the data now okay you're you're a cult expert you would measure it right but you don't obviously understand what's going on right exactly but if you ask me prior to my induction into the Moonies that I understand the Asch conformity study or the power of B I would have said no I'm an individualist right I'm a nonconformist I had the bumper sticker question authority right I had the ponytail and you know that we're typically unique right in you rebel [Applause] [Music]
