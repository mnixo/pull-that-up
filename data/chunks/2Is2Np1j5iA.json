good I think I'm out of the woods you know I think I'm officially out of the woods you remember the old Kinnison bit about that it was he's like they say every bands kind of homosexual fantasy so I'm sitting around the house the other day going on my fantasies cuz if there's one in there I wanna know I want a fucking now yeah hey I didn't like the idea of a guy there was I think I was blown another guy stubble that's what Bob just like stubble there's a lot that you bother I don't want stubble anywhere near my precious well men are crazy and they're violent and they're also that way if they're gay straight men crazy and violent and straight straight men and gay men they're the only difference is one of them likes boys okay so the idea of that being hot and sexy a like getting blown by a crazy chimp you know I don't trust dudes some studly muscular dude who's sucking my dick exactly just rip it off and throw it away and go hey hey I like how you went a little crazy ha ha ha yeah a big muscular guy going hairy perfect hairy chest perfectly hairy not too much just trims it lets you grow out a little but doesn't get doesn't get unkempt yeah they that they're having a good time over there I gotta say the gays yeah the gays have a weird life because if it wasn't for the persecution it's pretty goddamn sweet if you think about it like if we all men and women okay and this is coming from a guy who has kids and loves having kids however there's a weirdness to having sex with men and women because it could possibly result in a child yeah that weirdness is eliminated with gay people it's just fucking the end there's no yang it's all yin you know or yang no Yin one of those whichever is a hard one there's that well there is a bit of a change in them there's there's a little bit of a bottom top issue yeah but there's what the issue isn't what a man wants versus what a woman wants they're both men so the weirdness like the trying to figure out women especially like when you're young one of the weirdest things is just the idea of trying to think the way a woman is you think the way a guy thinks you think everything's gonna be fine and like I remember when I was young and I just started dating when I was like a teenager I would talk to girls the way I would talk to my friends and they would get upset and they would think you're crazy and can't do it you can't change your language completely change your language change your approach change the way you know guys can fuck around with each other and we assume that we're gonna like laugh and fuck around the middle back and that's what we did we insult each other half-ass cos today you don't have that Irish fucking vengeance thing huh no I well if I did when I was young I eliminated it all with thinking and you know do you want recess do you argue do you argue with people in your head I don't allow myself to do any man that anymore I used to do that I used to that when I was a young man I used to if I was a young man I got an argument someone I would relive that argument like every day for like ten minutes for like a year maybe I'll come back to it a year later yes fucking guy shoulda told that fucking guy yes sir oh shit yeah well fuck you mister you have to like go through your notes like what was that gonna say to him oh yeah I was gonna say that I just talked about this on stage this is totally true when I was I guess I was like 26 I live I was living in Encino and I rented this house and had an orange tree in the front yard but I didn't pay my bills was very irresponsible so this guy came over I had to turn the power back on the guy came over to turn the power on and seem like a nice guy said hey man those oranges are delicious if you want one go grab one and he goes oh okay

he you know I mean he like knows what people want to hear about they want to hear about Rocky they want to hear about fucking they want to hear it so he's talking about he was directing the movie stayin alive oh uh yeah I remember that yeah he was in it was a Travolta movie that that Frank Stallone sang on the soundtrack is correct um so this is the yeah yes so Stallone said that he he goes he goes so I I called John up to the house for a meeting about to get that song play that song while the story's going he goes Frank Stallone this is the end I think it's called this is the end and I'm

first of all is fucking rude which is fucking make me laugh my head off and I was like that he hasn't forgotten that he that's his orange story find it yeah is that is that it's that it was fucking rude that Stallone or that Travolta Elvis well he's hanging on to some shit from the early 80s right one was staying alive that was 82 remember when he's walking down streets in New York City with a fucking fur coat on and I got bumps into him Travolta bumps and all like Stallone you really remember this movie now this is the wrong song is that it yeah what does it say it's called far from over

spinning around and in a perfect position and still only said that they were shooting Flashdance next door and he's like and we knew that that was gonna be the one John Travolta Mehta single-handedly made more men gay just from this music and from singing and dancing and getting people to dance he probably person that was probably his total overall goal which is to say nothing of his bathhouse
