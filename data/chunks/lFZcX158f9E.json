fight once who the fuck would sign up for that fight Tyson that's like fighting Jon Jones out of jail president enjoy that it's gonna be a motherfucker well also the amount of people that were paying attention to that because they felt like Mike Tyson got railroaded like that was a that was a questionable decision like what had happened to him trim the the lawyers sort of strategy for dealing with the case was that the girl should have known she should have no wishes going tell room yeah that she should have known but also she should have known because of the guy that Mike is like their strategy was to like make it look like he was just a bad guy look you should know he's like he's out there of Merkin dudes you know go watch the Marvis phrase your fight and expect to what do you think's gonna have when you get alone with that no I got that big ol dick room and that was essentially their strategy a lawyer strategy and that shit dis didn't work drugs like fuck that's like what this but the girl had apparently allegedly she had a false rape accusation already before the Tyson's what's her thing so it wasn't you know it was look man some of these people out in this wild world

a backpack problem since you've been picked up for proxy got arrested for prostitution when I don't know don't eat crackers with the crackers down I was this is great I got us out the other day I bet everybody thinks it was fighting so I was like pilla you got arrested yeah why I was fighting I have a whole story about it prostitution up well no it wasn't but it wasn't I was not trying to pick up prostitutes this is a story then you tell me what he was doing I have paid for sex now anybody knows me knows that I believe in it I just haven't done it I believe it will even and I think it really does exist it's not Santa Claus that's true and and I don't do it I have I don't do it in my adult years because I don't want to I don't I doesn't turn me on and for a lot of reasons I just want to be part of it but you're married yeah but even if I was married I wouldn't do it because I have an expensive you want someone to be attracted to you yes you don't know what it is yeah so know what I don't want to contribute to someone else's destruction there are a lot of reasons I have a philosophy behind it it doesn't matter but but um I come out of a Jimmie Burke's apartment it's late at night I am literally been on a plane and I just cook these two blonds are in a car and I look in and I go and they go hi and I go hi yeah what are you doing I go not much anyway I'm like hmm interesting yeah I figured milli they gotta know they look kinda hungry and they go you wanna have a good time not ago how much and they go how much you got I go I don't know five thousand dollars how's that sound like that's silly right right so they go sounds great we'll be right here I go okay I'm gonna go right to the bank machine and but you can't give my daughter again so I go to the vending machine things the other bank machine by the way to get them to cash out cash to get in a cab and go home guess what I go the bank Shane guess was waiting for me bunch of cops guess what those girls were cops it was a sting operation and they caught me and I looked the cops ago you guys are really gonna arrest me I said $5,000 guy goes yeah I know there's a problem you got caught up in the sweep we got to take in sat next to a guy who was dressed like a woman who was trying to pick up women and he was peeling his mitt he was so nervous he was peeling his nail polish off I spent two days in jail it was a lot of fun and I am you know yeah anyone was silent Hey thank God they were there to protect and serve thank you glass for John's for where I had to go to a class for uh you know whatever like for Joe John's for people that this is also story should be telling on stage right so you got you being a man a funny way to be huh well it's about the bingham an unbelievably but intricate prostitute someone can what come up to you and ask you if you want to have a good time and then when you respond to that but it's your status you know the cops were cool they were like bro I mean look for me by all means I get it the problem is you got caught up in the sweep you know they're like don't worry about it yeah it'll be knocked down our misdemeanor just hides a pain in the ass I know they were all cool I mean you know but yeah but you were in jail for two days that's not amiss to me and I had to make up a story when a girls go out next to you in a car and say shit like that you gotta know that they were parked it's like music video type shit that shit don't exist it does exist oh that's the problem you hear about in fucking penthouse letters well maybe this is the time what would you see did when I was getting married the next day or something my wedding would be over and now there's all kind of shit I just learned when girls go oh you want a party they're not talking about dancing to some tunes now I don't draw yeah I talk weird hats with rubber bands at the bottom yeah they're not talking to celebrate two times in Vegas I got I got had with a girl better just cute we're talking hanging out get get upstairs she and we starting dancing yup that she goes and I start moving she goes oh wait hold on hold on you have no idea how much fun this could be but nothing's free I was like oh you got me then another girl we were hanging dancing beautiful having a great kissy-kissy go to my room and she goes all the problems I have to go to work I go what what do you mean we didn't work we're almost like Meg she goes well it cost me a thousand dollars you know I'll lose a thousand Austinite if I don't know I was like you want a thousand dollars I kicked her out of my room you one hell of a game earth up I didn't I was like nah I did I really didn't I'd be like you know I'm just gonna grab we take check yeah of course she like no actually take credit card I didn't like the look she did it's not that that's not I didn't like the way she was trying to pull a fast one on me that is hilarious I was like yeah be careful these days these hoes ain't loyal it's tough out there it's out there for John you know I think the authorities of a John my real problem with all that is when you make something illegal it puts all this extra energy into something because you create consequences the consequences being you could go to jail crime you know all sorts of issues can happen it's a is it a it's a misdemeanor solicit prostitution right it's not a felony so yeah you can knock that carry a gun you can still vote but either way the idea so they're taking away your freedom and putting you in the system you also probably have to register some sort of a sex offender so now you know you don't you know no you do dates you do I've been in some dates in Calabasas for sure for sure you sell out a lot of sweet older man I mean it depends on what the fuck you're doing you know like what are you doing with the prostitute you get that figured out you're still making a fire from your job and big consequences and here's the point is in countries like Australia where they have legalized prostitution their divorce rate is way lower they they don't have like all this violent crime prostitution two individuals I don't need first of all they with violent crime they don't need John's okay they work in these places where they have security to get people tested when people walk through the door they know you know they take the right D sounds like the way to go we're gonna do it regardless it should be ruined it should be legal was leaving a fuck someone for free right which it is why isn't it legal to fuck someone for money what is different in particular if it's legal to give someone a massage for money why isn't it legal to stick to chicken is consensual and all free him free me be oh yeah to consensual adults and all my nerve and hands are there two consenting adults and all my nerve endings are in my anus and I want to relax and you I can't let the guy do you have a problem Jam his ring finger in my shitter strong lower back issue I do I can't have him Jam his ring finger and his middle finger right up my shitter leaf yeah double digits closed matter what that banana tree knocks deep
