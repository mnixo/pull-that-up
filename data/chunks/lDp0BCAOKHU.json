hello bitches no guy rule can bring guys over no guys and yeah sometimes you know it sounds like a sugar daddy thing I just stripper I used to date she had a sugar daddy and she would just buy him all the viola shit which is great cuz I don't have to buy it I got the point Michael you know what maybe he should start getting me some shit cuz I'm letting it go out he's trying to fuck her obviously sitting on like what I remember was a VCR I'm like go get me a VCR because I don't want to put up with this shit me won't she come on with a VCR it's like I need a VCR I'm like beautiful I actually went on a date with them in a limo and pretend that I was the guy friend and badmouth myself for an hour in front of this guy that boyfriend of hers like oh yeah he's a real dick oh my god and we went to a mall and I picked out like like 20 CDs he bought me and I think he bought me like I figure what's like a Walkman at the time or something like that I'm like yeah I'll take one and I was like sure you seemed a good dude just fucking bad - and the guys holding her hand and the limo and I'm just sitting there like the friend am I don't give a shit I'm getting CDs strong pimp move I tried to get a TV but it he wasn't going for it see a lot of these guys that rocket like this the reason why they have to is because of prostitution laws if prostitution was legal there's a lot of these older creepazoid dudes that are just out there trying to make it happen it's just tough action you know unless you're paying for it very tough to get someone to love you for who you are like if you have these really high standards and you're gross yeah but if you've got a ton of cash and prostitutions legal if they just made prostitution legal in America you'd have exactly the same amount of hoes okay exactly the same listen to me they're not gonna more people are not gonna be hosts hoes our hos already they're just they're doing it in weird ways and maybe it'd be better prostitution was legal so you found out exactly who the holy tax will pay exactly nothing wrong with it it's just sex is it okay to gate get a massage yes it's okay to pay someone to suck your dick it just is yes it should be you know and these guys shouldn't have to move these fucking girls they find cars it's rude by the guy friends VCRs -

worse really the shoulders rolls into his neck color is really interesting about hair - I'm telling you I hope you don't hope not necessarily that you mean him but just that you're in in your life you end up in the same room and just test my theory I honestly I couldn't look away well the moment if I did meet him the moment he gets Dickey I go I will grab your fucking hair and I will find out what's going on so you might want to shut the fuck up what are you gonna do beat me up right you gotta call security I better get your hair before security gets here I bet I get to your fucking hair dude Shh don't get Dickie with me just leave in this I'm in the later stages of my life or whatever where I'm at I don't have any patience for people like that I just don't have any desire I get it okay you know that's the reason why it's so successful you don't get to be a super fucking billionaire real estate mogul who has his name on every building the Trump Towers right you don't get that unless you have that sort of an attitude so I guess I understand stay there history put us up there once for the the up fronts and I open a little like minibar and his face was on the vodka for me I was like this feels like too much bro I feel like you got to draw a line somewhere or you just go for it can we just go for it if you just keep going like the further and deeper you go into the crazy ego swimming pool it becomes like warmer water cuz like it gets better is that it yeah the more you can be like the Walt Disney of total douche bag it felt like Disney World I couldn't escape his face he's got steaks Trump steaks look above that Jamie I think those are made from manatees I I asked him I asked him I met Joe I it was kind of I I don't know I'll be honest we beat John a bit of a chip on his shoulder was bit angry and stuff you know I mean he won't mind me telling you this because he he said I can don't beat me up and then he yeah he was a it was a bit like that and I seen him at k1 cuz I didn't k1 in Los Angeles a while ago I was talking to him I said you're miles better than what you come across on the Internet you're a much better person than what you act and I kind of stuck home with him he made me a friend on Facebook and then I contact him and said you know do you want me to work with you anyway yeah sure cool and then we got on he's so smart he picks things up so quickly he's so open to stuff we've done some really really cool stuff this I can experiment on Joe if that makes sense you know some things I want to try I dude him and he seems to work really well on him like can you give us an example like what do you mean like things you want to experiment right it's really strange but but it's like I to think about because I'm English that's Galahad the knight Sir Galahad you know the the knights of the round table yes you know King Arthur and Joe didn't want to get injured because it was gonna fight I think you've robbed eart something or other he was fought on glory and then he was gonna fight on Bellator against Melvin my mother okay and he waited to come out unscathed so we persuaded his unconscious mind to of armor like Sir Galahad so I talked in hypnosis about the archetype of Knights of the knights of the round table and he was Sir Galahad not literally obviously but you know so he had armor so he didn't can't so he'd come out on one injured right you know and it was I'm not saying it's gonna work for everything you know like it you know slightly bullets and stuff like that you know to me but it was just it was that I getting his mindset into that into that sort of the way of thinking
