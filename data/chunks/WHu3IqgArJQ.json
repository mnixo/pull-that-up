hahaha hello freak bitches so soon as you have that you don't have any data so if you don't have any data then you gotta go how you banning people for this like Ronda Rousey fucking went off today we watched a little I watched that clip she went off and dropped the mic after it was over yeah and one of those that she said that I totally agree with about marijuana she said this in the past too it's an invasion of privacy is what it is you're invading someone's privacy just like the fact that if you're if you work for a company and the company decides to test you and you you work all week you do a great job you work hard and then Friday's tits five o'clock baby it's over you want to smoke a joint your home you worked all day you want to watch The Walking Dead you want to put your feet up and you want to get high you can't you fucking can't because they own you they own you they own your flesh they literally own your mind when you're not there because everyone knows that marijuana is not psychoactive permanently it's not like you smoke a joint on Friday and then you show up on Monday morning you're still high as fuck and your high for the rest of your life that's not the case so if you if you if you smoke pot you will be tested four or five weeks from now you will still test positive if you don't smoke any pot if you you get high right now and then four weeks from now they give you a urinalysis tests depending on what they're looking for if they're just trying to trace metabolites you can still test positive in four weeks that's fucking insane so is it simply a control things the power thing it's a power thing these people government people their government people that like to be able to tell people what to do that's my concern though is if it's a power thing how deep is it how many levels does it go to how many judges are friends will not miss should find out yeah well they probably already on the case but ultimately I hope they're on the case ultimately anonymous Catholic public outcry look this is a tyranny these are a few people that are deciding which is again we're not talking about steroids here we're just talking about pot yeah it just doesn't make sense and we're also talking about a guy who passed to world anti-doping agency tests those are the most trick fucking tests in the world of sports he passed two of those and failed a quest I I think its quest again I apologize for i'm wrong but the bottom line is the tests were not the test that you need when you're taking away a guys fucking livelihood and you're finding him for 165 thousand dollars out of a $500,000 purse which by the way he has to pay his managers he has to pay taxes he has to be all these different things when you make 500 grand you don't make 500 grand course because you have a manager the manager has ten percent you have you might have an agent the agent gets a piece you might have a lawyer you might have a business manager you might have you have to pay taxes you have training expense a training partners yes well you mean you have to be very strict and nick is notoriously disciplined with his diet I mean he's eats all organic food he's mostly vegan except I think eat some fish he doesn't need any land animals and he does this based on the effect on his body because he's an extreme endurance athlete he does a lot of triathlons and he does a lot of running he swam back from forth from Alcatraz twice he's a motherfucker dude he takes care of his body and if he's smoking pot that should tell you the pots not bad for your body it's real simple but he's not cheating he's not doing steroids he's not doing anything that gives him an unfair advantage he's working hard he's tough as shit and he fucking fight smart and these assholes they stole his ability to entertain people and he's one of the most popular guys in the fucking sport when he came back and fought Anderson Silva the pay-per-view was through the roof and why was that well partly because when people want to see what Anderson Silva would look like after he came back from a leg injury this horrific leg break but also it's because he's fighting Nick Diaz you know Nick Diaz gonna talk shit to him like he did like he got in his face is like what bitch what bitch like nobody ever done that to Anderson sale before he laid down on the ground like he was making a sleepy face like look I'm sleeping you're born the fuck out of me and jump back up to his feet he humiliated Anderson completely fucked with his head inside that cage that's what people paid for and what he is experiencing right now it's a bunch of assholes taking away his ability to compete taking away his ability to thrill people and what he does best this guy's worked for more fucking decade as a professional mixed martial arts fighter more than who knows how many years before that training and learning how to fight all that's taken away by some assholes we're moving back to Spain and you know are you oh yeah really I am yeah I mean this was always a temporary visit this was a slow nomadic trip through North America cortland and then Spain well it was I mean first it was vancouver right canada and then we're in nicaragua for the winter then we went back to vancouver then we came to LA for the winters when you know you and I Duncan started doing the shrimp parade and all that i was living in Topanga but it's always like a slow move and then we went to Portland for a year and a half and now we're going to go back to Barcelona and what made you decide to go back yeah well we were always planning to go back and we we sort of flirted with may be staying for a while but my wife's a doctor and for her to get a license in the US would mean like going back to medical school essentially what she's not going to do right and she really likes working she hasn't worked in four years while we've been traveling so you know that's an issue like if she's going to continue practicing but also just we really like Spain you know I've lived in Spain most of my life I've lived in Barcelona longer than I've lived anywhere else really and what is it about Barcelona that's more appealing in America you know when I first got to Spain I felt I traveled a lot and I was actually on my way somewhere else but I got robbed and you know I ended up hanging out and the way Spanish people see life is much closer to the way I see life and so even though I was raised in America I never felt like this country never really made sense to me how so well like what we're just talking about like work materialism materialism you know it's all about money Spanish people that you know the expression is we work to live we don't live to work right you know they're know like Spanish cars there's no cup holder if you want do you want to get a drink pull over in a cafe and get a drink there no to go tops you want a coffee go to a cafe they're really yeah it's like someone should tell them about cups it lids on them the fuck is wrong with those babes it's crazy uncivilized even fucking cave people um sac hubs you know even though Spain is you know officially a Catholic country there's so much more chilled out about sex about a sex outside of marriage like yeah whatever just don't tell me about it that's the sort of normal way to deal with it um women no you look I've lived in Spain 23 years or something right I get accustomed when I see a beautiful woman I look at her and she knows I'm looking at her and she appreciates it and she smiles and I smile and everybody's happy come to America look at a woman like that your fucking rapist right you know I raping me have you heard that microaggressions I mean fuck your micro aggression I don't want to hear if you're not a fucking dwarf I don't want to hear about microaggressions give me a break in this country is just nuts man and like it and I feel bad because they're there i love people here I've got great friends here there are a lot of things I love about it like you know workwise it's the best place to be but um lifewise fuck i love Spain you go out to lunch with a friend it's probably gonna go till five or six o'clock did everybody just hangs out ya know like restaurants right I'm sitting in a restaurant and we're talking the waiter first of all the waiters gonna come four times and ask you know how is everything how are you Oh how's your day going fuck you get away I'm truck trying to talk to my friend here right then then they'll come and say are you still working on that this isn't work is this fucking lunch am i working on that get out of here drive me crazy tix twenty percent I go to Portland I fucking you know by across on and a cup of coffee there's a big tip jar or I run my credit card good ten percent fifteen percent what you just handed me a fucking bag and a cup I'm supposed to give you fifteen percent extra wood that's because your boss is too fucking cheap to pay you a decent wage
