three-two-one fortune what's up good to see you Oh our first date do you have a special coming on just the craziest time ever for specials yeah it's like one after another after another it really is like I can't remember ever in the history of comedy there's been this many specials released no and like just killers every week yeah speaking special pull up that the video of Tom Segura's a new special there's a it's on Netflix is a joke on Instagram has a copy of it because he's doing English and Spanish right yeah this one's just English yeah he's gonna do one in Spanish he got a yeah people don't know that Tom Segura is fluent in espanol he and his mom on this part yeah no in Spanish yeah that's amazing yeah it's funny because he looks so white he looks like a white bro I don't know sometimes Mexicans talk shit around him and he'll just look at them and then say so that it's Spanish and they're like oh no play the video they fucked him he let some lady put make I never let them put makeup on me never and they always bring someone and this is why this is why they they made him out and by the way they color corrected it because it was way worse than that before oh really he told me was way worse than that I go what the fuck bro it was like I know I go dude you can't let them do that to you it looks like he kissed Christina and then went out to do the shit he looks like a clown he looks like a clown from the 1930s like when in black and white movies like look at that that's crazy they put lipstick on him they put lipstick on them and they put white makeup all over his face I had that once where cuz you really can't tell what you're putting it on someone made me look like a the marionette doll we have big red rosy cheeks and I it was I was hosting an award show and the whole speech is on line it's so crazy because you let someone dictate what your image is gonna be someone that really has no business doing that they just do makeup and when someone does makeup they want to do makeup oh yeah I do yeah but like like that this Posterous put some chapstick on that's dick that's it look that's what he looks like this is what I always say like these I'm the only one in the UFC broadcast that doesn't put makeup on - yeah and I'm like we're getting we're talking to people that are getting their heads punched in ok literally you want to you and Jay check who's the former straw weight champion and she had a fight with this woman Zhang Wei Lee who is the straw weight champion yeah from China it's crazy epic like one of the best fights in history at the end of it you want his head I saw them is so slow like a Frankenstein forehead yeah imagine me yeah look at her forehead now imagine me with makeup on standing mixer that would be ridiculous right I refuse look at my foundation like we're just gonna cut down on the shine who is a fuck if I'm shiny yeah literally no one cares yeah she's got a double forehead now it's a double triple for us I back is it back down I don't know she doesn't follow up she hasn't taken that's what she looks like normally beautiful lady she's so tough yeah that lady is as tough as human beings can possibly be yeah cuz she like never even flinched her fucking foreheads twice the size of normal she didn't even flinch kept throwing bombs it was amazing yeah epic how long did it go five rounds five twenty five whole minutes of chaos like and it was even the whole fight the whole fight was like back and forth and back and forth back and forth it was amazing I repeat are you guys super bummed out when people like throw one punch and the person Falls exciting - yeah it's exciting yeah the sport is crazy you know it can happen that way we're like there's a recent fight where Donald Cerrone fought Conor McGregor and Conor in the clinch Conor McGregor slammed his shoulder yeah into Donald's nose and broke his nose so they came out of clinch like seconds into the fight his nose his bleeding and then he got a head kicked and he got pummeled and stop the fight in 40 seconds oh my god yeah and everybody was bummed out because there was this huge pay-per-view event that's big deal but that's part of what's crazy about this sport is it it's the fighting in either boxing kickboxing or MMA it's the only sport where you can end it early right like football goes the distance yes for hours yeah you baseball goes all the innings it's like that's just how it goes yeah but fighting can end in 10 seconds we had fights that have ended I think well who's got the record now it was Duane Ludwig but not spell took it I think right that's right mom's fidelity has like eight seconds but it was like it's not really I don't even think they gave it eight I think they said it's five I think it's great what do you do at the live event everyone's just like all right 12 fights Oh gotcha so that was just one fight there's many many many many fights [Laughter] yeah I'm not live it on TV you should go I'll get crazy yeah it's pretty wild it looks so fun yeah no one's ever invited me and I'm not you know proactive enough to be like now you've been invited bring bring your boy Tom papa I will yeah he needs to go - yeah I'm just bread has he I wonder if he's been one helping yes or like I don't think so probably not maybe Jamie it seems like maybe for anything Hamill goes a lot he's kind of animals but gundog oh really a gang of them yeah yeah so so you do that morning show at Tom I do enjoy it I love it except for the 5:30 wake up that's horse shit to do with every conflict it comes to the show is like why are you waking up this early cuz we're all doing spot so late yeah well it's this is the new world do you don't have to do that anymore yeah just a whole idea of like it has to be on it a day yeah I don't know that's just how they set it up you know seven to nine every morning Monday through Thursday were doing it for Netflix yep they have a new Sirius XM channel that's 493 so yeah a few numbers they tell you how many people listen they give you no information what you have no no idea we have no idea we only know that people are listening because they call in that's no you know just talking to Mike do you hope that way it'd be kind of fun to do a show where no one could record it and you know it just goes out live and there's no recording it at all like that's what radio used to be right radio used to be I mean that's one of the fun things about the Howard Stern Show back in the day cuz it was so crazy before radio but it was you were hearing this and this is the only time you were ever gonna hear it oh yeah I remember one his show was on the E channel mm-hmm that's right I was like him god she had a show yeah rest in peace poor Anna she was one of the first like I mean if Instagram was around she would been one of the first has to house like a reality celebrity yes everyone was following her life and her lawyer right yeah Howard his name's James Howard Marshall oh yeah I think it is Howard Stern yeah yeah different Howard Stern's that's right yeah and that was post-divorce after her husband well not old yeah yeah yeah that was the best cash-in ever her with him it was the best cash-in ever yeah he was like 95 years old in a wheelchair and she was a fucking bombshell yeah cuz I know her his kids were like fighting yeah they were trying to keep the money from her but look it deals a deal that's always a bummer though if you were the kid of that guy well I had a whole bit about it yeah he doesn't know it I go he's a billionaire right like 95 years old he made a billion dollars from scratch and my joke was you know like don't you think he's a tad crafty what's he done give a fuck you don't have any time left but like hit two kids or however many kids he has they don't need a billion dollars the size of his ears that's one weird thing it's all people their ears keep growing yeah I'm looking forward to a giant ass shrink yeah I think I might get my ears reduced when I hit 150 oh really that's what my plan is plans about 150 160 Medina operating table get my ears reduced I'm just trying to I'm just trying to make it to 50/50 that's it that's all you wanted I was like I want more I want more do you know we had a guy on yesterday talking about the crown of a house man it's nerve-racking yeah not good well cuz you know you don't really know what's coming yeah well here's the thing there's a whole bunch of other diseases that we discussed too like chronic wasting disease and there's a lot of shit that's on the table that could happen if yeah there's all these pandemics that are possible well are there like because certain things are melting certain diseases that are sort of like being uncovered from that's a theory yeah yeah I don't know yeah there's a theory that the permafrost is gonna release wine when it gets melted it's gonna release some ancient bacteria that we don't have an immunity to Oh possible it's all possible there's something that happens with any any time you have overpopulation and one of the things that happens is nature starts to try to course-correct yeah nature's like there's too many there's too many let's do something and it happens with the animals they get diseases and a bunch of them die off and it you know it happens with people as well I mean it's not a coincidence that this disease came out of China which is heavily overpopulated which has these he was talking to us and depth about these wet markets that they have in China where they have all these animals all right now yeah there are like laying around what is it he said it was like chickens and what was above the chickens with civets any chickens were over those they were like dropping their shit on them or something and there was civets below right yeah there's a slurry combination with that right and he was saying like with crossover diseases that's like a test tube like you're literally doing experiments right he's like the perfect test tube perfect environment for creating a new disease yeah as we've seen this wasn't this started from bad yes yeah people are eating bats over there bro-bro I'm with sweet-and-sour chicken chicken sounds good right now bat bats is which we when you're starving to death I mean yeah that's true yeah certain places well China again has a fucking billion people and when you see the stuff that they're eating over there there was a salamander that they had that was like I mean like the size of your thigh bone yeah it was huge enormous fucking salamander they're holding it down with a meat cleaver hack up the salamander they're like it's all food look at that bat oh that's gnarly and they got the wing spread to let you know it's a good one that's a big that's a big bat juicy bat a lot of meat there do we have to watch oh yeah bats that big I don't believe we do like they were always like yeah big in America if we had bats that big weed whack them that's enough that's enough the Stone Age I always old bat tonight we had swim meets look at those fucking things oh look at the mouths on those things open that up what is that what the fuck is those a little werewolves that is crazy bro what are the mouths on those thing yeah I was like sharp teeth that's what the wings two chopped off no I guess I've never seen a bat up close like no arm or something whoa do I think you're right find out what that is I need to know those huge clearly they're popular cuz that's a lot of vets for so what is it delicious imagine we're missing out oh those are bats those are bats they are bats oh god what do they do with the wing look at the fucking teeth on those monsters imagine if they were like the size of a horse flying around yeah get the teeth on those fuckers it doesn't even look real yeah I like how when they die their mouths are all abilities are still trying to bite you mm-hmm just to let you know you got to be hungry as fuck yeah where's that hot you said that was in Indonesia I would have said yeah I just typed in bats in the wet market mmm my dog threw up in my car today and I caught it in a coffee cup Oh wow that's impressive well he was sitting in the front seat and sometimes he gets sick especially when he just eats yeah and I saw that yeah they start moving and I just put a coffee cup right right where his mouth is while I was driving yeah I have a little dog who will just throw up out of nowhere give you warning well when you're driving you know I mean fortunate things he's sitting right next to me in the front seat yeah he's he's adorable isn't he that's a good dog he's a sweetie pie mmm-hmm gotta love that dog he say I've never had a golden retriever before yeah that's my first one but with the best dogs is like a classic dog yeah they're so sweet yeah they just want love they want family just wants to hang out with you and give you kisses and go and walk my dogs are like six and a half what are they what do you have well one's a Pomeranian a little guy little yappy they are but we got one that is not yappy really yeah lucky we had the jackpot and then the other ones a like terrier Chihuahua makes she's like eight pounds oh they guard our house well they're good guards in that they let you know something's up someone's out there they're part yeah I got a gun yeah that's probably the best way because I want a gun no you want I don't know I I wanna I would want to learn how to use it first oh for sure yeah because I don't want to just have one I would but I've been the shooting ranges for sure I mean I'm from North Carolina that's part of you know the culture ya know and I went to uh randomly Luke bronze house and shotguns for the first time he's buddies with my buddy cam hands yeah they're but they're real close I've never met he's a cool dude I won heard he's the best I went to a charity event they had at their house and it's so nice but he had skeet shooting I didn't get to do that but then they had some like rifle shooting and that's the way to live and then the long rifle yeah [Music] here's what's crazy though my partner she acted like oh what's this it's a rifle hmm how do you use one of these and then there's a five target she goes bow bow bow bow it's every single one of them and I was like what she sandbag him she's lying she's lying to me yeah that bitch - practicing while you're at work sandbag man she's got a Punisher t-shirt yeah but you know yeah I don't want to learn the gun safety how to use it better that's pretty straightforward though I mean they could teach you that in just a few minutes yeah long as you're paying attention yeah just you know make sure the Safety's on make sure there's nothing in the chamber keep your finger off the trigger whatever pointed at somebody even when it's not loaded mm-hmm that's where when you hear about people doing really stupid things it's just that's what it is it's just not respecting gun safety right yeah yeah it was a some Instagrammer - tick tock or some guy shot it's fucking computing right identity - guy and twitch did a live twitch moron he thought it was unloaded and he pulled the trigger on his computer and his computer it's like videotaping him and then disappear yeah yeah my uh my brothers in the military so he's here it is let's watch this guy [Laughter] no did they remove it Oh times when you hit that video to play on mm-hmm Twitter it doesn't play the first time do you mean when it's embedded in someone's yeah yeah when it's embedded in second oh man unavailable you cannot see this this is true it's too real man what we don't want you to know that that happens oh he shot is his Yeti Cup zoda's oh he did right through his computer screen I think like ricocheted hmm yeah what happens is someone like that they take their gun away they should it's held against the law I think right cuz you like to fire it on accident or something like that or if I can get fine to think yeah you can't get fined if you shoot up intruder if you shoot a person you're alright like in Texas you can kind of you could shoot I remember story where a guy was repoing a guy's car a guy hadn't made payments on his truck I believe and the repo guy was opening up the door and you know with the slim jim and getting into his car and the guy who reached out the window with a rifle and shot the guy in his driveway yeah and they didn't charge him they really yeah they said someone was breaking into your car as far as you knew right your property okay but I mean he killed this fucking repo guy yeah but yeah but then you hear stories about people getting sued like if they shoot somebody that was trying to breaking in their house that's in other states in other states yeah you can get sued I mean which is crazy so I'm gonna breaking into your house yeah you're kind of you know backs against the wall well you're supposed to assume that they're not gonna hurt you when they've already made the commitment to enter your home yeah I force they're already doing something insanely risky yeah the idea that you're supposed to somehow or another like warn them as much as you can and that I mean I I mean I kind of get it like what if it's a teenage kid that doesn't know any better stupid and they're with their friends and they think it's funny to rob someone's house hmm I don't know it's just it's just it's it's both ways right it's like it's horrible that people have guns and they can just shoot you and kill you but it's also horrible if you can't have a gun to protect yourself from someone who wants to kill you right both things are horrible right no one had guns the world be a way better place but then we'd be at the mercy of like giant people that's just be the king of the world that's what it was before people figured out sticks and Spears and rocks and stuff like the biggest humans just fucking rancette and we just like let him yeah well then someone figured out a bowing out motherfucker when he gets close it's problem yeah I'm gonna start running shit I like bow and arrows yeah that's fun you shot that yeah yeah not what not the gun the old cross the old school see that's what a crossbow is it's a shitty gun yes not really a bow like people call it a bow come on that's not a bow that's true it's got a trigger you got a scope yeah that Walking Dead shows ridiculous he'd never runs out of never he never gets a pass through he's on so soft you could walk up to him stab him in the skull your knife will go through their skull no problem yeah by stabbing someone in the skull that shit's hard I have never it bounces off it's not easy to just try it just it's not easy to you have to be really fucking strong and you got to hit a good spot the other his soft spot like attempt yeah but like he just goes right through them with that stupid arrow but then it never passes through right never goes right through and he just grabs it even have like broad heads on he's got field tips those those tips on his arrow that look a little tiny they'll make a pencil hole like what that is is for practice right practice tips on his fucking arrows he doesn't even have broad heads there's some holes in these plot a lot of that show I used to love I love that show for the first few seasons yeah it was a great show for like the first two or three season I watched it up until Rick the main guy left I didn't get that far and a little spoiler alert yeah when they killed Glenn I was like I'm done the day they killed Alan that was a bummer but some way they did it to what you guys got no respect to your main character smashing his head and I saw the dude who played Glenn I saw him out somewhere I want to say it was out of UFC he might have been out of UFC in the crowd he was somewhere in the crowd but he looked depressed Oh like he was bummed out about getting killed though I mean if you imagine if you're on a show and you're one of the big players on the show I mean he was one of the main guys yeah and one of the more interesting guys and he's on this show for five six years or whatever it was and then one day they just baseball bat you this new guy yeah baseball bats you so not only does this new guy on the show who's getting all the heat but now he baseball bats you to death yeah and then you're just out there in public and probably people are like mocking you on social media if you're not smart you read that shit and that was at the height of its success now I know you can't wait till Rick leaves yeah well once Rick left it's dead right I mean I mean there's kept it going but I was on it now uh the chick with the sword still there she was but she's leaving soon didn't like what do you got yeah cuz his son's gone to Rick son Carl Carl Carl Carl huh yeah uh my buddy Josh McDermitt is on there yes yeah Josh Eugene yeah Josh was on the podcast like early on the show early and we're like dude I can't believe you're on the fucking walking down I knew Josh from way back in the day Josh worked with me at the Tempe improv he was doing an open mic contest I think on Thursday on Wednesday or Thursday and then we went we got in there early because we had to do radio back then and Josh was on stage he was really funny and I said hey you want to work with us all week yeah he's like fuck yeah and so he worked with us all week oh really good guy and now ah fuck dude no he started I mean that's this thing he just stand up was he still doing stand-up not much not much that sucks yeah he because he has to be in Atlanta so much but he's like a play he can play Bill Hicks in a movie oh yeah I've never do a Bill Hicks movie especially with that haircut the game perfect well he he kind of went off the radar a little bit cuz you know that the fans are so fanatical that that he it was just like a lot on Instagram and social media and it was too much and he just went off all that stuff oh did he really mmm-hmm that's not good once you're done though yeah doing the fucking improv again yeah I need that shit society's gonna be an actor now yeah he might cuz he really loves acting but I remember he couldn't tell anybody that he had gotten the show yeah I remember and suddenly he had a mullet yeah really I mean the mullet cool he kind of did but not really it's really just a punchline he owns he owns it he lives it he is it he embodies it yeah is um is but they didn't with Josh's mullet isn't it um the hair is like glued on though right it's like some crazy wig thing they might put some pieces but he grew it out and dyed it dark Wow and then he then I was at a wedding with him when the announcement came out him I don't know about the top part yeah I think they glue a lot in there some extension he can he can rock that shit look at the upper left-hand corner that one will you curse was that oh that's good that's like hot dude from the eighties you know like a dude who just pulls up in a Trans Am that's right you're like that's that's who I want to be yeah one of those gold chains were those people Heather what do they call what's those flat gold chains called you know I'm talking about I want to say like Heather cutters midlife crisis a gold chain guy would show with a gold chain and you're like are you what are you up to some dudes can pull it off black guys can pull it off yeah yeah there's something about white dudes with more than one gold chain yeah really atrocious I hear it's like when guys out of nowhere start wearing a bunch of rings mm-hmm those big pewter or silver ears yeah you can't do that you used to do that and you don't need more or you just don't yeah you can't just start it or thumb ring right out of nowhere yeah yeah that's going on with yeah yeah when I first met Bourdain the other thumb ring oh really yeah I'm like what you doing man I'm too old for this thing and he abandoned it yeah he abandoned it after a while maybe you thought it would catch on like oh I wear a thumb ring I think it was kind of cool for a little bit you know you don't see him much no I don't see a thumb ring it is weird that we decide like this for this finger is fine yeah this fingers fine this is an acceptable ring finger yeah but the thumb is like what are you doing stupid or a pinkie ring what do you want bro were you in the Mafia Joey Diaz has a American Indian pinkie ring that he wears didn't know why wears it cuz he can't get it off he put it on any gained weight and it stuck [Music] I'm sure it'll come off I'm just I'm just joking but I think I always wonder if that's what it is cuz I always seen with that fucking ring on it now that everybody's having to wash your hands maybe it'll slip oh no it doesn't help Michael osterholm saying it's not it's not gonna help you Oh airborne Terrance in the air people breathing coughing around people if you're close to people yeah and they're breathing on you you're gonna get it touches if you touch things you're gonna get it too though I'm maybe it'll help a little bit if you wash your hands a lot yeah it's it's you know crowded places is where it's gonna be an issue Pearl Jam apparently just canceled all their gigs I saw that up until late April and they were playing Madison motherfuckin Square Garden they canceled that yeah they canceled some big yeah I know my court mentors starting and I'm like really everybody's tour yeah I've been on these text threads with all my friends and like you cancel many dates like what are you hearing I think everybody's kind of wait like comic wise no one's canceled don't think like I haven't seen comics canceling so maybe everybody's kind of waiting to see because it's almost like a ripple effect once one goes you're like oh right you feel like you have to like South by Southwest kind of felt like is how it gonna have a ripple effect they they're saying Coachella is gonna be October did you see Elon Musk's tweet on Coachella they should postpone a Coachella until it stops sucking I've actually a response no pull it up I've never been a good show because he was there with a car no that's Jaden Smith fluke model over the crowd wait Will Smith son plays at Coachella yeah well that makes a LAN right that was good you know that Elon Musk is reading his tweets how does he have time he's he has 16 different jobs he made all the time how was it possible they're tweeting memes right but how is it possible maybe he hires people to do all the stuff now you know very hands-on when the model 3 production was underway he was telling me that he was working 16 hours a day dang yeah he was in in the factory 16 hours a day maybe he gives himself a little bit of a break and then he has on tweet storms his tweets have cost him millions of dollars and he's still tweeting he didn't care he doesn't give up but that's how much money when when you have a lot of money you're like whatever yeah I'm just tweeting bitch yeah when the when he wrote Tesla stock selling private at 420 are secured at 420 like as a joke oh he's got like weird 420 jokes but he doesn't even smoke weed like when he smoked weed on my podcast he barely inhaled oh yeah I don't think you really smokes weed but he is thanks a lot of 4/20 jokes anybody smokes weed on the sneak tip and just didn't want to in front of everybody so he didn't want to be rude because those offerings just took a little bit yeah he's legal he's too smart it's uncomfortable yeah cuz I wouldn't know what with imagine talking irregular idiots like when he's sitting down there talking like me I felt bad talking to me I felt bad you know but you know a lot of stuff oh I know yeah well you're well-read yeah I know a lot of dumb shit that's good have like a car like a peripheral knowledge a cursory understanding of and your things it seemed like you remember a lot of things that you do read yeah that's where it's tricky that's where it appears that I'm intelligent I just have a good man want yeah I'll just remember things cuz I'll read things and it'll go you know I'll be like oh yeah read that look I couldn't tell you what I read like a year later it's gone that happens to me too though yeah I only have a memory for things that I think are interesting if I think something's interesting I remember it but if my wife tells me some shit I don't give a fuck I forget it five minutes after she told me did you hear so say it again what are you talking about I just talked to you about that I'm but I'm like when just like 5 minutes ago my I blocked you out yeah I do that same thing like what she's like you never listen I'm like no I know I heard it worries over memorizing scripts though for emerita short-term memories yeah I'll remember I can learn a script super quick oh really do the lines and then it's gone forever well I feel like I stand ups we have to have a memory yeah I mean you're on stage for a fucking hour mm-hmm remember my sets because it's so much repetition some people bring notes onstage but I always find that to be a bit distraction like yeah like like Bill Maher brings a fucking like concert pianists like really stands things yeah yeah and he like looks at the notes Oh like like if you're inquired yeah music a music stand yeah yeah yeah like a podium I have brought notes on stage and I'm as soon as I start talking I put it down and never look at it you know cuz it feels odd to like stop the rhythm right to be like let me see what my notes are you're like just go with it and see what happens well if you have new shit you're working on then I understand then if like I've seen guys go on stage and they have new shit yeah sometimes people go on stage with notes just to let you know they're working on new stuff it's almost like you it lessens your expectation right like yeah I just flat out tell them I'm on a journey peter out sometimes that's how you find the punchline yeah I did a show Saturday night I go I don't have a punch line to this you guys have any suggestions like three dudes raise their hand well you could I was like oh you took me literally okay well what do you got garbage I never know you never know never know yeah I'm doing that show tonight at the store stand up on the spot have you ever done that mm-hmm it's Jeremiah Watkins show he's asked me but I should do it yeah well used to be called thunderpussy which is a way better name and it actually is something that I used to do at the end of my show the end of my shows I used to do a Q&A and I stole that from Jerry Seinfeld all right before I ever did comedy I was like 19 I took my girlfriend to see Jerry Seinfeld at the Paradise in Boston yeah and at the end of the show he gets requests from the audience they they raise their hand is paradise is a small theater I want to say maybe 300 400 people it was cool intimate place to see Jerry and did he know these questions we did not say nope okay they just like we that we want to find out yeah so he did like an hour and up and then afterwards he he actually says thank you very much thank you very much and then he says I'm gonna take some questions from the crowd you know if you have any questions okay God and then some guy says how do you feel about the big digs there's this big thing going on in Boston when they were digging tunnels and he went on this whole like impromptu improvised rant yeah big dig and then someone yelled out something about something you did it for a while it's like that is a great way to come up material yeah particularly the end of your show so I did that for a while mm-hmm but then it got to be do draggy like you never know when to end it right I do an hour stand I'm an hour that nonsense torturing these poor fucks well because sometimes than that you can find some real gold and then other songs it's just like like getting crowd work you like where do you work and it's something laying really and where do you know how do you write fortune all right I go to the computer and write it all out that's what's up knuckles boom came out some people like all right on stage of it no I would find punchlines on stage but I have to know where I'm going good for you but uh but I was a journalist for seven years we really yeah I was an entertainment journalist no kidding it was my like day job while I was pursuing comedy at night how did you get that good very random I was thick I was the student speaker at my college graduation and this actress was the commencement speaker and she hired me to come out to LA and be her assistant and her neighbor wrote for like the LA Daily News and she's like I heard you're a good writer from your speech from in college I was like yeah yeah it would simply go well just like do you want to write for me cover events and stuff and it'll be in the LA Daily News I was like 23 it was like yeah sure why not so I just like became a journalist I had to just like learn how to do it was gonna like um like movie premieres or like the Grammys Oscars Emmys I talked to celebrities on the phone and would write stories it wasn't like gossip it was more like what are you working on tell me about you know the project and what do you do next and what was the like word and so and so so I was like getting to learn all this stuff about the business and were you trying to make them funny or you just like just laying it out just laying it out laying out the you know the interview and what they said and and then that job led to a syndicated column so I was writing it so it became full Tom for the next six years yeah so I wrote all day from like 9:00 to like 9:00 to 6:00 no shit I would do events at night and then I started like doing comedy like two years into that Wow so you would write all day and then do comedy at night so while you were writing would you say oh this could be funny and then like set it aside yeah well I always was like requesting to like go to like funny movies like I knew I could interview comedians or go to like Sarah Sarah Sarah Silverman had a show on Comedy Central's like oh can I go to set an interview all the comics so I was like gathering knowledge that way knowing that I love comedy but I didn't I was never that person like I'll do comedy cuz you know I'm like brand-new and stand-up but it was more of just like it taught me the skill of just getting to the story faster mmm like what what's the interesting part of this interview what's the interesting part of this story and getting to that help me you know just be a better writer yeah that's a great skill to have when you craft in bits I never knew when I started stand-up that it would be so much writing like I hadn't you know obviously now I'm gonna stand up I'm like duh you have to have material but going into it you just don't realize the content that you need to create it there's a big mistake that many comics make where they do just write on stage and then they have these sort of rambling intros to a bit or a bit maybe they have something there but yeah they they don't sit down in front of the computer for hours you just try to pick it apart oh yeah I try to find the best way to do it right but if they did that they would cut down on the process of creating that bit you can get to the end like some guys can get to some guys just like they're just great at just figuring out how to shorten things up and get to the point really good but some people are not and they get comfortable with kind of half right and then they stick to that form through the entire bit and you'll see the bit like hey man that bit would be so much better if you chopped out like the half of the world yeah for sure yeah and I mean I'm I'm definitely more of a storyteller so that's why I like to sit down and write it because I'm not doing setup punchline setup punchline I'm telling a story but I'm trying to make it funny on the way there and so for me I have to write cuz I have to see what it looks like because I'm like that said it's really bland right what like one word can I put in there that just like oh I see it now I see what that is you know yeah instead of just being like you know a ball you know you're finding something more unique about it I tell people there's four steps to creating material and you could just do one all right the one you can do is you just do it on stage right you just fuck around on stage and you will come up with an act or you can write in front of your computer or in front of a notebook and then you go onstage you improvise on stage and then you listen to your sets right those are the steps those are all the steps so you can fuck off on the other three and just go onstage yeah if you're a good comic and you can figure out how to develop an act that way but I really think you're doing yourself a disservice yeah and comics come up with this bullshit like oh I write on stage like I do too I sit down and there's some of my best punch lines have come from sitting in front of the fucking computer yeah cuz you're pushing yourself to you're like this this is not good what you know don't stare at my computer for an hour until until I find like even if it's one sentence right right that makes it better valuable you a hundred sets and never change your bit yeah but you could have like one you know our session in front of a computer we like oh oh yeah because if you're just alone with nothing else and no distractions and you can look at the stuff like it just makes sense that you with focus and time you you can create better yeah this makes sense so you can look at it better yeah that's what I was doing when I was prepping for this Netflix special I was I wrote I wrote it all out was like 18 pages something like that and then I was caught I was always I was going onstage and working it out taping it listening to it and then constantly moving this paragraph maybe this it was all all all of the work was done at the computer like moving it to where it needed to be do you use a program or anything to move stuff around no I just I work I use word yeah that's fine um there's a program called Scrivener have you ever heard of it I like it a lot because what I do is I'll put all of the subjects on the left column right and then when you click on each one it'll be the whole bit oh that's cool I don't write in it a ride in word or I write in I used to write in something called write room but that was when I was riding on a Mac yeah and the problems was a Mac's their laptop keyboards oh no you were saying shit something you discovered thank God yeah Lenovo ThinkPad that one yeah there's so much better I mean you make way less errors first of all they're curved yeah the keys are curved so your fingers fit into them and also there's a lot of key travel yeah this is like 1.7 millimeters - I think their maximum wants to point two millimeters and the minimum is 1.5 1.5 is probably cuz the low is you really want to go because any time you get around one it's just not enough key travel an apple everything has to look beautiful and everything has to be designed it's all about that sleek design minimal horseshit because you've made a tool that doesn't work as well right it's flat keys they're not concave you know they have that beautiful C shape you know that lenovo has so your fingers like you know which key are hitting there's no errors you don't fuck up as much yeah I did the old school uh my mom made me take keyboarding in high school so I had to learn how to do things so the keyboard is important yeah it's variable Y a you should try a think pad I'm telling you yes shit yeah I was so much better and you get over the windows thing here it's like Windows sucks it doesn't suck anymore and Windows 10 does not suck yeah it's easy it doesn't fuck up it sucks when it has to update that shit takes a long time right but that happens on the Mac dude yeah but the type on it is a dream it's so much easier well especially if you're spending so much time riding on something yeah if you're just like surfing then then that's like yeah I see like whatever I have this ThinkPad x1 carbon and fucking weighs nothing yeah weighs like a couple of which is nice to take like on the road well the Apple wants to make aluminum laptops yeah old beefs that I have over there yeah it's 17 it's heavy then you have that big old power strip yeah but that I could fuck somebody up with are they trying to mug me that's true you have a bag with a 17 inch laptop in that's like a bomb yeah but that's actually the reason why I have that one because the key travel was different back then that key travel is actually pretty good on that yeah the keys are a little curved but once they started trying to make them thinner and lighter that's what I loved because I have the air yeah so it's like my little fat fingers and then change something recently where it's like I'm writing words and it's changing it for me in yeah but to like the wrong ones totally wrong I think you might that's not it's yeah it's been weird like there's some update that was weird lately in Microsoft Word I think so yeah unless I'm thinking about my phone it could be my fault yeah the phone does that with me it's like I think you meant to say just like the craziest words that no one's everyone is really yeah well I mean the classic ducking oh yeah who's ducking at some point they need to embrace that people are saying fucking well why don't they have like a way you can click on it and say learn like man old people don't want you suggesting fucking right but or you know hardcore Christians or something that but if you're a person who the fuck all the time preference you should be able to autocorrect - fuck yeah like it says that once you used to know ya should be like alright this is a standard word what if Android does it the same way Oh wonder if Android corrects like that to my partner of the Android yeah they're so funny with partner why don't you say my girl my girl a woman I don't know it why is it part partners always you guys in business thankful is that what it is I don't know what I think because we couldn't get married I mean we're not married we're engaged but I think because we will couldn't get married for so long it was like they couldn't say wife her husband right so the word okay partner it is weird right like wife and husband and all his words yeah that just standard word so we just use over and over again my wife my girl is like that it's like your girlfriend for a long time it's your fiancee for a long time his wife when did BAE come along when the BAE when did they come along seems like it's real recent isn't like three or four years ago yeah these fucking kids on Instagram probably came up with it my bad with her kids yeah it's just a partner's weird a friend of mine used it and he was talking about his wife mm-hmm it's like my partner and I we died with your partner what yeah it's like people who are progressive they try to use words that like gay and lesbian people use the right word and they try to use it like almost as like they're an ally yeah my partner your partner yes your wife that lady you're married to I shut the fuck up I find the word fiance weird it is weird so is she is my fiancee we've been engaged for over two years but it's weird to be like this is my fiancee yeah it's like it almost seems like more pretentious it is a little bit right it's like shit-or-get-off-the-pot bro yeah what are you doing we are getting married but we're like just not neither of us are planners you should be able to say it the week before the wedding yeah my fiance and I the week before that mm-hmm other than that stop saying it no so if you come up with a better word for me good thing about fiance is those gender-neutral mm-hmm right it's boy girl to everybody right yeah this just spelled differently but no one really cares about that where was I reading in some country they have a marriage contract that lasts a certain amount of time what fuck was that I was like wow that's interesting like like a five-year contract with a with an ability renew and oh and so if it's not working out yeah that's like a lease on a car you just get that piece of shit back that's not mad for some people because great for some Anna Nicole Smith's husband would have loved that yeah you know let's take a lease try it out yeah it'd save you a lot in divorce fees and write all that because this is I don't know it's weird it's like in a case like the Anna Nicole Smith bit or the Nicole Smith situation like that kind of situation is weird when one person has the money and you could tell the other person is only with them for the money right and they're trying to talk them into signing a contract and then they'll eventually leave them like I knew this lady she was really hot her boyfriend was really not and we all knew what was coming right and the guy had money and he got married yeah I got married and she took the house she took everything oh she left him oh yeah yeah we knew she was gonna how long did she stay in it just dating in a couple of years just enough to get the cheese ash just it was it was ugly for all involved yeah a chicken on the outside we're like that poor pass but you can't like say anything your friend cuz then your friends like what's wrong with me why would she don't want to be with me for me well I wasn't tight enough with him okay yeah he was just a casual friend yeah he's a nice guy but but it was like the writing was on the wall oh yeah the moment I saw the two I was like oh you got money yes I see what's up and she was just what you got yeah she was looking around for other dick too it was just one thing man to always looking for the next but but it is a possibility that's the thing it's like peanut prostitutes illegal but being a gold diggers fun right like you should go to jail being a gold it was a difference it's the line is not that far apart very close yeah like do you remember Donald sterling the guy who owned the Clippers the only hot girlfriend she recorded I'm saying straight to shit yeah that was a perfect example yeah girl was clearly a gold digger disgustin yeah he was disgusting and she was hot and then he had a cell right yeah they made him sell the team had a whole bit about it because it's really funny what he said was he goes I don't care if you fucked these guys just don't take pictures with him ya see everybody like it was a virtue signaling opportunity for everybody to make sure that everyone knew that they were not racist and that they abour racism right which is wonderful right but what what he said was pretty reasonable he said I don't care if you fuck these guys just don't take pictures with them yeah that's his girlfriend so imagine if he said it the other way I don't care if you take pictures with him just don't fuck him right that would be reasonable right so he's giving her a way better deal she's allowed to fuck them yeah take pictures if magic if he said it the other way everybody'd be like well that's reasonable yeah he said you know just take pictures all day but don't fuck them that would be like a standard thing that someone would ask of a spouse I mean most spouses don't want you fuck another most some of them do yeah that's where it gets really weird right the people that want you to fuck other people they know open stuff you take pictures even worse like rocks those guys those guys that want guys to fuck their girl oh yeah because there is like what mask is there something like that nothing there their cock holds that's what it's called that's the that's the real term but the the origin of the term this is a cock hold and the origin of the term is like a man who knows his wife is fucking other guys I know they're approves of it or or likes the feeling of shame right there's some men that like the feeling of shame and humiliation to run this world weird how does take all types of people to run this world oh that people have so there's so many different kinds of people when it comes to like sex stuff people are all over the all over the spectrum yeah Ferraris people have to dress up like mascot yeah there's a lot of CEOs that like to hire dominatrix tell them what to do and I'm on the ball is the only person that will like talk to them like that they like it they like guys - or they like women to spit on them and stuff yeah piss on them and and just treat them like shit I'll tell you this surgeon once I'll piss on your feels like I'm gonna just be in pain for the next two hours nothing that works that's what they say someone - they just poured they poured vinegar on it I'm like you don't have an ointment like what you have to go straight to pissing on my foot not much they can do I just pulled the things out I got to pull them out we were snorkeling and then we you know we've got near this reef and I want to put my feet down catch a little break and I just went right onto a sea urchin well I tried I attempted to surf in Hawaii and I couldn't even get my board past the break and so it kept pumping back and I got so tired of just like I had no upper body strength so I just I stood up and immediately like stood on the sea urchin yeah those fuckers rough yeah they don't wanna get eaten because they're delicious have you ever had surgeons never so good it looks like an orange oh that's that orange yeah I never had it because it looks weird it does look but it's quite delicious and the textures not it's a little mushy okay but I don't texture doesn't bother me texture bothers me I can't eat certain foods really like strawberries seeds oh really the Tokyo tea seeds like the feeling of white what about Chinese the same because it's mushy and seeds oh you're a weirdo I'm a weirdo I think I'm just coming up with excuses not to eat fruit well you mentally I'm telling myself keep away from seeds yeah you okay with oranges I like oranges yeah what about when you find a seed to get mad it's different because it's not like that hard I don't know some of the hard crunchy thing I don't like same was like um raspberries okay raspberry seeds are a little odd yeah they're a little odd but love the flavor of strawberries so you do about it I just think someone peel your strawberries don't super baller and flying around in private jets get your toes done just peel your strawberries why do a bitch yeah no good no have any problems yeah I get it though I eat a lot of crazy shit though yeah yeah I don't have any problem so it's your very healthy guy pretty healthy mm-hmm thank you good for ya do you have any aspirations to be healthy uh do you want to one day I mean I've been trying to be better I just lost I lost 40 pounds that's awesome yeah thank you I mean it's more like 32 now that's good um but you know it's just it's a start I mean it always fluctuates but I think once I got with my fiancee she she's very skinny partner yeah my partner she's very skinny and she comes from a healthy family did she ever like bitch you crushing me well she she she just like you know we were like in love you know what like ten course meals azam whoo you know you're just like living the high life watching Netflix you drink yeah but we both just like we got engaged and saw our engagement photos really oh shit bullshit like there's no joy in looking at our engagement photos were both like horrified so it like was the catalyst we did that whole thirty thing you know that is what's that it's like for 30 days it's an elimination diet it's like no sugar dirt no dairy no gluten soy yeah all that stuff no alcohol and it it really like made me for the first time start reading labels I certainly didn't like what all the chemicals are in foods and it's basically eating whole foods like meat and vegetables basically for a month and how'd it go almost 20 pounds diverse realm that's amazing kept it off and then did another round like six months later lost another like 20 18 20 and I kept it off for a while and it's like over the holidays like seven pounds or so creep back the holiday creep yeah but at least I'm like we're trying to go hiking together cuz I just come from a family that come from from North Carolina we love fried food my families were big folks and I just never really learned that nutrition thing you know we don't have a lot of money and we're poor all that you know the worst foods for your like a dollar yeah it's not amazing the poor people were fat in this country yeah this is the only time in history where poor people are overweight mm-hmm in the past it was I mean look at photos from like the 1920s when people are poor yeah it's something John yeah try not to starve to death they just need food yeah so you know it's like when you don't have a lot of money you do tend to go to like the fast food places the food that's not good for you so I'm almost like having to retrain myself and my brain as an adult and it seems like backwards like you can eat pretty good at fast food if you if you're smart yeah like if you like you can get like three egg mcmuffins and just take away the bread mm-hmm and just eat the ham and the end the egg is actually good it's not bad it's actually good yeah yeah I mean it's a bullshit egg so really the yellow of the yolk looks like you're yellow like I buy these organic eggs I used to have chickens with the Coyotes kill them all oh yeah my brother has chickens the same thing my um my yolks you still look like orange yeah get them from the chickens that I raised cuz I'd let them roam around but that's also how they got whacked actually lost a bunch of them that way and then we lost more of them because they broke into the chicken coop but I buy them now from this organic company that lets their chickens free-range and they're dark dark healthy yolks yeah I don't get that from McDonald's unfortunately no but you still get eggs which are good for you which is not bad for you yeah you can you can be pretty good yeah I think where I get messed up is the road yeah it's hard for me to like really maintain that I need structure I need like I want you know every day we're gonna hike we're gonna do this we're gonna eat at home yeah as soon as I start on the road it's like oh you know well we got a taste this delicacy from I don't know Detroit right well I was actually after shows is a real problem for everybody because you're tired yeah when you're tired you make the worst food choices for sure give me cake cake for breakfast yeah there's one of my favorite restaurants ever is in Montreal it's called Joe beef I've heard I've ever I've never been all the comics love that place damn it's good and the guys Fred and David have been in here before the podcast before they're great I was introduced to them by Bourdain it's a good steak house right they have everything okay it's a French restaurant oh that's a spectacular food yeah it's the first time I ever ate horse ooh I had worse in Switzerland by accident it was bovine gnarly give that texture man it tasted like a raw hamburger patty oh well it was probably tartare it was probably yeah but I didn't order that I ordered a hammer so you thought you were getting the hamburger and they gave you raw horse meat yep Wow like my dog in the car yeah it is interesting what we would choose to eat what we choose not to eat I went down a homesteading rabbit hole last night for whatever reason you know sometimes I go on his YouTube brow it holder the last night I spent an hour watching videos of people who raised all of their own food and the homes dead okay and this one guy was talking about rabbits and he's raises rabbits and he has these rabbits in hutches yeah these hutches and and then they they keep them and and eat them yeah and he was like two rabbits will give you 600 pounds of meat a year really yes two rabbits yeah as they fuck so much and they make so many rabbit babies yeah keep doing it and then you mix them up and make them fuck them and they all fuck each other and they make more rabbits and then you keep feeding those rabbits and the other thing that he was saying was the rabbit poop is like the best fertilizer on earth it's amazing fertilizer and you scatter the rabbit poop and also the birds will actively peck at the rabbit poop and they will turn the rabbit poop they'll they actually turn the soil for ya they fold it into the soil for you yeah crazy these people living off the land right well this guy was living off the land he seemed a little odd usually he always are yeah when they're off the grid and there's home schooling his children you know the whole deal yeah like Jesus is coming back and we does we're gonna give him rabbit meat let's everybody got a bunker Jesus is coming back don't listen those people at school they don't know shit I know those little kids they like try to like you know intertwine with other kids at some point and you're just like oh poor kids your home school that's a rough spot for kids if they've been homeschooled and then one day they get out in the real world well you just need to socialize them right listen if you are a homeschool good for you I understand some people you know you could end up getting a much better education if you're a good home school teacher but socialize your kids that was harm I knew this one kid that was socialized and his dad he's taken to jiu-jitsu and he was pretty talented like pre talented jujitsu kid but he was just so socially awkward for someone his age yeah whereas other kids like I want to say like 16 17 at the time other 16 17 year old kids who would come to class they would be like kids they'd be having a good time trying to learn like wow that's cool but they they were used to being around people right this kid was like the whole the wild world yeah here in the world and his jiu-jitsu class news he seemed like little shell-shocked to be around large groups of people whereas kids that go to school you're used to being around large groups of people I'm right there's a very valuable socializing aspect to school mm-hmm absolutely I mean most people don't even learn anything in college you just learn how to like a cool person to hang out with right well they learn so not everybody some people well they do learn but some people also learn how to push buttons they learn how to get people to like you right you learn you know how to get people to think you're virtuous you know how to be for the right causes and how to shame people that are for the wrong causes and how to try to yeah there's a lot of that going on in college too but that's also part of being a young person right right you're young you have these ideals and you're trying to enforce them on other people you think you know it's when I go do College shows now I'm like oh you guys are so young yeah I can't believe it I still do college shows like here in there it's once in a blue moon they're they're hard you know those kids like they don't they don't know how to take things like they don't get the joke sometimes yeah very literal where you're like hey that I was being sarcastic yeah you're not allowed to yeah you shouldn't do that yeah yeah they're like 80% people they're not 100% people I've been schooled sometimes really you shouldn't say that kids in the clutter in the crowd it was a while ago but you know yeah you're just like alright I'm not getting paid enough I had a kid came up to me once and say tell me that something was anti-semitic and this was the it was like someone said do you know any was like one of those fun it was like little auditorium not a big crowds way back in the day right yeah and someone said do you know any jokes jokes like good jokes I said okay I gonna know one two Jews walk into a bar they buy it that's it uh-huh and that joke was very anti-semitic why because Jewish people are good at business they're successful that's not anti-semitic this yeah bro Jewish that means they're good at buying stuff right good at good at running businesses yeah that's that may be a stereotype right but it's a positive stereotype right it's a successful stereotype it's like black guys with big dicks right right yeah to say that it may be stereotypical yes stereotype but it's a positive no one's been like yo Joe yeah don'ts they have a big day Italian grandmas are good cooks oh my god you racist well yeah no that's that's usually a fact yeah usually more people where that is true yeah not it's a stereotype yeah but it's a positive stereotype there's a difference between something that's discriminatory like it's mean right of course something is just fun yeah you know and college kids don't get that yet inside I had this conversation with the kid you know he like felt like boy he was gonna tell me you know he came up to me to let me know like you know he this is again this is the 90s yeah I was like how was it how was it possibly into semantics yeah and he didn't have an is baffled he thought he could just say it and I'd be like oh my god I'm sorry I didn't know I offended you and you did and then he was gonna leave I'm like think about what the joke is I'm saying they buy the bar yeah how is that bad in any way but that's half a college shows you're explaining you're taking up top just explaining the joke I just old but that one in particular is so ridiculous yeah because there's nothing negative up about it at all it's the simplest joke of all time two Jews walk in a bar they buy it right it's not even that funny it's like but I don't know any jokes I don't know any jokes get out of here the fuck out of here yeah tell me what you talked about Oh God I talk about life I've had fucking comedian like older comedians in particular say that so what kind of shit do you talk about on stage but I talk about the hierarchies and how we can just mental them and separate people I don't I don't know I want to talk about I talk about life yeah I see or you'll meet somebody for five minutes like you can talk about me if you want what do i I don't know you people the thing I'm gonna talk about them on stage hey fuckface yeah yeah ain't interested I'm like I'm on in my own crazy life silly family yeah I'm good and your nonsense your nonsense but I could yeah I came up at the the store that's where I first learned to stand up really and it whoa what you're just start 2007 Wow that's the year left I know that was the whole controversy and yeah I wasn't there that night but it was all the talk obviously and uh yeah sorry 2007 in the belly room and uh just you know that's one like no one was coming to shows you be empty they're like giving me like 130 spots the one thing that I felt bad about I felt like damn what if that shit place goes under mm-hmm you know after I bolted yeah I'm talk shit about them right because yeah it was a it was like just a different town like now every shows sold out and that crazy yeah but back then it was like I was like performing like for drunk dudes well 2014 is when it all turned back around mm-hmm what did make it turn back around just like oh you guys coming back yeah for sure yeah yeah and then talking about it talking about I think podcasts helped when I started back again it was pretty good yeah it wasn't as good as it is now now it's now it's great saying yes now but but creatively it was really good back then I saw roast battle for the first time and I remember being there I'm going wow these people are fucking creative this is a this is a fun show mm-hmm you know and I came back because well first of all because Adam Adam Egan and because Tommy got fired yeah dipshit that was running it but also because Ari was doing his comedy special there right right and I love our to death there was no way I was gonna miss that I was like I can't miss it yeah it's one of my best friends I was friends with him when he was a doorman at the store now here he is doing his Comedy Central special day yeah am I gonna have to come back and so I went there the night before which was a Tuesday he was filming on a Wednesday I came to the night before and I saw roast battle and then a huh I was like holy shit I was like this just feels crazy yeah it feels like a different place a whole whole different energy yeah and Adam was like come

a month before I was which helped me as well and then Duncan came back a little bit after that and then Adam because everybody loves Adam he opened the door to a bunch of comics that never worked the store before they thought it was like they thought it was dark yeah a lot of people thought it was like a gross place what a weird energy yeah there was like you would walk down the hall and you could feel that sort of heaviness you know this is a comedy place like this is weird that it feels so heavy well that place has gone through weird peaks and valleys when I went there in 94 I first came here from Boston or from New York actually I went fosston New York but when I was in Boston it was Mecca you know talk about it like dude that's where Kinison came yeah this is at the store Richard Pryor you know Billy X was a doorman I mean we would talk about it like yeah with like hushed tones like the mecca who was Mecca mm-hmm but then when I came here in 94 it was dogshit really I was terrible yeah it was terrible there were a bunch of bowed acts see what happened was kinnison died in like 92 mm-hmm and when he died there was a vacuum there was a yeah and he had already left the store he left the store I think like a year or two before that he had a falling-out with Mitzi and you know he was fuckin crazy right cuz it was like legitimately crazy yeah and there was a wave when he was there were a bunch of people come to see him and some of the other guys like you know Rick do come in and some you know there was Martin Lawrence was there and then more actually Martin Lawrence was there during the during 94 when I was there yeah made me be like 95 or 96 but when I when I came back most of the nights he would be there like Monday Tuesday Wednesday 3:00 half filled room yeah

probably the same material that was happen when I started yes yes they were working the same material forever for years and years and years and that that was fucking gross it was just it was weird to see like I remember the first night I came there I sat in the back of the room to watch a show I was out here for a pilot me and Jim Breuer mm-hmm we're out here filming a pilot we both lived in the East Coast yeah and I was like wow this is the store like this is weird right acts are terrible no one no one was good there was no one good it wasn't like you know Dom Marrero was there I mean I'm

after killer it's like holy shit yeah and it wasn't when I started it wasn't it was like Tony was the door guy I'm not good daliyah was like just starting to do like the o.r and you know yeah it was an interesting time like Whitney was doing a lot of spots know our and you know it was very cliquish like everybody's kind of knew each other and I just like started in the belly room and worked my way down and it was cool though because it made me it made you better because you know there was like never I wasn't I rarely did show him like 10 people in the audience at least downstairs but I remember late-night spots were weird those late-night yeah they're weird and they didn't care Tommy didn't care if people are on TV like I remember Jordan Peele had just finished MADtv he they put him up on it was like that bring her and not bring her show as an open mic they let him do like three minutes on this open mic and he wasn't what he is now as far as like he had this huge hit moving now he's this massive director but he was been on MADtv for seven years he went like three and a half five minutes Tommy comes storming up you're like what's happening it was like the wild wild west and so I just kind of like kept to myself and just kept doing jokes and well Tommy should have never been in a position ever to tell anyone what to do yeah and they let him do that because he was basically Mitzi's caretaker and right you know along the way he alienated a lot of people he became a real mess yeah people but I had you know I was lucky because early on like guys started seeing me perform in the belly room and they were the one cuz you know it's hard to get his ear you had to like get his ear to like let you showcase but like I bet Ernst saw me at a show and he's like you got a you got a showcase I'm like I can't get Tommy's attention you know so it was like dudes would like you know he he would see Tommy be like you gotta show guys you gotta learn showcase I always wondered if maybe he was like Jack Nicholson in the shining like in the Overlook Hotel yeah the place like took over him but it might have maybe he was just vulnerable and dumb enough so the coast could get in his head that place is definitely weird yeah it's but it's real positive now it's a different darkness isn't isn't there anymore oh yeah sorry supportive my showcase room it's yeah did I did the video though she wasn't there she had just passed Justin Martindale and then I showed Justin Martindale was the last person one and then I and then she passed she didn't pass me as a non-paid regular first me too yeah did so I got to do the belly room on Friday nights and then I was a non-paid regular for like six months and then then I got passed yeah my story's real similar non-paid regular folk I think four or five months I was going on every night late late late at night and on after the show was over mm-hmm you know just and I get it I mean I was only I got past three years in the stand-up so I wasn't complaining yeah but you know she was like she needs to keep working sure I'm gonna make her a paid regular yet so it made me you know have to work yeah work for it which I appreciate now also it's like you get used to the club you get used to just be in there like to me it was just being there was so weird mm-hmm but I was six years in a comedy when I came to LA yeah and I remember the day I became a paid regular was like I couldn't sleep mm-hmm I was like holy shit I was staying in the Oakwood Gardens apartments oh yeah furnished everybody yeah yeah I was laying in bed going holy fuck I'm a paid regular at the store like I'm a real comedian now yeah that's all I could think I was like I'm a real comedian mm-hmm like I'm professional yeah he's a big deal oh my god for me was huge and it was like um because I started an improv and sketch at The Groundlings oh yeah so I've like even though I was newer to stand-up I'd have that stage experience for a couple years before I started stand-up which I felt helped me just get in the rhythm of stand-up right away and so I just kind of hit the ground running and you know to me one of my biggest accomplishments is being a paid regular and then that I got it before I was on TV because sometimes you know I feel like that does help when you're like um TV they're like oh they're well they're funny they're on TV and they yes sometimes get passed and so it made me feel like a real comic dude it passed and not have any TV credits yeah no I'm sure I mean having that any kind of performance experience is gonna like at least give you this comfortable feeling yeah performing talking in front of people some people it's so weird yeah walking in front of people is just that's that's one of the most terrifying things that some people can do yeah like before death started doing the road pretty quick 2010 I did Last Comic Standing I was on that was Philippe as far as the Tommy John again hopefully pay yeah Nikki Glaser oh she was on that scene yeah damn that's a good season it's a good season and it had like gone away and come back so it was kind of an exposure to host Craig Robinson oh okay yeah and so I did that and I started the road after that but like she gigs you know God Craig was the host of it I just when J was the host of it yeah it was it had been on and it was like more of a reality show with stand-up and then when they brought it back it was like just stand up no one was like living in a house together oh really yeah there were no like challenges oh yeah cuz you got lucky yeah for sure so I just got to do stand-up and then I started touring after that and then 2011 I got Chelsea Lately and then I started basically I've been tour ever since wow that's cool mm-hmm that's amazing that's a good little origin story yeah like well bill burr used to he's always been so nice to me and he'd always be like why are you never at the store I'm like I'm I'm Tori I'm promise you I'm doing stand-up I just started touring like and wasn't going in as much for a little bit that's great though but he's always like you need to stop acting and just to stand up I'm like I get it but I need to compliment I do like acting when he says that it's a compliment yeah for sure he's just he just thinks you're really funny that's that's high praise yeah he's always been so good to me he's great guy he's a really good guy the best I just didn't think that he would be into my comedy you know I he loves comedy period yeah yeah and he loves just he loves the art form and he respects people that work hard at it and they're good at it he's so down to earth like still yeah and all the success that he's had I've known him forever he's never changed yes and he's so humble like if you tell him that he's doing well it's like but that's why he's so funny I mean this is also a unique time in that comics are putting out all these specials and the specials are better with each time like I think paper tiger was one of his best specials ever yeah maybe his best it was really sharp and it's hard to top yourself you know it is yeah but that's the thing about the store that's so wonderful I hate to use that works it makes you sound fake wonderful it's so amazing that there's so many people doing that like you know and it's cool to be able to sit down and talk to the different people that are doing it and you know different ways like yeah like bill doesn't put himself on any kind of a cycle he just decides when it's time to do a special I don't I don't want to ruin it like whenever I want to do it then I'll do a special right but Jeselnik puts himself on a cycle and it's an interesting so does he one year all town all in town crafting the material one year clubs okay one year theaters film special I did not know yeah Jeselnik is one of the hardest workers and one of the most clever writers in the business yeah he's very sharp very clever and his jokes are one of those jokes we hear and you go yeah like this is like a pause be like god that's a good point because you don't see it coming to yes is a real talent yes and he goes dark and dark there's you know people that can get away with that oh he can get away like you did that yeah bleating mmm and you know it's also just it's so well done yeah it's like if you're gonna drive fast you better be really good at driving I mean yeah if you're gonna do dark comedy you better be really good jokes like there was a like a la Tom's I don't know what it was they were interviewing like Sebastian Maniscalco and they came to the store to interview him and they said that Jeselnik came in the room where he was being interviewed and just sat and stared at him [Laughter] as the then you finally got to Sebastian can you get out of here he's another guy Sebastian is it's hugely successful but really humble never changed at all yeah just just happy and grateful and yeah yeah well that's the cool thing about comedy right now I mean you've seen so many different iterations of it but like dudes they're selling out arenas I mean you - it's like ever it's comedy it's like as big as rock guys you know like you should be the opposite was always the rock guys were like here and the comics wanted to be them and now that all these you know guys are like killing it yeah well the difference is the rock guys have a fucking band and they have to get along with the band and then like I bring different opening acts all the time I don't want anybody get annoying yeah I mix it up yeah and we don't have to bring shit with us love to bring drums plug-in and feedback what the fuck bird I love Bert but what the fuck is the big picture of his face always boss he did Joe cool I always mess with each other like Joe's all showing his plane and Bert's showing his tour bus which is joke why have a plane his face on it not it not with just their they're like showing off their like lows of trepidation yeah and I'm all like I get upgraded on American this week look at that look at that boss beautiful boobs body shot World Tour look he's got his fucking podcast that's just you're just begging to get stalked yeah but I mean that is it we wanted a role in advertisement I mean I guess it's also annoying all of us all of his friends are like what are you doing but he's but he's been that guy yes forever where he's just like hey I'm gonna bar after the show let's go like I don't think he cares Lee's drunk yeah why would he carries drunk and in college what he was like the dude the party guy he was the inspiration for that movie with Ryan Reynolds and wilder and Wilder yeah was the inspiration on yeah that's crazy like he's not fuckin nuts that's how so I got I got like work god I love him to death he would have a bus with of course he would but yeah I'm so silly but it worked it's also he's so grateful because he had this Travel Channel show yeah and all of us Burt was out there traveling and he's he's doing these shows he's gone for months and months at a time and all of us like Bill talked to him about it I talked to about him like I remember I called him once and he was drunk on a motorcycle yeah he said you were a big reason why he was like I gotta I gotta stop doing this and get back to stand up yeah I'm like dude you're a great comic you're a funny guy and you're you that'll go away and you'll be you'll be at the at the beck and call of these people in the Travel Channel who want to censor you I mean they everything has to be like squeaky clean down the middle like I was friends of Bourdain and he had real problems with the Travel Channel yeah you know they at the time I think they were owned by very religious people and didn't oh yeah there was a lot of weird shit so they wanted he could talk about things he's a bird so fuckin savage he's a drunk Savage and he's out there you know I mean he enjoyed being employed on television right it was all good when a bad thing it was a great job I'm sure he loved the job but I equated it I had experience doing fear factor so for me it was like kind of the same thing but at least fear factor I was in town yeah and I could do the store at night but I was telling them like listen man you won't be happy unless you have a career as a stand-up you're always gonna wonder you're he's gonna see these guys put you in a drive-by The Improv see these guys headlining yeah it could be me I could be up there having a great time yeah and look at the level he's at now that wouldn't have happened he's crushing it he's close she's selling out fucking theaters everywhere everywhere yeah it I mean it's a direct result of him deciding to take that chance and that's a hard chance to take when you have a family I'll tell you that's one of the hardest things in this biz this is betting on yourself yeah it's so hard to get stability in this business so when you get a taste of it you're like oh I can't I don't I don't want to mess this up yeah but you don't realize that the risk is greater you might fail but the risk is if it works it works like five yes exactly but that's that's a hardly for a lot of people to take it is it's one of the reasons why I have so many jobs I don't I don't want anybody to have any power over me yeah I want I just I have a good philosophy on how I do my thing you know I want to just I just want to do my best and have fun and the more people that are in your ear talking to you about stuff and telling you what to do and what not to do once you get away with the not get away with the more you're fucked well yeah it's like you're you're never gonna find your best voice he's not going to because you're not being you at the end yeah you're compromising yourself for some company are you compromising yourself or because you want to get hired for the next job right this job is over but when you don't have a job and it's just you're just you're just an artist right then you just get to create the best comedy you can create and the podcast thing just sort of like became like a support but it started off just for fun yeah and then it became like a support mechanism and then it became this what it is now yes just bizarre which how long ago was it that it started 10 years 10 years yeah so it was like at the the forefront okay yeah I started after I got booted from the store yeah yeah I started two years later you're like fun find your own outlet well was that I was also depressed I just come back from Colorado I was trying to move to Colorado but then my wife got pregnant when we're in the mountains and we got a house in the mountains like 8,500 feet above sea level like way up like to live I wanted to live up there yeah yeah yeah I just I was tired of like as for me is like big crowds like all these big crowds and what would be like the perfect antidote to big crowds no one right just peace so that was like so when you are when a woman gets pregnant at very high altitude it's actually kind of dangerous especially you're not acclimated yeah Denver which is only 5,500 feet has a very high number of premature births I didn't know yeah because of that because of the altitude yes you know it's no fucking air up there oxygen so we moved back when we moved back I was like all right I was like I got to do something different and so me and red bands start doing just with a laptop answering questions yes like doing a live stream and answering questions yeah knuckleheads like 200 people yeah you know I think you put it up on your own website put it up on Ustream at first okay and then after a few months we decided to start uploading it to iTunes hmm as an audio version of it yeah became what it is now that's that's very strange yeah but that also helps me to not have a job right you know it's like I don't have to think well now you are not making decisions out of fear exactly yeah and that's where people really get but it's hard so I didn't take that fucking leap you know it's hard it's it's dangerous dangerous leap mm-hmm bettering yourself yeah when you when did you first like realize like fully you're making a living doing stand-up when did you go like I don't need anything else um I mean I would I like I said I started 20 in 2010 but it was like two you know small clubs and meddling yeah oh no I never met I went straight from the store to headlining really yeah it was a weird journey that's crazy I wish I had middled fuck did you do that laughs how long standing and Chelsea they came back to back yeah and so because I had been at the store for three years just honing my material and I was doing sets all the time I was doing shows constantly around the house Comic Standing launched a lot of people right iliza who else Felipe you was Alonzo did Alonzo get launched yes don't saw me Kathleen Madigan they do the early on mm-hmm what's Ralphy for sure Ralphy yeah and Gary Gulman good thing weird yeah and so all right I wish I had middle because I would have like it still is damn my god I'm so curious how other people do their shows you know but I just sort of went from zero to 60 like doing the story for three years that's crazy - like headlining and so I just how much time did you have oh my god I probably I was headlining but I did a lot because of my improv background with Groundlings I did a lot of crowd for you for taking that chance what kind of trick people you were three years in your act and you were headlining on the road off of television off of TV yes crazy but you know I packed a lot into the first three years like I was doing because you know a lot of people you're just trying to find stage time but somehow I got lucky I was getting tons of stage um it's over three years I was doing like six nights seven nights a week of multiple shows oh that's awesome so I was good I was getting lots I was getting material quickly I think a lot of reps that are reps yeah I did the show for Adam Barnhart for a year every Sunday night he would give me ten minutes and brand-new comic you know that's huge that's your brand new comic so I was building material quickly but like for as far as like a good set it was like 30 minutes but then I would do the crowd work and and now would sprinkle it in and so it would you know turn out to be a decent 45-minute show and then I just kept doing that and then I was on Chelsea for four years I left Chelsea to do acting and then stand-up took a little bit of a dip but then I did my half hour for Netflix it came back up again and I was doing well at clubs the last couple years and then my Netflix special sweet and salty just came out and I've been this is my first theater tour and it's been selling well now I feel I guess answer your question right now right now 13 years in there years in because it's cuz in standup 13 years is like nothing you know what I mean like Peterson 13 years to get into a theater tour if 13 years is amazing oh really yeah that's great yeah I don't know the my time went so all over the place that I don't know that's really good 13 years I wasn't doing a theater tour yeah so this is my first one and you know that's the nice thing about the Netflix reach you know is anybody come up to you and go I love serious really yeah what do you think though Netflix is like 90% of the reach for the theater tour yes yeah special yeah yeah I mean I've done a lot of acting the last few years I've been I did the Mindy project for three seasons and some other things a bunch of guest stars moot some movies what kind of contract you guys have for doing that serious thing I think we signed a year contract and then it's kind of like we'll see it a year if everyone's happy I think that's what it is let's talk after show okay I have some suggestions yeah and then the special as far as stand-up I mean I feel like I have a lot of people because they knew me from acting didn't know I was a stand-up but I was Stan that's always been so important to me and I was always on the road even when I was acting I was constantly headlining and I ran into Bill like a year ago on the road and he's like what are you doing I'm like honey people don't know I've been helping since 2010 I just don't talk about it I just do my shows and now that I have my special come out this is it's really great it's like I'm doing these cool theaters we're adding two shows most night that's amazing it's awesome that's amazing really lovely that's awesome congratulations really it's like I said there's a lot of storytelling now what do you do in terms of now that your specials out and then you're gonna tour again mm-hmm how much new material I have about 40 minutes with new material oh that's awesome I'm still working you know as your tour start Saturday oh so you're gonna throw some of the old bits in there some people's our neighborhood neighbor Yahtzee was like you should like do your new stuff do as far as you can and then throw in some classics because people enjoy that you know they liked it from they want new stuff but then they like certain bits and why not yeah well fans yeah I mean like to some people that like Gaffigan has to do is fucking Hot Pockets bit everybody blow a gasket yeah you know there's certain people that like Sebastian does a lot of his classic but he knows the road yeah yeah so it's you know the challenge as you know was like oh crap now I got a like what's what's my story that'll until next yes we say that's working on yeah well that's I mean that's the beautiful thing about being a writer right do you smoke weed uh here and there it's not like a regular occurrence yeah I will say that I did this weed dinner with Chelsea where we ate like five course meal that was all cooked with weed oh great and I because I love food ate every course and like cleaned the plate I was like high as a kite but I have never been funnier and I'm like why don't I do this more often do they give you transportation yeah they did oh I couldn't have and I could barely walk by the people go into a fucking K hole if you give him that much weed oh it was a lot I think I had like four joints wow it was a lot like I was high on noon the next day people to this day are like that we'd dinner was the funniest thing I've ever seen everybody's high like that yeah in a good place yeah I was in a good place and then at the very end of the night it was all fog nothing I like I remember sort of getting into the car I don't remember any of the drive and then opening the door to my house and then blank again I do remember thinking in my head like don't text anyone because you don't know or don't tweet you don't know you're gonna say right now so I just made myself pass out oh that's good that's perfect you slid right into home plate yeah that's perfect you made it perfect that's nail the landing there's not too much that's exact right now like you you you actually came here but I I think yeah I should because it did sort of open something in my head oh yeah that let the silliness just so I should do a little bit you know when I won't start right yeah start right now this is what some right now sure hey kids I'm gonna have to go home and write the the new tour starting I don't even know I will tell you this because you were talking about Ilan your name is sheriff Ian held I cuz I normally just do a little edibles I don't even know if I know how to smoke it right I'm like the lamest person oh hush no you know just a little bit that's a blunt tobacco on the outside weed on the inside inhale right Bill Clinton well this isn't like Bill Clinton this isn't rocket science good blow it out blow it out yeah let me say it was nothing in there did it go in I like gulp that I was talking to Chappelle Lacey you know Chappelle yeah uh like the dude who's like a unbelievable athlete he was a cheerleading champion oh really level six world champion a cheerleader and he's built like a tank he is he's really funny but he's he's funny like he's never never smoked weed he's like I think maybe I want to try it I was like listen if you try it try it with a friend and try a tiny bit yeah try with a friend of smokes weed I just want you to go yes oh well that's it puff hold on to it that's it don't go crazy you have it in your mouth I mean I'm inhaling okay goes all the way in your life pretty shirt them along I think I'm like you feeling good you feeling different not yet I do you do yeah immediately I meet Lee yeah I feel like whoo yeah they did nothing no but it definitely went down my throat but did it go all the way it like this and then all the way out like you don't need it you don't need it you're good I'm my own life I don't want you freak out well no people freak out I won't freak out we've had people freak out who's the biggest freak out we've ever had in here hi about a few like where they just start acting way different Sturgill Simpson told me he's not used he's he lives I love Sturgill yeah Nashville that weed they have is I don't know it's not good getting the stuff out here is like so we got barbecued before the podcast cuz I know he loves weed yeah and he goes dude that podcast started I know what you're saying anything who's sitting there like locked in and then all sudden it's live - that was the other thing back then we did it live yeah which freaked a lot of people out just a live aspect what they would say it was like attention to it it was attention to the fact that all these eyeballs were on you right now currently right some strange reason could you tell that he was like no I was high as fuck - oh you know I mean I'm not immune to it like guess gets me scares Joey okay because he just he goes so deep yeah he goes so deep it doesn't even make sense he'll he'll throw down four stars of death those are 250 milligrams he doesn't funny and he's laughing haha that's crazy yeah I see the devil Joe Rogan devil he gave me some some pills to give to my lady oh my god that feels a danger but I was like don't give no biggie he gave one that Thompson girl Tom Segura has a bit about it oh yeah yeah I don't want to give away the bit yeah yeah recent occurrence yeah Joey dosed him yeah would you try Joey's fight again so he's fucked some people's lives up for real oh yeah yeah yeah legitimately cuz they go so they look this is something I had a guy on the podcast Alex Berenstein it was a Berenson Berenson he wrote a book and I had him on with a doctor as a cannabis enthusiast this guy dr. Mike Hart from Canada and one of the things that they talked about is how marijuana to some people can and couldn't competence liyan do schizophrenia oh that's for real real yeah I think it's for real yeah and so some people are so you you think that happened to some of the people just Joey you'd have to ask Joe oh okay for sure I think it can do that and for sure I think I know people that have done that and have lost their fucking minds because it's an alteration of reality but is it that star death yeah those and this cheeba choose that are even more strong to choose yeah Chiba choose that are 500 milligrams I don't think it's legal anymore I think once they went full legal there's is that the case Jamie it's like ten milligrams 100 milligram per per container right so if you get gummy bears mmm you'll have ten that are ten milligrams and then yeah that's a hundred okay so you'd have to take two and a half bottles of the old fucking things are they're not making these things in a lab right next door to pusher they're making microchips right there's some dude some dude is cooking this shit up and some bullshit commercial kitchen that he got his friends to chip in money for me this who knows who's making these things I mean I'm sure a lot of them are being made by giant businesses now it's a real thing now yeah but back in the day especially like right now I can't really speak of it I'll be ignorant I'm just joking around but back in the day when you first get edibles you had no idea yeah I'm sure there's some testing methods I'm just fucking around if you're a grower you I'm sure ones that ever worked on me doubt like I would just fall asleep yeah I found out it was like a grandma making them in her house that because she liked them she would sell her leftovers to this one particular dispensary but then they went away yeah I would trust grandma it's the edibles but the star death one it's 250 so you said yeah that's an insane amount a thousand no way to change four of them yeah Oh easy easy mm that's that's great Joey Joey can just eat it he doesn't eat yeah it freaks him out and he throws two more down it's not kidding a regular basis yes we landed somewhere he's like I almost had a fucking panic attack oh my god I was so high he was I'm taking two more fucking he's two more down it goes out he was so pumped about those pills that he gave me I was like I don't know I can't do this he's my favorite person oh you just don't know anybody like him Oh Joshua's told stories about them coming up he's just a genuine human yeah funny I like him a lot but the the thing is this Berenson guy Alex Berenson who wrote this book had a really good point is that um we think it's fine because it's fine for you mm-hmm but that doesn't seem to be the case for everybody everybody has a different point they can go to I think people have different brain chemistry right right that's one of the reasons why some people have depression running their family and we could all say oh hey you just got to suck it up yeah I don't know if that's true because we're built in a way where we can suck it up that's true but also it's like I don't know how your brain is working right it's just guesswork right there's no thing like I could take your temperature right and if your temperature is like 96 whatever the fuck it is it's hot what's hot 19 what is it normally 98.5 is normal right it's 6:00 yeah 99.5 and 100 is higher yes we circuit and pretty warm that's why the how come this float tank they want it to be 94 94 is like the sweet spot they say that's the surface or your skin yeah as I say your internal temperature is 98.6 it's not yeah I'm not a doctor either but my point is you can measure that right you can't measure how a person feels no you don't I mean it's like so we could assume oh they just got to get their shit together but it could be a thing like a thyroid issue right or it could be a thing like some people are born with bad vision right that why would what wouldn't we assume that that would be the case with mood - yeah right with mooners it's gotta be like some people are born having less happiness there's less of a feeling of joy like maybe an overwhelming sense of gloom just genetically yeah I know yeah yeah every we all know people who've just always been kind of like down right now if you give certain people like that some medication it can help them right and I think there's a leveling thing right things out I mean it's not an exact science right right there there was trying to find things that work for you that's with it but they can help you but yeah people are in a situation where I know people that have been like really suicidal yeah and they got on some stuff and that it helped them a lot and then they slowly wean themselves off of it after they and improved their lives and they found they didn't need it anymore yeah because it dulls other things some of that stuff you know yes yes it's tricky you're messing with brain chemistry you know like hopefully it works right but the the goal is to get you feeling better than you feel right yeah but I feel like since some people need that and some people don't it just make sense that some people would interact with everything differently than you would right whether it's alcohol or drugs or cocaine or amphetamines there's some people to get a taste of amphetamines and they can't get it up yeah and then other people don't have nothing to do with that shit no I get that crazy yeah fucking sauce away from me I don't want you running around like a maniac I barely take like an Advil that stuff yeah but I wonder what it is about weed that can can open some other portal to like you said this it's or anything for some people again obviously I'm an idiot and I don't write anything about what I'm talking about but I would imagine that what's going on is that some people have a tendency to lean towards mental illness anyway maybe they're struggling a bit and then something comes along like a big dose of edibles and it just knocks their already shaky cart yeah off the trail they just can't do it right yeah it's just too much it's a blow out event that their brain wasn't ready for oh man yes sir I think and I think there's a bunch of mitigating factors right like some I would like to know like when when do these people experience these bouts of schizophrenia is it directly related to stress is it directly is it just something that's genetically they're predisposed to yeah who knows but he was saying that there's it's it's possible and we don't you know we don't know what the numbers are but some people might have like real mental health episodes yeah because of a high dose of wheat interesting I think we got a that's a problem is the real problem the problem is because it's been illegal for so long they haven't funded adequate testing right and it's it wasn't even legal to test on and I mean for a long time right I mean it's like the federal government has to approve whether or not you can test on shit that schedule one like if you wanted to do some studies and you wanted to do some studies on cocaine and what it's like when people use cocaine which is the effect of cocaine like you're gonna fun cocaine studies right they're like it's illegal why would we want to get to the bottom of what you might be right because it's got manacle right right so we do schedule whiners all the good stuff it's mushrooms all the stuff they can get you to see god yeah that's right yeah is heroin schedule one it is that's interesting what about morphine there's morphine don't they still use that shit in the hospital yeah the button is rude the fact they give you the ability because why would you stop especially if you could feel sorry for yourself you're at surgery oh yeah well nobody wants to they're in pain no I'm just sitting there anyway right let's put five quarters into this ride it's like I don't know I can do that and go okay I don't want to do that ever again yeah some people can't and I don't think we should think of that as anything other than a chemical thing mm-hmm it seems like there's gonna be behavioral things with people right there's some people that are addicted to gambling right it's not a chemical thing but it's still kind of it's a rush yeah I think all that behavioral shit at all ties in together it's really interesting like dopamine yeah spurt well it's really interesting to think how other people's brains work like we were talking about Elon Musk he's too smart he's too smart like I can't imagine what it would be like looking through that guy's brain you know his brain works different they know for sure right there's different brains out there and some of them create wild art right the the middle part the Pistons have to shoot you know they have to connect in the left brain there's the whole light left brain right brain thing you know where sometimes the wires are crossed yeah so that's why some people are better at math some people are better at writing you know there's a different different part of your brains effect those that's interesting I wonder if there's gonna be a way to target those I bet there's gonna be a way where they put something on your head and it you know because the things they do for PTSD patients they they do this thing where they energize with magnets some crazy magnetic thing they concentrates on a certain area of your brain where they feel you've been damaged oh yeah and fighters and some people with injuries CTE injuries from the war they've gone to this it's a base it's near where the bases are down in San Diego pretty close I think maybe within an hour San Diego and they they use magnets to stimulate your brain and so I'm obviously butchering it but somehow or another they're helping your brain heal itself yeah what I hear something like that I'm like okay what if you just juiced up the right side right well if you just use it every day yeah nothing's wrong with it but it's I just want you to Joyce the fuck up I'd like to be able to pass my math test today imagine if they came up with the technology if they come of the technology that allows you to help your brain heal and I know this is stupid I know I'm not biologists but if they came up with that and they can help use these supermagnets or whatever it is on the outside you wearing like a helmet or something and juices up your brain and helps your brain heal itself right why couldn't they make you smarter I don't I don't know what cuz you're talking imagine if they just started to use it like really rich people just started wearing those helmets all day yeah and just juicing their brain up all day and their brain just keep getting bigger and a head start growing oh my god what I mean what if that is the future hot look right look like the hot look used to be like the the bigger the person like if a king wasn't fat he wasn't attractive but Kings wanted to look fat because that would mean you had all this wealth right and all this prosperity ya know and then people got skinny like tits oh this means you're fit this is the idea maybe one day the ideal is going to be big okay listen your brain up I don't even know you could I don't know much about even repairing your brain you always heard that once you mess it up it's messed up yeah I think they're learning I mean it's there's there's for sure therapies that they're doing but I think they're learning a bunch of different methods of how to help people heal from certain brain injuries yeah and this was part of that it's um I mean it's really the brain is such a weird one right it's cool it's how you interface with the whole world their whole body is like you know it affects everything affects how you see things and think about things that's where you control all of your emotions it's how you all stand up yeah yeah I mean that's who you are and the brain is a strange thing to fuck with yeah you know you're like you juice in the pumps that's why I'm like you ran a motorcycle put a helmet on yes you know please do have you seen the videos when they're doing brain operations and they like I think they make the people I play a guitar think you lose the ability refrain yeah if they're afraid they might lose that ability if they're not continuing to do it right he's going on Jesus Christ that's nuts the best is when people wake up from brain surgery and they have this whole er skill you know there's like stories of people like suddenly being fluent in Spanish you're like what yeah they can play instruments I've heard that I mean I don't know anybody like that but I hear stories you know what's funny that is a really fascinating idea that someone could get a brain injury and come back with some new special skill or a language you would think I looked into that yeah article about Mary Steenburgen she's married to Ted Danson I don't know house there last night yeah she had a she had some sort of injuries she had surgery I don't know if those brain or not it might have been brain something she came back and had suddenly the ability to write music well and she like wrote the songs for like a soundtrack of the movie that just came out and it was and she never had that oh the Stenberg brain begins became steam virgin's brain became musical after a strange complication from a routine surgery Wow all my thoughts became musical oh my god who discovered a new passion for songwriting holy shit yeah that's weird that's what I was saying earlier it's like everybody's brain is just different mm-hmm we all want to hold people like the way they think to a certain standard right they want people to think exhibit everybody wants everybody else to think the way they do they want to enforce their ideas and three we just have to come up with a better way of a better way of expressing that no one has any idea how you see the world right the way we talk to each other we assume that your version the world is exactly the same as Mars yeah the world that we're coming from the same place yeah mm-hmm yeah but not only are you coming from a different environment but your brain your brain is different yeah yeah for sure like the way some people see the world did you see it different than you they're looking through a different window yeah and you can tell we gotta be a little bit more I think we have to be a little bit more understanding of some people like that that's where all the weirdos that's where the crazy ones come from that's what they say that all that person is wired differently you don't think Quentin Tarantino's wired differently Yeah right you know I'm saying yeah I mean how are you gonna make a movie like once upon a time in Hollywood unless you're wired differently right that you can see this alternative ending to this for a third story wanna go on a ride through that dudes brain yeah like I create some fuckin wild dark image I know but you know that guy's his brain is different it's fuckin different yeah that's why a lot of this you can do it stuff that you hear like inspirational shit the year like you can do anything just say your mind doing right not always really just like you know well you want to think positive that's always like if you can think of the positive side but not everybody can physically do everything you should definitely think positive in terms of energy in terms of the way you view people except the moments but you shouldn't think positive in terms of you can do something that's not physically possible yeah you should jump on a moving vehicle you shouldn't like if I decided at 52 I want to play football in the NFL physically possible it's literally not physically possible maybe wired different after that my career would last 10 seconds if I was lucky and that would be it yeah is just physical reality it doesn't matter how much positive thinking I do right I'm not winning any sprinting contests I can't dunk there's nothing special happening here that's physical reality it doesn't matter how much positive thinking I ever have oh for sure that's where people get weird that's like when people who don't believe in science you know someone gets sick they go we'll pray we'll pray that it will take you know why you go okay I'm not knocking praying pray all day but at some point this person needs medicine ya know God invented people people figured out medicine God made medicine just take the medicine Jesus Christ just people that are studying their entire lives to try to figure out how to fix you they're not always right but they're right way more than you are or naturopaths I'm sure there's real natural paths out there I'm sure there are but just the term makes me go what are you doing you go to real school for that natural path I'm sure is a real thing but for sure also there's a lot of people that are like kind of faking that thing yeah that like they don't telling you how to heal yourself and tell you telling you what herbs to take like hey where's the evidence there's evidence these herbs for doing jack shit they're like just drink celery juice like homeopathy that shit's that's nonsense right isn't it I don't know is that been proved to be nonsense about homeopathy achmed astray there's a certain amount of you just believed in you got some medicine mm-hmm right yeah Oh like the placebo effect yeah yeah for sure there's a certain amount of that I mean if you take something that's like sugar pills and you you definitely feel like you've made a big difference to your illness to return for the better you just immediately start thinking that but yeah but we know that's not possible there's no good quality evidence that homeopathy is an effective treatment for these or any other health conditions some practitioners also claim homeopathy can prevent malaria or other diseases there's no evidence to support this and no scientifically plausible way that homeopathy can prevent diseases it's just you Kay yeah that's those English people though they're probably trying to save money on their socialized medicine kidding yeah I think if you believe that you know eating walnuts is gonna gonna make you feel like you're have more energy and feel pure and someone tells you and convince ya you eat those walnuts you'll start feeling different very very beside you feel different in life I don't know what percentage of people you're not gonna get the really skeptical people yeah the real cynical people but for some people you give them some sugar pills and it'll work if they really believe it works you don't even know why that is we don't know no one they don't understand the placebo effect yeah I mean it's real it's measurable hmm and I think depending upon how much you buy into it I bet that has a big impact on the effectiveness oh for sure because if you buy on 100% you do I think fill that change but if you're it's almost like some religions are that's what they are there are a theological sugar pill mm-hmm like some religions are just if you believe if just really believe you you get rewarded if you really believe and that's like that's the pull of a cult right that's how you start adding any wacky cult oh well yeah really bully do you really believe I believe too we all believe together oh my God we're so connected we all believe together and they're saying they got the answer oh you got the answer well then and that's also how you get people to you know the churches that do the tithing yes change good yeah that's a good slice of cash right there I don't I know uh Mormons tithe though there is that sort of thing in other churches um yeah yeah some some Christian religions definitely do it yeah yeah tithe 10% man that's a lot of money yeah especially if you're an entertainer and you're giving your agent [Music] yeah it's um I don't know if Jesus would have wanted you to give payments like that yeah I'll see you as Methodists we just passed the collection plate and you know if you put a dollar how's that different than 20 you're just like I put I gave something wouldn't Jesus be just happy that I made the effort yeah it's almost like they should just charge a membership fee like some fucking right like do you get more prayers if you put it on 20 that's a good question I bet you do I bet you get preferential treatment yeah is it like raffle ticket I would like $20 worth of prayers well do you remember when preachers he's late night preachers they came up with his really dastardly move and the really dastardly move was to convince poor people to send them all of their money yeah that God would return it tenfold or you know to fold or whatever it is and they had all these yeah different stories of all these poor gullible people that they were telling I mean I don't know who was doing the the stories where they would tell the success stories right I did this and this happened to me and I made so much money afterwards and now we have a house we have a car and they get these people convinced oh and just send my last remaining imagine targeting people's last remaining dollars there's a special place in hell that's some of that televangelist stuff is you know really prayed on that especially back in the day it was like like you said those commercials like what they have cuz they did this for the church for us it's crazy meanwhile the preachers are flying there was a preacher I think I heard it on Stern there's a preacher that told the church flat-out I need another plane I need you to donate money you're like what that's great bunch of I've done that yeah and there was one it was a woman interviewed this preacher as he was getting into his limo just getting off his plane she asked him is it because you think poor people are demons he said something crazy about he doesn't want to fly commercially with all those demons oh my god he's like a poor fool yeah this is the guy oh man and he says don't you say that don't you say I said that you'd like me he got really serious with her pointed in her face and he's very scary man that was all the rage because I'm from outside of Charlotte it was a Tammy Faye Baker Jim Baker just had to be shut down he was selling some would debate coronavirus shit he had a fake coronavirus thing that apparently oh really he got busted for they told him to stop stop selling that yeah yeah man there it is Missouri Attorney General Sue's Jim Baker over misleading coronavirus cure claims oh that just came out bro that's what he looks like now looks great ah yeah he looks great is the best he's looked in years oh he was selling it for on his website totally eliminate it kills it deactivates it that's what it said I love my guys late I love we gotta go to prison for being shady and they're like not stopping look at that the product is 225 dollars in the show's website so he's saying he's got $125 cure for the coronavirus it does not exist I was like drink this hand sanitizer when you throw up that's the demon coming out of you I didn't know he was still uh wheeling and dealing like so Whelan preachin um I think yes yeah I think you show what well he's out there rocking it oh he does the Jim the jim bakker show POW shout out to the jim bakker show yeah North Carolina I don't know imagine if I really did have he really didn't have the cure and we were mocking I know and he's like you was like what a scientist it lives in the wood and he he brought the guy and the guy had a cure or the figured out it worked but no one else News he's he can't get fucked over by the FDA so he's just gonna sell it from his website yeah sold it for a deal with Jim Baker becomes the king in the world he's the only one left everyone else is like we don't have the cure we don't have a vaccine it's just him and his believers Yeah right we'll find out tune in folks next week but I miss Tammy Faye rest in peace she was a wild one huh anybody that gets their makeup tattooed on top to Don the whole deal I'm pretty sure yes all those kings all that I make up Wow you letting somebody drill ink into your eyelids whew I think it's like become like more women do it than you think it's just that they do a lot better job now they have like better tools and techniques so people get them tattooed on it but you can't tell I think we're one or two generations from them being able to do whatever the fuck you want right what do you want your face one or two generations fifty years from now but you know like I feel like with that you know people can change their face so much already it takes out some of that when people fix certain things they take away what was unique about them you know you know Jennifer Grey knows people fuck up yeah yeah and you with your face you can't really go back yeah it's hard right yeah it's a real hard my bad yeah you know some gals got convinced that they needed to get their lips thicker and so they had surgeries on them lips opened up yeah oh yeah so painful yeah and you know so you can get scar tissue anytime you have surgeries yeah weird spots that's why I became a comedian that's why they're so weird to if they don't match your face yeah what's happening here mmm just the ratios off yeah you know but I think that people thought because they could do it with tits why can't they do it with lips let's keep this party rolling all right I've heard that small boobs are in their back yes what that's the word on the street I'm off the market so I haven't been testing it that's probably what people have trends right yeah people are like getting their implants removed too well that's good for health reasons right you know some people there's a woman in cat Zingano and she fought in the UFC now she fights for Bellator mm-hmm she was one of the top bantamweight contenders fought Ronda Rousey for the title yeah she had hers removed and she detailed it on her Instagram talk about all the negative effects it was having on her health-wise I know she once she got them removed she felt infinitely better well especially the old implants you know how we were leaking and a lot of people were getting sick from it yeah but probably the thing the problem is apparently it's just like everything else like stuff we were talking about earlier some people have a reaction to it and some people don't exactly right for some people it's like for whatever reason their body rejects it and it creates like an 'm you know what soured immunological so the word immunological sounds right responds by their immune system it creates inflammation some people have real problems with it yeah you know well the trend right now small boobs big butts Wow that's what I've heard interesting like a track star yeah make sense we need a streamline for when our society collapses we have to go back to live in the forest oh man this is that like this coronavirus turns out to be just like the flu and everybody just gets to flu mm-hmm I hope the hope that's the case but we got to be really prepared for a real one right really prepared for like a plague yeah well because you're seeing how fast yeah this is not just that but how underprepared we are right right I say we as if I'm out there doing something oh yeah I need funding well yeah I have tests you don't have the tests I think we need to pay you way more attention of this shit I think I don't know what I mean I have no idea of their underfunded or if it's a matter of scientific innovation like how much time it takes to figure out a new better way to protect from these diseases or if he was talking about some of the existing vaccines that they you know what they could have possibly worked on to make a vaccine for a corona virus they never bother doing it after SARS right apparently which is another corona virus type thing like animal dove person type thing well there's a lot I think apparently a lot of them elect out including the flu yeah a lot of them are people get it from like pigs that's the swine flu Birds avian flu right yeah it's the jumps it jumps from the animals to us we get sick as fuck yeah well Buki shit it's really scary because you're already dealing with like life right and then you're like oh the plague of the land yeah pandemic and it's also this is my take on it like with the way we look at it is it we look at it like it makes sense because people we know about colds we know colds kill people you know we know diseases kill people so it seems to make sense but if those were demons and not diseases yeah tell terrifying the world would be if like all the people who have dying of diseases were really just dying at demons that would be scary I would buy that $125 thing Jim Baker was selling why is why is it less scary to have them die of disease than it is for them to die from demons if they're both just gonna kill you hmm why was if we just looked at diseases like demons there's a fucking holy war going on out there there's a holy war going on out there the demons trying to get us instead we're like oh no it's just CO vid 19 stop it's a demon yeah you guys are miss labeling these diseases they're all demons you're like can I take vitamin C for that we should treat health care in this country the same way we would treat fighting demons well how do you never have to fight most of those demons like Silver Bullet fucking stake through the heart we haven't put enough money into fighting the demons we've accepted a certain amount of loss of the demons everywhere imagine if that was it like we would be so angry at our leadership you fuck your shit for the demons at home dealing to claim and everyone like how many people die of disease in this country every year a lot a lot right like a lot of young kids and old folks die from the flu that happens in this heart disease like the worst one I'm sure yeah beside a disease general like you mean like yeah because cancer is a disease too and a lot of people get cancer you know if we've thought about all that shit like demons we'd be working harder to fight it and there's a whole there's a fucking holy war out there but how do we find it I don't know it's not a corona virus it's a fuckin demon yeah and that's we got a call maybe it's a bitch-ass team and it's only gonna kill people with lung problems right now it's not strong with a strong demon like Spanish flu or shape-shifting demon oh dude a shapeshifter like outside are you watching that show no but I've heard it's awesome very good I'm deep in yeah is there only 10 episodes good shows do like eight or ten easily may come back yeah yeah easily it's really good it's a really good show it's just a really well done Horror Show really the stephen kids based on Stephen King book oh that's right it did he write is he based on a novel or is it something I know it's his writing I believe so yeah he does that a lot he gives his stories out for young directors to make projects with oh that's cool they nailed it yeah yeah it's really cool where what where's my HBO it's really good yeah but the HBO does that thing when they make you fucking wait Oh long make you wait a week yeah what's with the way it feels like screaming bitch streaming it's only streaming I know that we can't go back to like a p.m. here to noon I know it's it's an imam to wait a week for these choses so feels like a month well they also have to give into this idea of like this certain window of prime time mm-hmm into a prime time which is you know whatever the fuck it is right eight to ten people want to watch whatever the fuck they want to watch for their plane ride just Jack the whole system yeah streaming just fucked everything over for these people that want you to tune in within the show devs what is they like your boy Alex Garland that did ex machina oh I don't know seems like it I don't know just me guessing based off the trailer it just came out it looks like it's about the people that make the simulation sort of old Nick Offerman oh that all he's really he's a good actor looks good just came out have you ever contemplated the idea of life as a simulation no you ever heard a simulation theory that's what they're talking about like that there will be a like the matrix type thing exactly yeah exactly [Music] fucking Elon Musk believes it really yes he said if you had one question would what are you saying he would want to know what's behind the simulation or what's beyond the simulation like who's controlling and I was like his one question he would want to have answered right that's on the other side yeah yeah like who's controlling the simulation what's beyond the simulation I think was his quote right yeah he said that it's possible and then have you talked to some scientists that have tried to study this like look at it objectively they think it's more probable that we are living in a simulation yeah but it would be like yeah the question really is what cuz it can't just exist right right like eventually it's gonna be here right this is what we all agree eventually there's gonna come a time where if you think about what you could do now have you ever fucked around phones like HTC vibes oh the oculus oculus one it's pretty sweet because it's just a headset yeah and it plugs into a laptop or iPad rather so the iPad sitting there plugged in and you step away from it and you're in this fucking world yeah you're in a world other place yeah you can play all these games there's boxing games those games swords and shedding you're swiping at like geometric patterns to fly you and you're playing drums on them and it's so realistic so realistic and weird this is at its infancy mm-hmm but we know for sure if they keep going with that think about what a movie used to look like in 1930 it was so ridiculous the special effects is so bad they're so bad yeah that's like for kids today it's actually funny I've showed it to my kids and they thought it was funny right I mean but back then it was amazing yeah it was like beyond they think anything anyone had seen that's not even a hundred years right so what we can do now with these HTC vibes and these oculus is the all these these places like sandbox where you go and play these games and warehouses with virtual reality this is just the beginning oh yeah this is this stuff is going to be indistinguishable right there's gonna come a time where they can create a digital realm that you can exist in and it's indistinguishable from this world yeah that's gonna happen it's gonna happen it's just gonna take time if we don't blow ourselves up it might take other thing we have plagues and yeah if we don't get by the demon climate stuff we don't get attacked by aliens we have us if we can survive for a certain amount of time in prosperity one of the aliens coming to get us I don't think they're gonna come get us okay mmm they're probably gonna stop us from destroying the world I bet they would do that yeah like they were really watching they rose from another I wouldn't think it'd be a good idea to fuck with people let's just let them sort this out hopefully they'll get it right but I definitely would want to step in before they hit the nukes right you know like we can't let them nuke the whole planet idiots India right they both have nuclear weapons oh yeah and they're right next to each other well when Trump was fighting with Kim Jong hoon and I was like I'm like we're really close please just Pakistan do they have nuclear weapons as well it's well India for certain has right they're right next to each other and they hate each other and they get mad like one dude that if he's like really pissed off Pakistan's weapons of mass destruction is one of the nine states to possess nuclear weapons Pakistan began development nuclear weapons in January of 1972 under Prime Minister Zozo fiqar al Bhutto Ali Bhutto Zilpha car I want to say his name I'm fucking it up no disrespect who delegated the program hmm okay and so everyone is just like what a gentleman's agreement that zolf a car Ali Bhutto Prime Minister's it's that's a crazy thing to like parts of the world that just have wacky ass names you know like there's a dude who fights in the UFC mmm-hmm he's the UFC lightweight champion and he's from Dagestan they have a totally different way of using words over though yeah and their names are crate like his name's khabib nurmagomedov it's like this it's this powerful you know Russian sounding name it so identifies you at that part of the world yeah I came like that there's a guy mago beds share his name is beat mago bed sharapov Wow I fucked it up so good thing that name is a beat Muhammad Shara Paul yeah yeah still sounds terrible coming out of my mouth terrible incredible fighter and he's from that part of the world - oh there's Mago med sheriff awfully long name like that name shows you that's that part of the world it's like like but Mike tunes hi I'm uh I'm Jim Smith yeah that's so American we have like a yes name program well we got people came off the boat right it's Williams Nova Vic Jones pit Jones good to see you Oh have you met Pete Jones where's Pete Jones Idaho Pete Jones don't know no no or they would just take your trade oh you're shoemaker there's your name Craig shoemaker ya nuts but but some parts of the world they have fucking gallant names you know long with you like liberal use of Z's yeah but he's a lot of Z's yeah but like some languages though it's like this huge long name and then it's like a zero with a slash you're like that's how they write it it's like all this long name can be represented by like a tiny symbol and some things are true I don't know like um like a Chinese symbol yeah exactly like that imagine having to learn that now at a grown age oh learn Mandarin so hard yeah fucking really hard yeah you got a brain injury you just could understand it you couldn't explain anyone that's had what had to happen what you're seeing Yeah right yeah I'm I'm to think the crazy thing about Asian characters to it they developed a whole different way of saying stuff they developed a way of saying stuff like they can recreate our language inside their language but they're doing it with these little symbols and they all kind of know what it all means and it's all push together like that yeah well we look at it as just like a bunch of lines that we don't understand but if you could see it like that would be one of the weirder things about learning to read it all of a sudden it would look like language right yeah it's no longer just symbols it's no longer nonsense yeah look at that and don't they read from certain languages read the other direction right left imagine if you had to write all that out oh good lord but that's and that's perfect yeah that's like beautifully look imagine like you know how bad doctors have prescription handwriting stuff terrible what's his note look like you know do you have to really understand man yeah oh there was supposed to have three dots I've gotten mail like actual mail from friends like oh Christmas cards something like that and they write something in it and I'm like hey bro what did you want to say to me because I can't read a word what that scratch was but they still send it to you Oh what is that well no wonder they don't oh my god but that's how they're doing in Chinese that's the Chinese version of it see what that is Oh oh Jesus Christ you imagine what kind of 10th degree black belt in Chinese you'd have to be to even understand what the fuck that is that's amazing of course though it just makes sense if we're thinking the people of terrible handwriting in English what would they have terrible handwriting in Chinese for sure yeah I mean that's illegible like if you told me that was Chinese I'm like bro that Scrolls kind of looks like Chinese duck but Wow look how everything flows and it's on top of each other oh it looks like letters that are being attacked by a tornado doesn't it looks like letters that are all being attacked by cartoon tornadoes at the bottom everything's a tornado attack it's a complicated language though it's so much more interesting than our ISM so I'm so bummed out that I'm too stupid to learn at this day and age I mean it's hard Spanish is useful though there's way more Spanish people over here of course it's more spanish-speaking people but it's uh not it's the beauty of Spanish is that things sound like they're spelled the hard part of the English language is so many things are not mmm pronounced how they're spelled yeah so Spanish literal yeah and Spanish is all using the same letters that we use you know like if you had to learn Russian there's a bunch of those little weird Russian symbols you like what is that yeah but that must be how a Russian looks at English they don't speak but the thing is about other countries a lot of them are bilingual oh yeah oh we're we're way behind with that behind I lived in Spain for a year and everybody there spoke two languages really at minimum and a lot of them were coming from other countries and they spoke multiple languages there I wonder if that's one of the things that makes places like Italy or countries like that a little bit more like artistically sophisticated still maybe maybe it's that the fact that everybody knows more than one language and one of their brains just work a little better doing that processing two languages mm-hmm like think about all the weird like every time I visited Italy I'm like how did all this art come out of this one place I know a lot of it they stole from other spots or the Romans but just this shit that they made for sure in Italy is like this one little country yeah how the fuck did you guys do this they had a really good coffee but my argument falls apart under scrutiny because they just spoke Italian back then right they didn't speak English back then did they uh I don't think so they probably never made contact with each other like they do now well like even now you're like you'll go to like a a gelato shop and the the cashiers like fluent in like Italian and English you're like you couldn't make good kids million dollars and the somewhat you know being a translator but there's like oh we all know two languages that's just how it is yeah some of them are perfect but it's like such a valued skill you know rare and they'd only think they even know how much that they have like what value they have in them I used to know this dude that is do Taekwondo with and he was a he was at an international shipment guy he get things in other countries and bring them back to America and sell them and this is like pre-internet like I said liver pizzas with this dude he's trying to start his business yeah but anyway he could learn languages he just had a unique ability to learn language oh yeah it was really into it and he would like recite things from these languages to him like damn dude that's impressive it's funny they just kept learning he was really into learning languages and then you know he'd buy and sell things from other countries he could talk to these people on the phone like different languages yeah well I think it's like having a musical skill mm-hmm I think you hear things like you are just able to translate it better yeah hey my one of my best friends brought up but he speaks like five languages okay I can't I think you just have to be predispositioned to be good at that do you think so mm-hmm is that what it is or is it just you just have to love it I think it's a combo of like you have to love it you have to practice it but I do think certain people have like the gift to do it more than others mm-hmm I wonder how many kids become really good singers as adults because they get encouraged to do it as children and they develop their vocal cords and their ability to project while they're growing right I wonder if it's the same thing it's raining it yeah yeah the same thing it's like there's certain physical skills like martial arts in particular where they think that the very very elite cream of the crop they start really young really and yeah guys like Floyd Mayweather started boxing really really young and he's pretty much regarded the best boxer ever and yes as he grew up he grew up like his body was developing while he was boxing right you know so it becomes almost like a part of who you are and your body and your skills become one of the thing yeah and they think that when you're learning and you're like in your 30s like say if you are like a pretty athletic person you're learning in your 30s you were always going to have like a giant deficit right when you're dealing with a guy like Floyd Mayweather yeah because it's just so second thing in his bones it's in his DNA it's clean and honed so the pathways are so polished and he has so much understanding cuz he's been doing his whole life yeah it's it's like there's certain things you see almost like you can't catch up can't catch up to certain that you have to if you want to if you want to develop those skills to like the the ultimate peak for some people it has to be done while they're growing and evolving it seems seems as and I was wondering if that was the case with voices too if we little kids are singing we're really I'm one of those little kids develop amazing voices create like strengthening it as you think so right like swimmers they start gymnast yeah yeah everybody starts young yeah it would make sense that you know I feel like there's a lot of energy involved in singing I can't sing but I feel like there's a lot of projection energy involved in it I would think that if you learn how to do that as you're young as your body's growing and developing it'll I would think so I would think so yeah you know people get classically trained they get all these different trainings yeah but if you started younger it does seem like you would be at such an advantage I wonder if that's the case with talking shit to talk shit when you're really young becomes a real problem as you get older yeah that's hard to learn oh yeah it's hard to learn how to talk shit yeah thirties and forties you least have siblings I feel like they're good at talking shit or good friends right my friends that can shit on you yeah it's not a bad thing yeah it's if it's funny you know it's fucking good for you it's good for everybody yeah it's look it's we're funny people are funny well I think that's what made me is have a thicker skin I have two older brothers yeah so you're just like from day one there's not your position but they let they love you but they talk to you in a different you're not coddled you know brothers they're just like toughen up yeah it's a totally different kind of relationship yeah they know you they're they they know that every day you you know it's some you always find that really tough people they're really toughest people a lot of them not all of them but a lot of them they have older brothers that used to beat their ass yeah the best fighters in the UFC oh yeah like I don't fight because why would I fight but if I had to like protect myself right I know that old-school fighting with my brothers would just come out cuz that instinct would come back that like fighter flight no you're like oh my brother's about to beat the shit out of me I better toughen up and fight back yeah cuz I didn't care if you were a girl there was no like oh that's your girl you can't hit girls about we'd be like I not be an instigator to like eight I was like that's what you got fuck you you're eight that's America's that brothers Wow your brothers they the ones the oldest ones seven years older than me and the middle ones three years older than me oh my god so that's a lot yes ladies a lot sevens ridiculous yeah it's almost like you're dead oh my god you might dad yeah but yeah like I had I remember I got sent to the principal's office like second great cuz I gave some of the bird how did you learn her where'd that come from like my brother that's hilarious yeah that makes sense that you that would lead you to comedy they turned into like really good guys but like when they were young I heard stories like when they would walk past that that was back when people would keep their doors open in our little town everyone see my brother's coming home and shut their doors like they were like the rug rats of the neighborhood's I just learned to be you know a little feisty do you think that helps you in comedy it certainly certainly helps because you just you know we all eat shit at some point but that's that's the hardest thing for people to take right yeah oftentimes well is yeah it's hard cuz you're like it's just you in a microphone if you're bombing it's you yes sweat through it yeah I mean it certainly helps like you know social media that we talked about it's brutal at Tom's you just are like yeah you know it's not fun you just kind of shrug it off and go hell and move on yeah but those bombings are so valuable yeah for sure damn they're valuable I'll yours are so valuable like we look at them like they're really bad and it's terrible and but if you have energy failures are valuable because that makes you realize like I got some correct me to do yeah I gotta figure out what the fuck went wrong I gotta I gotta get her and re-energize this you yeah cuz if people were just laughing you're is not making you get better and that's why yes what sometimes you just sweat it but it does make you're like oh something's not working here yeah so I try to pretend that I just bombed every day yeah just about I've thought about it that way like 10 like I'm doing a set right after I bombed get to work right no yeah it's a weird thing we do mm-hmm it's doesn't get any less weird no you keep doing it 20 30 years it's still weird yeah it's weird well I think that's why with the stand that was a great equalizer these you know huge comics can go for their audiences go kill kill kill but then they gotta go back to the comedy club and with that new stuff and start from square one don't work it back up so it doesn't matter how big you are everybody's got to go back to the club at some point and that's the beauty of it really is that's the beauty of this era we've all been we've been talking about that a lot lately because it's such an important point you you become a beginner again yeah cuz you have new shit you know and you know I was hanging out with Tommy this weekend Tom Segura was in Vegas who just happened to be there doing stand-up the same way I'm same weekend I'm there for the UFC yeah so they he came to the fights and I came to see a show oh that's cool and his show he's he's got you know his special is just about to come out and he's got all this new shit that he's working out at the clubs and all service it's so fun to see that stage where someone's putting it together yeah you know they got these big laughs and he's got these this part where they're trying to figure out where this goes and then you can see how much is vis new and how much of his polished where he's going with do you I mean I'm like Tom who's you know so seasoned do you look at stuff I never really hey I have a suggestion or you kind of just you know do you ever I really sauce I mean we talk about stuff and he'll give me one to tell me you know I love it when you did this way first show you did it this way we definitely do that to each other yeah if you see something glaringly yeah you know like we ask you to the two like Bert and I were talking about a new bit that he had where he did it one way during the first show and he missed the part of why it got such a big laugh and we were explaining it I was like I was like this is how cuz I watched both sides I was like this is how I saw the first one but this is how I saw the second one you were implying something that's more funny right and he was like oh right yeah okay so that yeah so I needed more of a pause there I was like exactly right like otherwise it seems like it's a part of the sentence before yeah I love that I love getting that feedback yeah oh it's great getting it too you know some good comics have given me really good advice mm-hmm it's cool when you see it through somebody else's eyes yeah for sure cuz yeah there's so many things you miss mm-hmm yeah because Bert Bert was doing that with me he was like oh you said this thing you got to go back to that thing right and explore it you know like you record all your sets I listened to half of them yeah we're even a board I record all of them yeah that's how I learned how to do it feel like if I if I learn that way it seems to me that when I'm doing it is just it's always just trying to do your best right right and for me part of doing my best I have to hear it I gotta listen to it yeah and if I felt like something went weird or something was clunky or I tried to do something backwards do the punchline first and she's just fucking around with a bit trying to expand on it I need to hear it yeah I need hear it I need to hear it I mean yeah science right it is kind of but it's also like like what's great about Joey Diaz is that it's an art right there's no science to him right it's feel it's just he know he knows what's funny right it's it's you know buddy's like that all the time I listen fortune got the chip what's got the shit yeah he just cut this shit and yeah and he's got a lot of opinions and they're funny yeah I just start with what's funny to me and then expand from there and hope that other people find them funny if they don't you jump ship trying to bit yeah but when you doing it you're doing it for a specific reason right you're doing it because you're trying to figure out how to make it work yeah yeah that's a little little science project you're doing mm-hmm you know yeah it's kind of crazy well cuz you know that certain stories from your life or family or whatever funny yeah sometimes like like but how do I get that across in it not via you had to be there moment you know I mean do you think how do you make the audience be there that's the part for me that's always what I'm aiming for mmm I don't want them to go away going oh I guess you had to be there to find that funny I want them to be like I felt like I was in that moment with you watching it happen I like that yeah well that's just a really good joke right I always say that most jokes that you see recorded it's probably 70% as funny as it was if you were there right do you feel like that's accurate for sure yeah because there's a feeling that you get when you're laughing with people there's a communal feeling yeah fun about being the audience yeah yeah part of the fun of what we do is the fact we do it in front of an audience everybody's jazzing the off experience everyone having a good time and the audience can control you so much of the mood of the show yes you know sure for sure when you're live are you watching it at home rather you're you're just getting a ghost yeah I'm your ghost of that night Yeah right you know you're not getting the full juice it seems like someone's funny what I'm saying is if someone thinks you're funny from Netflix and I'm sure they will you're more funny right on top of that you're more funny on top of that no one percent yeah it's just cuz there's a magic as a matter of people you know you watch them live oh my god it's one of the cool things about what we do is it has to be done live and then it has to it has to learn you have to learn how to do it live yeah you to practice it live [Laughter] know what's going on now though you know they know you're doing that before like when people would come to see you they wanted every bit to be you know polished and done and ready but now they know that if you come to the Tuesday night to the comic store there's gonna be some clunky premises talking about there's I sometimes you have a new idea and you just get it off wrong right out of the gate and you can't recover ya can't recover one flat tire who's next yeah Joey comes murders how many nights a week E going up I'm doing hitting different clubs probably three to two three a week oh that's cool yeah but I go I don't go like to the comedy store every week I'll change it up new different shows around town yeah what are the other spots like to hit uh I do store Laugh Factory improv hit up flappers sometimes gonna go to flappers is a good place to work out you ever do the ice house yeah do the ice house like all shows Largo here and there there's some mother like rooms that do like gay shows those shows but for me it's always important I it would be easy for me to go to the gay rooms and just do those shows those audiences they know my my story is similar to their story they know my thing for me as a comic hitting the store is always gotta be part of the routine because I want I wanna like appeal to the bros to the straight chicks to the married couple to the whoever I don't want my thing to be for one group of people I think that attitude is why you're so fuckin funny I mean but you have such a good attitude about it like you that's such a professional approach you know you're looking at it objectively and you're saying I want to mix it all up I want to do everything cuz there will be times I'm going to the store where I know like have a new bit I don't know how I'm like I get anxiety like I know it's gonna be hard but I got to do it because that's the only way to get better you know and if I could just go to this alt room and kill and be like but it you walk away go on yeah but you're preaching to the choir yeah yeah exactly like what did I what did I accomplish from that right and then so for me this store has always got to be part of my workout because uh you know you see do you see the arms cross yeah what do you got you know and then you have to slowly see those arms unfold and you don't win those people over good for you and it doesn't always happen but it makes you keep keep at it you know that's why things are you already 13 years in you're doing a theater tour well that's really is your the over very professional attitude about it well I love I love comedy I love stand-up I respect the art form I know I'm like on the newer side of it even 13 years and and I just trying to find my place in it and you know how to keep getting better at it well I really I think that's why you're so good I really do and I'm a fan yeah I think you're very very funny I appreciate that I enjoy working with you really I mean I look up to you so much I mean don't do that no there's no I mean your storytelling is like unbelievable I think that one of them I saw you doing that um
