the Joe Rogan experience Wow so for you you had this traumatic experience of violence when you were young you were depressed you were trying to figure out what the source of this was whether it was some sort of a chemical imbalance in your brain when when they say chemical imbalances in the brain have are they capable of measuring the level of serotonin in your brain yes so there's a huge debate about this you couldn't for example do autopsies and there's a big debate about but that's when someone's dead yeah but there's a big debate about so there seems to be most scientists agree not all of them and there are some people who dissent from this but most scientists agree low serotonin correlates with depression right but it's not the same thing in the same way stretch marks correlate with obesity but they're not reported obesity they're the product of it so there are real brain changes that happen which I write about in lost connection isn't important to say that I don't think they should be described as chemical imbalances but one thing that was really shocking to me was one of the British experts on this dr. David Healy said to me and you can't even say the sir idea that depression causes serotonin you can't even say that that theory is discredited because it was never credited there was never a time when half of the scientists in the field believed that right the reason that story got sold to me and most people listening to this in the 90s is because it worked really well for the drug companies right because what it makes it sound like if you've just got a chemical imbalance the solution is just to give you chemicals now it's important to say chemical antidepressants do play a role we can measure that and there's a slightly nuanced point to make about this which is so depression is measured by something called the Hamilton scale right I've always felt sorry for whoever Hamilton was that the only way we remember him is by her fucking miserable we are but anyway so how the scale goes from one where you are you know dancing around in ecstasy or on ecstasy to 51 when you would be acutely suicidal right and to give you a sense of what movement on the Hamilton scale looks like if you move six points on the Hamilton scale sorry if your sleep patterns get better you'll gain six points on the Hamilton scale and if your sleep patterns deteriorate so you have a baby who's crying all the time you'll generally lose six points on the Hamilton scale right so professor Irvin Kershner medical school did the best research on this and what he found is on average chemical antidepressants mu people 1.8 points on the Hamilton scale right about a third of what improving your sleep patterns does it's important to say that's an average so some people do get more than that some people get less and you can see one point eight points is not nothing right if you're acutely suicidal one point eight points can take the edge off there's real value in giving people that relief but it's not solving the problem for most people I thought I was you know weird for being on antidepressants for so long and remaining depressed turns out I was totally typical according to dr. Stephen Lodi a professor of psychology he's done a lot of work on this between 65 and 80% of people taking chemical into depressants become depressed again this is a guy who is a real Bernie Sanders supporter open Bernie Sanders supporter who worked for the DNC the DNC absolutely rigged the primary against Bernie Sanders he was aware of this he was there while this was all going down so is Donna Brazile everyone was aware of it the guy got fucking murdered after he leaked information to WikiLeaks if you don't think that's a little weird what are you looking at what what what delusional rose-colored glasses are you looking at your party from but you think you're in some Julia Roberts movie from 1990 this is real shit some guy got killed he was 24 years old he was a young guy who was very optimistic and had this view of the world where he mean the kind of fucking war American flag pants and shirt there's a famous picture of him with a beer on means the Patriot that a lot of ways he wanted to be involved in the political process he was very idealistic because is he was probably shattered by finding out to the party that he was working for was corrupting the democratic process and because I've said this before you know I've been accused of helping Donald Trump win by really wacky people online like by pointing out all that flaws of Hillary Clinton like look man you can't ignore that shit because you want one side to win I've talked about all of his flaws too if there's a lot of flawed human beings that run for president pretty much all of them I mean it's very rarely if someone's not flawed rights tremely flawed we're all flawed but extremely flawed who wants to be the fucking king of the world it's very rare well you know not to change subjects but Barack Obama everyone thinks is the greatest guy in the world you know in contrast to Donald Trump because he was polite he's a statesman he was he was sight but at the end what he was polite at the same time he let cops crack the heads of peaceful protesters at Occupy Wall Street all across the country said he put on a soft shoe to stand up for unions he fucked over unions in Wisconsin when they took the teachers union away he opened the Arctic to drilling twice whenever shale oil wanted he said okay and he only closed it when they didn't want to do it anymore he took us from two wars to seven he cooked out five million families out of their homes instead of helping them and he made wall street whole while fucking over everybody else so this guy he and he made the Bush tax cuts permanent so there was what they say is that it looked like it was change on the outside continuity on the inside just come fly through the windshield is this the flat earth Gaia oh that guy's crazy he's only raised 110 dollars hold on it's only 110 dollars at a ten thousand dollar goal listening flat earthers you need to put your money where your mouth is I'm starting to believe that you don't really believe in this cause ya send my boy Michael Hughes ten thousand dollars you get your liver-spotted hands off my mother this is a bailed on the first ship sails right I don't think he's actually does he launched himself into space yet I think they got delayed a few times I'm surprised gonna do it they the government got involved it was like yeah you can't do that you know that is such a crazy move I'm surprised he doesn't fucking he has $10,000 if Eddie you think there is flat fucking give this guy some money what about that b.o.b character isn't Eva wealthy this is a single for F well it's because he's been too busy with Flat Earth theory listen man once he understands the fucking real true image of the earth and then you have a wall that surrounds the outer realm of the earth and everybody thinks the Worth is wrong you got some shit to tell the people it's more important than your rap song you're right you made things Ron you got to get people whoa look at the guy from blink 182 what moved on y'all gotta take this Flat Earth shit to the next level fuck the flat versus round argument let's talk more about the simulation and who's programming it is that's how both sides get benefit if it's round or flat oh my god like real bees going through some shit you're not fuckin flattered stuff what else can we talk here's the thing and this is something really important for anybody who's listening to this you you got to not hang yourself on your ideas I've done it I did in the past when you do that you're not really paying attention you're only looking for things that support your idea it's called confirmation bias everybody if everybody's susceptible to it included I've I've done it a hundred times to myself in the past but once you realize what it is if you keep doing the same goddamn thing then you're being stupid so once you know what it is and you know it's possible let's just look at this look at all the overwhelming amount of evidence from super geniuses that say it's round just you got to walk away it's it's it hurts you it hurts your view of the world to believe that because you can't believe it if you're really paying attention so if you believe that what you're saying is you have a very limited box in which you're willing to operate in you're not willing to accept anything outside of what you've already got as a preconceived idea and you're ignoring massive amounts of data that points to the fact that you're wrong so by doing that you limit your own view of yourself yeah you you you become you you don't trust in the way you view things anymore you're boxed in it's very dangerous to be committed to something you know is not true it also shows the level intelligence too because when you got these geniuses who spent their entire lives doing doing this stuff in astrophysics you're telling me that they're part of this scheme too and they believe that it's this is 100 percent of the problem 100 percent its adopting an idea too soon that's a hundred percent of the idea because once you once you adopt that idea and then you hang on to it now you're fucked like Bigfoot man Bigfoot was a big one for me I was I was convinced it was really wrong with you how long ago was this not when I Jobs oh yeah that's totally legit you know dude if you can get a guy into that position that shit will hurt yeah if you get a guy like Gordon Ryan puts you in something like that just for fun yeah oh fuck your legs up but here's it go back to it again I don't think it's a good position for a couple reasons though like right there it's good if you can get to that if you can get to that but I'm not sure here's the catch stop in him I'm not sure what's stopping him from scooting his butt towards that guy's right leg here's the cab but is that if you can roll over while you're in the figure four leglock it completely reverses the Polar's of the of the earth pain of the pain so then Ric Flair we go well let me see by the way that's also true in real life I've tested that well what I'm saying is like the position it's you would there's a natural way to defended that it doesn't seem like the guys defending it that's why like look oh he's trying to keep him from putting it in there I stepped on his dick because he stepping on his dick a little bit that's the under tape Wow you allowed to okay oh this is a shirt legs oh yeah that's a heel hook yeah okay the guy here's why this is so fucking stupid the guy is getting his leg cranked is actually the guy who's in the best position he's in a heel hook position yeah she just grabbed his leg right so who's supposed to be getting hurt here this is actually the guy in black the guy in black is no no the guy in black has a better position all he has to do is reach back with his right arm and hook time his elbow on to the ankle no you timeout motherfucker this is not a figure four leglock this is embarrassing that's a heel look he's giving him a heel hook and the other guys pretending he's in pain this is crazy this isn't even a figure four leglock doesn't know what this is it's on a lot of fighting your fourth oh come on look he's in agony no he's got a fucking heel hook take the heel look it's right there you go like this you clap your hands together this match is over I mean it's a hundred percent over in real life yeah well what the fuck are they doing that what are they doing winners or losers everybody gets a trophy is that what you're doing you show in a terrible position the guy in white is in trouble what happened how's the dip in use right now I broke out yeah the other guys doing it wrong for the whole fucking time this [Applause]
