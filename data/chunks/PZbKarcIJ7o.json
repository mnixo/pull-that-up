hello freak bitches what about the ideas of the universe is in a constant state of contraction no it isn't and man and well I mean don't people think that know something abandoned something cystal argue that it's there's a cycle well it looks nice and they are good I think most of most people I mean there's some people arguing for that you know I don't find that something neat well I think they're trying to type their ignorance and something that isn't any more plausible in the picture that it expands forever and as far as we can tell the most likely possibility is that our universe will expand forever but to make you a little bit happier it's quite possible the best pictures that we have of our of the early universe is that we actually our universe isn't unique isn't alone that there are many universes we call it a multiverse and that at any instant in time in kind of a cosmic super time there's always universe being born so that that multiverse might be might be infinite and eternal where are they outside of our universe how's that impossible of course it's possible I understand I'm not questioning it okay no no here's one line it well first of all the simplest possibility is that they're outside the region we can see right for for example the edges of our visible universe space is expanding faster away from us than light because you know we taught you in school nothing can travel faster than light you may remember that from right we lied okay well no you have to parse it more carefully like a lawyer nothing can travel through space faster than light but space can do whatever the hell it wants so locally as I told you that radio host ism is at rest they're not moving and the other end of the galaxy the other in the visible universe and we're rest but the space between us is expanding so that galaxies like a surfer is being carried away from us faster than light relative to the water the surfer isn't moving right but relative the shore the surfer is right right okay so this this galaxy is not moving relative to its local surroundings but its ruling away from us faster than light and like a surfer and undertow they can swim really fast in the water but if the water is moving away from the shore then let me get back to the shore right and so that galaxy the light from that galaxy is traveling through space at the speed of light but it's a space in between us and the galaxies moving faster than light then the poor light can never make it to us we call that a horizon Wow so the space is traveling too far for the light to reach us so our best the traffic base is too fast so this light can't catch up with the expansion of space and it never gets to us and that that galaxy disappears from our causal horizon we call it we'll never be able to see it we'll never be able to interact with it we'll never be okay and it could be that that there are different regions so far away from us where space is expanding faster than light which which have a very different history than our own so there could be space could be infinite just our simple unity space that we know of and love could be infinite in extent and different regions of that space had different histories in some of those regions everything we can see we know emerged from a single point okay we can tell that we can tell that by measuring the Big Bang expansion of everything we see and working backwards in the universe that our visible universe was once smaller and smaller and smaller if we go back in time we can actually follow the laws of physics back to the earliest moments of the Big Bang until those laws break down and we can make predictions about the universe should look like all those predictions agree exactly with the observations we make which tell us that that picture works but another region if you wish could have come from a different Big Bang but is that another universe or is it a part of the universe now when you see here's how we've changed and this is semantics but non-trivial semantics namely when I was a kid universe meant every everything right but we say that's a pretty stupid definition a better definition is an operational one universe means that region of space with which at one time we could have communicated or one time in the future even if the futures infinite we might communicate with because that describes the region of space where cause and effect works some measurable distance yes and so that are we think of a universe as that region which could throughout which everything could affect everything else ultimately in an infinitely long time and in that picture universes can be restricted in size and then other regions which could never have affected us and which will never affect us in the future we call other universes and when and now there are many different versions of a multiverse but that's a simplest version and this picture we call inflation which you know I talked to I just did two little clips associated with the new book of one force for publisher and one was for big thing one is a universe in under two minutes so you can look up online look for Lawrence Krauss explains the universe in under two minutes where I talk about this cosmic expansion and how it might mean there's a multiverse but the other is I explain the universe in terms of this beer bottle that I talked about to you earlier so you can that's a video you can watch that but it this theory of inflation which actually says our universe could the quality qualities that we see of our universe can best be explained if some early time in the history of the universe when it was a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a second old it had a huge expansion suddenly and increased in size by 30 orders of magnitude in size in a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a second which is by the way particle physics suggest is highly plausible even though okay and then and then and then it would produce the universe that looks more or less like we looked like he looked like and and and it's right now the only explanation of how that would cause the universe to look like what it looks like but the neat thing about inflation is it's eternal so inflation that puffing up and it in our universe and then boom a hot big bang followed it okay so the region universe universe puffed up by huge amount and all of that energy which was stored in empty space got released like the beer bottle and we got a hot Big Bang and the rest is history but that's locally but somewhere else between us and air space is still expanding exponentially and faster and faster and faster and only maybe somewhere else today boom like an ice crystal forming boom that that region of space is suddenly left inflation and maybe a guilt the gazillion years in the future to be another region of space that's expanding away from it so much faster than light so we'll never know about it we're suddenly that region leaves inflation and boom another hot big bang happens and it turns out in each of those hot big bangs after the inflation ends depending upon how it ends the laws of physics could be different in that universe and that's how we tend to think it's quite likely that there are many many separate regions of space and in fact it's eternal so such regions are forming eternally for all time and and and there are hot big bangs happening in many regions and the properties of each of those regions whether they're conducive to forming galaxies and stars and planets and people may be different so we could say logically in that picture that the reason the universe looks like the way it does is because we're here to measure it oh my god we should leave it at that okay we should close with that that is the mind blower grind blow it [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
