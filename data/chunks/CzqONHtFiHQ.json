you got me to leave my house for the first time in five weeks I'm so happy you left and I'm so happy you got tested yeah the first time in five weeks that I've left the house and yeah I got tested and and everything's great so but I'm not like you know paranoid or anything like that just spray down baby how bad is all this Lysol for us stuff is pretty good this is a real question right how bad is all this Lysol yeah but no great to be here thank you my pleasure me and man what I haven't I haven't left my house in five weeks I've been isolating has a responsible citizen right yes yeah and I feel good I feel first of all I was excited to be here I decided to have you here I posted that I've been going through my computer's I'm at home I'm going through my computers and just killing time I live alone okay I happen to be single at this point in my life ladies there you go huh right before this happened and I kind of think to myself sometimes I think okay imagine if I had been in a relationship that hadn't been going well and this happened and then you have to make the decision to isolate with somebody I'm not in that situation I'm home alone and I've been talking a lot to my friends on FaceTime and I've been socializing and I've been you know living life in this world but alone in my house I'm going through my computers started going through old footage I found that clip from when you came up to my house back in the day and yeah I just I I saw this moment where I just jump right into this if that's cool sure because this I saw this moment in the clip where we started talking about my old web show and you've come up to my house back Monday and it was so cool that you came up then and I remember at the time your website was like way advanced right like it had all sorts of extra stuff on it that people weren't really doing on the web back then and you came up we just start talking about the web and I because on my webmaster Andrew Blevins shoutout to Andrew uh-huh he's a wizard at web creating so I was always really into the web stuff you know I had my website I started my web site early when I was you know up in Canada and I was really thought that was cool and we started talking about what I was doing which was kind of crazy right and then you just started talking about you said you said what what what we gotta do is figure out how we're gonna make some money off this and I'm like yeah and I'm like oh yeah I know it's not I mean yeah I'd been trying I had been trying I've been going to you know advertisers instead they were like what you know what what do you mean the internet you know but it's kind of funny that I saw that clip I thought that's hilarious cuz you know not to not to you know blow too much smoke up your ass but clearly you figured hope how to make money off of it and was hilarious I'm like that's hilarious and prophetic moment how could we make money off of it now we're here in this beautiful studio it was a few moments that really planted a seed in my head to do something like this online this yours was a big one yeah donate your house and seeing how you had servers you had full cables like folks this room is not as sophisticated as Tom Green's home was in 2007 that's how crazy it was there was some weird stuff in there yeah but you had it set up like in it you had a whole internet service provider set up at your house like like you could have run like a network in 2007 you had all those you had that whole rack all that equipment I walked in that room and it's humming and I'm like holy shit uh-huh it was like gr8 drive the gr8 drives yeah I was like this is crazy this is your house and that's like folks like back then you had to have these cables that snake through the house like so everything was taped down I was like fuck dude this is like you you literally turned your house into a set mm-hmm like it was much more like a set than anything I'd ever seen before outside of a set it would light screwed into the ceiling yeah I kind of trashed my place I even figured out how to take video calls from people that was exciting that was exciting I had this this yeah it is Tom Green yeah yeah yeah and that the TV on the wall yeah and there's my dog Steve oh poor Steve oh and look I have don't have gray in my beard look at that yeah young man back this was probably around 2007 I guess yeah and that's that was the back corner of my living room there it's a gene you can see all the wires going up see that that's going up into the ceiling up through the ceiling into the spare room which I turned into the editing room look how crazy all this equipment is yeah dude you are so ahead of everybody that's actually a little later actually I'm looking at this now this is later this is after okay so I can tell cuz that's an actual that's not the TriCaster that's an actual television switcher I forget what model it's a Sony switcher so you started with a TriCaster and I've been called a Video Toaster system first I had that for a year then we got this the first version of the TriCaster that's Victor who was working on the show he's stoked that I'm here today I still talk to Victor quite a bit shoutout to Victor Victor what's up but so yeah so that was a little later but still kind of you know we're talking three years later so 2010 ish yeah yeah look at all your like your lighting and everything like you had done it where you would basically instead of like putting cameras in your house you turn your house into a studio it was like legit mm-hmm I remember thinking oh my god because Anthony cou Mia had a kind of pretty high tech set up in his basement yeah that was another inspiration yeah yeah cuz he was doing that while he was doing Opie and Anthony and you know they actually his employers at the time wanted him to stop doing it they decided somehow another it's not he shouldn't be allowed to do an extra show right he's like but I'm just promoting the serious show all right this is free like we could see it it's fun so Anthony would do karaoke with machine guns in front of green screen uh-huh you still still kicking ass on the intern wait he has his own Network yeah actly yeah yeah yeah I love that guy he's a he's a unique dude he was great on Opie and Anthony he was always really funny and just like like a comic but he never did standup yeah it's really interesting he's like the most comic II comic guy that I've ever met that never did stand-up is Anthony Combe yeah 100% could have been a great comic 100% I think sometimes people that I mean I'm just making this up right now but I think sometimes people that have never done stand-up who do are afraid of it you know cause it's like because they can they can is the scary thing doing on stage you know in front of an audience if you've never done it before but you get comfortable behind that mic but anyways yeah man it was so cool when you came up because I remember like I think there was like Entertainment Tonight was there that day or something like that or that and yes that's right and you left this made this quote to them and that went out and it was defining what's happened you know you were just saying you know like we don't need the advertisers anywhere we don't need the network's anymore we don't you know we can't go straight to the advertiser I always is that video available anywhere I think I saw it on the Internet some glasses in you of me saying that it's kind of hilarious if you stop and think about how all this internet stuff has played out since then mm-hmm it's like Street and there was this pre-youtube right and like nobody was uploading to YouTube you had to have your own Tom Green Comm set up so I remember I got a call this is one of those like you know when you think about think back and you sort of kick yourself I'm you know I was it was so I mean how far in the weeds do we want to get technically I was yeah it's like people right there but here I was I I had the cert that's the clip those my backwards basket baseball hat days so we were still in those days we were hosting this stuff on this site called bit gravity dot-com so we would upload our shit to that those the guys from Denver mm-hm no bit gravity is San Francisco okay San Francisco and Barrett Lyon is did you do some stuff with some guys from Denver that was that was sort of around the same time they were that was mania TV yeah and so they kind of but what I what what I did was mania TV was the only people that were really doing live streaming and I said hey you know like I want to build this TV studio and they helped me build a studio but I wanted it I wanted to be autonomous of them as well so I got my own servers through this company bit gravity where they basically invented the technology to upload video and then serve it out right so I would link that to my website Tom Green Comm completely autonomous of the other webs mania TV so you know it was some funny shit that happened there because you know I remember like I think back ago I really made a few mistakes like I go I want all the stuff to be on my website right and then YouTube started you know what's this so YouTube uh that's cool they're doing a thing out of an apartment in San Fran I remember at one point somebody called me from YouTube is it hey man we really like what you're doing with your thing I'm like oh that's cool cool man yeah yeah I'm kind of doing my own thing over here yeah that's cool I like what you're doing too and never really kind of connected with them cuz I thought I was thinking at the time it's got to all be on your server right so you have those views not thinking okay we could have it out spread it send it up just get the eyeballs on it so but it was it was exciting it was exciting time everybody thought that I mean no one could've ever saw what YouTube had been yeah or has become yeah it's great what's crazy about YouTube is that there's not another one that's just YouTube it's like there's Vimeo and a few other fairly popular video sites yeah but it's like the XFL compared to the NFL or something like that not even the XFL is done right do they just go under yeah it's done you know now it's like comparing the two of them because all those other video things it's like yeah you'll get some views well it's just YouTube for whatever reason captured they have the market it never became MySpace you won't remember YouTube now something as simple as uploading video yeah I mean obviously it's complex right like just being able to get it onto the website and make sure it streams and all the technical stuff super complex but just the concept is pretty simple you with your phone or a video camera you film it you can upload it like real simple anybody can do it and then anybody all sudden get views like that is amazing that one company has that locked up it's kind of crazy cuz you would think that like boy that would be something that everybody would want to get involved in look how much money YouTube is making yeah I would I would I haven't thought about that but I guess kind of not the amount of of advancement that happens every six months in in technology and they've got the funding to be able to stay right on top of it and just make it the strongest platform possibly I don't know even Twitter like how they do that there's like one Twitter yeah I mean there's Facebook and I guess people hold discussions on Instagram but if I read what do one things that drives me crazy about Instagram it's like if I go to your page and I'm reading one of your captions someone will say something in response to someone they like hey fuck you dick boy or whatever and then I try to click and find out what they were talking about mm-hmm and I get to the beginning of the comments and then I only go through all the comments to try to figure this out like why can't I just click so do you do that you get into the comments you're you're another able shit okay people to talk about you like just go ahead yeah if you really get into it and start reading it's like oh good and bad yeah both of them are equally toxic that's pretty good you believe the the bad you like oh my god this guy hates me so much it's a pretty good you know form of restraint though to not be curious and to go read well you're always curious the key is just not giving in to it mm-hmm it's just listen there's a lot of time in a day but not if you spend it doing stupid shit you know you those things are not beneficial most of them are a waste you know like most of like the reading comments or get getting into it with people that's the big one when you see people like arguing with fans and going back and forth like that is that is a trap you're only gonna respond to the negative ones you know if you're responding to the positive ones and the negative ones people trying to get your attention some of them don't even mean what they're saying they just fifteen-year-old kids and want to rile you up it's like is that a way to talk to people uh-huh the way to talk to peoples like this hi what's up we're in front of each other that's how people talk when they're just being around people this is that we're supposed to talk yeah all this other shit is too confusing for us oh yeah we don't know how to handle it yeah and I've I've fallen into that trap for sure I've gone through sort of cycles of the way I handle comments I've become an indiscriminate blocker who is what I do now the first sign of negativity is a broom some people say oh that's not very democratic but what whatever the way I look at it in you create an environment yeah I'm trying to create a positive environment on my social media and but the problem is and what you're saying is making me second-guess myself to be honest with you because I know I spent far too much time on that shit and I'm thinking man I really should just not read that stuff time is precious yeah it's precious even now when people are forced to not work you can do one of two things right you could either drink all day which a lot of people are doing there's a hilarious video of this guy who's out jogging in his neighborhood just passed by people's recyclables point out all the empty wine bottles and empty vodka bottles and he just jogs over let's see what this guy's got boom same shit whiskey why bam-bam-bam people are just getting lit up you could do that or you could use this time to get in shape you could use this time to write out a workout program you could use this time to start reading books online you know you could you don't have to leave your house you have a Kindle just or you know or one of those Barnes knows Barnes & Noble the Nook cuz that's still around our Barnes and Nobles still real bookstores they still have books you think they don't know if they still have books about books or as I've been doing before after this that's really gonna that kind of that kind of old media you know tangible media and that's really gonna because people are getting losing their old habits now you know it's true I can't go to a bookstore now you sure Kendall and all these things are taken and bookstores were hurting already because of Amazon because you just order it online like I'm on a book it's there tomorrow yeah there's something about that like not having to leave and now the people getting used to getting groceries delivered if you live in a neighborhood that has a grocery store that delivers you can just order online they'll send it to your house so I've like I said I haven't left my house in five weeks this first time I left it's like a castaway type deal mm-hmm were you like a prisoner with an ankle brace Joe Joe Rogan calls you come okay but no one else would have gotten me out of my house really yeah absolutely Oh nobody else but I was I was very you know I'm honored to be here I love the show to have you but no listen I I have gotten good at living in my house without leaving I first of all one thing that was weird and I actually find it's strange actually I find this strange about four weeks before shit went down right for whatever reason it was happened it was it was in like it was in Italy I think it was bad over there I I'm not by any means doomsday prepper or anything like that you know in fact I'm the opposite I strive always said to myself if something went wrong you know I'd have like I don't have like one day's supply of food or something like that my house and I went before the rush on the toilet paper all that stuff I went and I got non-perishable food I got sardines I read articles about what's good protein I got you know beans I got rice I got such stocked up my pantry with stuff I've got about a month's supply of food not thinking that I was actually going to actually I mean I knew it was possible there was glimmers of it they were starting to talk about it but nothing I was actually going to be locked in my house and then all of a sudden it happened and just were being smart like wouldn't it be nice if I did have a month's supply of food yeah I talk about this stuff a lot with my friends and we're always sort of talking about the possibilities of things but you know you didn't think it was actually it happened so then it happened so then I've discovered some delivery services that deliver groceries but who are the people delivered it and are they healthy so so here's the thing though that so yeah I do I do not interact with them oh Jesus yeah they touched right again again again just just to be safe I I did disinfect them and then I take them and I put them in with gloves with rubber gloves and put them into a another room and I let it sit for three days for the virus to die and then then I start eating then I start eating I wish there was a clear answer to all this I wish there was a clear solution to all this I tell you talking to you is making me feel better well I feel better reading the latest statistics about the mortality rate I wonder what the action there's an infection rate hospitalization rate mortality rate and what was it was the study that was was at UCLA as I would was for sure and it showed of a very low fatality rate in comparison to infection so that's good news but the bad news is this you know it could still kill a lot of fucking people and people that are immune compromised people with diabetes people that are overweight people with lung problems people with cigarette habits all those and particularly one of the nurses was saying people who were into the jewel people who smoked with jewel they said there's a high instance that there that he personally was seeing of people was it the heat nurse or this she nurse told me this no what I was wondering you know I remember like it's like one month before this happened there people were having lung issues because of vapes and that what do you think that was gone a virus well it was a big thing like for like we had that explains by animates maybe that was Corona we had that explained to us by Adam curry no it wasn't really what it appeared to be what it really was is a concerted effort to conflate two things that were happening one these assholes that made like really shitty low-level THC vape pens I got people sick and pettite a couple people died I forget how many people died was it like ten people died Jamie something like that Adam Curry told us the whole story in the podcast then the cigarette companies or whoever is behind this and tried to get all tobacco vapes banned and they're trying to ban Lee I just fixing my shot could and when it be on camera I don't on the mic pocket blot my face but you're extra handsome that's the first thing I've touched you in flesh ripping about sorry oh yeah you're grossed out by too much sanitizer that's good sanitizer but it's not good I know a guy used that stuff all the time he's getting warts all over his hands now because his his immune systems all fucked up oh and sanitizing cons too Carlin bit yeah well that's really what happens like you're not supposed to use antibacterial soap you need bacteria yeah it's great bit when we would in jiu-jitsu sometimes guys would get staph infections or ringworms a big one and ringworm they would use antibacterial soap and it would wind up fucking up their whole body and they'd wind up getting it more often like they think oh I'm just using antibacterial soap all the time you're killing all the healthy shit on your the outside of your skin and then you wonder why you're getting sick all the time you wonder why your skin is getting infected and you're not like that normally but honestly is the first one that well actually that when you made me that coffee earlier mmm-hmm whatever that coffee was which was amazing that's the Laird Hamilton stuff that's black rifle coffee mixed with Laird Hamilton's turmeric which is just some Hawaii surfer yeah yeah yeah it's so good right oh my god I know coconut milk whoa it's nice yeah good for you super healthy that's the first thing that someone pops yet that I've touched in over a month that someone else had touched definitely other things you just forgot well no one's been in my house that's true you haven't left the house at all so no I've touched the groceries but I first disinfected so it's but I don't I don't expect to be like this forever well that's the question when do we go back did you see the Mayor of Las Vegas yeah this is not China this is Las Vegas Nevada so there's a line that you know on this end of the spectrum it's complete casual lackadaisical approach to what's going on there's this end of the spectrum which is I guess me right now right and then there's the middle weight which is more of yeah she on the far end we're gonna open up Las Vegas we're gonna have casinos open when are the casinos gonna open winners comedies gonna start again when are we going to be back on the road telling jokes it's a good question man my most everything I've had I think has been moved there was supposed to be some stuff in May that I was doing in Des Moines Iowa and somewhere else and that that's getting moved and the only thing that I have scheduled is July and Vegas so I'm like I don't know if that's real yeah that seems so crazy to say that I don't know here in eight whether or not I'll be able to do a gig in July in Vegas you have the podcasts you're doing the podcast you get your adrenaline rush from that I'm assuming you get an adrenaline rush from this you get it from stand-up of course right is it weird having an absence of that stand-up comedy thing not just because it's fun to do but just physically are you feeling different not getting that on stage energy rush every night no I mean I need to go down there yes and no but I know I know that I can't do anything about it so I just shut it off right I'm like I'm not gonna think about that yeah you can't think about shit that there's nothing you can do about that it'll just drive you mad I heard you're talking about that with Donnell yeah oh okay you can't to stand up right now that's just what it is is what it is but look man have you stopped the thing about think about a guy that works at grocery store okay yeah not the worst job in the world but it's fine now all of a sudden he's in a fucking war zone he's in a viral war zone he's got a hope that some coughing motherfucker doesn't give him a death sentence while he's a restocking the rice mm-hmm right it's a different word yeah different world for them I mean what I just I can't I can't go onstage for a while yeah yeah it's terrible I feel bad for the comedy clubs really I feel bad the waitresses and waiters and the kitchen staff and the managers and all the people that don't have a paycheck coming in I feel bad for them mm-hm and I'm happy to do a ton of free shows when we come back I'll just do do shows and donate all the money to the Comedy Store or The Improv or whoever happy to help but I think that it is in for us in particular it's an inconvenient thing yeah but it's not life-threatening this is a life-threatening time for some people for nurses and hospital workers is a life-threatening time for that Chicago bus driver do you see that video the bus driver yeah who's telling people please be courteous don't be confident the middle of pandemic and then he's dead a few days drive yeah horrific right that's this is see this is why this disease is so fucked up it just seems like for some people it's a death sentence hmm and then for other people it's nothing and that just doesn't make any sense to me just I'm clearly I'm not a doctor and clearly this is a new virus but it's just so weird that something could be asymptomatic for a huge amount of people but some people get it and they barely even notice it they just feel a little bit of fatigue some people get a little bit of a cough for a couple days and then nothing and other people are dead like it's nuts it doesn't it doesn't compute in my head like other things could you know what I'm saying like so have you ever been seriously ill yes I've had the flu but I mean like I'm a cancer survivor right so to me not putting unsane the flu is not seriously oh that's flu from the flu right you die from the flu we know this but so when I got cancer or my show was on MTV things were going great everything was going great you know I've got my show on MTV people were watching I'd been doing it on public access in Canada for years six years I've been working away making my own show because you know I've noticed no one's ever gonna give me a friggin show so I'll make my own show right so did I did that before the weather I did that first written that's how I I always thought like that you know also I'm on MTV everything's great Oh Oh feeling a little funny down there fortunately I went to the doctor wait which a lot of young people who get testicular cancer thank you very much what don't go to the doctor right away so it spreads hmm and they die right I went to the doctor I was lucky I went to the doctor but for me having that happen at that time was so bizarre just in the you know I sometimes think if I'd gotten if I had gotten that testicular cancer one year earlier you know MTV wouldn't have picked up the show yet so I would have been in Canada dealing with it and then probably they wouldn't have picked up the show and my life would be completely different that sort of change that and sort of the the that you know I don't believe there's coincidences sometimes I don't believe in coincidences sometimes I do i flip-flop on that but but I basically because of that what that sort of made me realize is that like life's random it's not fair shit can happen even if it is unlikely it might happen to me and because of that having dealt with that and it just sucked man it sucked having cancer like like because it wasn't just about like you know removing my right testicle right yes that sucks enough you think that you know but it's fine I got the left one it's fine it's the middle one now it's fine it's doing good but I'm doing a bit but no but the thing is they also did a lymph node dissection and it cut me open it was painful I was in the hospital for six to eight weeks or six weeks took years to recover from that physically like pain nerve dams just you know slowing down your body and so I just go I don't want to go through that again like I just I'm happy to just stay in my house right now cut up cut all you know cut cut you're just completely like improve my odds I don't really have anything to do right now anyways you know I'm not touring I have a lot of stuff that I love doing in my house I'm working on my computer I'm Pro Tools I like making music like making hip-hop beats and stuff you know but if for years I've had these little details and that Pro Tools program that I've not unlocked little mysteries because I haven't had time to go and figure out how to mix and do like compression and do all the little things that you do so I'm like going down that rabbit hole I got my sound engineer calling me and I'm like doing online like doing on FaceTime like Pro Tools lessons and I'm getting I'm having fun with it and I'm thinking okay I'm doing something with my self right now that is positive I'm enjoying that and I'm trying to avoid you know being hospitalized again because I hate being in the hospital sucks yeah makes sense yeah are you doing anything differently in terms of how you eat or health-wise or nutrients or taking care of you immune system yeah yes I well I heard you say zinc on the show and I listen to me first of all advice for me yeah well no I I had already had the zinc I but that confirmed that I was taking zinc so a couple articles you should read on it but yeah ink very good taking vitamins multivitamin vitamins and then honestly I'm not drinking as much you know unfortunately YouTube said that they're gonna take down anything that doesn't coincide with the World Health Organization's ruling on you know what to do about this pandemic what I mean their YouTube is taking down things and now I now know how specific they're gonna be about this but they were saying alternate therapies like vitamin C and things along those lines which is kind of unfortunate mmm because like unless they're not being that strict about it because I would say if someone was saying howdy if somebody made a video someone who's a nutrition expert and they made a video how to protect your mount immune system from Co vid 19 or maybe just protect your immune system during the time of kovat 19 so I'm saying that it's protecting it from that but how to how to boost up your immune system in this very dangerous time in terms of viral infections well there's there are strategies there's things you can do like get more sleep drink more water eat healthier and keep your body healthy with nutrients and making sure you're eating clean and don't drink alcohol and don't smoke cigarettes if you just do those things like this is real like this has actually been proven mm-hmm so I don't know what you can get away with saying and what you can't get away with saying but you can't always just hope that doctors come up with a cure because yes the doctors are going to come up with a cure and yes we need them to do that but you can't always think that medicine is going to fix you and you could just keep doing what you've always been doing that got you sick in the first place because a lot of times when you get sick it has to do with how you've been living not always but a lot of times like is your immune system already compromised or are you already weak are you beating up your body and abusing it and then BOOM then you catch a cold mm-hmm we all know that's true so advice on how to strengthen your immune systems it's important for everybody now if you want people to say don't say that this is a cure for kovat 19 it's gonna keep you from getting Kovan 19 fine great but so what like YouTube is gonna take a video down that says this what I'm saying like if you vitamins don't don't don't drink alcohol or during the time it has to do with coronavirus and it's contrary or not in the World Health Organization is recommended which changes every two weeks well they fucked up here's where matters don't wear masks wear masks don't wear masks good to wear masks bad to wear masculine but if somebody posted it on their Twitter the other day from it might have been Donald Trump jr. but showed the world health or nose on Instagram world health organization a tweet from them from it was I guess it was what time it was last year I think it was last i think december or maybe the beginning of this year but they were saying that the world health organization says that it cannot be contracted from person to person mmm this is a tweet that they put out mm-hmm so you can't say how the hell do you get at them well they didn't know then directly from a Pangolin yeah yeah to be there so don't worry about it this is what they were getting Chinese propaganda they were spreading but the World Health Organization when they were posting it that was that's absolutely wrong we all know that's absolutely wrong so if you say you have to listen to what the World Health Organization says well they've been wrong before right and I want to know how much they really know about nutrition how much do they really know about health and fitness like I'm looking at these people they don't look the healthiest humans in the world just fish someone's a scientist you know saying doesn't mean they're taking care of their own that's a problem smart guy but he might not work out and I've talked to a lot of really brilliant people including doctors they eat shitty food and don't really work out so crazy I realized I didn't have a lot of vegetables so I ordered you know on Amazon which I'd never used Amazon by the way on fresh yeah they were taking too long to deliver actually they actually aren't weren't even delivering when I ordered this but there's there's other stuff on Amazon that's not Amazon fresh canned corn okay I ordered like a couple dozen cans of corn so I have that and I sometimes will mix that in I've been cooking so to stay healthy I've been cooking I like to cook anyways I'd like to cook anyways I believe you I just say that twice like you're trying to convince me yeah because it seems like it might not be a believable thing but I do like to cook no it just seems I just you seem surprised by it so I figured others might be but I'm not at all yeah I like to cook but I'm not an X I just kind of I kind of have a sense for I know I can usually tell that I'm gonna like it just by the smells of things and so I'll like so I have canned corn I've been cooking a lot of pasta I've been you know I I have I have stuff do I go alive on the Instagram story I do a little cooking show sort of like mean it's not I'm not saying it's a cooking show but I do I do whenever I cook I do a little Instagram story I got these you know the San Marzano tomatoes okay what are those they're just like can of tomatoes but they're cans of peeled tomatoes oh so they're delicious tomatoes but they last forever because there can't so I can have a closet full of them in the last forever and you'll always have Tomatoes then I've got the the stuff when I make pasta it's called like ragu okay or prego sauce crazy that's exotic yeah when I make sauce but I add that the tomatoes to it thicken it up throw some canned mushrooms in there why are you buying ragout tomato sauce it's just to have it don't do it no no it's just to have it because in case of you know in case like you know system is is if I can't get food for a while I've got some some backup food you know mmm cuz you remember in the first few weeks of this people were kind of thinking is is everything gonna shut down right you know so I made sure I had some canned food you know like they said right but why ragu there's other brands you get ya wife prego - I've got the rag the ragu is the alfredo sauce and the prego is the marinara sauce but what I'm saying is my cooking my personal recipe for spaghetti don't just doesn't just heat up the ragu put in some canned tomatoes in it way better okay so I'm getting I'm you know but I wouldn't normally do that I wouldn't normally have canned corn I wouldn't normally think about having vegetables the kind of person that'll eat rice so do you think you had a premonition or do you think you saw what was going on in China and you were like you know what it would be a good move to have a month worth of food here yeah like it's not like some sort of a superstitious thing you don't feel like like the universe was sending you a signal you need to go buy corn well I watched one of your shows recently where you're talking about I love this episode where you're talking about are we living in a simulation yes so I was you know I love talking about this stuff you know it doesn't mean that I'm oh I think we're living in a simulation oh I think that we you know our doomsday is coming not necessarily but I do love the thought experiment of talking about it and thinking about it and so after watching that show your show I was really thinking about a lot had a long conversation with my mom about how you know we could be living in a simulation you know what do you mean well I mean you know the computers are getting so fast I mean they're gonna be able to program computers that have conscious you know that little character on a computer might be able to start to think and then its might start to be able to self-determine and then we could just be an advanced version of that and how would we ever know and my mom's in there and all what are you talking about and then I had a pretty long day of talking about this with my mom and trying to convince her not that we're living a simulation but that it's possible we could be living in a simulation my mother it wasn't really buying it right and then two weeks later this happens and I'm thinking it's like Fez were living in a simulation because if you were living in a simulation and then you started talking about it mm-hmm and then the creator of the simulation heard that he might start a pandemic maybe a problem is the term simulation yeah because if you're living in a simulation then it becomes your whole life mm-hmm like is that simulated anymore like what is that like maybe it's always been a simulation mm-hm maybe if you stop and think about events that take place that ultimately all seem to be leading towards events right when when you think about the invention of electricity and then the electronics of the 80s and the 90s that led to everyone having a home computer that led to everybody having a computer in your pocket it listens to everything you say and takes pictures and uploads video and just keeps getting more and more advanced and more and more intertwined with you being a person until one day you enter it and you become a part of it and it they create something inside the world of computers it's far more compelling than the regular world itself but maybe that's just the natural course of progression and that's where life is going anyway like maybe that's just a new kind of life and new dimension of life and that all these things just come about through that they come about through either natural causes like you know star supernova and you know everything coalesce --is and things become carbon-based life forms emerge and life becomes what it is in 2020 we or those things figure out how to open up new realities and that what a simulation would be would just be another reality mm-hmm that we were created by some person doing the exact same thing that we're doing right now mm-hmm that one day we get to the point where technology's so spectacularly advanced that you could have a new world that's indiscernible like you can't tell that it's not real right it's impossible to tell you are in that world now and that's where you exist that's what I was trying to convince my mother that we might actually be in you Hoss she wasn't buying it dude Ilana must thinks that you must understand he freaks me out I know I saw that on your show too if you were talk to him no no I mean his eyes like what's going on there man oh yeah extra shits happening in there yeah because when you got a guy that intelligent and he's saying there's a 1% chance or one and a billion chance that we're not living in a simulation you think okay so you just messing with me or who was it was the gentleman's name that I was having a discussion with ball strim boström Nick Bostrom yeah yeah that's socially that was watching that was a very complicated discussion huh who's talking about probability theory uh-huh the probability of us having living life inside of a simulation is usually higher mm-hmm because ultimately we're going to come up with a simulation someday and then when you talk about this stuff enough and when you watch your show which I do and you listen to these complex conversations right and you start thinking about it and you start thinking about all the possibilities what could happen and then the this pandemic happens and then you know yeah yes I still live in the same place where I did the show you know as I I started seeing you know I'm here in Los Angeles you saw him too all the sudden you seen Black Hawk helicopters go on by I'm seeing Apache helicopters going by you're seeing the Ospreys you see the Ospreys going by every day and the first week of this and you're thinking what's going on man do you watch The Walking Dead you know I I haven't watched it let me tell you I know it's crazy Walking Dead the first many seasons where I hear about it now the first few seasons were awesome but maybe even better is the first season of the LA version of The Walking Dead what's that one called the first the first couple episodes of that is spectacular yeah it's for the first season is pretty good but it said they did it very differently than the other Walking Dead but you know it just like where it people it takes a while for people to realize what the fuck is happening mm-hmm it sort of felt like is that - yeah in the beginning in the beginning oh yeah man in the beginning it felt touch-and-go when everybody was hoarding all the toilet paper and we're fighting yo and everyone wants a gun the gun lines were giant right the lines outside the gun stores were creepy yeah yeah were you in one of those lines I'm not waiting in line I have a theory about the toilet paper maybe it's obvious but but I don't know maybe it's not obvious I don't know so toilet paper is big yes so because it's big takes up a lot of shelf space because it takes up a lot of maybe everyone's talked about this already but maybe takes up a lot of shelf space so all of a sudden everybody went to the grocery store at the same time and there's probably far less toilet paper than at the grocery store then it would appear just because it takes an entire aisle because it's big so everybody what bought one piece of packaged of toilet paper on the first day it was instantly all gone it's instantly an entire empty aisle which is dramatic looking hmm and it was the first sign of shelves being cleared and it was the toilet paper was gone and everyone went on their fucking phones there's there's putting a running toilet paper and all of a sudden that compounded it exponentially and now everyone's going for the toilet paper and they don't need to be going for the toilet paper and we had the great toilet paper shortage of 2020 this is the type of investigative reporting you do when you're alone that makes a hundred percent sense because it's big everyone grabbed a can of corn everyone grab some kind of beans but it didn't create an entire empty aisle that then got people thinking talking and and and tweeting and typing and instagramming it's also something dumb people think about a lot of shitting yeah you don't want to not be able to wipe your ass firfer all the things you need like do you understand what it's like when shit goes down get a rag and a bucket of water okay right wash your ass with a washcloth right cuz shit is going down yeah all right that's the last thing you need to worry about is toilet paper you need to worry about consuming food and staying alive yeah some people don't think it's ever gonna get to that and those are the ones that stock up on toilet paper yeah the ones you buy like rice and beans and stuff like that those are the people that are planning their legitimately planning ahead you want to stay alive mm-hmm they say yes you know that's right user Haynes corn and rice is a that's what I Ren was a subsystem enough enough vitamins and everything you need so sure you don't get enough protein that way but you get some from being oh really yes it's not as available sometimes bioavailable as it is in other foods yeah yeah so he gets some protein you just got to eat a lot yeah it's not as complete as some forms of protein so have you been enjoying doing the podcast since this started obviously becomes a big subject of conversation right do you do you sometimes not want to talk about it anymore I mean we could when your guests come in is everyone always talking about the pandemic and would agree about them man I wanna talk to you just go with the flow yeah we just have the conversation sometimes is repetitive unfortunately yes people that are listening in they listen to me having conversations people that haven't heard the other conversations right and we wind up talking about the same shit yeah but that's it seems like as the more I think about doing it the best way to do is just talk to people just have talk just talk just think about what you would how would you normally talk yeah you'd have to talk about this if I didn't see my friend Tom green in a long time then all sudden we're here like bro what the fuck is going on well we're just gonna ignore it exact because really we only talked for like there was a couple times we were having conversations out there we were like gotta save it because I haven't seen you in a while mmm but gotta talk about it Matt we're in living in madness it's a weird thing when you talk about something in the hallway I told you the story but I'll say it now I'm doing now I'm doing what I said I didn't do but he's dead man used to come up and do my web show that we were talking about and you know Johnny Carson's psychic I never got to meet Johnny Carson but I got to meet at McMahon that's pretty dope do you met Ed McMahon yeah we became friendly came did it all the time he did it i Healy lead it like four times or something Wow cuz he I think he just yeah I had a curtain had a I got a shiny curtain yeah I had a desk at the the desk that you and I just think he felt like it was fun for him no pressure we're doing a little kind of make-believe Tonight Show or whatever that's awesome and he'd come up and I was just so overjoyed that he was there and we'd stand in the hallway and let's start talking to him and he'd say I could tell he'd get quiet was never quiet on the show but he'd get quiet before the show and I was like he's not in a good mood and the first couple of times and he said don't leave it in the hallway Tom don't leave it in the hallway and I realized oh he doesn't want to have the same conversation again and it made it a lot easier for me as the host of the show in my living room because then I didn't feel obligated to talk to him either and we just sat there in silence for half an hour until the show starts we fucked that up a bunch of times on this podcast not just you and I I was trying to kind of talk about things that weren't gonna come up I mean like the early days of the podcast that was before we ever all the chef's started we had talked about all the coolest shit yeah you know what fuck what we're just talking about and then you're talking about it again and you and you know you're talking about again and they know and you're sort of then you're trying to pretend that you haven't heard it before and you're kind of doing this sort of and can't really force the laugh but you do and then it doesn't feel right awkward yeah yeah but you know I mean I look I look I love that I love the little the little I love the rhythm to these kinds of conversations that's something that I really love you know like I've you know as you know I've loved doing what you you do I love doing this I love talking to people I love creating a you know whether it's an interview or a conversation I love listening to people and just waiting and feeling that rhythm of it it's something that's very interesting to me which took a long time to figure out and that's what's kind of exciting about you know doing this stuff is you do learn as you do these shows and where else would you ever have the opportunity in the history of broadcasting right to have built your own studio and go oh I'm gonna do you know what do you how many thousand shows of you didn't know I'm gonna do a thousand shows right I mean you've got more you know time as a interviewer then anyone like in history other than the few handful of people that had shows that didn't get cancelled right everyone else they got a chance to do a talk show they get to do it for a few weeks or a few months or a few years and then it get cancelled well it's radio guys have been doing forever Eastern you need way way way more yeah that's why I'm saying you know you're in that category of people where you've got 10,000 hours of interviewing time you know mmm that's pretty it pretty it's pretty awesome it's pretty weird yeah it's not 10,000 hours yeah how many thousand hours a thousand something 3,000 show 1,500 show 1500 shows and the longest ones are like well there's a few five-hour ones in there the Kevin Smith one a couple of them that were like four or five hours most of them are three or under yeah yeah was it in the early days of it okay when you were doing in your house how long did you love it being in the house and then at what point did it start to be like haven't I don't want to do this in my house anymore well when I was bringing over of people that I didn't know mhm then I was like just to see us feels awkward you bring bring them to my house it just feels like it also feels like I was you know I wasn't the right setup I wanted I was like well if I'm doing this all the time I should have like a better setup mhm I should figure out I do this better so for a while red bands set up at the Ice House we did it there we just did a show together red Ben and I we did weekend at San Diego at the American comedy company right like right before this that's a great little tool yeah I love that so bye Ben yeah I love San Diego's it was an awesome spot for comedy - yeah so and then I got a place near here that was smaller and then I was like okay I need to I want to build something crazy I want to build something where it's like what would I do if I was me you know I could feel like oh if I was Tom Green I would set up a fucking Internet city on my house well if I was Joe Rogan what would I do mm-hm oh yeah which I should have all this shit that I want like a gym and you know float tank sauna incredible that's that's the most fun part about this place is it like but you could never have a place like this if you had like a real company behind you you know I mean if you have if you were an employee like Showtime mmm Showtime put some Tom green show together and you're like I don't want I want an indoor archery range legalism we can't do that well I want to set up a gym hold on we need everyone to sign a waiver we're gonna enter this gym you're lifting weights okay let me talk to the lawyers Tom the the the gym has to be in a separate building yeah you have to have key cards to get into it and everyone has to sign a release mm-hmm you would never be able to put whatever you want on the walls you wouldn't be able to it wouldn't be the same and then there's always the looming possibility of it all being taken away somebody's talking about on your show that was that conversation 2007 I just put up the you know the pictures sorry pulling the plug on a time yeah we just booked a bottle the new furnace a dike called some lovely woman a dike yeah yeah it's uh it's it's amazing but but was there a moment though in your house when you were doing it where something happened that made you say this is you know like like did anyone anyone ever come up and not want to leave after no no no something bad no it just seemed like a that it just always seems like it's time to do something new see what I what my problem was I was drinking a lot more back then mm-hmm so you drink now at all I do do you but a lot less actually I'll tell you when I started doing stand-up again 10 or 11 years ago I started doing it again have a drink right now for yeah of course a couple of drinks of course I will have a drink right just like drinking yeah of course but absolutely well but uh you know the thing is is I don't as much anymore and back then I was your booze a little too much so are you saying yeah and I think I think what I thought was I got a little too carried away with the idea of hey we can drink on the show right right right I remember that we were dragging Coronas yeah that's one of the things that people were pointing out like you're gonna be here yeah big hit uh-huh so crazy I bet yeah people are so dumb they're blaming the name of the beer on a virus yeah I was thinking in the beginning like hey why don't they just call it covet 19 or something just to you know this company's anyways would have caught Corona just changed they had a co vid 19 at like a special-edition have some fun with it yeah grandpa's dead have some fun yeah he died choking on his lone lung fluid so I was having fun with that and but I I feel like I feel like that maybe I forgot where I was going with that but the point is as a nice why don't we got any more bottles this thing's almost empty mm-hmm Oh whiskey there huh that's my drink I've been drinking Bushmills oh there's a specific type it's from Belfast it's Cheers Irish whiskey mm-hmm it's a healthy pour they're at school dude awesome thank you i won't i won't ever you have any more else Epis that's fine so you need little sip it's not bad for you it's been proven sorry what is that that's a Buffalo Trace mmm this company's been around since 1773 son oh I heard you talking about answers I'm talking about look there's actual Buffalo testicles on the label oh wow no don't make me jealous respect I used to have two of those but so we're talking about drinking doing the studio you said you it got a little carried away because you could drink there oh I know where I was going with it yeah so so yeah so so of course people like to drink my guests like to drink to have a lot of great guests coming up you know sometimes we'd have a few too many sometimes turned into every time we had a few too many turned into it turned into a party every night it turned into a party that never ended every night it turned into you know you know I remember like we had great stories too don't get me wrong it wasn't bad I mean I remember Norm Macdonald would come up and I you know I'm from Norm's from Ottawa okay I'm from Ottawa Canada the capital of Canada okay I grew up loving norm okay like cuz when I was a teenager I was doing Amateur Night they called it that's what they used to call opening my open mic nights at yuk-yuks in Ottawa amateur night I'd do that and norm would come through town he had he hadn't blown up yet he is norm he's 25 years old he was my favorite him and Harland Williams jeremy hots those guys were my favorite and so having grown up idolizing those guys and then all of a sudden they're up at my house and now we're having a drink and now the show ends now the show ends and norms having fun I'm having fun let's go look at some YouTube videos so now we're watching YouTube videos till 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning and then that starts happening every night with other people and everyone and everyone it's like I'm wake up in the morning you know there's beers like the floor sticky but floor in my hell's you know I've got a nice place right the floor is sticky right and then and then the then the housing crash the housing market crashed and I was doing this thing and the tow here's another thing okay the technology changed and so every like few months oh the cameras are obsolete you know the four by three cameras don't fit in the aspect ratio you got to get all new cameras okay so I spend $6,000 on the new cameras just to keep it working I've already spent off okay and then the house is worth like half of what I paid for it I'm liking my underwater here and that force and not to mention that the floor the floor is sticky that I've screwed things into the ceiling I've ruined it I've ruined the house that's worth half of what I I'm like maybe I should move get rid of the studio out of the house this is not healthy but no and there was also you know this did you want a semblance of normalcy and didn't you want a house well it also what happened was cheers Cheers [Laughter] also what happened was um you know I I was becoming increasingly frustrated with my inability to monetize it okay and because it was it just wasn't really what people were doing quite yet and I had people all over the world calling in and watching me were getting a lot of views we're what though the break the moment when I realized something cool was happening with the views we figured this thing out Kat Von D came on the show okay the you know Kat Von D yeah she came on the show she had a MySpace page with like a gazillion followers this is a funny story actually I hope it has at least we we embedded the feed to her myspace pitch all of a sudden we had a million views on that one feet oh my god this is amazing then the end of the month comes I get a bill from the server company we hadn't talked about if you had a million views a bill for $40,000 they go well we charge per clicks I mean now that's the noon end you know we always had this thing but now we have a thing where it's so I mean in fairness to them they didn't make me pay it but they wanted me to pay it until I was crying on the phone you know I just got new cameras this is great ceilings got holes in it you know I mean so they didn't make me pay it thank you for thank you very much to everybody that I won't even say their name in that story but thank you to them for that but it became a lot of pressure financial pressure to keep it going I'd been doing it for a long time I had grown kind of you know that started finding myself annoyed with doing it and then I just one day just realized I want to start doing stand-up again and I just I had always wanted to write I did it when I was a kid I was always felt like a thing that I'd you know I was doing stand-up I stopped when I started my public access show cuz I got I'm a focus a focus right so I had the side the public access should I don't have time to do that anymore I focused on that right for 10 years and in the back of my mind I was always like man I left that on the table you know so I found that that was gonna be my way of monetizing my web show was I'm gonna go on tour and all of a sudden I started I jumped up the Comedy Store and I felt that feeling you know that feeling and felt since I was you know 19 was the last time I'd done it you know and and I and I and I did well right it was like the fear of like Oh am I gonna bomb or they gonna you know it was just instantly gone and I realized shit and then I went back and so going back one step back them back in their dog and I start getting booked and then I'm all of a sudden you know six years of doing the web show and paying for it out of my pocket and worrying about it in Ulsan whoa I'm I'm like making good money doing stand-up I like this idea getting paid to do what I love to do as opposed to paying what for what I love to do and so then I'd come home from the road and the equipment was getting more obsolete to you know it was like it was like he was dust on it you know and they're like the camerawork yeah you turn him on it wouldn't work as well you know like you'd have to figure and in and I'd come home and I look at this house and I didn't I I was tired from being on the road I didn't want to turn on the studio I thought you know I'm gonna take the studio out of the house and I'm gonna go focus on trying to become as good of a stand-up as I can possibly be this is what year what you just start it's probably about 11 years ago so yeah and so and then I've been on the road for the last 11 years like you know I mean I've talked a bit about this but I've been going hard man I've been going everywhere I've been all over the world and then every every club in the US and loving it and I love doing it and I feel and what I love about stand-up is I know it's it and I I'm not sure if this is true at your point but for me I still feel like every time I get on stage I feel like I'm learning something and getting better at it so every single time yeah me too done thousands of shows but then how could I even how can I walk offstage and feel like that was the best show that's what I said the last time so I said the time before it that's why I said the time before but I love that feeling of like oh there's some where we're moving somewhere with this we're moving and we're figuring something out it's very fulfilling well it's clearly something that the more you do it the better you get at it if you're enthusiastic and you're concentrating on it the more you do it the better you get at it and the the more years you have in it's like the more data you've processed out how to do it right and how to do it wrong and how to what to avoid and what to emphasize and all these different things they they just get to a greater and greater understanding of this thing so really there is a difference between like 10 years and 20 years 20 years and 30 years and really you really do keep as long as you really are still passionate about it yeah we'll still get it get better at it da Marrero said this to me and Dom's been doing it longer than me I remember watching Dom on TV when I was thinking about doing comedy he was already on TV right and when I became friends with him he was like one of the first guys of those friends were sorry I can't believe I'm friends with Dom I rera and to this day Dom's been doing comedy probably 40 fucking years mm-hmm to this day he still says you know you just keep concentrating on it you still get better like that is the craziest thing isn't it so you just if you're as long as you're still locked in and some guys like Dom are still locked in like he still crushes see you Dom at the Comedy Store kind of rush which is so inspiring oh yeah with new shit yeah yeah she walking around light-light with the audience having a good time uh-huh been doing it forever still loves it still loves doing stand-up and I think that's what's up it's like whatever you're doing whether it was your public access show or whether it's you doing stand-up or maybe you become an author whatever the fuck it is that thing you just have to really be all in on that thing and really be interested in that thing and if you are you're get better at it mm-hmm you're gonna get better at it and just keep me you're gonna have bad times and good times jokes it suck and jokes it are better and some jokes you have to Bannon they're never gonna work you try them like what is wrong with this I can't seem to get let me just put it aside for a little bit and you might come back to a two years from now you like all that tomato joke and then you go back and you start fucking around with the tomato bit again you're doing it we reintroduce to the crowd never now man it's a it's a like a living forest of ideas that's what an act is it's like a life form and it's like you you you fertilize it with information and knowledge and and you keep paying attention to it constantly we in a good way to just like it's supposed to sing to plants like pay attention to that act like go there with enthusiasm be happy that you can do it and this is nothing that's gonna happen to a lot of comics after this break come back you're gonna be so thankful yeah so thankful that you could make people feel good that we can all have a night out together yeah where you know people come and there are dates and they're just happy to be there and they're there they're there to have a good time and the comics are so happy that everybody is there and everybody gets just a good old love fest out of it just let's appreciate what we had I think we all appreciated what we had at the store but I think now everyone's gonna really really appreciate how special that place is and how special stand-up comedy is across the world it's a special thing to be able to get in front of people and and and make your ideas change their physical state you know when people are laughing about something they're having a great time it's someone killing on stage it changes it's like you're giving them a happy drug when someone makes you laugh it feels good that's why we gravitate towards stand-up when Joey Diaz is on stage crushing you feel good you like that feeling that you get it's like everything feels amazing and you and I get to feel that all the time we're so lucky we get to hang out with some of the best funniest people in the world and make each other laugh and just joke around and hang out in that back bar and tell war stories and just laugh and have so much fun and I think one great thing about this for us is it's gonna make us appreciate what how special and how fortunate that is I think for a lot of other people during this time off that have been like on the fence about quitting what they do I've been a lot of people gonna change course in their career I've got a lot of people gonna realize you know what this could all be just taken away from me I'm playing it safe and even though I'm playing it safe doing something I want to do it still got taken away from me and I didn't even have a chance to take a chance mm-hmm I was trying to do this thing and do the right thing and follow my degree and now they're gonna go since this can be taken away from you at any time I'm gonna do what I want to do yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna try to find out how to make a career at whatever their interest is whether it's making tents or fucking painting whatever it is whatever making tents somebody literally is making into making tents to see for sure that what they decide they want to do that though at what point in life when their kid camping they go someday I'm gonna make them better one of these this thing's leaking right now exactly they shouldn't be leaking like this better sleeping bags some people make better you know those little burner stoves those stoves that people take when I go hiking someone goes this thing sucks I'm gonna make a better one of these fucks make a better one they sell it to REI and the next thing you know it's the hot thing if you're going camping ya gonna have it there's some there's some crazy tents out there now - I'm sure you know you probably do a lot more camping than I do I don't camp that often hunt when you go in the hunt you don't have new model tent I have what I prefer to did the most miserable mom I think the most miserable is rain cuz cold you can get warm like I've done Montana we did the movie in Bryan Callen with my friend Steve Rinella and his crew for the meat-eater show we did the Missouri Breaks in Montana okay in October it was cold as fuck it was like 9 degrees some days that was cold but that's not as miserable as wet what's more miserable one time we did Prince of Wales which is the most rainy part of Alaska okay yeah it's an island and it was rough it's like all day long you're soaking wet like you need that pant is wet your sleeping bags wet this the air you see when you turn your headlamp you go piss the middle the night just missed this is water everywhere everything's wet you're never gonna dry off and it's not warm out I love that though even though it's uncomfortable it's I love getting I've done a lot of that okay I've done a lot of camping Canadian right my dad was an army guy my dad was Captain in the Canadian Army so he made you go camping pretend the Russians are coming yeah no for real yeah it was it was serious it was sort of used to pair it was an authoritarian kind of thing you had to be good with nature when I was 14 years old I got really into skateboarding right already been doing it but when you started but kind of teenager somehow I don't know how this happens but somehow a skateboarding you equate the ability to be able to do something like that really well with maybe the ability to be popular or to maybe get girls or something if I can do a jump right and I'm really so you just you're as I think it's a male energy thing or like a you know you start to feel like I've got to be the best skateboarder mm-hmm so I all of a sudden like you know I don't know what kind of energy it is I don't wanna be sexy it's a human energy sure there's girls that are really obsessed with doing things to be the best of it back that up back that uh-huh it's a human energy right you want to be successful you want to be the best skateboarder right so this was the moment where I wanted to be the best skateboarder but I was 14 and I was still a kid but I was on the verge of being a teenager I was a teenager if I was on the verge of being you know an adult you know like we have some music playing in the background the story all of a sudden dad says we're I'm sending you this summer on a canoe expedition it's eight weeks in northern Canada you're going out with this like group of 12 that it was this whole organized thing was actually an American group it was called I member was called Lorien okay it was an American group from upstate New York they drove up they a group of 12 people and they were divided into like five groups of 12 that would go out into the middle you know what it's like in northern Canada it's like you know where you're going out into Lake Kip Alois in northern Quebec and Canada yeah see the middle of Canada yeah my friends live in Alberta shout out to my friends John and Jen which I sent me an image you want to pull it up on the big screen Jen rivet she sent me a picture of her fucking backyard yeah in her backyard there was a giant fucking grizzly bear just wandering around in her backyard hold please look at that that's her Yard Man what the fuck dude look at the size of that thing yeah not in her yard lucky to see that actually that's a 10-foot grizzly biopic it is what it looks like those that could be a ten foot that's that's a nice thing I'd be able to see that's a big hill it's running towards you see white shoulders are how much muscle it hasn't its arms I saw a small bear look the size in the big picture beautiful what in the Christ Jesus they have them up there word they have to shut school down sometimes like where their kids go to school it'll just wander through this fucking school yard a grizzly bear Jesus and they're probably just used to it I've got friend who lives in Pasadena the bear comes down everything he eats avocados out of his tree clearly my friend is doing well he's got avocado trees knows but he's ballin yeah that's a low-key flex yeah bears eat my avocado trees what you got an avocado there yeah absolutely oh yeah but you know no he talked about him later but he's a great guy incredible up there and I was out there eight weeks out of you type deal kinda well when my dad was when my dad was you know kid he joined the cadets and he's joined the army left school went joined army we went back to school you got a college degree later we just clarify dad if you're watching but he is watching too by the way my parents are watching so so you know you're on oh they know but listen so it was sort of this you know you got to know how to be a man you don't know how to deal with nature and I went out and I I'd grown up fishing with my dad a lot of fishing never but a lot of fishing you know northern pike largemouth bass you know like I like a love fishing and and I was actually they know the only Canadian on this tour and we'd go out into the middle of nowhere we do it every day there'd be a like sometimes up to three kilometer long portage or you'd have to take so today we're doing the portage we're gonna take all our bags all our food all their supplies we're going to walk the three miles or whatever three kilometers is that we called portage port OSH yeah port Raj when you pick up you I thought it was portage oh yeah no it's French French Canadian Oh because the voyagers right where the French Canadian fur traders who came down from northern Canada with the Hudson's Bay Company selling their beaver pelts and the port ah right so that's funny because thinking of Portage Avenue and Winnipeg which is a mistake no I'm not I'm thinking of port is like carrying hilarious if it was a Winnipeg thing I don't think I've ever heard the word said or said it myself poor Tosh yeah okay french-canadian so I digress yeah we wait but so so it was a lot of work you know and you'd have to carry your canoe and then you have to go back three miles and then you have to pick up all your food and all that stuff it was a pretty intense thing you know what they had was every two weeks a float plane would come in would land they resupply the twelve groups of people and then everyone would go off in the own direction so we were off there with like you know maybe twelve people and I don't think they would do this anymore it was like one instructor guy who was probably 25 years old and I was 14 with a bunch of 14 years old and you know was fishing and you know I loved it I loved being out there in the middle of nowhere fishing is so fun it's such a great feeling to like catch something and then cook it like if you can cook it like within a close amount of time when you just caught it yeah Russ barks those primal fires yeah largemouth bass you know largemouth bass ate a lot of largemouth bass or the year story people but Todd people don't like eat and largemouth bass isn't interesting yeah yeah they were they were prevalent in this lake we went to largemouth bass northern pike and smallmouth which put up a better fight than the largemouth oh yeah small mouths are tough it tastes better too what's your favorite lure work what situation topwater lures because it's exciting when they hit okay yeah you know if you have a bug or a rapport Rapala yeah you're twitching it and then you see something come up and smash the water that's always the most exciting to me but I like you know I like fishing with all kinds of lure spinners and crank baits I used to like casting crank baits into lily pads for bass most fun because you can kind of pull it across the surface of the water you see the bass explode crank bait what's that that might be I don't know that your bait is uh it's got like the skirt like the flowy skirt the lowest rubber worm paper thing over the over the hook well it's a what is it called it's called I think that's called a crank I think that's called a crank bait I'm saying there's a little different tippet terminologies with Canada in the u.s. too so because like we we call it a little metal thing like a wire sort of one side it's just I think they would either call it I don't think they would call it a spinner a spinner is like a small little lure yeah that spins when you pull it through the water that's oh that's a crank bait okay that's like that's like a fat lip one that you can move all those Jitterbugs but what are the ones where there's the spinner on one side and the goddammit I forget the word with it's like it looks like like there's a coat hanger almost all of them and a one-size these are pretty big right yeah like muskie and stuff I think they would maybe he would call us he wouldn't call it a spinner yeah just a lure of some air bait that's it spinner bait okay that's what it is pattern I pretty much used spinners for bass I put a worm on it see what that looks like oh yeah yeah yeah I never know what to call the hoser yeah that's a little spinner on the end of it I used to use one of these like literally 30 years ago yeah I put a spinner with with with a worm on it for bass I like to use Rapala 's the best fishing experience I ever had was night time with my dad I was probably six years old we were in a canoe it was you know when you're up past midnight and we're going along he was up late that night it was maybe was probably ten o'clock but it felt like midnight because it was up late as a kid and I was like literally 6:00 and we were going along the shoreline pitch black you know hardly seen there's like a lot of mosquitos up there too and I had a floating lure I think it was a repeller it was I think was a jitterbug they make that sound along the top and this bass hit it it was a four pound bass okay it's good that I got it in in the canoe got it in we went back to shore we where this little cottage my parents had this little tiny little cabin when I was growing up the neighbors came out because they heard cuz how excited we were okay got it look that excited we went back out and I got another one the first cast so and those kind of memories are why I do love getting out into the woods I went then for the bass family those memories are equally horrific and then grandpa grandpa goes out it goes where's my son yeah and he and he grabs ahold of the worm to all catch and release now whenever I fish but back in the day it wasn't really sounds like alien abduction does something kind of fucked up about it it's like shooting up like a deer and knocking it out with slingshot to the head but then like letting it go yeah yeah something really fucked up to that fish yeah you're making it vulnerable yeah well I get it I was pushed a lot in the last few years but I do my parents live on a nice lake up in Quebec actually and whenever I go home to visit them it's like being on vacation we go out in the boat and we catch some northern pike a lot of people like barbless fly-fishing never fly fish bucks without a barbs yeah they can release the fish very easily so it never gets like stuck inside from Jesus Christ the whole point of the barb is it keeps the fish on the hook so yeah they always get off all the time you don't always get off you keep tension on the line sometimes you're okay but the point is like you're you're not even pretending you want keep that fish mm-hmm like you just got a you just putting a hook in its head and bringing it out into your world and going psych and letting it go it's like a there's definitely some times when you catch a fish and you hook it wrong and you feel bad because it's not a pleasant thing well in that case it's not as much because you can get those barb with barbless hooks out easier but it's just it's weird that like most of fly-fishing like when they fly fish for trout a lot of it it's catching release a lot so there's like a whole industry built around torturing these little fish eats that that think they're gonna get a fly and it's just to give you that rush oh god one a good one this is like primal caveman rush of stripping in that line oh my god am i condom and bringing that fish up to the shore and thinking this is gonna sustain you and your family like psyche I'm going to Burger King you ever get those moments I just had one moment like this where I'm sitting here and I'm looking at you you know in front of the American flag on the show that I watch the show all the time I'm sitting here that's just it's awesome man yes thanks to being a citizen American citizen today I would just became a US citizen and you one of us but we don't trust you enough to be President so step step the fuck back is not born here I will never be president be President unless you're born on this patch of dirt don't worry everybody there's an imaginary line in the sand and you were born in the wrong side of it son no need to worry I will never be President of the United States I wish I was born somewhere else I wish I could never be President I'd like to be born in Cuba cuz that's gonna be a lot of work when you're president I've never run for any office yeah but never thought about getting in politics no that's not my place my place is to talk shit and be ill-informed about many things and cause a lot of people to discuss these things because I'm ill informed I'd cite discussion my place is not to lead I don't think anybody's places to be president I really don't I think it's a ridiculous proposition I think nobody anybody's capable of handling it correctly mm-hmm that's why we don't like anybody who has ever done it yeah nobody's ever done it we like it's a tough suit you know you can't please everybody so you can't you really can't no to lose-lose proposition if you want to be the guy who runs the whole thing you got to please everybody and then there's all these different styles of running the whole thing right that's one of the more interesting things about America we have essentially 50 styles of running the whole thing because we have 50 states right so we have all these different people that are in control of these different states and you know we get to see how they do it like Arizona let's just carry a gun everywhere Oh God take a gun go go ever we want you know and California's like fuck that it's gonna be harder harder to get a gun New York City's even harder different places let you have different laws in terms of like Louisiana like New Orleans you could walk around with an open alcohol container nobody cares yeah walk through the street in New Orleans with a beer then drinking out that beer they won't say a word I've had some good times in New Orleans normal normal so there's different styles of running running running the whole show yeah it's interesting and then you know with the fact that you are under a microscope and you can't please anybody and everybody you definitely complete somebody yeah as long as you're pleasing yourself right like what you would do like don't be offensive to you if you were watching would you be watching this going this corny motherfuckers bullshit would you be watching and saying that or you would be you be watching going well that's probably a difficult position to be in but in that position that guy's showing some character he's showing some some grace he's showing some some compassion you know that's what you hope for but it's you got it the hole is weird anytime you're talking like this and in people are listening and how many people are listening Millions like that's the what is that number even mean like how many stars are there does that mean anything to you anymore it's like well the universe been around for 13 billion years like you lost me I don't these numbers are too big nice to understand what they are yeah but what you can control is how you would view yourself yeah you know and that's important for comedy too because there's a lot of people out there doing stand-up that don't do stand-up for themselves they don't do shit they would go to see they do things they think will work they're basically like a plumber like I need this size wrench to go onto that pipe and crank it crank or cranky uh-huh you know as an artist you know as it's a fucking highfalutin word for stand-up comedy but it's it's kind of accurate in just in semantical terms right so what you're trying to do is you're creating something right but are you creating something for you like that you would like are you creating something that you think the general public will enjoy mm-hmm right so that that comes across to like you people whether they know it or not they could smell weakness they smell bullshit they smell when you're not really you're not really tuned in mm-hmm you know if you ever had that moment on stage where you telling a joke but you're not really thinking about it as clearly as you should be and even though you're saying the words right people aren't laughing because they're not connected to you you're not connected to the joke they're not connected to you so there's some weird shit going on it's not just the words there's some weird shit going on there's an understanding of your authenticity and the people either have or they don't have if you don't feel authentic like you got a certain amount of people that are pay attention but after a while you're gonna lose them yeah because they know they're not okay and everybody's trying to be locked in everybody's trying to be authentic everybody's trying to be out there if you're not a sociopath you're trying to be authentic right I'm trying to be better than who you were yesterday it's right because we all realize that this is a complicated game and no one's great at it everyone's fucking up the game of life is a mess right it's a war zone so you're trying to get better and so you want to pay attention to other people that are trying to get better and people that are legitimately tuned in people that are legitimately sensitive people that are legitimately expressing themselves in an honest way it's very nourishing because it makes you realize it's possible mm-hmm and that's what we all give each other we all give each other through these moments of grace and these moments of intuition these moments of inspiration of observation of the sometimes you have the ability to express a thought that you didn't have yesterday I got thought will come into your head and you'll be able to express it to people and then they say it and then they then they'll say it back to you and you start talking and you realize like oh you just popped into something you just own this is it it's right there I found something I found something about myself and I found something that maybe you could relate to and then other people listening go if they know you really did find something they know you're not bullshitting they listen to and they go mmm is it right maybe he's not maybe I think differently and then they can maybe think their own and all this shit branches off from that but it's long as you're authentic you can be wrong we're all gonna be wrong but are you authentic mm-hmm that's what everybody really wants people say they want honesty they certainly want honesty but honest and stupid and unaware that son helping anybody you want authentic yeah well I mean that's what that's why we love doing this right yes that's why you you were saying you keep getting better the more you stand up you're getting more and more authentic you mean you're figuring out yeah what resonates the most with you the way you think and the way you perform do you feel like there's going to be and we sort of touched on this but when this thing ends I feel like stand-up comedians are gonna be so happy to be back on stage and have had a break you know because so many comedians have been go go go go go for a year said is this the longest you've been without being on stage in your life I'm pretty sure very sure now have you ever taken take live wings off of getting on stage yeah I've taken a little time off here and there and I was trying to think of how many months was there was one period of time where I did take a couple months off I think it was when I was moving from Colorado to LA I think is around 2009 I think it probably came back from that would renewed yeah I think it might have been right after I filmed my special to I think I filmed a special and then I think I took some time off after that which I like to do sometimes just kind of reset my perspective make sure I'm not I'm not bullshitting like I'm talking about things I'm actually interested in so sometimes when you're working too much like one thing that does happen would stand up so they spend all their time either traveling or doing stand-up you're not living enough and if you're not living enough you don't see enough things yeah the other opinion on you're thinking about your career you're thinking about your setlist you're thinking about a lot of shit that doesn't doesn't factor in with the you know it's it's very very narrow-minded in the sense so not only have all of all of comedy every comedian has been forced to take a break mm-hmm to go do something else but also to do something else during a crazy scary time but we're all being forced to think about our mortality think about the world think about the environment think about and then think about your fuck-ups yeah think about ex-girlfriends apologies - yeah yes yeah think about people that you wish were still alive think about things you could have done better you could have hit the brakes faster oh yeah times you could have been driving slower times you could have been a little less drunk Oh everything everybody's ever done time you did a thing when you were a kid you wish it had that done and went up sending you to juvenile home and you know there's a lot of people that have made these that happen to you I never happen to know I'm just making up Stephen King right now creating a character but having things that happened to you that went wrong things you did wrong but you know when you're when you're go go go all the time sometimes you get stuck in a pattern of momentum right well you don't have enough time to evaluate and and go am i doing the right thing I think there's a good lesson to be learned in a reset in that you could kind of if the world's crazy ants this is not anything nothing's the same now and I think we could all safely say that when the whole world shuts down you're not allowed to work and everyone's supposed to stay six feet apart and everyone outsides wearing a mask when you get to apply like that you can kind of agree the world isn't the same anymore right right so should you be the same should look what are you doing what the fuck are you doing with your life what are you doing when she's tipping in terms of your friends what are you doing what are you doing what are you doing you're doing the right thing are you fucking up are you eating sugar all day like what are you doing what are you doing well don't do that anymore because now you realize this is all whether it's a simulation or not what's happening right now needs to be addressed what's happening right now is if you don't have your shit together you're more vulnerable right so get your shit together the Renaissance movement I read this on my phone two weeks ago or the Renaissance movement occurred after the Black Plague everybody was forced to self isolate and then what happened oh the greatest shift in thinking and art and literature in the history of the world plus it probably killed a lot of people yeah made room yeah people came out of that and the whole everything changed after that and I sometimes wonder if that could happen here if we come out everything could change in a positive way for sure a positive way also the through this surviving that experience you probably feel incredibly lucky so you feel fortunate so you feel like you want to get things done and accomplish things and go for things that maybe you held back on before because you maybe not save a fuck as much paint a little weird now I'm not gonna do it the way that they've always been doing the painting I'm gonna look I'm gonna I don't know a lot of a painting but I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make the painting weird now you know yeah that's weird that's a weird way of painting hey man I don't give a fuck anymore man the Black Plague yeah above the fucking black boy shot my fucking you know wherever they lived back then drinking homemade wine yeah banging boys they did I don't know I don't know a lot of that I'm sure some of that was going on yeah it's these moments of history where things shift and change I mean clearly if you go back to as far as we're aware of you know go back to you know 1100 AD pick a spot pick a year now compare that to now well we're definitely better at life now right why do we get better at life because there was trials and arrows just like you get better as a human we get better at life you know what bothers me man and this bothered me we were just just discussing this I was like do you wonder when I see a civilization like China that's like completely in control they're citizens and so old such an old civilization like as time goes on if a civilization lasts a long long time does it get just tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter control is that what the magic of America is what the magic of America is is that it's only been around for 300 years not even so like is that the thing that you have to have a young fresh movement of freedom and then eventually human nature sort of fucking chokes it and gets in a rear-naked puts it to sleep is that what happens is that over time life and nature human nature and greed is basically I could you Jitsu black belt you could defend it as you defend it for a little while but eventually it's kind of put the choke on you is that what it is because it seems like all these older civilizations when the oldest ones that we're aware of are run by military dictators the old ones is that because they've always been like that because they were like that thousands of years ago they're like that still now they never had a chance to make that clean break or is it because as civilizations go on if long as some power is maintained there's no overthrow of it through this whole cycle they always get to a point where they just try to control the citizens it's just too difficult and I want all the money and I want all the bitches and I'm gonna shoot the bombs and I'm gonna control the people let them eat ice cream mm-hmm it's weird you know III went to I went to China for the first time in my life one year ago okay strangely enough I've never been there before another thing that happened a year earlier that it's perfect for your life one year ago I did a show in Hong Kong and so in with your show and the cancer and the thing that I find interesting about China though having had never been there before Hong Kong of course that's different right you know it's it's you know British colony and it's very but he sang hi same thing I that was only part of Communist China that went to Shanghai right and you get there and they got a Louis Vuitton store everybody's walking around shopping you drive from the airport I'm thinking it's gonna be some driving from the airport there's big mansions I'm like well I thought you know I I'm crazy with Janis I was like why yeah exactly and I'm like well I thought I was saying to the guy that picked me up the airport I'm his own well I thought this was a communist how come how come they have big mansions he's all it's not really the way it works and it's sort of a it's just sort of the economic systems not communists as I forget it even have explained it to me but you sort of got over there and you realize like it didn't seem a whole lot different to be honest with you I went to a mall you know they had one of the pianos in the mall anybody can play you know I sat down played people came arrests you know like just the same kind of dumb shit that they got here yeah and you know so I came back from that thinking okay well I mean obviously I know it's a lot different but we're also also still the same - it's very strange you know so have you have you been to China or it's a Bennett I want and I've got a China you know that's the thing about students when we tour doing stand-up it is that is that thing that kind of bothers you sometimes when you go somewhere you've never been before and you get there and it's exactly the same where's it ever been exactly the same well it's like I remember the first time I went to Australia and I was exactly the same well you got there I was like that within five minutes I went to a Starbucks and well I did a USO tour that that's a bad example a better example is I went to a USO tour so I'm thinking I'm going to the Middle East we got to Bahrain what landed in a Bahrain went to the Marriott okay and then we said can we take him up you can take what we took a walk there was a Dairy Queen I ended up getting Kentucky Fried Chicken I had some Kentucky Fried Chicken in Bahrain after I've just flown to the other side of the world and I was thinking this is gonna be so different it wasn't wasn't that much different it sounds like you were at a military base so well in Bahrain we were staying at a Marriott and then we went into Kuwait and then we went into so where'd you get the Kentucky Fried Chicken when you're in town or was that was it Bahrain we weren't on the base in Bahrain we were in town it was whatever the city isn't bad it's almost to me more exciting that when you would go to a place like that already be corrupted by McDonald's something is something ridiculously thrilling look I would love to land somewhere don't get me wrong I would love to land somewhere and deal only with the authentic culture but there's also something kind of weird about flying for 18 hours and landing in some country and ordering a Big Mac and and seeing it being served up by people who live in this strange land different different than you you know grew up in a different environment different culture different language different alphabet who you are eating a quarter-pounder in the same place it's like there's something about it that I like when things don't make any sense I like when things are haywire I like when you're like what in the fuck have you done there's something about that that I like and I like a Burger King in the middle of Thailand I like it yeah I don't want to eat there I don't want to eat there but there's part of me that's like the ridiculous folly of humans and their decision-making and and and and what we do and what we don't do I'm thrilled by it yeah I'm thrilled by ridiculous videos of dudes getting on a slip and slide trying to ride a fucking beer keg down the side of a hill when you know it's gonna go wrong I'm thrilled by that you know this is a part of me that I'm trying to really suppress that I'm not thrilled by people dying from this virus I'm not thrilled by you if you feel ill I'm not thrilled by any of that I'm not thrilled by anybody suffering but I'm thrilled by a chaos I'm thrilled by the fact that this whole system gets thrown into a fucking just a blender and spun around and no one knows what's gonna get spit out and a lot of these people they're getting you're getting really clearly revealed they're frauds these people that are in positions of leadership or bizarre human beings that don't even live in reality like I was watching Nancy Pelosi trying to dance her way out of saying that in February she was telling people to go to Chinatown hang out have a good time don't worry about it like like what you were doing the same thing you're accusing the president of doing you're accusing Trump of not warning people well you didn't warn anybody either everyone's playing gotcha with this nobody saw what the fuck was coming like I said the fucking World Health Organization in a tweet was saying it can't be transmitted from person to person no one knew see this is all this chaos of all these people getting revealed I like it yeah I like it there's part of it that I like I enjoy I understand that yeah one one thing that we have above all the people that live before us is that we have more access to information we see the flaws better we see the flaws better whereas before we were lied to and pull shit it now you could see it better it doesn't mean those flaws aren't gonna exist but those people are gonna have to be they're gonna have to be authentic they're not authentic right now like when you see someone the record will show that I was there in Chinatown to tell people to not be racist the record will show you can't do that anymore you can't do that anymore we demand you be authentic and if you made a mistake like that like in February look man if you were hanging out with me in February we were barbecuing I'll be like it's probably the flu people gonna get sick they're gonna die but I'm not a fucking expert okay I'm not a politician and if I said that I'd be like man was I wrong here's why I thought that here's what I wouldn't say the record will show the reason why I said that is I want you to not be racist to Chinese people mm-hmm like if you believe that like this is like some intricate plot to that Nancy Pelosi had to sort of stop racism against Chinese people like nonsense right you were talking shit in the world changed and it was the same as like was it the Secretary of Health in New York City well who was it that was telling people to go out take the subway I forget who it was but there was this lady like write a bad call right but nobody no the World Health Organization's telling people it can't be transmitted from person to person at one point in time no one knew it's a new thing you know where mistakes made of course they're made this isn't who's the perfect person in real time in the middle of the fucking pandemic crisis doesn't exist they don't have access to the information to make perfect decisions you have to have all the information was some of it ignored yeah because there was conflicting information so it has to be sifted through right is hydroxychloroquine turns out that stuff kills more people than not using it oops yeah whoops that's not then there's some other stuff what is the new stuff that the the nurse was telling us about yam Rams vitamins and by the way I feel good about you feel good about getting that yeah antibody test yes you know it's interesting well I feel good about that and I really feel good about I guess it was what we're saying it was the UCLA study that was saying that it has a much smaller rate of mortality than was initially thought so early antibody testing we talked about this so way how did they determine that is it because because they are being tested yes yes and anywhere people are no but this is how to do it as they are testing people they're realizing far more people have had the virus and survived from the antibody yes anybody not just far more but on a magnitude of you know whatever would they thought it was like 2,000 it turns out was like 400,000 or they thought it was 20,000 and it's four hundred thousand is the most and through that they've determined has a much lower fatality rate than they initially anticipated they were they were thinking it was gonna be like 5% 10% fatality it's like one half of one percent but that doesn't mean it's not dangerous it just means that it's not as dangerous as the worst case scenario could have been like if it was like the h1n1 which I think some crazy number h1n million infected I think but no I mean as far as fatality yeah for yourself for certain people's a very high rate of huh this was not as bad as that but they didn't know they didn't know they did do the social distancing with h1n1 they didn't everyone didn't go we didn't do this whole shutdown so then you go well maybe if we hadn't done the shutdown they're loosely worse I don't know what the steps were this was during the Obama administration I think it was 2009 Bert Kreischer thinks he had it hide he felt worse than he's ever felt in his life I have a friend who in December you know had the worst flu we ever had it was a weird flu a few friends who've had that you know this been around longer than we know I mean they said the first case was in January that was in December I don't know like who knows but Wow you know I mean you got to take care of you moon system folks this is number one you got to shore up the troops take care of the troops they're gonna fight the war for you if you have an army and your army is mal fed and your feed them junk food and bullshit and you're pumping them full of cigarettes you expect them to fight with all they have what they have is gonna be less ok doesn't mean they're not gonna fight to the death or whatever but what they have is going to be less than if you took that army and fed them healthy food and gave them eight hours rest a night and you know and taught them how to meditate and kept stress low like legitimately and that's how you have to think about your immune system this same way you would think about an army think about your immune system is this is going to be what protects you from the invaders and the invaders are invisible viruses and they exist and they have always existed and we know it this is not a rumor this is not alchemy this is not nonsense this is a fucking scientific fact and even knowing that scientific fact beautifully intelligent people that are some of the most creative and innovative people the world has ever known still ignore their own physical health because they don't think of it as a primary concern they think of it as a frivolous egocentric narcissistic endeavor to look good and work out and nobody gonna wear a fucking tank tops and flex your guns get the fuck out of here I'm doing research but we all need to take care of our bodies this is something that needs to be like it should be like brushing your goddamn teeth did your teeth fall out of your head while hey stupid you should have brushed your fucking teeth alright did your body start falling apart yeah hey stupid did you do your exercises everyday you didn't you don't exercise every day I can't help you you're not helping yourself exercise doesn't mean you have to mr. Olympia means you should be doing jump rope or push-ups or whatever you're physically physically you can if you have some limitations whatever you can withstand walk around your block with ankle weights on do something fucking do something man eat right do it so you have such a huge responsibility here you know that obviously but but because you have so many people watching this show okay I'm trying to freak me out Tom Crean little so you're responsible you're responsible for me doing this how about that ultimately you I don't like your kid yeah you know for Patrice used to say that about comedians that like imitated him they're my babies Patrice you say like like David tells got a lot of babies out there because a lot of people imitating David tell but you have a lot of babies and I'm one of your babies that's very nice of you to say that's hilarious Howard Stern Stern Dean Anthony ganged up with Terrence McKenna I'm all your babies that is very kind of you to say I'm sitting here on your incredible show with everybody is riveted by your show and when you say something it matters which is different than when you do a show on your you know I do a podcast now I got a few people listening but it's not like it doesn't matter right that's a responsibility so it's a responsibility of the people listening but you're when you say something here it will affect the entire society you have people now who don't believe in stay home order their own and well they should they should they should until the actual scientific experts tell them that they should go out but here's the thing right who are the experts and are they different in different states and I think that's one of the benefits of having 50 states when I was talking about the different styles of living Arizona lets you have a gun just carry it on your hip right you can't do that in San Francisco right everyone there's different styles of living let's find out what different styles are right way to reopen the world we know the world's got to be reopened okay we're not gonna just stay in our house forever we're gonna run out of food I have to do things right so do we have to do things after the vaccination and can our society survive that do you how many people are committing suicide right now my a friend of mine was I her said Nick Swardson I said yesterday sorry dang he told me was talking this sheriff and the sheriff said they used to deal with one suicide a week now they're doing five a day this is something needs to be factored in another thing there's a there's a Bloomberg there was an article that was written that we're talking about the drop in the economy equivalent to a loss of a certain number of lives and that every time the economy drops a certain percentage that's equal to X amount of lives we might get to a place where it's conceivable that more lives are lost because of the ensuing depression an economic shutdown then where would have been lost if we didn't open up if we didn't close down anything and we just let everybody get sick it's a it is a complicated thing and this is one thing that we have to really rely on the people that are supposed to be in power to address accurately and honestly no one knows the right way to do this there's some real good protocols in place for four P keeping people healthy and protecting each other and staying away from each other as much as possible and wiping thing down and using hand sanitizer and stopping the spread yes for sure but no one knows how to get this thing started again no one knows what's gonna happen knows no one knows what the risks are are we gonna wait and in the meantime what about the other diseases that are still around what about the colds and the flu and what about all that stuff that all stuff that you know it kills more people than any of these things including kovat 19 projections heart attacks yeah heart attacks killing people left and right how come there's no like well there's no alarms to stop people from dying a heart attacks heart disease was number one like the flu and all these other things that we're all terrified of this is lack of know first of all lack of information not knowing I mean lack you don't know if you can prevent this right cannot you can't you know you know you've eat well you didn't you look after yourself you be less likely to have a heart attack but you don't know if you can breathe can't breathe in a heart and then the heart attack thing is all dependent upon your genetics as well there's some people that have a predisposition to heart attacks but what you know like okay now just so I guess I asked this already but like that's a lot of pressure Joe I mean because if you say something wrong and it's sending people so you must do I'm just kind of curious how much time you do spend researching because you know you know so much information my ass 99% of the time you have Jamie Google things to correct me in midstream so is it instinct is it are you able to see sort of the you know the the truth through the bullshit and then you kind of because cuz I mean please sort it out in real time cuz you're walking to very you're walking a very fine line then you I think you're walking and incredibly well and in a way that many many many great many people are not right they true it seems like we're in this world now or because everything's so polarized oh I've got to choose to say this because that's what everyone's saying and they're just kind of saying it because everyone's saying it whereas you definitely straddle that line in a way that to me seems incredibly a astute but also must be some pressure to make sure that you're right not until you start telling me about it freaking out Tom Green oh well because you could easily be that you could easily be hey you should this is bullshit go I told him he was my daddy now being he's being like give me a little time now he's he's basically giving me the hard conversation I'm curious because it's fascinating to me thank you how do I do it yeah how do you have you make those determinations cuz a lot of people have made mistakes right a lot of a lot of commentators have made mistakes who have said things I make mistakes too if you're doing 1500 whatever the fuck shows Plus fight companions and shit I don't know Jerry MMA shows there's another 50 of those at least right mm-hmm 100 Jesus we're living the world now mistake done that that's very good keep going keep do it again it's this like number the vast number of interactions that most people have with each other are positive right most of the otherwise the world be a war zone most of the time you deal with people like hey I do and hey what's up hey this the same thing as podcast the vast majority of the stuff he do is gonna be good it's gonna be moments where though some guy you were taking a left turn and he talked to you and you said fuck you and he said no fuck you and like that guy's got a bad opinion you you got a bad opinion him that's gonna happen to well that's the same in podcast it's gonna be these moments where things just just fall apart or go off the rails it's got except it it is what it is and how do you decide to not and I I don't feel like you do have an agenda to change or change things in it any sort of premeditated direction you just you're trying to be on one people don't want everyone has an agenda right you can see Pelosi you you say this about who everyone right-left right-left they got an agenda oh I can't say this even though I believe it because that's not going to work with the narrative right that that seems crazy I I don't have an agenda yeah yeah no I can tell you just want to be real well I just I wanted I just want to be able to talk to friends about stuff that's actually happening that's it you know but if you haven't liked the identify have an agenda at all is I want people to do better get me included I mean there's one of the things that I like to do I was possible at this point sure for sure everything real stand-up with archery yeah I get better at playing pool more practice okay maybe get better at pool maybe martial arts or like the more you do it the more you think about how you're doing it and more you realize like oh there's like a lot of stuff I could learn here uh-huh that's what I want people to do I want people to find things and try to get better at them doesn't mean try to be the best doesn't mean be obsessed with it there's something that you get out of trying to be better and whether it's better physically like if you choose just like the to develop a better like people like look down at bodybuilding a lot of people looked down at bodybuilding like fucking videos isn't it okay that's great some the sometimes people fit the stereotype but there's kind of something cool about someone say I'm gonna turn my body into a work of art I'm gonna develop a freakish physique where I look like The Incredible Hulk in a comic book and I'm just gonna be walking around everywhere with cutoff shirts on and then and you what you do is kind of weird but it's it's kind of interesting too we just decide that it's stupid because we don't do it you decide that it's stupid because I don't want to be 320 pounds with 28 inch arms and fucking walking around but some people do and there's kind of something interesting about watching someone do that to their body there's something weird about it's a we writer suit at what point does it cross that line with bodybuilding look you know you're healthy you're working out you're getting yeah you know clearly I work out no but you're working out you're all of a sudden you're starting to go wait I'm getting close to that line where mm-hmm I remember Joe Piscopo no I loved Joe Piscopo right got real jacked like what because I was you know in the eighth grade and Johnny dangerously came out and you know you fire working ice holes and it was like he was the funniest thing to me I loved that was a great movie Johnny dangerous I forgot about Johnny dangerously referenced that's a that was a fun I remember the eighth grade we were coming at you farting ice holes we thought it was so hilarious because we're swearing but we're not really swearing but then all of a sudden he became Arnold Schwarzenegger and that was like there was a decision that got made there at that point I'm just curious because you I'm not really around a lot of the I don't go to the gym I don't know if you were I don't know if you could tell but I don't do workout at home I I walk I walk a lot you just try to stay alive pretty much yeah you like the Bee Gees yeah pretty much yeah I vote you know when I'm when I'm when I'm on the road and there's a gym in the hotel right great song yeah great song maybe once a month I'll go to the gym once a month so good number it's better than zero times a month what's a month on the road it's not not the worst thing yeah zero times a month is bad but I walk a lot and I touch my toes I stretching strangers live in dangers oh yeah you're alive I watched my more than watch my what yeah and I know you got some kind either sighs once you get a trainer once all this boils over yes dude to come over in a hazmat shooting yes show you how to do burpees I just worry I don't know what a Burpee is it's a fun exercise you you stand there you jump up jump up and you do that's one that's one revolution and you keep going any time I do any sort of organized exercise I feel great why don't you do it more often I need to it's a weird thing it's like come on oh that's what I'm talking about it's like this weird sort of you know you got to do it but yeah I I offered to make the decision like because I made this decision every time I go to a new hotel and I'm on the road I say this weekend and then a workout I pack my gym clothes I put them in the thing I say okay tomorrow morning when I get up I'm gonna go with the champ then I get up in the morning and then I just like go get lunch you brush your teeth do you take a shit I go to the gym I do just go to the gym yeah it's like don't give yourself an out the problem is you give yourself an out yeah like you can't give yourself an out why do I do that though it's a steven pressfield's this wrote about it in the war of art yeah it's a great book if you haven't read it the war of art it's a real small book I used to have a stack of a mice to hand them out to he talks about this thing that we all have everyone has not just me mean everybody that does anything has and it's like this voice in your head that wants you to do nothing this voice in your head and he calls it resistance yeah and he talks about this resistance that is in your head and that you have to decide that you are a professional this is what a professional does a professional goes to work and they they they give in to the muse okay the concept of the muse whether or not it's real but the concept of the muse is you settle in and receive creativity almost like as a divine gift from this magical entity the muse now whether or not it's real is not important what's important is it is if you treat it as if it's real it does work and what works is if you dedicate your time and your focus like realistically with a professional disciplined effort to creativity you show up every day like a professional but you show up to be creative if you just do it on a regular basis ideas will come to you where are these ideas coming from well his his concept was to think of it as you are a professional and you're getting these ideas from the muse and this is what you do you show up and you do the work you focus on it and these ideas will come to you and that's really true if you really stop and think about it if you write something whether it's the most brilliant thing you've ever written or whether you're not good at editing and it turns out to be dogshit you're still it's where is that coming from man you're just sitting down in front of your laptop and these thoughts are coming to you and all of a sudden you're talking about a kid who's riding a bike and it gets attacked by a werewolf like where the fuck is this coming from if it's not coming from the muse where is it coming from well it's good for my creativity okay do you know how to access your creativity like you can blink no you don't you do do I access your activity like you can lick something or perform any sort of physical functions repeatable no you don't it's a non repeatable thing treat it like it's magic but treat it like you're a professional and you show up to engage at the magic so every at the same time you sit down in front of keyboard and you start working mhmmm and just put in the work and put in the work and force yourself to do it you before sit like a muscle like the same muscle that you develop when you go running every day and then you get to the point where like seven days in you start fucking feeling good running right right so you start to feel like you're good at it you start feeling like you're getting better yeah because you're putting in the time I think that's what it is so with because I'm very focused on so many things in my life but for some reason I think I'm thinking me I'm figuring it out now because you explained it to me because when I go to the gym I feel like I'm not good at it and I feel self-conscious about it of course and I feel like oh I don't really know what I'm doing or people looking at me I don't know how the way puts bad inputs right and then you don't like it right so that you don't want to do it again and then you're next to some goddamn Calvin Klein model with his shirt off right then he looks amazing yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm feeling bad about myself and I don't want if I don't like that feeling so I'd rather just yeah I do it but I do think that you that yeah I guess getting a trainer would help because yes you know you're not making mistake because they're telling you what to do they're telling you not only they're telling you what to do but they go to chart progress mm-hmm and they're gonna challenge you like a good trainer it's look it's a very valuable resource like if you can afford a trainer if you can't there's a lot of great resources online on YouTube man YouTube is for someone who wants to learn exercise routines and wants to learn like a bodyweight routine that they can do just in their living room there's never been a better time to be quarantined you don't have to pay for a gym membership and this is gonna a lot of people gonna realize like hey if I have a fucking chin up bar in my house and one kettlebell I don't need I don't need a gym membership okay I got gravity boots for stretching my back out I could do sit-ups on that thing I could do leg lifts I can do a million different things with kettlebells literally a million more have atiba have any boobs around you hang from your ankles okay you never done that no oh my god the hood it feels so good do that I have a thing called it's a teeter and it straps onto your ankles and now you don't have to have the gravity boots anymore it's you're on a like a plank and it tilts you upside down you try it right out here we have it out here in the in the studio okay that I like even better it's called the Dex and you hang from your waist it locks you in curl can't imagine having gravity boots at home right now by myself just hanging upside down at the deck see is better for you it is the Dex you don't have to hang just you just put your legs in this thing don't you think that one feels the best yeah you cuz Jamie you had some back problems when you fell Jamie Jamie fell on the hoverboard I'm sorry I'm laughing buddies over those hoverboards are fucking dangerous man those things you stand on go a little mover to wheel things yeah well Jamie was learning out here and we have concrete floors and Jamie was playing with my camera while I was doing I was doing some shit you shouldn't do you shouldn't do that you should concentrate entirely on what you're doing you want to be strapped in when you land because you start feeling like I remember the first time I did it at the comedy store almost fell but my friend Tate was there at 8 to gorilla Fletcher he he had a hold of me like when I was on this thing I was like oh my god how does anybody ever get good at this this is so crazy like I'm gonna die and then five minutes later I was like fool it's like a really quick thing to life tried one once and I skateboarded my whole life and that's still it's a completely counterintuitive sort of balancing thing again well Jamie was fucked it he might have broken his ass bone didn't you think he broke your ass probably did okay took about a year and a half oh yeah he was talking about there was a kind of pain that he had then we saw it on the video there was like a similar injury was a critter was in here and that's right jack same thing that's right he went the doctors and they couldn't figure it out that's right it was AK bitter who is the world record holder for a 20 well for a 100 mile run he did a hundred miles in 11 hours and 40 something minutes is that what it is which is the most bonkers thing I've ever fucking heard in my life and then he ran a few miles after that wait what did he do sir he 100 miles in a row in 11 hours and 40-something minutes ran a hundred miles in a track hoe in the track it sir just went circles just rent yeah for 11 hours us distance runner Zack bidder she got to Zack he's a fucking Savage so instead of us you could run a hundred miles oh I'm sorry 11 hours 19 minutes that's the record for 40 minutes he's amazing they're measuring that like how many people have ever even tried that a lot to run a hundred miles yeah because a four-minute mile was a big thing he did it in the hundred mile record though that's a big commitment to break that record crazy 11 hours 19 minutes to go a hundred watts it's fucking bonkers that's bonkers Wow would it I wonder if he would have gotten a hundred miles in the same time if he'd just been running on the street alright I'll prop obviously now it all depends on whether or not it was totally flat there's a lot of factors involved when you're running that long like there's really savage guys like my friend Cameron Haynes he runs that uh moab 240s through the Moab mountains it's 240 miles yeah through the Moab like have you ever seen that terrain it's okay I don't man I've heard of the Moab where's that okay it's in Utah Utah right okay pull up the images from the Moab 240 so this is a whole different thing this is not just two hundred forty miles this is 240 miles I love that word pull out videos by the way like let's look at some videos because like two that's got to be a hilarious thing to be able to have the ability to do that by the way to wake up in the morning and say I'm just gonna go outside and then you you know you you know you know 11 hours later you're in Connecticut you know yeah right so this is this is the this is the footage from the race so these folks are running all through the night with fucking head lamps on in the mountains mm-hmm there's all like dirt roads and shit weird trails and there's I don't know how many people are in the race but it's 240 fucking miles man it's amazing the obscure things that people decide to do right I mean that to me seems obscure I'm sure it's probably very big thing but I just watch the movie about the the free free free climbing movie that's playing on the plane but the guy that climbed Alex Honnold yeah yeah he's been on here I'm sure yes he has Wow I know it's like to focus on something that I mean how many people have he the only person that had done that is he or the fastest to have done it or I think he's the only person who did it without ropes yeah yeah - so does to see somebody that decides like I said earlier we're gonna make tents I want to make tents I want to climb that yeah you get to meet so many people like that yeah that must be fun well it's it's very important for me as a person who's trying to figure people out is to be able to see this insane spectrum of exceptional people right to see someone like Alex Honnold who's a really fascinating guy yeah very fascinating guy because he's really smart he's really tuned in and he's really mellow he's got hands like sausage right and this might look like like change they've got his hands have evolved or something I mean not these fucking the surfaces of these insane rocks yeah dude he was telling us a story in the podcast of one time he was halfway up the side of the fucking mountain he realized he didn't bring his chalk with him so he found some other climbers that were on their way up that were on ropes and he said hey do you think I can borrow some chalk and they gave this guy goes yeah I have an extra bag here take it so he's fucking a thousand feet up just hang it on finding other people were connected to the ropes and they give him a batteries over and he leaves it at the top of the mountain because he passes that up cuz he's not using any ropes you're a fucking christ man climbing with Alex recently it's like about March well I heard about fall down or something he came very close to the system don't show me a frequent word don't show me all freaked out got down to that Wow oh my god that's terrible that's not good whoo holy shit dude look I know it's I jumped out of an airplane with Jared Leto once did you really yeah with Jared oh well it was we went to Paris California together with a group of people and I had always said I am never going to jump out of an airplane that was always my thing that I said my whole life never gonna jump out of an airplane I'm gonna go parachuting if you're done parachuting know exactly I was feel the same way I still ended up doing it because we drove out there together a group of people and I realized on the drive that I was the only person that wasn't jumping out of the airplane oh Jesus and for whatever reason my competitive spirit got the best of me I said there's no way I'm gonna be the one that didn't jump out of the airplane on the way back so we suited up and I just done that movie Charlie's Angels okay and there was a lot of parachuting in it and the stunt coordinators from that movie we're taking the cast out to jump out if they wanted to so I went and jared leto was there and you know my friends were there and and I did it I did it and I didn't regret it but I'll never do it again it was amazing it was exciting it was tandem you know you have a guy you're strapped onto a guy guys on your back right guys on your oh yeah he's on your back he's on your back he's on your back there you go and that the way the craziest thing is you go and you flip you flip and then immediately you see the plane the plane is filling your peripheral vision and then immediately the plane goes from bro get small and you realize wow that perfectly good airplane as they say that perfectly good airplane is getting a lot further away and then you're and now the weirdest part about it was this was 20 years ago now but or 18 or whatever but you're now you're doing this right and you kind of realize hey we've got some sort of control because there's another guy over there he's like kind of far away and all of a sudden like you lean into it and you're you fly up to him like Superman right now you're this far away this far away he's got video camera head I don't know what APIs and you're looking at each other and it's amazing and exciting and then the thing that was weird about is then you pull the chute or the guy on your back pulls the chute and now you're hanging from ropes you're hitting your chutes open and you'd think that would be the time where it's you can relax but to me the one time I've done it talking about parachuting like I know about it the one time I've done it 18 years ago that's the scariest moment because now you're sort of realizing that the only thing preventing you and you're looking at your feet now you're looking at your feet hanging below you and you're feeling these ropes you're holding and so I'm holding the ropes going these ropes give like nothing nothing between me and it was it's amazing experience huge adrenaline rush we'll never do it again because our now at least I can say I have done it right even though I didn't ever want to have to be able to say that now that I have said it there's no reason to do it again but you know who knows maybe I will end up doing it you should jump you should jump out of here I can't believe you haven't actually I'm surprised you haven't I think you got a contact house on yeah I think you should do it I think you would I think you would dig it if I lived yeah got you it seems fun you got with one of those I'm not in the thrills like that like you get your adrenaline from a strange way to get a thrill I'm not trying to knock anybody doesn't but it's a strange way to get a thrill let's pretend we're doing isn't it pretty yeah I get it I get it but I don't I don't think I need that in my life no you don't that's what I always said - it's not necessary they ended up waiting you know whenever you're gonna get in a situation where you end up going out to a parachuting thing with a bunch of people unless you know you're you know in a relationship and the person is going and you go with them because they're going and then all of a sudden you're there and you're going like I'm not gonna be the chicken shit yeah you got to do what you got to do save face yeah almost died yeah save face people do die you know what's fucked up about it that's one of those things that you kind of you do it and you think oh I'm gonna be okay and then one time maybe you're not and that's all it takes one of I think it was was it red bands dad his friend worked with a lady was it a lady that was really in the sky diving and she was always trying to get him to do it and then one day he showed up at work and she wasn't at her desk and he said oh yeah yeah died skydiving fuck yeah all that fuck all that dude yeah yeah that's like could have anticipated that you know yeah it's enough enough enough it's kind of how I feel about the that's why I've been staying home you know yeah for the whole world we just need we need to lock in this is gonna this is gonna be the the honey pot that gets us to enter the virtual reality this is gonna be the honey pot like do you want to deal with viruses there's no viruses in this world mmm your soul carry on so what do I even know what about what Edward Snowden I believe I've been researched this by heard he was saying that this is sort of a an attempt to get us to get implanted with you know biological testing have our phones set up more to follow us as this you know is there any sort of thing this is a reality of human nature thank you he's a brilliant guy any time there's an opening for people to take advantage of that opening anytime there's a moment that happens where there's some scrambling and maybe they can gather up more power maybe they can gather up more surveillance tools maybe they can make it easier to do things that they'd like to do that have nothing to do like the Patriot Act like they did there's a lot of stuff for the Patriot Act that had nothing to do with terrorism they just decided let's add some stuff and let's control these one of the fuckers they always want to control people Pete it's hard to control people and as the population gets bigger as time goes on they slowly give in to this idea of controlling people more and more so they're going to definitely use this as a way to ensure that you know they have some sort of extended reach whether it's some sort of a reach to make sure that you're vaccinated or some sort of a reach to make sure that your your antibodies are clear some sort of a reach to make sure that you're not drinking are you because if you drink you get your immune system shattered if your immune system fuck's up what if you get sick and you pass it on to your friends if you're drinking you're being a bad citizen like who the fuck knows what could happen once someone's tracking whether or not you're healthy what are you doing man I see you've only slept seven hours last night like what's that all about Tom all right seven hours not a lot of sleeping yeah do you not love your neighbors do you want to get sick now do you sense ortus or any been any evidence that that is happening now that there is with our phones specifically to do you know the phone's tracking it is heard like I think well the concept of it is definitely available right the concept of it of contact tracking is being talked about openly and then if if a company ensures if they figured out like say if like there was a place you go right this would be kind of interesting so save there's a place you go Tom Green you go and they give you a vaccination once the vaccination becomes available and you know that you now don't have to worry about getting this thing so we can track all the people that have been vaccinated as long as you sign up for the app and all the people not be vaccinated you see them and you see them on the app oh my god well before we stepped in this mall let's see what kind of shitty fucking citizens there are that haven't been vaccinated or maybe you're not allowed in the mall yeah yeah and you'll be able to find them on a map and it'll get real weird yeah it's like it's another step a really quick step in dragging us into the Machine and to take away you know the the nuances of just human life that we're accustomed to and it become more and more digitized and organized and people need freedom man and if you don't have the freedom to just be somewhere without the government knowing that you're there like if you haven't committed any crime you're not a criminal and if they could just monitor you and you've never committed any crime that a weird place that's weird things are getting weird you're supposed to be you're supposed to be following criminals only and I know it makes it easier for you to follow criminals if you could follow everybody but you were changing what everybody is you're changing what people are if you follow them all the time everywhere they go if you listen to everything that they ever say through the microphone and their fucking phone you're changing what they are and you're making them scared and everybody knows it and no one wants to admit it you're making people scared and people do things because they don't want censorship they don't want to be censored they'll only yell at they self-censor they don't want to be not in compliance it changes their behavior mmm and we all know that we all know that it's dangerous to creativity it's dangerous to authenticity it's dangerous to so many things it's not it's not a good way to be as a person like looking over your shoulder people are watching all the time it's to aware this is too weird it's too weird and to force the whole and then who's got control that the government like what some people that got elected to a position the only ones they get to look in on everybody well and then what if that opens up was they know everybody can look at it and everybody fuck it the Information Act we just gotta give him the evitable time gonna watch his shit I'm gonna watch your shit from your toaster cuz your toaster your electric toothbrush that knows whether or not you have cavities is listening in while you shit not a pretty sight yeah it's almost like we're taking a step closer and closer towards the digital world with this and that's I don't I'm not a conspiracy theorist in the sense that I don't I don't I don't think that robots are out to get us I don't think that the electronic world is looking to consume us but I am concerned with some steps that we could take that make our life more digital to take away too much of what it means to be a person some what it means to be a person is like fun there's this there's fun and the weirdness of the world there's fun in the danger of the world you take away all that shit with apps right and and alerts and you know and like where I can't go down that Street there's a guy down that street that was arrested at one point in time shit like what well you know we're gonna lose out all the mystery of life for safety and then we become what would have become these unromantic boring bullshit digital things that are locked into pleasure sources things that pump them pleasure because they take in the place you know I mean really they could do that if they could get to a point where you wear an implant it just keeps your dopamine levels up at a very high high note you get augmented reality glasses where everybody's hot it'd be pretty cool might be might be better than not yes like that might be better if they lie to you like the matrix remember when that one dude was given into the matrix and he's like look I just want to be an important person don't be like an actor or some memories right he's a steak again no who's eating steak right yeah maybe maybe he's right yeah it's cool just to sit here and and and I mean I'm just I'm just I mean thanks for having me thanks for being here dude and thanks for I mean that original thing in your house yeah no you didn't do that I'm telling you man me and red bam we were in your house I was like this is we need to figure out how to do this yeah I even talked to those guys the the Denver people I talked to them at one point time yeah but it just didn't I was in the middle of doing a bunch of different shit back then that was right before I moved to Colorado to and I was like I don't know if I'm even gonna stay here I don't know what I'm doing I know you know I mean and then I was like I don't know if I want to do that spend all my time doing that I want to concentrate on the shit I'm already doing but then as time went on I just kept thinking about that and I kept thinking about doing it with nobody I've kept thinking about and I think about this for money just do it let's just do this for fun don't do you know if I did it with some company or some it's like mmm yeah you could do it with serious or some kind but it better to just do it right just do it just to figure out and then slowly that was the secret spice right there that was that's where you figured it out right there because that has people people see that right they can tell that yeah and then that's all documented you go back watch the horrible early ones they're all available that but that's no but because of you though you can probably second-guess them but no you here had this incredible energy and you're doing your thing and people loved it so eating the early winter paper trip people go back much the early ones they're terrible stay away from them we didn't know what we're doing but it's also like everything else the more you do it the better you get at it but because of your risk-taking because you were the guy that was willing to set up this crazy setup in your house and because I knew you and I'm over your place and I'm like wow like this is you really went deep I remember like being around your house guy Tom Green what have you done and I was thinking like this might be it like he might be on to something well this might be the move like just do it all yourself it's very kind of you to say straight oh man it's true it's you Anthony ku Mia Opie and Anthony Howard Stern for sure the original one it's all everybody feeds off everybody I grew up loving David Letterman okay yeah David Letterman when I saw him go out on the street with a megaphone and yelling out of his office of people I was like oh I want to do that yeah I want to get a megaphone and I would go stand on the roof of buildings and my hometown the video camera yell at people with a megaphone Suze Letterman had one of the best styles ever of like hosting a talk show because he could talk to people that were talking to him about nonsense if he didn't give a fuck about mmm-hmm and he would have the same enthusiasm as if he was talking to Al Pacino not some Academy award-winning movie he was in yeah some some rock star like Mick Jagger sat down there he would talk to him with the same left he had a style like Dave Letterman had of like he's in on the joke style of talking that was my first experience with seeing something that was kind of like anti television yes yeah more sophisticated what is he's making fun of television while he's making television it was and that was completely a date of this girl when I was 25 and she fucking hated The Tonight Show but loved a David Letterman and I'm like why I go why is it she goes because I don't you know I don't want you bullshitting me and she goes I know like he's in on it like David Letterman Xenon it yeah the other ones are just bullshitting you yeah the first first time I ever saw somebody kind of you know goofing on the network yes taking the sleep basket over to the security guard and I'm messing with them getting in trouble his boss you know you're biting the hand that feeds you here but I mean the risk that he took to do that was like real you never saw that on TV before everything was and he was the guy who broke Jay Leno he he brought Jay Leno out to the people Jay Leno at one point time was the edgy comic oh yeah he was the guy in the 1970s yeah he was they everybody says it everybody who was alive back then said he was the sharpest comic working yeah and he got on Letterman and would go on Letterman with his jet-black hair and like this sardonic wit and like sharp punchlines and he was the fucking man back then oh yeah yeah it's kind of crazy you know where he's at his best for sure is his car show yeah holy house sure I love that show he's himself that's it again it goes back to what we were talking about earlier he's authentic what Jay Leno really is is a guy who loves cars yeah that's there's no joke and that man he doesn't have to pretend he doesn't give a fuck if you have like a dune buggy you made out of a VW or if you have some crazy souped-up Corvette if you have some crazy NSX from 1994 he loves cars yeah he loves them like I've been around the guy he has first of all he has like 11 warehouses full of cars I watched your episode with him actually on his show that place was great bananas yeah bananas yeah he just has car after car after car how many cars a couple hundred cars I have no idea hundreds of cares eleven buildings filled with car 11 buildings yeah some of them were worth a million dollars to stray see scout like he's got steam-powered cars and you see him dry in living in LA right you know each other you know there's Jay going buying a steam-powered car if you live in Burbank people look forward to that he'll drive by on a fucking tractor he takes cars are not supposed to be able to grow actor I'm not kidding yeah he put old-school one with metal hills and he had rubber put on it so he could take it on the road is he doing it to be funny though like I'm on a tractor right now or is he just think the tractors cool because is there an element I'm just I don't know I don't even we would know they usually be a reductionist to stay one way or the other it's just got to be so much fun for him to be driving around in that know it really is legitimately fun for him one of the things that I said when I was talking to him when he and I were driving around was like hey man like you're you're really you when you're doing this it's so much better than doing the Tonight Show and having to pretend that you give a fuck about some teeny boppers new his new fucking top 40 hit you gotta go wow that's amazing like you don't give a fuck about that you care about 65 Corvette mhm you know Jay Leno's around a 65 Corvette you see Mike all the lines and you see him looking at the steering wheel the seats like that fucking guy loves cars man he loves them it was bones yeah he loves them he loves no ha that's the one with the 454 the 70 Chevelle SS he like he gets into the the gritty details of it and I remember think I'm like man it was too bad that you ever did it tonight's show should have just done this like if somebody had figured out in 1970 whatever that this is what Jay Leno is best at oh my god who'd have been like the most the greatest car man not that he isn't right now but the greatest car celebrity that's ever lived in terms of like a car guy on television because it's authentic cuz he really does love it and he's funny like when he does that show that car show is Jay Leno's Garage he's so loose yeah he's like it's just himself yeah I've watched a lot of those shows I love that show yeah he loves it he loves it's real and you hear stories all the time but oh yeah my car broke sometimes someone in LA says last week it happen again someone's car broke down no Jay Leno pulls over with his wife on the road and gold-plated wrenches in his backseat you literally break down in LA and jail pull over and fix your car and then take off [Laughter] [Music] yeah he probably likes it yeah he loves cars man like legitimately it's like guys that are working as a garages he's always got his fabricators right so his guys are like fixed fenders and shit put new quarter panels on a car you could do everything it's nuts the guy loves them loves them and he's got everything man Mopars and old fucking Maseratis and Jesus so you know a lot about cars so well no no no no I know some about cars but I don't know her to his average guest that he has on the show you probably was one when he went in there and yeah he loves the fact that I'm axle car nut I really I'm a car nut that's a fact but I'm not a not I'm not good I don't understand what's going on hold on details yeah I'm not turning any wrenches and I know I know what you got a problem with your solenoid switch or something any of that yeah I know what drives good I know it drives good I like to drive I love cars that make you feel like you're driving them too but then again I like Tesla - Tesla's like it's doing all the work and that do you drive that if you ever trimming a Tesla before I drove I know officially that gets Exodus I drove Harland Williams as Tesla first of all we were talking before about Theo Theo von and he has this language of comedies uniquely his own like Theo just has stuff like you see it written on paper like what that's funny and then you see him say it on stage you can't even breathe you're dying right this is a go Liam Harland Williams a perfect example of this so hey there a flapjack what do you say buttermilk biscuit like but you're crying laughing and so Harland is one of my best friends in the world I love that dude and it's it's surreal to me that we've become so close friends because like I was saying earlier when I was a kid I was his biggest fan I was actually told him this the other day I was telling him I have told him this Polly story ten times you alone I was like we were talking on the phone okay I was telling him Jerry clothes on uh I did he he called into my he called in my podcast I'm sitting in my house by myself and I you know talked I was interviewing my friend so but I was telling him stories like this one about to tell you right now and you know when I was a kid I would go down when he would come to yuk-yuks and at the time and this is probably not exactly a fully accurate statement but for whatever reason at the time it seemed like there wasn't a lot of that kind of weird like breaking the whole mold of comedy comedy hmmm everyone there was stand-up and then he was the one standup that was really surreal really strange and silly and so at the time it was it really popped out for me as a goofy kid it was kind of a weird kid you know what year we're talking about 88 89 oh wow that's before I met him yeah yeah back and he hadn't come to the States yet and and then and then I remember he was like that from the jump huh yeah I mean he was so he was headlining in Canada he's from Toronto I'm from Ottawa I didn't know him and went out win it when when I was fifteen years old I think I was doing the Amateur Night he was my favorite he'd come into town and I remember one day I went up to him at the bar at the comedy club 15 years old some have some reason they let us in I went up to the bar with my friend Phil and we went up to him and I said mr. Williams would it be okay if tomorrow we took you out for a submarine sandwich Oh sounds good to me in the next day of Saturday we went out in Ottawa took him out for a submarine sandwich and he was I was drinking his cocoa thanks for the submarine sandwich there fella you know so he was being himself on the inheritor he was he was great I mean he was just it was just great yeah and yeah it was it was until years later where I actually got to know him where he's you know not always like hey you know but but so it was it was incredible to get to know him and he's always been a friendly guy as long as I've known him I met Harlan I think in 94 and I'm like what a friendly guy this is my thought of him has always been the same with a friendly guy he's always friendly every time I see him I hug him I'm always excited to see him it's always a nice guy he was one of those initial things though in my mind where I saw somebody who's seeing I'm gonna do something that nobody else is doing and I'm gonna be amazing at it well you know when he figured out it figured out how to be just he's a you he's weird and I want to say unique but yeah but it's he's got a weird sense of humor but he's also really nice so like that weird sense of humor is intoxicating it draws you in like a siren to the rocks mm-hmm and he just starts talking his nonsense and he just get sucked into the trance and it's it's he's just figured out that like we were talking about before there's no right way to do it there's no right way to do stand-up this is the right way for you and maybe you're an interesting person maybe you people people vary so much man it's like it's all in like can they figure out how to make their own unique weirdness come through and make make jokes out of it and some guys like Harlan figured it out perfectly well if you wrote it down it's like you want to steal Harlan Williams act he'd be Foxx and possibly you would be fucked you would never be able to do it right like the ovals - there's no way no one's doing that no one you have you have to be that guy right yeah he's figured out how to make his own unique mannerisms hilarious top-flight comedy I love him and you know this and here's a guy who's one of the most creative people I know obviously one of them and I were lucky to get to know a lot of people that are like top of their field you know Harlan's you know created a show called puppy dog pals it's now it's going into fourth season on Disney animated show for kids it sounds like he's oh boy he created this whole show it's like but you teeth taking that energy and putting it into your art without compromise which is what he has always done which what you've done you know man it's it's it's pretty cool my fire I love the guy I love them it's one of the cool things about living in a place like LA is that there's a lot of people like you in Harlan and you know we can keep going fill in the blanks Joey Diaz and Duncan Trussell and all these fascinating people Duncan Trussell fellow yeah so many folks I mean we're real lucky Tom Segura Owen Smith Bert Kreischer you can keep going down the line yeah Joey Diaz we live in an amazing spot there's so many bill burr Santino Tony Hinchcliffe there's so many interesting people here it's a good spot and as far as that but we're all spread out well we need to do is buy up a fucking plot of land and put a fence around it called comedy town like Hidden Hills you fucked up a gated community for comedians yeah got pretty fucked up in there but be fun grow tomatoes shit so you love it you love LA you think you live in LA for the rest of your life no no I'm thinking about getting out now I heard you mention that every watching people drive man people listen there's a lot of people that are under incredible pressure right now financially and that's well people are under pressure that's when they act the most erratic I was watching this guy yesterday he cut in front of me and then he cut into the left lane and he passed like in oncoming and he cut in front of the people in front of him and I was like what buddy yeah what did someone mister some where you would go where there's not fucked up drivers though we are in a position right now where people are under extreme stress I'm starting to see it a little bit on the road I'm like what is it gonna be like when everything opens back up again is this gonna be the best spot mmm or is the best spot can be like a little slightly less populated we can look up hold back so we're ready go let's watch this motherfucker from a distance and you see in the distance he firebombs and I knew it I knew people were getting sketchy I knew San Diego is the spot mmm I don't know I don't know what the spot is over the mountains of Colorado I think San Diego is a good spot because it's it's a city but it's not as big a city it's big enough though so it's not it's not hick right right sophisticated but it's not too ridiculous but you wouldn't miss getting up at the Comedy Store every night but if there's a bomb what if there's an earthquake what if the volcano goes photometers destroy to impact it's going down to the yeah center of the stand-up universe and to having that I help my every night whenever you want would have that anywhere else I had it and I didn't have it who your had it again for the Comedy Store I had it for from 93 to 2007 then I didn't have it from 2007 to 2014 that I had it from 2014 to today and I'm better off with it especially the version of The Comedy Store that exists now I'm definitely we are all better off for it it's a it's an amazing place right now and I'm committed to keeping it amazing and doing whatever I can to get it back to financial health and whatever whatever we can do to get everything rolling but I think if we had to get out of LA for some strange reason as long as the Comedy Store exists for the comedians that are here I'm good I think there's a way to not be right here yeah I just think that right here is so crowded hmm there's good and bad to that you still come back for a couple months exactly rent a house stay there do stand-up the story go back to your the movies to get like a nice apartment here yeah will you come back occasionally yeah but watch this beast from the outside and play musical chairs hopefully you don't get stuck here where the music shuts off yeah yeah I think about Lux I'm from Canada if you think about going back I do a lot on toes shit yeah yeah I love to run on where would you go I'd go back Auto I just coming off his horse my parents my brother and old friends there and they still have access TV back then back there brother like you do cable access the public access station you imagine if you did that I've thought about it but do you imagine how people would freak out same studio you would get a story on Digg for sure if calm I feel like I'd be good I'm green goes back to cable access place where he first started I would love that yeah imagine if you did that yeah how people would go nuts for that you know it's interesting cuz it's like now we you know we've got the internet now so it's sort of interesting that public access is different now right yes back then you had to kind of talk your way into getting in there you know you wouldn't think you can just get a shows you had to kind of talk you're way into getting in there and then once you got in there it was nobody was watching but if you did something weird enough her people would sort of hear about it and we used to send our tapes down to Manhattan neighborhood network in New York and you know people would hear about it and it was but it was it was not like the internet you know now it's almost hard to imagine why anybody would need to do that when I was an open mic in Boston we did some cable access shows the same same thing I think is your public access TV thing in Canada that cable access shows and I think there was some sort of a rule that if you had a cable channel you had to leave a certain amount of hours open for people to just like regular people just sign up and do things so me and a few other comics we put together these terrible sketches uh-huh and I'm not sure they were amazing they went they were terrible well they we would you know with 21 years old and they went up on cable access and I remember one of you have those no no but it's not a tape somewhere in 88 maybe you don't have the tape no I don't have every tape really yeah I let things go yeah I'll keep movin keep movin keep movin bitch but I remember like thinking while I was there with my fucking moron comic friends were you know just silly bitches doing this stupid show I'm like who the fuck let us do this I remember I was wearing a dress just thought about some dating show that's why you lost the tape I was I think I was like it was like a blind dating show so you got to find it so stupid but it was just like it was not funny but I was thinking like honey they let you just do this sounds pretty funny yeah but better better in this like me telling it than actually seeing how bad it really was just like there's nothing lucky nothing bad about that but this is YouTube now it's like YouTube is taking that and no one saw it coming that's what's so interesting no one saw like a thing where anybody can sign up anybody can create an account anybody can upload video nobody saw that being this thing that would ultimately like the amount of eyes like Jamie you would know that's more than anybody like what are the amount of eyes that are watching YouTube every day like what's the total number of human beings that are watching YouTube every day let's take a guess Tom Crean yes number of eyes watching YouTube every day yeah yeah a number I don't know yes Maci yeah I'm trying to think individual humans are individual views because someone watched something 10 times that kind of mean individual humans I want the individual humans so if it was 1 billion that would be like 1 in 8 people which seems like a lot but but it also seems like a number that you would imagine them saying it would be so many views do you think it would be a day let's just get was that might be simpler how many views a day does YouTube yet it's funny because I don't know but I'm gonna imagine a see if ever a billion people in the world seven points on something yes so if it was a billion today that would be crazy that does that mean like 1 in 8 people watched a YouTube video day or one guy watch that's a million and one is tick that doesn't seem unrealistic it might be a billion I'm gonna just guess that because a round number was a good number yeah alright I'm gonna go with 700 million is this like Price is Right rules ok September last year daily active users is 30 million but monthly active users is 2 billion so there are a larger number code that use it every day versus the people that oh I see users really thank you people that are using it every single day how many views how many views I was my fuse but no we were playing how many of us watched per day is 5 billion Oh Price is Right rules 5 billion billions that means is one guy 5 just watching a billion yeah I wonder what it lets me that's impossible there's 8 billion people in 100 possible it's crazy well it's that's how many people are watching how many people how many videos individual people watching what we think the number of videos the average number of videos a person watches per day on YouTube we say for how many the average number average number how many think how many you think you would watch average I probably watch for whatever ten a day so yeah that's not even close to that I might watch two or three a day yeah I don't watch a lot of YouTube I watch a lot of I watch professional pool I watch a lot of it's a good place to watch this on youtube okay way better than anywhere else it's hard to watch pool on TV it doesn't really exist anymore yeah but you watch it on YouTube there's fucking thousands of videos with hundreds of hundreds of thousands of millions of views I use it for tips with Pro Tools ah that's good I can't figure out how to do something so then I go how do you you know dude for martial arts it's one of the greatest resources ever you know so many people give it instructions on how to throw certain kicks or how to cinch up certain submissions like jiu-jitsu alone is like is accelerated in in giant leaps and bounds because of the in skateboarding - oh I'm sure I'm sure I think it sacré speed boarding Thrasher Magazine once a week a magazine would come out you could see a still shot of a guy doing a trick you'd have to imagine was now you kids are watching watching the bring repeat and they're seeing exactly where the foot goes exactly how the board spins exactly and then they then they learn it and then they advanced on in the advancements of the advancement you know I'm sure you've talked about this two videos rubbing drumming like a new young kids or that's why you got all these young kids or like incredible musicians cuz they go on YouTube they see it and they replicate it and then they improve on it yeah dude it used to be hard to find a fucking drumming coach they could tell you to drum like Travis Barker you know fuck is gonna teach you how to do that yeah I can watch that's not on demand yeah and I think that's with everything with playing guitar with art there's so many like tutorials about everything Jogja like if you want to just do yoga at home fucking hundreds of thousands of yoga videos you know anywhere it's kind of crazy like has never been a better time to be quarantined right right you imagine if this happened in 1990 if you can be a self-starter or place yourself how to be a self-starter right now it's a good time to be quarantined yeah he's got to be a self-starter just got to get up and go to work I've made a point of trying to do things that I've always wanted to be able to do at home in my house that I haven't had time to talk your own cock you know I'm not gonna say the improvements I made in that area but it's amazing what happens if you mike shinoda from Lincoln Park and other bands he's been doing live streams showing like from start to finish how he makes a song Wow I watched one yesterday's like hour and a half he started from scratch how I these are the keys I'm using this is the thought process I would use yeah I like how he's color coded as his waveforms I think that looks different yeah it's amazing why is that cat have hypnotic eyes that's so he was streaming it and I was like this is the his live video from his livestream doing donations but that's people are following and subscribing that's very cool yeah it's like something like that like if you were a kid they wanted to know how do you make a song like I love Linkin Park how do I make a song like Lincoln Park BAM yeah BAM and it works now you can get on your computer and have that Network seen you're a part of that you understand that right by creating your Tom green show you allowed people to think about streaming things from their house I bet you were a part of a lot of people's desire to jump in and do something like YouTube because if you really stop and think about it before you were doing that before you doing it from your house or you're doing it from that public access station you know how many people were doing that you're a real pioneer Tom Green legit the Pioneers leave with arrows in their back Joe no you know listen I've always loved technology that's one thing that's kind of interesting when I was when I was a kid my dad was in the military but when he retired from the military after 26 years in service as a tank commander he continued working for the Department of Defense as a COBOL programmer so he learned he went took a computer course and he learned COBOL and he would go off and heat up the cards and he took me in he'd show me these big computers because Otto the capital Canada there's the government there and these big computers and I remember in the 80s early 80s they had this thing in Ottawa was called the Naboo Network it's the weirdest thing you would you would order it in Google this NAB you if you don't believe me and it was essentially a like a VCR sized box you could rent it you would hook your television cable into it and it was the Internet it was basically the internet you could talk to people there was video games got pumped through it so you could play like real arcade style video games on this thing and it was really like way advanced yeah there it is that's it I had that and and and my dad always got like the computers that no one else had like everyone had a Terry 2600 but he went got the Naboo cuz he said no that's that that's Doug Henning by the way the magician the Canadian magician Doug Henning doing you who had the who did that ads for I remember that dude and yeah so you're sitting there as a kid and you're you're playing like Dig Dug the arcade game same graphics quality and it's streaming through your cable it's not it's not you just you don't have a cartridge it's streaming through your cable so you're thinking about that and then a lot of my friends were very advanced my friend Phil Giroux who was the guy who drank coffee in the window in the background of my show on MTV there was a guy who's my best friend he's a so we started doing stand-up together when we were when we were teenagers and then he kind of had to quit when he was 17 because he got hired as a computer engineer for the National Research Council because he was a computer genius so there was always this really early sort of computer sort of things I've always loved looking at that technology and going okay well what's gonna happen like so now it's like what's gonna happen next that's the question what's gonna happen next what's the new technology now like what's them what's the thing that's happening now that's gonna be next and I don't know what it is really but it's it's fun dead manatees right now it's fun to try to figure out artificial intelligence what's the augmented reality I think yeah I think it's gonna be something that whether Apple comes up with some fucking Terminator style remember those Terminator goggles mm-hmm something Terminator style that go look Google glass or those glasses just like a weird little thing in the corner of your eyes I think sucked I know but that like sunglasses yeah look aviators put on some aviators and you have a whole new view of the world with navigation with emails with voice calls with people with her translucent you can see the people in front of you so you don't stumble into someone but you still know that you're talking to your friend Bob mm-hmm you see each other while you're laughing you could split from your view to his view you can see I mean that all that stuff is coming man that's coming that's the next step mm-hmm that's the next step my real concern is that what I was saying about earlier about if we have tracking on our phones to make sure that we're not covet 19 positive and like that you're giving up too much I feel like you're giving up too much they're good I think people need to people need to be you know conscious of their health and take care of the immune system and make sure you follow all the protocols and wash your hands and don't touch your face and all the things that everybody's been saying but I don't really know if we want to give in to that level of scrutiny that level of tracking but will will even notice it right it's already happening right yes that's a question two phones well you know you put your email in and you know it's already happening and we've so the convenience right it's so convenient and then all of a sudden everyone's doing it and I'm doing it and good call all of a sudden it's like baby step baby step baby step yeah I'm so sort of like are we maybe already there we might be when they started planting chips in our bodies and that's when it's gets a little bit when you're going down to the I don't know the clinic to have them inject a microchip in dear this company was putting chips and their employees arms they can buy things at the store just by waving their arm we go through doors yeah so they're all getting a wallet to get chips and I'm watching this and I've probably watched at four or five times since then but when I'm watching I'm looking at them going why are you doing like where is this going hmm you're gonna allow a company what if Xerox fires you and you get their chip in your forearm mmm what are you doing yeah what are you doing you gonna just be walking around with that Xerox chip in your arm what you're gonna get it surgically removed some Blade Runner moment I'm gonna carve it out yeah no big deal set out on your own cuz no one will do it for you cuz you're not allowed to take them out if you take the stem cells it takes two weeks to heal it's not a big deal carve it out what what are we doing like listen I think if we looked at it you know at ourselves in like 1980 and then looked at ourselves in 2020 and said okay well how did this attachment to phones get so so in just deeply ingrained in the culture without people figuring it out it was a planned was it too you know you get this dopamine rush mmm from when you get positive energy back from something positive reinforcement back from something and so did they know that before they made the text messaging that every time you got a text you get feel good and then you or did or did they realize that as they were going oh oh whoa look at this people really like this people really like this phone they really can't put it down oh that's because they're getting a dopamine rush every time somebody gets a positive enter oh well maybe we should double down on that maybe we should create more of these or was it was a plan from the get-go or was it a new yeah I think it's one of those things that people take advantage once they realize they see it and they go oh yeah how do we how do we how do we double for you know the all the Cambridge analytical stuff oh look and how do we let's give them what they want to see oh they're liking this they're liking this let's lead them down this garden path okay now I'm going this way I'm going to yes I don't think there's a cabal of super geniuses that are trying to manipulate people in a way that get them to get addicted to likes yeah I think it's something that people realized along the way and they took advantage of it and I also think that what really were what started it what started it was people trying to figure out how to get people to be more engaged what's the best way to get him engaged and the best way to get him engaged it turns out is get him upset right and then they figured out how to get people upset is to like fill your feet up with things that you engage with mm-hmm but they're just trying to get you if you were like really interested in in positive intellectually enriching ideas that's what would be in your feet all the time right so you're blaming them for you having this like shitty desire to eat Snickers bars all day ain't and mental Snickers bars uh-huh you know but that's that's really what it is like what they're doing is like Ari Shaffir did a test on YouTube but he only searched for videos of puppies right and that's all that YouTube recommended right videos of puppies so all these people like they're trolling me they're trying to get me know you're interested in those things yeah I'm not interested in abortion well you're reading about you're watching abortion videos so what about when you start talking about stuff you haven't even typed it in and then you see it popping up right that's weird I hate that Jamie now we're just talking about that happen a lot to these days the thing that goes on your finger Oh - pulse reader we had one two days ago mm-hmm and we didn't say it out loud we didn't discuss for a while I think I did saying I'm getting my vitals checked yeah but I didn't say like oh look at that thing on my finger look at this company that makes pretty sure I did it the exact company that made it I got an ad for it I've got it three times the last two hours now I mean I I remember having a conversation about my Toyota Krug for a second there that what do you how do you think that got to you my guess is it connects to that poor whoever somebody's phone because it's got bluetooth in it it's connects to something so it's sending out a signal constantly our phones also have bluetooth on if you leave it on looking for a device is connecting constantly wait so wait what happened it was listening to you know what it's a it's a Bluetooth device that checks your pulse okay vitals okay okay because that is what it is it is sending on a Bluetooth signal and/or a near-field signal to devices probably the person's phone who owns it or is connected to it right but it's also sending out looking for other devices I mean my phone also is looking out for Wi-Fi signals for Bluetooth signals there's got to be a connection there somewhere where it's tracked how many what devices have been logged in or connected to this within the last six hours 12 hours I've heard I've read about this in the past so the possibility would be that this thing I'm just talking about it from a moron that this thing on your face sends out a pulse or said it reaches out to find out what like maybe Google programs are open devices I think devices how does it get that cookie into like your Google newsfeed we start seeing these so just like what I was gonna pull up with this chip thing that it's describing here our phones have ship a cute device number mm-hmm what they actually call it's like I don't remember off top my head butts like that MS ID number or something like that you're - it's almost like your social security number for your for your device it's not for your phone or anybody that's just that that device now there are this that the data mining companies can get that device number and then sell it and that's how it then ends up on your phone well they don't necessarily from what I've heard and what I've been told they don't necessarily know that it's you with like your name and your one-of-a-kind serial number they can get there it's your number they know that you were around that finger thing or your phone was around that finger thing they don't know it's you I mean I've seen a company offering this data to someone who wants it that like if you wanted to target ads at someone what they could do maybe like two years ago is like you could find women aged 25 to 45 in the United States now now you could go specific as I like to party years old wine that live in this city you can get very specific and they only have that data from this ongoing collection okay and finding it out okay I just think it's weird when it's you don't even sign up for anything it's just your phone starts it's like it's listening to you right I'm assuming it is yeah you know you're talking about Toyota trucks and then you start seeing them in your newsfeed yeah I'm thinking I'm thinking of getting a Toyota truck which happen to me I was thinking to get a Toyota truck right solid choice yeah very reliable ninety-three tweedle answer call Oh Land Cruiser yeah that's right yeah and then all of a sudden play Oda Toyota Toyota Toyota Toyota Toyota Toyota mmm there's a microphone is on it really I really believe it and you know they always say that everyone says your phones listening and then you go you sort of don't believe it but then lately more and more I really do believe it now and then you go all do I should I turn my phone off all the time I put it on airplane mode all the time I leave my phone on air is it legal to listen for ads like how's that work is that legal voice recognition software it's taking your name your words and searching them and I mean I don't know I don't think there's laws against that yeah but it's slippery right it's all we're sliding into this digital world just slowly sliding in it's listening everywhere suggesting Tom I see you're really in the toothpaste yeah right yeah you want to Thwaite any toothpaste this is the stuff and then maybe you weren't really into it but now you are really into it you mentioned it once but now you're seeing it all the time to know you're really into toothpaste Otis what's the what's the decision this decision to resist the machine or is the decision to enjoy the moment just live your life as a one-player in this infinite multiverse of lives coexisting dealing with this technological singularity that we're all moving towards what's the decision what do you do I think it's to be aware of it aware of what they're doing is what it's about taking my ass I can't believe yeah look at it right that's what we're that's when you're aware you're aware it's happening and you are able to not be completely manipulated because at least you're aware of the yeah because I supposed to be walking blindly through the world and not thinking about the fact that your phone's listening to you or that your yeah so I'm really worried about what the next grab is gonna be because the next grab in order to ensure that people will be safe from this kovat 19 it's like it's hard man once they get some some sort of control and power over you it's hard to give that shit up and when we're looking at these studies that show that it's not it's least as far as the amount that it's been contained and hasn't spread through the population but the amount of people that actually have been infected how many of them actually died that it's much smaller than they were fearing it would be when are they gonna let us be normal people again or are they ever yeah are they ever I mean we just wearing masks from now on do we have to wait for a vaccine like did we decide that it's more to spray down they're saying is it is it more is it worse to die from this than to die from the flu or to die from all these other things and you know what else is really interesting I was reading this thing where there might be a balance you know a lot of people died from kovat right it's not to diminish the amount of people that died but that because people are staying at home less people have died from automobile accidents that it might turn out to be just sit money back on my car insurance because of that yeah and do you see how low gases gas is free that giving you gas there's no one's driving they pay you to fill up that's Caddy's negative 35 everyone was driving it would be more valuable what's the other factors the Illuminati lizard people well these fuck kids need to keep it at a dollar fifty a gallon cut the shit we're trying to rebuild this economy you fucking greedy lizard people that's uh there's people that believe that right like still I was watching that London real interview he said he he believes that he saw someone's eyeballs turned to lizard people yeah you say on that one did he say on the other one no he said on the value tainment there's a value tainment podcast they were interviewing him after the London real podcast was taking up the air and he said he saw people's eyeballs turn into reptile I was right and I'm like Chuck please yeah please could have been some good LSD maybe it were maybe did didn't really happen yeah that's true maybe just wanted to or maybe it did happen maybe you did yeah yeah probably not yes idea that people are lizards it's hard enough just being a person just just dealing with people people yeah no evidence of lizard people stop let's try to figure this out together you're distracting everybody well this lizard talk I think we want to believe that there's something that can't be explained so that I've gee the towers the 5g Tom Green right so what's that about paying attention to 5g yeah research flat earth in n 5g you've probably had the flat earth people here right this is a little Duvall you know Lil Duval on Instagram he had a hilarious point that he put up I think he retweeted somebody else's point with his like five countries with 5g towers and more than a hundred countries that have Co vid 19 how the fuck do you think right it got from there to all those people you really think it's 5g yeah some people do yeah some people think it's 5g man it's amazing how things can just kind of grab a hold on the internet here's the question she was five Jim's how would you find out do you think Verizon we let you know if 5g just started fucking people's heads up and they start running into walls to think Verizon be like hey guys oh you caught us you caught or yeah you got us what would they do if it really was 5g bad we were trying to sting if 5g really did fuck people up well you know I look I've always asked myself you know going back to just talk about radio waves microwaves I mean I've always wondered who he is do more people have cancer now as a cancer survivor ago did I get cancer because I grew up in a world where there's radio waves and cellphones and all this stuff in there or just people living longer and getting cancer I don't know I mean I don't know but do you wonder it's gotta affect the human body to send I don't know what is it radio wave electronic energy through the air than going through your body through your cells it's got to affect it right so so you could sort of see how somebody might think that yeah that a stronger signal could potentially affect the cells in your body maybe but but you know I go why stab why start now let's go back to just you know radio you know microwave ovens you know yeah who knows who knows I don't think so yeah I mean I think there's a lot of factors but I think that biological factors you know they found in the instances and I believe they found it in like cave people and certain animals they found cancer and all sorts of animals yeah yeah and wild animals they've found cancer in them it's cancer is a weird thing and we can't assume like what when someone is born with certain diseases right we don't we don't try to make some sort of environmental connection always to the fact that they're born with certain diseases even people that are living in paradise with no toxins in the environments there's still the weird randomness the giving birth to people conceiving a child and the child coming out and what everything has to be in order all the ducks have to be in the road and make sure there's no diseases like with there's so many variables man and one of the variables is cancer and the fact that some people get it and some people don't and some people live their lives terribly they abuse the fuck out of their bodies they take all kinds of drugs and nothing happens right it's crazy yeah I think this is people like you they just live normal and they get cancer and if you didn't pay attention to it you could have died that's just how it is the world is weirdly random mm-hmm in that in that sense well it's not fair genetics are not fair intelligence is not fair creativity is not fair there's no fair there's no fair and if you start looking for fair favors in your household okay fair is amongst your clan Affairs amongst your loved ones fair's not the outside the outside world is a wild competitive battleground of ideas and actions it's not fair it's not fair at all and how do you prevent that randomness from scaring the shit out of you you can't man yeah you can't you you just got to keep on keepin on mm-hmm yeah there's no way you can't if you prevent it from scaring the shit out of you then you're not paying attention to it right you'd have to block it out completely if it wasn't terrifying mm-hmm because if you were paying attention to it's gonna be terrifying if you're not blocking out completely you look at the randomness of just the fact that we're in this planet with no roof and we're hurtling through the galaxy and there's all these asteroids out there and you know sometimes they don't see them because they're coming from behind the Sun they just fucking slam into us and kill everybody yeah I spend a lot of time trying to decide what freaks me at more the infinity of the universe or the infiniment infinity of being dead you know mmm like infinity of the universe that goes forever and once you're dead well that's forever - right there's this no no what's stranger this would be the scariest yeah the infinity of the universe if you live forever and you can breathe in space and you didn't need food and you were just floating forever and go see what the fuck's going on but you can't isn't you're never gonna land you're never gonna touch ground I'm just gonna float through forever for billions and billions of years without ever talking anybody but you're never gonna die that sounds terrifying that might be the worst yeah that may be way worse than dying yeah I think that would be I mean what is worse than dying wishing you were dead flying forever for billions years you know bored you'd be after the first billion years and realized you have an infinite amount of billion years left where you're still gonna be alive breathe in air with no need for food no friends mm-hmm you know what you know now we've been transformed by the gods and to this this symbol of psychic torture you're the god green that Tom green in 2021 God came back to show us all a lesson he let Tom green breathe in space mm-hmm and fly on forever and live forever right and then you you streamed your thoughts can't land on the classroom going around there's no landing I'm gonna be up in space forever be frustrating to fly right by a Greek planet and yeah one planet looks like Lake Havasu we're going over top you go they're all drinking you can't go down can you see it though how closely come out looking you see a close enough to jack off but then bear in the space again yeah we may not be so bad then you get every billion years you come around Oh every billion planet how much is not a daily fallacy - 3 times daily 5 times daily remember that movie that was about like god dammit Porky's or Canadian it was Porky's Canadian yeah the biggest independent film of all time was Porky's at the time probably it's I'm sure that's changed now was that an independent film interesting yeah and I remember when I remember that because that was my my age right you know our age right you know when you were like a kid and all of a sudden there was like you could see yes I could see boobies in a movie oh yeah that's pretty much I was the movie to see that is the movie to see man that was a you could make that movie today you know Porky's yeah oh yeah there was no chance there was some some weird shit there's a rape fest right I just remember some weird shit in there for sure yeah by standard current definitions yeah yeah there's a lot of sexual assault wasn't there I have to go watch it again yeah me too well there's definitely some peeping tom type activities weren't they there yeah some violence there we go whoa there's a lot of those what a great film yeah oh yeah well we were kids this was the shit right what year was this oh my god so I was 14 this was the shit dude yeah oh yeah yeah this was this movies probably a time capsule and there's moments in that movie where when you're a kid and you're seeing that and there's no internet and you're seeing something that you've never even fathom before and look what they did - they made it about an earlier time they made it they got off the hook by making is it I don't know maybe not oh and that's from Sex and the City right oh yeah yeah yeah Kate control that's wrong Kim control yeah yeah I knew she was in this is the scene I was gonna bring up I didn't want to mention as soon as I felt weird mentioning it who stayed hot longer than Kim Cattrall you know she hung in there strong multiple decades Porky's 1981 son all the way to Sex in the City go but go back a little bit on that tone let me see those cars from the 1950s like before that when the cars are pulling into the parking lot like look they did it all yeah there it is so look at those cars those are all like 1953 cars so they they did it all in an even earlier time yeah so they got off the hook by saying yeah people back there they fuckin cave people the 1950s grabbin tits yeah spitting on their dicks and it was an innocent time yes well it's also a time where you could do these outrageous ridiculous movies and people just roll their eyes and go home they wouldn't you know protest you have you deep platform from everything then there'd be the VHS of it and everyone talked about it you're like the ski movies it is no Scott dog yeah dog and pastimes at Richmond High of course vaguely know when Phoebe Cates gets out of the pool everybody sort of paused that rewound that video humming of aged high school movie yeah was giant and it was you know I mean for people who don't remember young people I mean can you even imagine a world without an Internet so that was your only access to seeing any sort of nudity right I wonder if I think we have it best yeah because we were born and raised with no internet and then we found the Internet later in life so we realized how crazy it is whereas these kids that are growing up today they've always had the Internet the concept of no internet is so alien to that mmm-hmm yeah and when you when you don't have instant access to seeing anything you can imagine then your mind has to use its creativity to come up with ideas and visualize it yeah you know they don't have doesn't exist now so so that was i I I'm glad I'm glad that we grew up in that era dude we got lucky we really did because that time was like and no one's ever gonna get that again you never get it again and we lock up and the society restarts but then you're gonna learn how to kill a bird with a rock all right you're gonna be starving to death right if society resets that hard you'll be fine you'll you know no one's gonna be fine medicine that life is horseshit you don't want to live that the fact that we could the fact that we're young enough to enjoy all the technology now you and I are young enough to enjoy it the wou same way young but we also are old enough to have remembered as adults living life without it is kind of a luxury and we're the only generation we're the only age group that will ever experience that Fisher it's a unique perspective did you have pong as a kid yeah first video game so yeah me too so pong which we used to have was the most crude video game why did I didn't have it my friend Sean Potvin had it but you were around what you experienced it was probably that was great would I have been if great and I would go over to his house after school and I was like I remember I remember he was like Marissa yeah what what what you're controlling the movement of the television there's a there's a thing and you're controlling it yeah playing call of duty they're pulling sniper shots on people making their fucking heads explode look at Jamie gets excited about that look at them is that what you're addicted to call of duty yes how bad how bad is your addiction I didn't play yesterday oh you took a day off yeah we sweatin no i almost played i didn't a game footage instead you just watch somebody play for half an hour Oh a little twitch fix is that what which is good for watch through their eyes see how they pull off a shot I got to commit to turn that's how they're gonna get you to I mean think about how big that is video games now first of all they were already at the borderline of being bigger than the film industry right and then they got bigger than the film industry and now the film industry is taking a big hit because people aren't going to the movies so they're gonna have to go straight to I phones or Apple TV or Amazon that's what a lot of them are doing now right does that mean we're getting closer and closer to living inside the machine because you live inside that computer game it's more exciting mm-hmm but everything's coming for your TV now even the movies coming through TV how's the movie going to compete with call of duty fortnight is launching Travis Scott's new song and music video or something today like in the game that made a character for him they're launched it stop it might be happening right now actually and not only do you not have to leave the house but we're not allowed to leave the house so many people are gonna do that in games have stand-up comedy specials in games it's gonna be an option now it's gonna be an options you can have an audience you can go to the Tom Green Theatre and you walk in and sit down and the curtain parts and Tom Green gets on stage and does especially they already did it once at the DJ and it was live he was talking live I don't know what he could see do you know like on his end if he had a room with like all the thousands of servers that were open oh we show that that would be awesome but they're very close already yeah they're gonna be able to do it I've seen 360-degree YouTube videos have you seen those we can move your cursor around it's crazy you can like move to different spots in the room virtual reality didn't take off though did it the glasses it didn't take off when they first invented it cuz I don't think the technology was ready but before the quarantine there's a thing that we were playing down the street called sandbox and it's amazing yeah it's really good like there's one words was a dead wood mansion that what scroll you put you have a haptic feedback vest on and you have a rifle and you have these goggles on you put the headphones on you have things that go around your wrists and things grow in the ankle so it tracks your movement and then you're in a haunted mansion right and fucking zombies are coming running at you and you're gunning them down and it's wild they're dropping out of the roof and right in front of you and they grab you they hit you I'm see red in front of you and you feel it on your vest it's nuts and the graphics are gonna get better yes their blade better now and then you're not gonna want to leave we had John Carmack come in John Carmack is the guy who designed quake he designed a 3/8 3d engine for doom and quake and all those amazing video games and then he was working for oculus so he came in with this the newest oculus the newest oculus is just a headset you put it on and it works off of an iPad you have a headset and these two things you have no tether there's no cord attaching you and it has like this clearly designed framing for your game playing area so like you framed the room so if your room is like out here big like a warehouse you can walk around like 30 feet this way and 30 feet that way and make a 30 you know foot square in 30-foot need direct each direction and then it knows that's the game footage and shows you where the walls are so it gives you this view of like don't go past here it gets opaque and now you know and you back up and now you're inside the haunted house again now you back up and you're in the alien spaceship again it's nuts what they can do now and when the graphics get better and then the world gets bigger yes that's when you don't want to leave because you feel like you can actually physically go explore and never find the end of it well that was that one game where you make universes you make planets and worlds it's called no man's sky but it was like a never-ending self-perpetuating type as you kept going it just made more I don't know if it worked out the way it was designed or what it was advertised but they're still working on it and that's just one step though to get further again that is gonna probably be like the inspiration for someone when new technology emerges to take it to the next level and come up with some other even more deeply immersive game once they did once they really get that haptic feedback shit down precise we could feel someone grabbing your tits you feel somewhat choked you yeah you know yeah well that's what you're into many of you getting attacked oh if you're the game of kicking the door and some guy jumps and you grab crazy like you felt of joking you mmm I got all that I mean movies like the revenant right where Leonardo DiCaprio gets attacked by that grizzly bear yeah if you had a suit on that lets you get attacked by a grizzly bear yeah but it throws you to the ground yeah it's biting on you shaking you like if you like holy fuck no it's just some suit that figures out how to manipulate your body the same way would be manipulated in this video game I haven't done a lot of that stuff but it's like that your mind does believe it right well if you're walking there's the one where you walk to the edge of the thing you look down you get vertigo and you know you're in a thing but your mind just see you walk a plank yeah obviously how to plank I think I know did I see it here or we seen that on the about it yeah yeah yeah you could put a board down on the ground yeah two-by-four I saw them walk on it and it seems like this is the board you walking on and look below you you see the city streets yeah I saw that recently on the internet yeah how long until you can fly how long until you ride one of them Avatar dragons go through Pangaea where is that was it Endora penned or go through a Pandora riding on a dragon how long not that long man less than a hundred years one hundred years from now you're just gonna ship and you got to be gone riding to be in some other universe to be in some other world you're gonna be Luke Skywalker you're gonna be Mickey Mouse it's gonna happen man it's gonna happen a hundred percent how long does it take you know how long does it take for that happens and will it be gradual or will be one big leap we don't see it coming and we're all like those Buffalo that the Native Americans used to push off the cliff or one of them would go off the cliff and then the other one fuck there's a clip but there's like a thousand buffo behind you that don't know it's a cliff they just keep pushing yeah when that headset goes on and it's way more satisfying than reality yes we're gonna have a trouble it's trouble because that's just gonna the thing that's gonna push it I'm sure that Warren that will probably be what happens what pushes every technology you know push streaming push the VHS push so many things porn video on video for sure once they figure out how to literally and have it feel like you're having sex with a porn star yeah like she has sex with a guy that guy wears a headset and then you put that headset on and it's like they're having sex with you yeah why leave the house at that point why just watch avatar two or three oh no I'm not doing it James Cameron first trying to get me to be vegan now you want me to be a robot but the avatar what was that like the Avatar depression syndrome with people like oh yeah man that was the concert or whatever know people got avatar depression because they went to see avatar and they wished their lives with that Noble they wish their lives that important and amazing people that happen are the depression yes was real because they realized that we live a bullshit life yeah and they want to ride a dragon and then fucking shoot bows and arrows have been bad guys they got avatar depression it was like a real thing because so many psychologists we're talking these people so many psychiatrists we're treating these patients that they were they just started calling it something like well how many guys are you getting every day that are sad because the avatars not real how do you do this as often as you do the energy the mental energy that it must I mean this is awesome I mean but for me like I don't have to that we've been on here from a mentally ill amazing that's nonsense I just found something that works with whatever's fucked up about me whatever's fucked about me is I'm interested in shit I talk too much ya know a perfect amazing look together no it's amazing it's exciting to sit here with you of course but to see the genuine enthusiasm for all of these ideas we're talking about you do this every day you do this not every day but you know how do you hate that
