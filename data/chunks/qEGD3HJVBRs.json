crazy I would be more afraid of a guy that says I'm like who says I am afraid but you know what I'm gonna still do it and I don't care if I'm afraid bring it I'll do it like this is sound crazy to me more than a guy said oh no no I'm not afraid because this guy is a lie he's afraid to say that he's afraid he's right hangman you know what I mean to me like personally that's what it is yeah posturing imposing it's it's unnecessary exactly but you are afraid of aliens though right yeah my friend does it true you have like a path mapped out in your house how to get out of the aliens show up now no that's the rumor man that's what I heard I heard you have a plan because I know you like to use game plans so I figured you had a LM I know I know care Eddie and I know jiu-jitsu value Java I put a triangle troll on him and also have a cat that I've also a katana Japanese katana so if they come I can slice them apart Wow do you keep a sword in your house yes exactly it's a it's a collection you know it's for me it's I have to we better not bring any crazy bitches home oh man it's a sword and crazy bitches yeah I have this knack saw on the side of my bed that always forget is there and I was like almost got my finger off all the time and yeah you should put down the garage on fuck is wrong see this big sword slash meat cleaver that it's just so do you really have a fear of aliens or is this just a bullshit rumor because it what didn't you do a countdown show and you did a whole thing talking about how you're being scared of being abducted by aliens yeah I'm scared I'm scared of a lot of things but honestly I get what I'll get I'll get into it I got I kept I kept talk about it right now and talk about it's one day I'm gonna come out and make a big thing about it but now all right I've been called on right now yeah have you had an experience with aliens no no no I don't believe you haha I don't believe you I don't know you don't know you might have had an experience you by my manager gonna have a heart attack right now this is like my brother I would never do or lead you down any path that's bad for your career just as you said that it's good that to be afraid it's also good to be honest about everything even shit that sounds crazy no no I don't know it does the thing I'm honest and like look I'm honest I'm afraid but I don't have to tell everything on the public it's true you don't but you know do you have second an alien because you're a smart guy let me tell you you're a very smart guy you know you know to dig dig into people's mind and as what I like you I hate that about you because he put me on the spot right now but he's a very smart guy but now I got I got go too deep listen if I was on an alien spacecraft and I had sex with an alien like I'm assuming you did I I feel like I would just come out and talk about it I don't know why you would hold that back no but I mean and I never something happened George I don't know it's either it's either I'm crazy or or or maybe it really happened but I hope that I'm crazy I don't think you're crazy I hope I am it could be pre crazy you know some people there's some great mind and you know they're they've been hallucinating stuff some people are out you say many iku depressed some people are OCD some people are there some people are dead and they're still great they've been able to achieve great stuff in their life know so maybe I'm crazy when I was I don't know my open well these experiences I can help you in one way are these experiences happening at night I am not sure I'm not sure have any of these experiences happen while you've been in the dream state or were you just been dreaming or just asleep and you were woken up I am Not sure that that expert I don't know I don't remember anything but it was there was at nighttime type things was it nighttime when you think you might have had something happen to you I can't say something happened to me I have no proof I just don't know but I'm gonna tell you about is your brain produces a chemical while you're sleeping but I'm gonna tell you something I'm gonna be honest about it sometime I'm looking at the clock and it's like I wake up and I look at the clock right after I sir and it's like the clock advanced like a four hour or two hours there's a time zone that I don't remember what happened it's called fall asleep I hope so what do you think you think you're getting snatched up and taken away for couple hours no I think I'm maybe I fall asleep that's why I hope that's why I hope or I can drive I can drive my car I can drive my car and then already happen I drove I drove my car when you were sleeping I don't know I drove my car in a normal day like going somewhere then I look and it's two-hour pass I'm like two hour I just pass like this like maybe maybe I didn't see maybe I didn't I didn't I hadn't and maybe I watched their time the wrong time like I watched my clock and I made a mistake myself right most likely right yes of course my hope I hope so well that's very minor stuff that's very minor stuff yeah um but that could be you talk being tired because you push yourself and lace dress it's exactly that's exactly what I hope so it's exactly what I hope so but you don't have any memories of great dudes putting fingers up your butt no I don't know that I've had a gel where you're driving down the street like on the highway and you're just like kind of dazed out and like wait how long I've been I've been dazed out for like a like 20 minutes what have I been doing for 20 minutes you can tell you autopilot yeah and then like you just realize like almost all said you're home yeah but the thing about being exhausted and sleep you know having these experiences at night they there's a chemical your brain makes that's one of the most powerful psychedelic drugs known to man so one of the things they're trying to connect it's called DMT one of the things are trying to connect is people having near-death experiences and people that have had UFO alien abduction type experiences in this chemical that they can introduce this chemical into the human body and people have very similar experiences to what they had when they had a UFO encounter or when they had you know a white light near-death experience in counter it's most likely this chemical that's doing this so when people having these experiences they're very realistic and they do believe they're being taken aboard by you know a UFO somewhere they might not be wrong but this is not a UFO encounter this is like oh it's on an that the five flying our jet right object this the encounter we talked about that if they've been taking a board this is this difference a cake it could be a third type encounter it is there many ways but this is different yeah but I did you talk about me I don't have any I don't have any memory of such thing but I think I neither like I have like you say sometimes I fall asleep then I wake up is the the time pass and I'm like well it's like a but that's just cuz you're tired man that's not aliens yeah no no it's but a you worried you like man how maybe it's aliens how would you do know it's because I am I feel like I didn't fall dad I don't fall asleep and I'm not tired I'm wide awake awake hmm but I fall asleep like this and it's kind of I mean it's kind of rare these aren't the hard sparring days no no just a normal day now you could happen every day we should get a GoPro like a camera just record yourself all the time yeah everyone think that happens watch it I mean this thing's record for like eight hours at a time some of them yeah how long has this been going on since I'm a kid Wow Wow wouldn't it be crazy if the aliens like manufactured you to be uh yeah mixed martial arts fighter don't let's see if we could just turn that try way I'm sure if it would have happened I would have been much better than this much better than this you're the fucking champion yeah but if I would be at you and manufacture I would be a Superman you know well they just want to get ridiculous with it it has to be real it would be yeah that would be obvious I can't turn a guy into a goddamn superhero ya know maybe they manufacture Anderson Silva John Jones maybe they did maybe zeldo maybe someone needs to talk to them about their sleep patterns maybe they're falling asleep behind the wheel too and being sucked aboard a spaceship for repairs maybe they don't want to maybe they don't say but maybe they are I don't know I'm never pretending I think it's funny though that that's maybe one subject that you you you have a you had a really hard time talking about that I do because it sounds crazy yes and I and I will talk about it one day I'm gonna talk about my fear my all that stuff and but no no I don't get deep into this yeah maybe this is what I promised one day I'll go oh I'll talk about stuff but it's not what you promised one day I'll promise one day that's that what is there is no tomorrow didn't you see Rocky 3 when Apollo Creed says that to Rocky Balboa you say maybe maybe I'll die one day maybe I'll know it tomorrow I hope I touch wouldn't up and add people how and I my god how did you say that it was a French touch would not desert I touch the wood I know what it happened you know yeah just let it go just whatever information you got spill it nobody I don't know I'm doing my I'm doing my own research I'm researching on myself yeah you say that's the thing that you just told me is very interesting the chemical that buddy-buddy yes / that's / that I'm happy that I meet you today and you tell that about me because I make me mean yep you know yeah it'll make you think like well I think a lot of people think they're going crazy it's not it's just your brain makes psychedelic drugs Israel your brain produces it and parts your liver and your lungs they don't know why this stuff is in the body but it's it's a super potent psychedelic brain makes it and it happens when you sleep in so if like the speculation is that it happens during REM sleep I don't think they have the most accurate way of measuring it but they know it's in the body and they believe it's the the theory is that it comes out during periods of heavy stress or when your body thinks it's going to die or in REM sleep those are the times that you have higher levels of the stuff in your neurochemical soup that's interesting that's crazy why would you brain why would your brain produce an incredibly potent psychedelic drug so a lot of people that are having these nighttime experiences it could be just varying levels of this chemical that's going around in your brain but that doesn't mean that these experiences aren't real we don't know what the fuck sleeping is anyway I mean what is sleeping you shut your eyes you shut off you don't exist in this plane and your consciousness goes somewhere else like literally you have no memory of a giant chunk of your day and we have no problem with it and yet we don't connect it to any other realm or the idea of there being other dimensions you go into another dimension when you go to sleep okay you do you just shut off you stop and for all intents and purposes you are in another dimension and if while you're in that other dimension your brain is being pumped with the psychedelic chemical that when you take it when you're sober makes you have these incredible experiences it only seems to it just seems like a normal thing to look into like people should be looking into that like what it what is what is happening when you're sleeping your sleep you go away and everybody's just so used to it they're like no big deal we just go away just go away for eight hours a day you know everybody's scared to die and no one's scared to fall asleep you're just shutting off man you know you're gonna be back so you're not worried but you're shutting off whatever that is you know is just accepted if sleeping didn't exist it would be the craziest fucking thing if all of a sudden you told people they had to shut off for eight hours a night and just completely not be away they'd be like what are you talking about I got a shut off like yeah you're gonna shut off for eight hours a night and you're not gonna know what's happening people can touch your balls while you're sleeping you have no way of stopping them there's a lot of things that can happen that show it is I said we don't know we don't know we don't know what the fuck that is I could I could like you don't like you say it so that I'm afraid to be crazy it's just I can say whatever the hell I want and we don't know baby you know what I mean we don't know we don't know the truth we don't know whether yeah somebody might be stealing time from you they might be stealing time like this motherfuckers got time that the truth is I feel like ad experience and I don't know what it is so for me to say it's alien or say it's a the drug chemical you talk about I don't know I can't tell you right now I don't know what it is but I did I felt like it could have been an experience or not maybe I felt maybe I'm crazy and it's the normal thing that everybody would like maybe I had but right now I like I don't know it's too I'm making my own research to find out about that how are you researching I research a lot of stuff documentaries and things and go on the internet now it's another thing I just said to me I'm going to research at my research on the wrong maybe I receive things that people have tried because that lab lapse of time that you don't remember they've been some people been at eyes on the other by the bad you know what I mean yeah and I don't want being uptight well that's very controversial you know the what's happening during hypnosis hypnotic regression it's very controversial because there's a lot of people that believe that you can introduce fake memories into a person while they're unconscious and then you could you know you you could steer the events in one way or another and introduce false memories so not it's not very it's not very reliable I don't think so that's one of the big things about these people that have these crazy stories from hypnotic regression like what the fuck is really going on you know you don't know a lot of times people that are in therapy in the first place or a little wound art of course so it's that those are the type of people that you're dealing with you're hypnotizing them and then you're finding out about these nutty experiences with aliens who knows what the fuck your real but I'm gonna tell you it's like Socrates used to say you take catfish in the water okay and the fish is live is in his environment let's say you're fishermen you grab a fish in the water it pulls it off the water look at him look at make the fish look around and drop the fish back in the world the fish after is going to go back to his friend and he's gonna tell the other fish man a bill pulled out of the water in and it was the people were breathing air it was another environment I saw a human being poop you know like and then grabbing me I saw trees I saw a bird in the sky I saw like a like a son I'm like I see a different thing in different universe and then you put me back the other fish whole thing is completely insane so maybe in a way we're all like fish and and maybe there is something like you said like when you save another universe or another well or something and we don't know and we're right next to it but we don't know and if that's what I'm doing research I want to see you know I'm going to grow as a human being fine what was the truth even though I probably will never found out that food and I want to get closer closer and find my research to see what's happening you know and we're all in the same pattern recording oh it is already what the fuck son
