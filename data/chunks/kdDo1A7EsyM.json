hello freak bitches people are really reluctant to give up fun shit like lying and driving their car fast it fills two things people are going to have a hard time with you like actually getting into the into their mind seeing their actual mind and being able to do that so we can know without a doubt whether or not someone's guilty or innocent but my question to you is if you could get inside someone's mind and it was like that really super um suggestive guy they were talking about earlier that just confessed all the horrific demonic possession stuff and eating babies what if it's like getting to the - that guy's mind what if you can't tell well that the case that that worries me and this is perhaps an inept segue to politics but the me we're in people's minds everybody get you get someone talking long enough you know their minds I mean they can only conceal what they're about only so well right how do you can cuz you're a super smart wizard but I've no just but Jamie I don't know about I don't know if he's a mind reader but the question is will people care you know it's like like if you if you have we don't even need a lie detector if you have someone who's openly lying right right who just gets caught in lies again and again you can see it - you feel it right but people don't seem to care right in the in the Lisa in a political process I'm thinking in this case of Trump where you have someone who is in in some cases lying or just changing his mind in such a incoherent way that it's the functional equivalent of line I mean someone who becomes totally unpredictable he has a stance that is aid on Tuesday and it's be on Wednesday and when the discrepancy is pointed out he tells you to go fuck yourself right so it's just there's just no a there is no accountability to his his own states of consciousness right that he's going to be helped to and the people who love Him don't seem to care they actually in as far as I can tell I don't know someone these people personally but it is from based on you know social media and seeing the few articles where someone has explained why they love Trump people view this as a kind of this sort of this dishonesty what is on in my view both dishonesty and a kind of theatrical hucksterism a sort of person who's who's pretending to be many things that he probably isn't they see it as a new kind of authenticity right like this guy he's just letting it rip he doesn't care what it what is true he doesn't care what your expectations for coherence are he's just going to tell you to fuck yourself every which way and this is the new way of being honest right this is a new form of ntek integrity it's amazing to watch mist it's getting it's been I'm someone who actually I remember on my own podcast I I think I was talking to Paul bloom this is Yale psychologist who's great and we had talked we got into politics so this is at least a year ago but at that point I said there's no way we're gonna be talking about Trump in a year and this is going to completely flame out and I was this is a I don't tend to make predictions but this was a clear moment that I remember of making a prediction which is now obviously false but I just couldn't imagine that this was this what people were going to find this compelling enough to further for him to be on the on the cusp of getting elected it's it is terrifying have you taught if you talked this issue to death on your podcast or I guess we kind of have well I think this is how everybody feels everybody feels like you're supposed to be like with their person whether it's Bernie or whether it's for Hillary or whether you're a trump supporter whatever it is like you have to be all but like if you look at the the choices that were given the none of these could really be described as ideal no no like Hillary Clinton you could want a woman in the White House and you wanna want to show everyone that a woman could do that job just as well as a man she's got the most experience she certainly has the most experience dealing with foreign governments and she certainly has the most experience in politics can make it easier but she's also involved in two criminal investigations she had a the observer in her bathroom there's all squirrely stuff going on she's terrible Injun anyways she was anti-gay marriage okay like 2013 and then wouldn't admit the change of mind other yeah it's a she's a politician she's probably a brilliant woman but she's also set in her ways in a politician and a politician to the end and part of being a politician is being a fuckin huckster you got to be able to get those people to see your side and the way you do that is to talk like this I can't talk like a normal person needs a speech coach so they all do he's terrible to the Trump's not even good at it and he kicks their asses well no but no but her boys she has a kind of to use the the sexist trope she has a shrill for it we know where when you get her in front of a mic and there's a crowd and she thinks she's talking over the crowd which she doesn't have to do because she's in front of a mic the sound you get is just it's is she's yelling when she doesn't need to yell someone someone has to teach her how to dial that back what you just is called mansplaining yes I'm Harry I'm explaining to the men in her future talk some sense into her but she she is she's a bad she's a bad candidate right I have no doubt that she's very smart and she's well-informed and she's qualified and she is absolutely who I will vote for given the choices but you know I totally understand people's reservations with her she's a liar she's an opportunist she is just almost preternatural e inauthentic I mean she's just like she will just focus group every third sentence and you feel that from her right and and this is all true and yet I also believe the people who say I've never met her but people who know her and have met her say that behind closed doors you know one on one she's incredibly impressive and and great but that doesn't translate into her candidacy she said probably think she has to do it old-school you know I mean the way she's doing it but she I mean the thing is she's when you look at the what's work what worries me so I went out on Facebook the other day and I have said very little about this but I've made enough noises of the sort that I just made that people understand that I that I'm you know for Clinton despite all my reservations about her and when I got on my own Facebook page which you have to assume is filtered by the people who are following me on Facebook and and already like me in some sense just like a thousand comments of pure pain I mean no one loves Hillary no one no one said oh thank god someone someone smartest for Hillary it was all just Bernie people and Trump people flaming me for for for the the most tepid possible endorsement of Clinton all I said was listen I understand you know Clinton's a liar and she's and she's an opportunist and she's I completely get your reservations about her but at least she's a grown-up right and she's going to be the candidate it's not going to be Sanders pessoa the moment now is the moment to put your political idealism behind you if you're a Sanders person and recognize that there is a vast difference between Clinton and Trump and no she's not going to change the system but she's also not going to run civilization off a cliff right and I didn't forget how I said it on Facebook but it was just the most it was just it really was a lesser of two evils argument and it just it was um it's amazing to see how energized and passionate people are in defensive Trump and Sanders and there's almost none of that for Clinton it's like if people are just sheepishly saying that just divulging that they will vote for Clinton but they are maybe somewhere that I haven't noticed someone look absolutely loves Clinton but it's just it's she does not have her defenders the way these guys do have you seen the man enough to vote for her campaign no no it's with like hipster dudes with tattoos and beards that are gonna vote for Hillary No I hope it's fake cuz it's so brilliant I hope it's not real is it fake thank God is it thank god it's so good though cuz it's not that fake it's pretty good like you could almost see so wait a minute yes I mean this is not that for her right this is no no no it's not bad for it's just funny that someone would like make a joke political ad you know that you have to be man enough to vote for Hillary like there's guys out there that would buy that they would they would I'm gonna know bro they'd do it it's a scary time because it doesn't seem like anybody that you would want to be president wants to be President and so we're left with all right what do you pick it's like as if we're going to play the Super Bowl with three the shittiest teams we could find we're just gonna go get some drunk high school kids go get some inmates with club feet we're just gonna throw whoever it we're gonna may have the worst game ever and that's what this game is is not a good game this is not a game where you've got like a John F Kennedy versus a Lyndon Johnson or it's not it's not like like powerful characters its Trump I guess is a really powerful character but in more ways like a showman character yeah like what what he's doing he's like he's putting on a great show and he's gonna win probably because he's putting on such a great show and people like a great show I do think I'm now of among the people who think something new we're witnessing we're witnessing something new with Trump it's not just the same old thing where the process is so onerous that it's selecting for the kind of narcissist or you know thick-skinned person who is willing to submit to the process and then there are many most of the good people just will aren't going to put up with this I mean yes there's that too but there's um there's something there's him it's a moment among the electorate where it's like it's a funnel it's an anti aesthetic there's an ant is enough of an anti-establishment mood and and vote now is it happening with with Sanders to where people just want to jam a stick in the wheel of the system just to see what happens just like we this is what the main gripe against Hillary really is that she's politics as usual she's not going to change the system right right people want to change the system but they're not really thinking about the implications of radically changing the system and in the case of Trump I mean here is someone who is who is advertising his lack of qualifications for the office in every way that he can it's like he like there is no I mean I'm not even but I'm not even bothered by his racism or his misogyny or his demagoguery or his bully I mean all of that I'm willing to to guess is an act right that he's decided that that's somehow pandering to his base and he's actually in truth he doesn't have a racist bone in his body say I'm willing to it to believe that I matter I don't know why I would think that's plausible but it's it's it's a you know I have a hunch that he's far more liberal than he seems and it's just pandering but the thing that that can't be true is there's no way he's actually brilliant and well-informed about all the issues and is saying the things he's saying he's not pretending to be as uninformed and is incoherent and as irresponsible as he's seeming because you wouldn't withhold information it did make you a better leader well it's just it's yeah it's just it was just the vacuous nosov is speech it's like he's he'll say that he'll say the same thing three times in a row and it was meaningless the first time right he'll say it's going to be amazing it's going to be very very amazing trust me it's going to be so amazing and he does this with everything if you look at the transcripts of his speeches and the fact that he can't he has never I mean so far as I've seen he has never once strung together a string of sentences that was even interesting right but he bit like he's knit he's never he just there's never a moment where I record or I say oh this guy is smarter and better informed than I realized that that moment never comes I keep expecting to see that happen and it's a little bit like mad is this image of like you imagine have an urn right where and you just you keep pulling things out of it and all you pull out of it is chunk right you pull you know chicken bones and broken marbles and gum and and it's it's still possible that you that if you root around in that urn long enough you're going to find the Hope Diamond I mean in each round that you pull something out that really has no logical implication for the next thing you might pull out of the urn but mines aren't like that when I see what this guy says he does not say anything that a well-informed intelligent person would say and it's just and ideas are connected right so you can't just you can't fake this stuff you can't say you can't fake being this this uninformed and you can't fake being really well-informed and he's just me just let me look at one policy that he wants the the in the rounding up of illegal aliens right around up 11 million illegal aliens now this this gets stated as yeah we're going to round them up and send them back to Mexico and what worries me is no one seems to care but that if you just look at the implications of doing this it is that this one policy claim alone is so impractical and unethical it's just what are we talking about here you're talking like you're your gardener your housekeeper the person who works at the car wash the person who picks the vegetables who that you buy in the market is going to get a knocking on the door in the middle of the night by the Gestapo and get sent back to the zoo the vast majority these people are law-abiding people are just working at jobs that that Americans by and large don't want to do and many of them have kids who are American citizens right so I'm absolutely someone's got kids under the age of 10 who are American citizens and what you guys send that person back to Mexico and you're going to do this by the hundreds of thousands and millions it's just that one point alone held in isolation from all of the other things he said the crazy things like climate change is a folks we've concocted by the Chinese to destroy our manufacturing base and you know the fact that he likes Putin I mean everything else he said right this one policy claim alone should be enough to disqualify a person's candidacy it's so crazy but the moment you you look at it and yet no one seems to care in fact it's just it's just more energizing to the people who already like him I know that he said that he wanted to build a wall but I didn't know that somebody wanted to get rid of the illegal aliens rounded up and around him up and do want with him I'll send them back to their goal is so crazy that's such a crazy idea and it's so brutal the idea that I mean it's like it's a subhuman thing the only reason why people would come to America is because they felt they felt like it would make their life better so people take a big risk it's not there's not an easy way to do it if you're poor you don't have any qualifications for any unusual job I mean you're trying to get across to Mexico but everybody who does it does it because they want to improve their life you know and the idea that one group of people shouldn't be able to do it one group should just because they were born on the right side of some strange line that is only a couple hundred years old but but I actually now go further in meeting him in the middle where is it so it so I think we should be able to defend our borders right so it is I don't have a good argument for having a porous border that we can't figure out how to defend and we don't know who's coming into the country right so I think building the wall is almost certainly a stupid idea among his many stupid ideas but it I think it would be great to know who's coming in the country and have a a purely legal process by which that happened I mean ultimately that's got to be the goal right right and we are we're imperfectly doing that and so I don't have an argument for open borders or porous borders but if the question is what do you do with 11 or 12 million people who are already here doing jobs we want them to do that help our society and the vast majority of them are law-abiding people who as you say are just trying to have better lives the idea that you're going to break up families and send people back by the Mille and the idea that you're going to devote your law enforcement resources to doing this when you have real terrorism and real crime to to deal with it's just pure insanity right and and and also totally unethical and yet he doesn't get any points docked for this aspiration and it it's just it's one of the things around which people are rallying but the climate change thing is also insane and dangerous well here's a birther right yeah right he was one of the original birthers he was saying that Obama's birth certificate was bullshit he was born in Kenya right wasn't he one of those guys oh yeah he was he was some I would like funding that for a while yeah I would love if he got in the office and just said listen folks I am nothing like this person I pretended to be to win the presidency I just wanted to show you that you've been manipulated and get it together and he just punked all so I'm gonna hire some people who actually know how to run things and we'll see that's the the the smart people who are voting for him think and this is I think it actually a crazy position but that they think that he is just pandering to the idiots who he needs to pander to to get into office so he's he's not disavowing the white supremacist votes you know with the the alacrity that you would if you were a decent human being and you found out that David dukes who supported you because he needs to he just he needs those votes and he knows that that most of the people in his base aren't going to care and he can just kind of move on in the in the news cycle and he's doing this on all these issues where he look we're smart people see that he looks like a buffoon and they are treating him as a the people who don't like him are treating him is a comic figure who he can't really believe that stuff he's not really he's too sophisticated to really believe that stuff so he's just pandering I mean one is it people aren't seen if that's true just how unethical and weird that is right who the guy has no compunction about lying and demonizing people cycle let's say he let's say he thinks that that Clinton really isn't guilty but Bill Clinton isn't really guilty of a rape right and now he's calling him a rapist right now at the time he was saying he wasn't a rapist and he's just being defamed and this is outrage as he was saying he was taking the side of a friend who you know he invited to his wedding but now he's he's calling him a rapist right a sexual predator who's harmed women's rights more than anyone so which is true right so there's there's no version of the truth here that makes Trump look at all acceptable as a person is like either he knew he was a rapist and was defending him because he was just cozying up to power at that point right didn't care that he's a rapist or now he he knows he still is still the guy who thinks he wasn't a rapist but now he's just for purely opportunistic reasons he's he's willing to call a guy rapists who he knows isn't they're both horrible right and it's not like this new evidence has come forward in the intervening years that it would have changed his mind about what happened in Clinton's presidency so he's some but I think people think that he's got to be much more sophisticated than he is and that if he got into office he would just be a totally sober and presidential person there's no reason to believe that I mean if he thinks climate change is a hoax and that we should pull out of the Paris Accords and we should ramp up coal production and bring back the coal jobs and this is what he's saying right there's no reason to think he doesn't believe this at this point that's just it you know it is a disastrous thing for a president to think the only fascinating versions of this that I've been hearing from people that I respect are that the idea that he is like the political version of the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs like he's going to come down and smash it and it's going to be so chaotic that they're going to be forced to reform the system and people are going to respond in turn like the way people are responding against factory farming and more people are going vegan that kind of a thing they're going to see it and they can respond in turn that is such a so so he's going to toss the applecart up in the air he's just going to fuck this whole goofy system up and then we'll be able to rebuild after Trump has dismantled all the all the different special interest groups and lobbyists and all the people that we really would like to get out of the system we really don't like the the fact that there's such insane amounts of influence that big corporations and lobbyists have had on the weight loss get past the myth this might be the way to do it you have some wild man you everyone's fired you have fired you're fired Jetson it's like a character like he's coming in his hairs plastic he's all fired up he's a billionaire and made all his own money sort of dad gave some money but he turned into a lot of money point being he doesn't need anybody's money truth is he's probably lying about the amount of money he has to it is his but he's a baller for sure though right at the very least he's got to be worth some cash yeah I'm a there could be a big difference between what he's claiming when we got back true but he's he's a minute there are many pieces here I mean people assume that because he's a successful businessman he must understand the economy right which was no necessary connection there right there's a lot of rich people who are totally confused about economics and you know most economists don't have a lot of money so there's not even no real connection there but the the I mean so what you're describing is a kind of just random like like you're just let's just let's just smash the window yeah and then see what happens right look I'm going to light a fire to this this place and and see what happens and that's it almost any process by which you would change the system is more intelligent than that mm-hmm you know and yeah and it's also not valuing how much harm it one bad president could do right like there's no I think even I haven't tested this but I'm imagining that even Trump supporters would answer this question the way I would hope which is like if I had a crystal ball they could tell you we can't tell you who's going to be President but it tells you how it works out for the next president so like right I look in this crystal ball and it says the next president United States is a disaster right just it's like the worst president we've ever had you just think of you know just just failures of governance and and the toxic influence of narcissism and hubris that comes along just like once every thousand years right justjust a disaster I think you know even if you're a trump supporter which candidate that was like only Trump is is likely to screw things up that badly it's not Clinton is going to is going to be almost perfectly predictable she's going to be a politician she's gonna she's going to be basically centrist on a lot of the on foreign policy and domestic policy you know she's going to be liberal on social issues she is not going to try to be a dismantle NATO and to get into a war with North Korea or you know get into an alliance with Putin or image she's not going to do something insane and the alliance with Putin yeah he he said basically only favorable things about Putin their homes yeah they're tight so we should get yet hopefully we'll see pictures with both of them on horseback shirtless and I have to go read the I'll be able to you shirt on I hope probably keep your shirt on I don't see him as being the shirtless guy yeah no I yeah when when just look at the landscape the between Bernie and Hillary in him and you know to me it looks like the last gasps of a dying system sorry but that's representative government system but it is a lot of a lot of people are saying that you things like that but they're not hearing just how nihilistic that is if true right right like like we there's so much stuff we have to get right right and there's so much and and the only tool to get it right is having your your mind actually understand what's going on in the world and how to manipulate the world in the direction you want it to go so you have to understand like whether or not climate change is true your beliefs about it have to be representative of that truth right so like let's say you know let's say it's let's say I'm mistaken and there's you know there is no human caused climate change it's not a problem and every moment spent thinking about it worrying about it correcting for it is just a waste of time that's just throwing out you know the wealth of the world right that would be a terrible thing right so it really matters who's right about that and and the fact that we have a president or a candidate who is coming in saying this is all bullshit you know in defiance of all of the science is and it's it's true but it's on every other part of a problem doesn't know anything about you know I guarantee you he doesn't know the difference between Sunni and Shia Islam or which countries are Sunni predominantly in which or Shia prominently and I'm sure he's going to do I don't know when he's going to cram for this final exam I'm sure before one of those debates he's going to get you know someone's gonna sit down with him and give him some bullet points he's got to have in his head but his head is just not in this game it's never been in this game it's obvious from everything he says and that's what that is something you can't say about Clinton right for all of her flaws as a person I don't care how much you hate her as a person she understands what's going on in the world right and that's that difference is so enormous forget about all the the other character flaws of this guy who who was just obviously going to I mean he's but are we attached too much to this idea of one person being the figurehead figurehead someone has to eat right I'm one decider if we all woke up today if everybody woke up and there was just no government it was nothing well I'll just what happened I don't know but we got to figure out how to run this thing well we had no no previous understanding of government what do you think anybody would say we need one dude to just run this whole giant continent filled with 300 million people most likely if we woke up and we had technology like we have today we ability to communicate like we have today with social media and whatever we would probably say we need to like figure this out amongst each other and find the people that are the most qualified for each one of these positions and start running our government that way well that that's what we're attempting to do but it's just and I totally agree with you that it is astonishing that out of a nation of 300 million people these are the choices yeah you would think you would think we starting from your your base at your zero setpoint of just you know now we're going to reboot civilization you would think that if you had this kind of process each candidate would be more impressive than the next me what you'd be like I can't believe I eat each person who came to the podium likely so so on James oh yeah it'd be light you'd be like the dunk contest you know for the NBA I'd be like oh my god like it's just just when you thought you saw the best dunk in your life the next guy comes along exactly and it would be that it would be that on every topic right would be like you'd be talking about the science of climate change you'd be talking about the the the actual dynamics of the war on terror - it's a topics that that seem had to have no relationship where you would have to be you'd be amazed that anyone could be an expert in all of them you would find someone who was an expert a functional expert in all of them a jeopardy winner dude yeah yeah but so and but someone who is also ethically wise who doesn't just wasn't obviously an asshole right um and who who had a mature relationship to changing his or her mind right so like that this whole bit about flip-flopping and and not you know being caught it like this is someone who could honestly represent changes of mind in you know across a political career right this is there's no it's nowhere written that it's a good thing to believe today what you believe twenty years ago in fact they do that on every topic it means basically you haven't been in dialogue with the world but there's something it's so taboo to change your mind that either you have to lie about it or you have to pretend it was a you is always that way or it's just a an assistant yeah the the the the system is is broken in that respect but given the choices you know and when you have a choice between someone who is for all her flaws been in the game for long enough to be really well informed and capable of compromise and capable of not just just breaking the entire machine and you have someone who's just he just got stepped off the set of his reality TV show and then lied about everything and a an elbowed his way you know onto your television set and never left because you know CNN couldn't figure out how to give the mic to someone else it's it's amazing well he's a product of attention because they realized that there's a the heated race right the heated race this guy was really famous and in a heated race this guy would say some crazy stuff and so they would tune in to him so everybody had to tune in to him so because of him saying crazy stuff he accelerated the amount they were talking about him so they're constantly talking about him and barely talking about other people and but he's created a wormhole in our political process now where there's nothing so crazy that could disqualify him among the people who like him that so he can just keep like nuclear bombs of craziness that the press can't ignore that the every time they think okay this is the crazy thing he said that's going to harm his candidacy so let's shine a light on it it just helps him you know he could just he could you know he could need to get on Twitter right now so you know who I'd like to fuck I'd like to fuck Nicki Minaj and and it would work for him it would hurt for me you would see a you would see a tweet storm of a billion people who say I'd like to fuck Nicki Minaj to go get her and it's insanity that's where we are but in a sense if we do admit this is a fucked up system it's not ideal it should definitely be reworked and it's so hard to rework wasn't the best way to rework it a Trump asteroid just slams right into the White House boom blows the whole thing sky-high who knows what terrible things have to happen but maybe that would be enough thing is we have those those asteroids are coming anyway so when you look at like 9/11 was an asteroid right so it's like a or a superbug that that becomes a pandemic that these are things that are coming and we need people who are in touch with with reality to deal with them right so it's like what the moment someone it advertises their not only their ignorance but the fact that they don't care that they're ignorant and they do that this again and again they keep doubling down that person is like if you put that person at the helm what you have done is basically put chaos at the helm right it's like like this person's going to believe whatever he believes regardless of the information coming in and regardless of the consequences that's just I mean it's it's it's worse than having no one in charge and because you're you've put the power in this person's hands right so this but this person is everything has to go through this node in the network this is just like an information scrambling device right so like know-how Matt no matter how good the information is coming in you have everything that you've got a bottleneck here which just screws up the signal right that's what you're doing if you're if you're if you're hiring someone like this who I mean yet in the best case you're what you stated earlier would in fact be true which I he'll get into the Oval Office and even he will be scared about of the prospect that he's now running a better part of human civilization and he will hire the best people or some semblance of the best people he can get access to and say tell me how to not screw this up and and that will be and then it'll then it'll essentially be business as usual right you so far as you've hired that the best people will be people people who are are deeply in this game already right you know it will defer to the generals when it comes time to make war being real really pragmatic about how they pick politicians and how they push certain people and decide not to push others do you think that something like Trump completely changes how they move forward now they realize that this can happen like now that you see that people are so goofy we're so WWE doubt that you can get this guy you know I mean this is this is where we're at where we've got a guys I told him the wall just got 10 foot higher yeah everybody gets crazy like how could you say that yeah once they realize that that's possible how long before you get like some motivational speaker type dudes how long before they start jumping in there how it Tony Robbins Ted president so we that's what we have I mean that's this is well this is way worse than Tony Robbins for president Weiwei was all positive dude yeah yeah but I vote for him yeah no Tony right positive god no that's not what I mean I mean right but that sort of ability to excite people right like if we could get like one of those motivational speaker dudes like most guys who wears a lot of yoga pants and he's gonna he's gonna be the next president he's gonna get us in shape it's gonna be a reality show America is a reality show we're there we're awesome we're the best did you see this press conference he held I think was yesterday no I didn't know that was a very funny moment where the prayer there was one journalist I didn't recognize who it was who gets hooked so so Trump was being very combative with the the press pool and he was he was basically you know shouting them down not answering any of the questions and one journalist just a gas said is this what it's going to be like when you're president is this how is this how what it's going to be like to be in the White House press corps and deal with you and and he said yes this is what this is exactly was going to be like and but you could just see that like the journalists like they turn the camera on the room a journalist and they like they are astonished by what is happening here like they don't know they're participating in this process and in some sense they have created this process but is this no not all of you just many of your fine enough of us is this what you do is it is this what its gonna be like covering you if you're president yeah it is let me do you have this kind about the teachers restroom okay yeah it is gonna be like this David if the press writes false stories like they did with this because you know proud half of you are amazed that I raised all of this money if the press writes for starters like they did where I wanted to keep a low profile I didn't want the credit for raising all this money for the vets I wasn't looking for the credit and by the way more money is coming in I wasn't looking for the credit but I had no choice but to do this because the press was saying I didn't raise any money for them not only did I raise it much of it was given a long time ago and there is a vetting process and I think you understand that but when I raised almost 6 million dollars and probably in the end will raise more than 6 because more is going to come in and is coming in but when I raise 5.6 million as of today more is coming in and I and this is going to phenomenal groups and I have many of these people vetting the people that are getting the money and would you play at the moment I was referring to I mean so here is a case where he's probably almost certainly lying about his history of giving to Veterans Affairs and he gave money very recently after people started fishing around to see if he actually had given the money that he claimed to have given to to veterans but I mean this is the what's difficult about this is that I mean the pret yes there are the press is highly imperfect and there and also partisan and there are false stories and there are you know exaggerations and that they screw people over yes and there are reasons to not trust the press from time to time but I mean the in this case you have a someone who there is no amount of fact-checking and dis confirmation of his statements that that forces him to ever acknowledge anything that he's done wrong and the lack of knowledge meant - he pays no price for it among among the people who like him and so the press is powerless and then and then but the net result of like a press conference like this if you were a Trump's follower is he just showed how biased and and petty the press pool is and the press do need to just be beaten up by a strong man who who's not going to stand for their bullshit but it's a it's a maybe what it son becoming at the very least that kind of communication it's kind of unexpected at sprit II mild you know that's why me compared to his League his paradeen of the of the disabled reporter who he saw that bit where he you know did like a cerebral palsy imitation at one of his speeches he was - yeah oh yeah yeah he was interviewed by I don't happen to know who them and it was a reporter was oh he was making he was making fun of somebody with cerebral palsy I mean sir he's done so many things that you could that you would think would be fundamentally cancelling of a person's political aspirations like like you can't you caught Marco Rubio pretending to be like a just goofy on someone cerebral palsy at at one of his campaign events Oh be the end right yeah one of the things that some Ted Cruz was just that video with him with his family the outtakes well they were I did it oh you didn't see it no it's a gem uh-huh it's spectacular it's him with his mom and he's like my mom prays for me often for hours every day and she like right she looks I'm like what the fuck you talking about for hours every day no i don'ti can't even say that and so they have all these really awkward moments like okay I'm gonna go in for a hug I'm gonna say I love you it's all like weirdly mapped out and that got online and people were like oh Christ okay I see that this is this is a bad game like you're not even good at this game this is you're terrible at this game yeah he was objectively terrible well that's his that's Trump's competition well the thing that would think about Cruz that never even got out which was the reason to be scared about a Cruz presidency was his level of religious craziness I mean no one was even pushing on that because it was just enough to push on before he even got to that door yeah you have to hold on to those weapons yeah but I mean had it been a crew had crews been the nominee it would have been all about religion what's what's odd is that that's not a handicap in 2016 that you can have that and people consider it an asset well the one thing that's surprising and actually hopeful in Trump's candidacy is the fact that he has he has dissected out the religious social conservative component of the Republican Party so like the the evangelicals for the most part we're going for Trump over Cruz when it was pretty clear to them that Trump was just pretending to be religious and I mean so it's a Trump gave one speech at you know I think Liberty University where he spoke he said you know Corinthians 2 and you know that's not the way any Bible reader would would speak about the second Corinthians how would you say 2nd Corinthians that's what how you would say yeah yeah and so he said he said Corinthians 2 is like MO as though this is something he just opened every every night before he went to sleep and so it's clear that it was clear to them that he's not that he is just just miming the language you know or impersonating a person of faith and but they don't care really as long as he does it and that's that is you know if you're gonna look for a silver lining to this it it shows that it's not it's is they just want a space where their religious convictions are not under attack and they don't really care that the person in charge share them just you just if you pretend to share them that's good enough and that's that's better than actually caring that this person really believe in the rapture or anything else that is quite obviously crazy but yet so I don't think any Christian who's voting for Trump thinks I mean they'll say I'm not going to judge another man's faith right or I'm who am I to say what's really in his heart right they'll say that but he's just given a the if you if you've been paying attention to who he's been and and if you just look at how he talks about these things I don't he's fooling any any Christian that it so I think they're willing to vote for someone for now for other reasons that are fairly depressing in their own right they're willing to to vote for someone who's who doesn't really play the game the way they do you have to believe in God to be president in 2016 right when you wouldn't you say that has to pretend to believe in God yeah but I think with Trump I think it I think his the pretense is is obvious enough that I don't think he's fooling the better part of the people who were voting for him who would say they care about a person of faith being in the White House so anything he might be in one thing he might be breaking is the barrier on having an atheist president because I think he you know it's just no but nobody thinks he is a person of faith I don't think anyone really thinks that so so he's he's me might be our first atheist president he would help us in that in that regard as well another Trump meteor right into the White House yeah I'm starting to sound like a trump supporter occasionally an asteroid does something good who would be the ideal president I mean like what what kind of a person who I mean it would probably a person who doesn't seek attention probably a person that well I don't they it could be that I mean the PERT that the process is even even an optimized process will be well we're cool it will require enough sacrifice of what ordinary people want most of the time that it will be an unusual personality who has to get promoted you will be on some metric B I mean it's almost by definition narcissistic to think that you should be in this role right right who are you to think that you should be running the civilization at this moment in human history and to for you to be on it's for you to honestly stand at the podium and say I'm the guy you know or the woman I am the most qualified I should be doing this right I can help you know if you if you're going to scrutinize the kind of personality that could give rise to those opinions it's not yeah there's there are some dials you would probably want to change tweak if you if you had to be married to this person or if it's not an optimal personality so there's going to be there's a kind of pathology of a power seeking that might be just intrinsic to it but you want someone who is actually wise ethically I mean just just just try to map that onto Trump right just he's imagine someone saying thing I like about Trump is that he is so deeply ethical and wise right it's just it does not I mean it's like saying it's because his hair looks so natural yeah is I mean there's just no it is the antithesis of what he is right the thing I like about Trump is that he is so well informed about the way the world works and where he's not informed he recognizes his ignorance so quickly and he remedies it as fast as possible he did you know he seeks out the best experts defers to them and you know he's just he's as mindful of the limits of his knowledge SEO as he is about his expertise and his expertise is vast right you'd want to be able to say that about a president you could not begin to say that about Trump right you could probably say that honestly you could probably say that about Clinton right like Italy yeah for all her defects she's very knowledgeable and I'm sure she will just try it where she'd up where she doesn't feel like she's got the knowledge he's going to try to go to go to the source of the knowledge right just grab the best expert she can find I think she I think she will be as aware as you or I would be of the consequences of not knowing what's going on right she's just going to want to find out what's going on whereas this I mean all Trump has advertised about himself is that he thinks that bluster and banality and bullying will win in every situation just like it's just attitude he the guy is the guy is winging it and it could not be more obvious that I that this guy is winging it on every level and it's like it's just it is it is it's not there'd be no way for him to signal the fact that he's winging it more clearly than he is what everything he's doing and and yet there's no penalty do you think it's possible that in this age of information the way we can communicate with each other that we're going to experience these cycles these waves these in and outs these high and low tides of really smart presidents and a really stupid president and we just people revolt and there's just it's so easy to stay alive is plenteous to people out there and so they're only willing to vote for other dumb folks so the other dumb folks get into position they send out the frequency that only the dummies here and everybody else is going what the fuck is everybody voting for this guy for what is happening and then it makes the smart people rebound and four years and challenge themselves anew because they they need some sort of an enemy to rally against to reach their full potential and then without the low tide you cannot have the high it's a virus that's hopefully that's not an analogy that applies the maintenance of civilizations the smell yeah yeah I know the time man maybe well at the very least it's a wake-up call for the political establishment this silly game you've been running of two candidates just doesn't work someone can co-opt your candidacy get in there throw the fucking monkey wrench into the gear system and guess what Trump's running for president now is that he's the head I mean he's the head guy for the Republicans how is that even possible they don't know it what's amazing it is a way if nothing else a total wake-up call for the Republicans may are just it's June a cast yeah it's June everything's decided locked down so we have July August September October November we're that close but if he's not someone who has been who's aligned with the Republican platform in most ways right so it's like he's been the truth is virtually no one knows what what his policies are because he keeps changing his position on things like taxation it's like if there actually is no he said he's talked on both sides of a core issue core Republican issues but I mean in many ways he's left of Hillary right he's you know he's left of Hillary in terms of being an isolationist like he's you know he means his his relationship to war is but both extremes like he's like no we're just kind of we're going to get out of the world's business right we're going to be isolationist which is deeply anti-republican but I'm going to be the maniac who you're never going to know who I'm going to bomb next right when we're going to wipe out Isis we're just straight away right did not not a man left standing and I'm not going to take any shit from anyone including China and North Korea and so he's that but we're gonna pull back in a huge way and not be in anyone's business right he said both of those things it's it's it was way too interested in a way it may we don't want politics to be this interesting and it's going to be me November is going to be if the polls are closed and watching those debates and and and waiting for a swing in the polls as a result it's just going to be it's going to be way too interesting it's gonna be like watching the Super Bowl those first debates you know it's going to be it'll be a hundred million people watching those debates I have a prediction I think I think it's entirely possible this whole thing was a plot that didn't work out this I think he probably came out of the gate saying crazy shit thinking he would tank the Republican Party and get his friend Hillary Clinton into the White House no just didn't well she didn't work out he kept trying to insult her kept trying to make stuff up about Mexicans it just kept making him get better and better and now he's stuck he can't pull out hey that that would be that would be a great moment that would change the system well we're going to have to go through something like this in order for us to realize that this is crazy that a guy can just do this can just not really have any interest in politics until hold out then he should get the Nobel Prize for everything if he pulls out at this point and says listen I'm just took you to the precipice here just because I want you to recognize how unstable this situation is you you guys could elect a demagogue who is actually an incoherent demagogue and I haven't even been playing an incoherent authoritarian right I'm I'm on one hand a very liberal right and tolerant and on the other hand I'm like getting ready to be Hitler and you guys can't figure out who I am and yet you're still prepared to vote for me right I mean yeah for him to do a post-mortem on on his punking of the culture that would be the best thing to ever happen but I don't think that's that's what's happened do we need someone like this so that we realize how silly this whole thing is do we need someone like that no we need a qualified person to deal with all of the other hassles and dangers that are coming our way that have nothing to do with with what we do right like what that verse is not that even even if we were doing everything perfectly there would still be the tsunami of risk right and hassle and waste and just omit all the rest of the world's chaos that is coming our way and it's just even if we had our house in order in every respect we still have terrorism and the you know global climate change will you have that you've got China and India and what are they doing in terms of complying with with climate goals you have all the things we've been talking about you know the the virtual certainty that there's going to be a pandemic at the not what I'm talking about bioterrorism we're talking about just the sheer fact that in 1918 there was a killer flu and there's going to be another killer flu right there's just no way there's not gonna be another killer flu and we need we need people and we need people people to smart people to change to optimize the system to deal with these kinds of things and if we're promoting you know religious maniacs and and crazy narcissists and liars and ignoramus and only that those people how could this end we'll this is just a weird year for like heavyweight boxing you know they have those weird years for heavyweight boxing when Tony Allen is a champ and and then are you where you could be the heavyweight champion they went through a period of time in like the early 80s for Tyson came around was a series of like these champs that were like you know sort of like journeyman fighters and then Tyson came along maybe that's what it only only with heavyweights right yeah mostly with heavyweights yeah the lighter weights they were always badass but I think that maybe that's what's going on maybe we need to have this bad season get the season out of our way realize the danger of having an inept person in office whether it's a liar or dude who hates money or or Trump whoever it is just go through it and realize how silly it is that we have it set up this way still
