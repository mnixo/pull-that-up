three two what Cameron Haines ladies and gentlemen hey what's up nice shirt buddy that's a ridiculous shirt that's you and me in Utah and it says must be nice yeah cuz yeah you know everybody says they look at somebody and they'll be like man must be nice to whatever to be able to have that or yeah yeah able to go there yeah yeah so it's like you know we obviously have a great alkyne I see a couple of comments and it's like people saying must be nice which it is it's amazing but yeah I think you read too many comments so I'm saying I think you reason ask you what do you think I really said that I think you did you never catch me reading them the deer you mentioned comments before - I catch them if if they're in the top and I'm gonna comment the other day and it said I always know that was because my wife sent it to me it was hilarious oh yeah that was after the video of you and I were celebrating and there you go I love this man I'm like I love this man yeah and someone said I always wondered what it looked look like if Cameron Haynes and Joe Rogan had a baby and we almost found out that was a good one every once a while you get a gym yeah the internet is filled with funny fucking people men like there's a lot of Larry frustrated comedians out there there is that get express themselves occasionally in comments yeah because isn't in like I sometimes answer because I feel like I'm let off the hook a little bit cuz it's not like I'm making a post calling somebody a dipshit but I can say in a comment and it kind of sneaks through but why do you want to or just be funny yes you're so busy that's what I don't understand how do you have the time the full time job I mean it's normal that you run a marathon in a day so how the fuck do you have the time to be commenting I don't know well well like waiting out here right now on the plane I don't know times of boredom I guess yeah yeah it's all good a man I know a lot of people that read their comments you know and smart P Eric Weinstein was making an argument that you probably should read some of them that there's like and you know he's a genius he was saying you don't want to cut off completely from from feedback so you have to find that sweet spot between reading some and yeah I mean like I feel like other people read them I'll get them though they'll come to me yeah yeah now the good ones people share with you yeah or yeah but I know some people who go crazy they read their comments and then they become obsessed and they read them all day long and then they go and they have these little Twitter wars people back and forth yeah and they they just argue all the time yeah they're sometimes or I mean like I posted a couple times yesterday and I don't think I don't think I read any till maybe this morning you know or just so I was like I don't post and then just like totally check him yeah every second you know refresh refresh but but every now and then is something nice like I saw this dude that we were talking about in the last podcast I reached out to him he lost how much weight did that guy lose Jamie 227 teen and 190 side I sent him a DM I'm like I'm saying this guy yeah that's fucking amazing it is it's amazing you do see people because you know like when you reach okay you're you're gonna reach millions of people there's gonna be a few dip shits but there's also going to be a few like that or it's just like oh my god this is I mean how impactful is that that's like it affects your life ya know yeah because it's so positive well one of the things that you do online I think it's super important is you provide inspiration you know we were talking yesterday when I have to code a Meyer on we were talking about Goggins and Jocko and you do the same thing it's like you provide something where people they could see you working hard and see you smiling and and getting after it and it makes people want to do things and when they know that you're doing these hundred mile races and all this crazy shit that you do they it gives them like that's just enough of a push to get off the couch yeah and get going and sometimes that's all someone needs to change their whole life you need a day a good day a good day where you get moving and you get your legs pumping and you you know you get huffing and puffing and you get your heart rate up and you sweat and then afterwards you feel great and you go okay tomorrow I'm gonna do it again yeah and the next thing you know you got fifteen days in a row and the next thing you know you're down ten pounds that's right next thing you know you're cutting off boos and you're eating good and now you're you're joining a gym and you're starting to do chin-ups and shit and you're getting in shape and you look way better and you feel better you make better choices your life move smoother it's yeah I mean it's it builds that momentum and it you know the journey of a thousand miles begins with one step and that one step is one day or maybe the first first step on your first run but you know I see that all the time too because I genuinely enjoy working hard and so I am smiling and and it's like people say okay enough enough I mean I've been watching you for whatever I'm gonna do it yeah and so it's like I don't know if you beat them into submission finally but whatever the case is whatever reach for whatever reason people get out there they do and then it starts that journey like like you said towards a different life essentially I joke around about it on stage about accidentally influencing dudes and I apologize to the girlfriends but there is a certain amount of responsibility that you have to assume when that starts happening when you do have a positive impact on people you realize like hey you know this this show having people like you and Jocko and Andy stump and all kinds of interesting fascinating people on directly influences people's lives for the better and changes the way they view things for the better gives them a positive outlook and it also gives them an opportunity to hear from people the way people think that maybe they would never get to meet these people in real life right they would never get to know these people but they feel like they know you have them or who you know that's the one thing I love about Jocko too is you know just the shot of his watch every day I mean you know he's up at 4:30 and he's getting it done you know no excuses no none yeah and he's done and that's I think that accountability is probably accountability for him but also it's like the people know okay hey this is what we need to expect of ourselves yeah someone a guy said I don't like following Jocko cos all it does is take pictures of his watch I'm like you're missing the point and yeah that's a new picture yeah it's a new picture every guy day of a new day with his fucking watch getting up and getting after it then afterwards a puddle of sweat in the ground yeah he's doing it every day yeah yeah and that's impressed for you it's a it's like and that was I'd never met him until our our elk on Utah and man people ask hey so how was Jocko and I'm like exactly like what I mean how what he says and how he portrays himself that's how are you that's how he is and he's like you know they had that day they were expecting a long day of blood trailing or just covering miles in the mountains and he's like he couldn't wait yeah I was looking forward to it couldn't wait three plates of meat loaf he did he carved load I mean he's like hey I'm gonna need these but ya big ol their own plates of food but he said and I remember this specifically he said what sucks is when it doesn't suck mmm he wants the challenge yeah if something without a challenge is like what's the point yeah he's turned his mind into this like challenge seeking missile yeah yeah yeah well that's why I love the fact that he you know at 45 years of age or 46 whatever is decided to get into bow hunting hardcore and a year in he's taking on his crazy elk hunt I know in Utah I mean it's awesome I was amazed it's awesome I love when people are not scared to take on new challenges you know like something that's completely outside the wheelhouse like when he started shooting and he got together with Dudley and Dudley started giving him some instruction I got pumped because I knew I'm like this guy's gonna dive into this headfirst right you know yeah it's that discipline I think guys like you and him it's it's just easy transition cuz you've had that like and I always say this bow honey's done this for me it gave me discipline or structure when I didn't have any you know I think you know jiu-jitsu did that for you too at that or it wasn't jiu-jitsu then Taekwondo started boxing a lot of different martial arts but yeah so it's a saint it's different but it's the same type of discipline for young I mean I guess it was young for us but it's a it's a transition to people who to have that mindset and they like know that I'm gonna have to punch this time clock every day for a while before I get to a high level yeah and it's just like that a certain type of personality or people don't they don't shy away from that they like or gret they gravitate towards it well it's also being able to pull it together in the moment which to me I've always sought challenges where the like it requires you to maintain your mental state mhmmm like whether it's stand-up comedy or fighting and to me archery might be the ultimate bow hunting is the ultimate because in these moments where like that bowl is going to be in between those two trees for five seconds I know and you got to draw back and make that shot these are crazy moments that you have to you have to have practiced you have to put in the time there's no substitution it's I don't think people who haven't done it realized how difficult it is and then I think people who've done it they definitely know how hard it is and that is one of the as you mentioned one of the hardest things to do but that's why that that's why that video of you and Utah 67 yards and it was just like we had been in on bulls like had opportunity with the moment the beginning in the morning it was a rock house it was right today but these opportunities were like right there or you could almost grab them and they would they were gone and it didn't happen and in that one just enough time but he's like you had to do it all you know that like the clock's ticking like it's not you don't know you don't have unlimited time that bull takes a step yeah it's over yep and for you to make that shot so perfect in crunch time that was such a beautiful thing he's like that's why it elicited the orgy type response well that's also why I said afterwards the practice is so important that's always thinking yeah that's what you said that's it you said practice something about practice and it's like that's what it goes down so that's the building block yeah and it's just those reps because you can't I guess you could get make a lucky shot but the chances of screwing that up are very high unless you got the reps yeah my thought process when I was making that shot was exactly the thought process that I go through when I'm practicing and that's why and when I executed and I saw that arrow hit exactly where I was aiming beautiful it was I was that's the first thought that came into my mind practice it's so important well and then I was impressed because you actually made notes to yourself oh yeah on your phone yeah so what tell me walk me through your your your procedure your process have I even added to it oh you did yeah because there's a certain way I like to grip the the release that I didn't put in yeah so back straight strong posture drawback elbow high light pressure on the nose Center the peep level the bubble now this is the new one that I added connect the fuck you finger to the thumb because is this finger yeah as to connect to the thermal release as I pull back yeah because I use that silver back release yeah I pull back with the index trigger pick a spot pull with the scapula and then the last one be the arrow right you know we're talking that what is that Warren so what does that mean Remmy Warren said well REM the whole thing no no the arrow like B I'm not not hoping yeah that it hits in that spot I'm aiming I'm good I want I'm concentrating 100% on that arrow going to that spot yeah Remmy Warren said that to me one time he goes he goes this sounds crazy but someone gave me this advice and it's like the best advice anybody ever gave me said be the arrow yeah he goes like I don't know what that means but like I am I don't know different things to different people yeah but to you it means yeah you're in you're so in the moment yes you're the arrow I'm a hundred percent foot when that arrows released I am a part of it as it's going towards that out right the arrow like don't just oh I hope it works like I got that from Joel Turner as well you know Joel Turner has that shot IQ website yeah and he goes over and he helped me a lot because he goes over the difference between a closed loop and an open loop process I always forget which one is which but one of them is automatic you know like like a ball comes at you swing a bat you can't stop in the process and the other one is you're in control of it every step the way and that's where a shot routine helps me because you think I'm thinking I'm making sure that all my things are checked off so there's no there's no chance I'm doing anything wacky right there's no chance you're spazzing out in the moment yeah and so that those two things and then what Remy said be the arrow like that sounds like to someone who's never shot an arrow that doesn't make any sense but when there's a thing that you do when you release an arrow where you're so focused your technique is on point everything's everything's lined up but you're so focused as you're releasing that you never break that focus right the only thing the only way I could break it was when I heard that our walk and I saw it hit right in the sweet spot I was like now I can relax yeah you know and I remember and I said this at that time but I remember your follow-through it was just like so I remember that arm coming back and is just I don't know it's you know and I think that's where a lot of people make mistakes is if you're new in it and there's so much pressure in the moment in that moment you've thought about it for so long that it's just like the pin goes on the animal and they punch the trigger yeah because they wanted they wanted they want to be there before they've went through the process yeah and so that's where people screw up and all that whole thing you making that a actual process each step but I think I don't know do you do it or is it subconscious you know do you think about all those steps I was thinking about all those steps while I was walking okay while I'm going through the woods I'm thinking about those I don't know shot I'm just kinda matica subconscious but that's why I said practice is so important yeah this is like I'd practiced it so many times that I just looked at that elk like it was a target yeah I knew what to do and just but it was only because of the wraps wraps right wraps wraps wraps that moment was so crazy because you know we had that bull I don't know if his that ball but as a big bowl but we were stuck over more to the left and we could see him up there he had these little smaller satellite bowls kind of in the way we were in the Sun which driving me crazy so he ended up having a circle all the way back around and get back up there had a line of spruce we could sneak up but uh it was you know those bulls the bull you shot went and fought with another bull for a brief time and we were switching back and forth which one is shoot cuz they're both big bulls and it's just like just to be able to slow that down and make such a perfect shot in a moment like that oh my god is so hard it was so awesome so that yeah it was so amazing but it's so hard oh this is the this is it yeah he just got done fighting with a bowl so he runs I can't see it in this film he runs up this Ridge right here and boom he's down right there I mean couple seconds late but this is everything that you hope for as a bow hunter yeah you know it was a mitt and I see a lot of people who haven't hunted they ant they're under the impression that maybe as soon as you the arrow hits the animal how come he didn't go down right what I mean because they just don't know so that bull was alive four seconds after that essentially he ran up probably went about a hundred yards he ran until there's no more air he's his broth of his lungs were gone right right sprinted he'd never knew what happened he probably thought he got jabbed by another bull or something yeah is no idea he was just fighting with that other yeah and they they have take tines to the shoulder and everything he had holes all the time riled up yeah but they you know a lot of times Bulls get shot with an arrow and they don't even realize it you know all of a sudden their blood pressure drops because they're because it's him urging and then they essentially pass out but then they die well the bull that I shot last year in California that's what happened to him he walked four yards yeah just walked four yards and tipped over boom and he dropped right there I mean it was the closest to shooting an animal where he died that I've never seen yes died immediately right in the heart yeah and I think it's a you know people may might be more familiar with rifle kills and maybe they think that they but even with a rifle they don't go right down and I think it's like a rifle is even can be you know they hear the sound a rifle will kill by shock instead of hemorrhage so it's you know shits getting blown apart I think a well-placed arrow is about as beautiful death as an animal's gonna get yeah I mean these aren't animals that are living in a controlled environment were they're gonna die of old age they're gonna get torn apart by animals and in fact John Dudley while he was there was 20 yards away from a mountain lion that was stalking the same bull he was right which is do you see that lion for the die put up yeah there's lions all over there although chances are it's gonna be death by a lion or and that usually will happen once they get weak because they can't fend off they get injured maybe they're too old to get the feed they need the winter and then their lion food and they also get jacked because they're there blowing out all their energy while they're in the rut yeah and they don't eat there just humping up a storm and then when it's over there's like oh Jesus yeah the winter comes oh I know some perfect storm heals yeah it's rough it's a rough life out there but that's why I say it's like death by a well-placed arrow is you know people say well people have the impression that these things aren't going to die ever or they're gonna live like we live or well they also don't understand that all the money that's spent on this elk hunt all of it goes to ensure the healthy populations of these animals yeah most of it most of it goes to wildlife preservation it goes to keeping the the habitat strong the numbers strong and this is what pays for what if people love animals you should love hunters because hunters pay for most of the wildlife conservation in this country yeah you know and that message is of course that's you know we've talked about that numerous times but that message is is getting out the the groomer today that I had she she was a groomer her dog Marshall goes to a group right yeah so similar but she does a hunt but she wants to hunt because she wants to be you know self-sufficient especially but she was talking about she does no but she knows that doesn't hunting pay for protection of the animals and you're not my you know explain what you just said and so it's people are figuring it out you know I mean we're getting the message out so that's good yeah I mean this there's so many different messages that you hear stats you know about meat consumption and food and like what's bad for the environment what's good for the environment is there's so many like small little sound bites that people like to rally off yeah and that's this is something that's this without a doubt it's the best way you could ever get your meat yeah there's nothing even close it's not even a close second no it's the best way these the animals by the time you get into in the rut they're already breeding never in the ones we're getting there's you know eight nine years old they've already had multiple breeding season yeah in their prime yeah their genes are passed on yeah and you're getting an animal that's just out there eating grass and living a wild life it's meat so good oh it's the best me never I had it last night it's very sensational it's so good I've been eating all week yeah yeah that's why I feel you know I got into hunting I don't know if me was up on the high on the list I was just a young kid just wanted to hunt I wanna get my buck hey you get your buck that's all I wanted to do is get my buck and then but now the meat is man it's it's as much as the antlers for sure yeah you know just getting that meat hundreds of pounds of meat bringing it home eating it fuels us for everything we do and it's like to me I mean at our age we're the same age now but not long ago our age was old we were dead yeah I don't I don't feel I feel better than I've ever felt and I'm just like if I was 25 I didn't feel as good as I feel right now and maybe that's wildgame me guarantee would have something to do with it I guarantee you and don't how I mean how do you feel feel fucking fantastic Beauty to out a heart run this morning right before my podcast yeah yeah man I think it's the most nutrient-dense food that you can ever get yeah I mean you just look at it when you looking at like a back strap from an elk it's like a dark red it looks like it's filled with nutrition it tastes so good like when you're eating it I feel like energy yeah you know I get it's it's hard to describe it yes it's just a way better meat it's just way better I was watching I took video of Colton pulling out the Tenderloin of your bone because people don't understand how you can get without getting it you can get the tenderloins out which are under the spine and that when he pulls that out it's just like I mean if I mean if a sound bite could it came in or something in dessert is like Beautiful's like there should have been doves flying around because that piece of meat looked so perfect and it's just like like you say when you eat it it's like I don't know it's like energy injection well they've done Studies on game meat versus domestic beef they've also done Studies on domestic beef that's raised on grain versus domestic beef that's raised on grass domestic beet that's raised on grain is probably like the least nutritious and then domestic beef that's raised on grass as far superior much healthier but then you go with wild game meat yeah I mean it's another hundred percent more nutritious it's way more protein like the difference between a piece of beef and a piece of book pull up the difference between like a 1 pound of beef versus 1 pound of elk I think it's more than double the amount of protein really yeah and then there's also our insane amounts of amino acids and and essential fatty acids like oh you're getting all the the grass-fed these this animals eating wild grasses yeah this this animals even the same diet would have eaten 4000 years ago yeah it's a I remember when I used to hunt elk in the ego cap wilderness I remember I used to think those elk were like high-octane like because they were so fast compared to the Bulls I hunted over on Western Oregon and I always thought that it was just that that feed must be I don't know just seemed like the elk were different and quicker and so I'm thinking well if I'm eating those bowls and those bowls are elite athletes for bowls it's like this can't I mean there's got to be a maze there's got to be a seam for me well it makes sense cuz the evil cap wilderness is like rich dense forests yeah right it's so greening up there yeah it's it's they call it the little Alps I mean that's it's rugged and it's it's steep its but there is good feet up there too for the animals yeah man those Bulls there they're studs amazing yeah they are yeah it's rough country though yeah it's rough country I mean that's where they live you know what's interesting is before people came around elk were like Prairie animals yeah they were right next to the mountains because of humans yeah and then wolves and all these other animals mm-hmm but when the Pioneers first came here there's Elks were just roaming the fields yeah which is kind of crazy yeah that is yeah but they wised up look we got to make it harder on these assholes they they got into the to the rocks for sure up in the mounds what do you got Jamie I don't know varying information that's about websites so yeah they're varying information anyway super good for you yeah it's bad for anything it's just no yeah well that's the thing about you know there's there's like not one standard website what's good for nutrition and figuring out what this stuff is but yeah I know you can you can pretty much have anything validated you want validation on the on the Internet well you know it's interesting I was listening to Rinella talk recently about this horrendous trip that they had in the backcountry because there were so many hunters during a muzzleloader and archery see this year yeah in Colorado yeah and I wonder like I wonder how much us talking about it all the time is affecting the numbers of people that actually go out and try it because you just stop and think about the the numbers of people listening to this podcast it's a bananas number yeah millions and millions of people well the feedback I see is like there's you know and they say because I just had this this talk with my buddy Wayne indica you know Wayne yeah I was out of his place shooting the other day and you know it says we've lost since 2016 too licensed hunters and I told him I said I don't know where we lost him from but bowhunting has got it because he owns the bow rack mm-hmm and bow bow hunting is skyrocketing because I see I'm you know I see the the following and people talking about like you mentioned and he said he was in Colorado to looking for elk and ran in like ten different guys back there yeah so yeah there is yeah I don't really I think people are looking at it more as like a pursuit like a difficult pursuit not just hunting none for me no it's different now yeah it's like it's yeah it's changed yeah I wonder if that's because of us talking about it it's had to have some sort of an imminent I think it's I think it's had an impact for sure and then I'm it so I'm trying to think I don't want to you know but then on the other hand so in the ego cap wilderness my buddy was back there and said he said you need to come back here and hunt again and I'm like yeah I know I you know the thing with with the wilderness is you I as a commercial that if you do a commercial activity you can't even share the photos because they won't give a permit for it I had to quit filming back there they made it illegal to film and release it as a commercial property well even me with my following now I couldn't even put up a photo from back there so as it would be commercial just commercially of sponsors yet in there they're making it seem like you're back there shooting a full-length feature film you know it's like they don't differentiate between your iphone shooting a movie or an iphone and so so like what we shot it in Utah you couldn't have done now wow that's not in the wilderness not in the National Forest yeah wilderness they won't allow filming permits hmm so but anyway he said I go I go man I said I've got so many good elk hunts on tap I said I'd you know he knows I love that country and he goes well he was just for for old times sake he goes because I'm looking up a 3/16 a340 bull screaming elk everywhere and not truck at the trailhead Wow so but it's a long way back it's rugged country so I think I mean there's still their spots yeah there's still spots that are gonna be hard to get to right yeah those are the spots that discourage people where you know that you're gonna have to hike in 12 miles and then you have to get the animal out so if you're hiking in and you're off horse you know it's a places that are off horse pack trails that don't get the attention because you have to if you kill a bull it's coming out on your back yeah that's a bunch of trips that's a lot of jobs if you're going 12 miles out or even if you have to pack it to a to a where horses can get it's a lot of work well Greentree when you shot his bull and when he was on that crazy 28 day hunt didn't it take him like seven days yeah by himself on that back yeah something like sound went up and helped him but still I mean tons of work but he had snow I think and he was like 9 or 10 miles in right something like that yeah so he's walking out nine or ten miles with a hundred plus pounds yeah on his back each trip it's a lot of work yeah it's amazing I mean you know how much work it is bring down a bowl because yeah because we've done it but then you go from there to okay now I gotta walk it out ten miles then you got to preserve the meat so you gotta hang it make sure it's getting cool and I mean that my friend Ryan Callahan shot a bull he got a tag in New Mexico and he wrote a whole article about it because he lost that oh I read that very disheartening yeah it was huge bull yeah that was I thought was a nice six point it was yeah he was uh yeah I mean it's real and I mean I think it's important to share those honest experiences but also it's like man you don't want people who don't get it to get the wrong impression yeah it's always the right right right with a wounded animal in particular right yeah I'm you see an animal get and he even mentioned that in the article he said he realizes about the nuts I don't know about the what people might think about down the stigma time just stigma yeah that's you know and he I mean I don't know it was I think he shoots with a stick bow to which is really weird he shoots with a longbow did he yeah he shot that bowl with that he shot his last bowl with a longbow I think that's what he hunts with you know yeah I think well yeah you know I get it people like doing that I get it but like come on man it's hard it's hard and people ask me about that oh pardon what are you gonna do that and I'm like God I I'm not that good as a compound bow so I don't really I'm not really ready to make it harder well our friend Aaron Schneider he's completely committed to a recurve it's all he shoots with I just saw him the other day like a post yesterday I think and he had a compound oh did he yeah maybe was given up on it no I don't think he's given up I was back and forth yeah maybe maybe was just practicing unless there's somebody else's Bob I don't know but he is a crazy video of him shooting a mountain goat with a compound yeah you see that no no with a recurve I was a recurve here yeah yeah he was on top of a cliff and shot down I know that was pretty sweet it was pretty sweet you know it's amazing video and I think he said he hurt his shoulder bike before he didn't know if he's gonna be able to shoot it with a bow oh really yeah because he had done something to his shoulder so I think I read it's like he was gonna have to get try to do half draw or so know as far back as he could get and he ended up hitting it through the heart what was that for shoulders that fucked up I guess so I don't know what happened that's the one thing that freaks me out about you how do you not get injured as much as you do like I just don't understand how you don't get injured kind of weirds me out weird you yeah yeah because as much as you lift weights as much as you're one I'm like waiting for you to get injured I'm always getting injured are you rooting for me to get injured ever so you're lever am I good no I'm like time crazy I'm stunned I'll make you you're made out of something different cuz you all the running that you do and all the weightlifting you do especially because you do high reps mm-hmm you don't always reps wraps wraps wraps wraps um like no tendonitis nothing nope everything's fine like what the fuck well part of it is I'm not gonna ever say on her so I mean I heard I mean I'm you know I'm not y'all sore but not injured yeah I don't say I'm injured but I it's not sore but I mean I remember the one time we had to go to the Vegas where I was going to get a stem-cell shot you have rydym agreed check out one of your feet yeah yeah your foot was kind of fucked up yeah I mean who do you have a stress fracture yeah and I get you know you can't you just can't do that and not get there's gonna be some repercussions to get on for to put on all the smiles but I just that's just part of the part of the deal so I just worked through it just you know I'm never gonna you know I mean even my wife today because it's like haven't been sleeping then I had that whole thing this morning with GQ and then this and she's and then out whatever she's like well how are you feeling I said I have no choice but to feel 100% I said so that's all I'm focusing on so that's how I do I mean I don't even if I'm down or don't feel good or haven't got sleep or I'm hobbled I'm only thinking about I'm a hundred percent I don't have to I can't I don't I can't afford to think about oh maybe I shouldn't do this or maybe I'm not gonna be as good as I could be a just don't even think about it that's ridicu don't get one of these whoops drops it'll tell you listen why what does that sleep oh yeah I'll tell you you need to recover I tell you I could not play I could not sleep last night because I was thinking about that whole thing today then trying I was thinking god what if that goes long and then traffic you know traffic in LA then I'm late getting over here so you got all these that's the least thing to worry about this is I know here I'm still thinking about it yeah so instead of keeps you up really yeah stupid shit like that's stupid yeah that's but that's firstworldproblems oh my god I have a GQ shoot today yeah what if what if it runs late and I can't do the podcast until 3:00 yeah I know could you imagine crazy I know see now you know what real struggle is the real struggle yeah yeah I don't have any real struggle anymore my my struggles are all fake God you have to manufacture yeah I make my own bullshit that struggles yeah workouts and and and training and all that shit yeah but like I always say because like so I could be a must be nice guy so who knows I'm still punched in time clock 9 to 5 yeah that's what's ridiculous so I'm like oh must be nice to be Joe Rogan it is nice attire it's like sweet but what I always like to tell people because I some I was argue notice why I was arguing with some somebody on somewhere but God where was it anyways about the alkyne like you oh yeah yeah I want to see you and Joe do a public land Elkind Joe's gotta earn his way or whatever I'm like I said I'm like trust me Joe's earned where he's at I mean what because because you have a different version of earn it in this one one small aspect of life hunting I said Joe's earned his whole everything he has so it's like all the way for so it's like people who say must be nice to be you holy shit you've been through the fire for years decades and you're reaping the rewards yeah but they don't see that I know that's irritating yeah it doesn't bother me what bothers me I understand what they say when people say like public land is harder it is harder but here's the problem with that you're dealing with a pressured animal I don't want to deal with pressured animals I know that you deal I know it's harder it's harder to have success in public land but I don't think it's better because dealing with all those people that are going after the same animals and those act like like we're now I was talking about elk that were silently bugling mm-hmm like they're opening up their mouths and they're not bugling because they don't want to get called to yeah I don't want to get chased down because they're so fucking pressured and wolves have yeah have the help don't call around wolves the other because the wolves come yeah so it like what I found is because I've done it you know I public I was only on public land for 20 years you know and I couldn't afford anything else so I haven't found that that that killing an elk is any easier or harder it's just they're bigger because they're older yeah so I can still I've always killed bulls but they they're gonna be like a three-year-old bull a five-point right now I'm gonna kill a ten-year-old bowl it's still a bowl but it's just different they just on public land there's not as many that are getting to that age class because every other hunter out there is gonna shoot the first bull they see right so yeah that's the difference it's not the hunting doesn't seem harder or easier to me or different it's still killing a bull with an arrow but just that that size when you go to private land you have more opportunities as more animals but to me they're acting wild they're acting like wild animals because they're not pressured because there's not that many people out there so it's rare that they encounter people and you know and when you're in a place like we were at which is 270,000 acres in Utah they're all just living in the mountains like they've been living in the mountains for thousands of years that's to me it's a pure experience and I know it's not available to everybody and I know you have to pay money to do it and I get that I get that it's not available to the average working man I get it but it's definitely harder to do public land without doubt mm-hmm but I don't think it's as good the reason why I don't think it's as good because those animals are acting like animals that are being hunted all the time they're pressured I've been I've on been on public land hunts I get the difference and it's definitely more satisfying when you're successful because it's more difficult and I know how people can take pride in that but I think a lot of the pride they're taking in it they're taking the because they don't have the option like if you could say to these people that are talking shit like you say hey would you like a free hunt at the Deseret in Utah maybe like yeah of course they would say yes they didn't want to experience what we experienced that day which was a pure wild rut fest pure wild experience where these animals just going off I mean we're deep deep deep into the mountains they're by themselves they're all bedded down up there there's a hot cow and they're all going crazy and fighting each other mean just the sounds that we were hearing was so epic that video that you got of us walking is here all day yeah all day they were going off is it amazing we hit the perfect spot that best spot that day that time yeah that was it and I've I've I've been in rough fast on public land you know I mean they that's how they act and that's in the wilderness deep where they're not getting so it's like you always I've always looked for places my whole career hunting career where the animal I'm not I'm not competing against Tom Dick and Harry and elk right you know so to me that was always like well the way I can do that is go further than anybody wants to go so I'd go to the wilderness to hunt those so it's essentially that without having to go 12 miles deep right right right you know and it's it's those elk are they're acting natural and you know I've been on the other side though to I get what the guys are saying I get it when I couldn't hunt my goal has always been to go on the best outcomes I could right sometimes that was instead of hunting the Oregon Coast that was going to Eastern Oregon then I went from Eastern Oregon to Wyoming I'm like oh my god this is so much better than Oregon it was better then I went from wyoming to colorado colorado that's right Eastman's had me going in 2005 i killed seven by six in wyoming then they said the next year and that was will public land hunt day nine and then it's like hey 2005 we want to film you on this on and I'm like well if it's better than Wyoming I'll go to Colorado that's what I'm trying to do I'm trying to get a better hunt and so it's just been that and so now it's been the places that I go I spend my month of September they're the very best places I can find in the United States and it's just an extension of that process thirty years ago right that's it that's all anybody's trying to do yeah you don't you don't try to go on worse outcomes some people do that I don't even really like never did mmm some people just love the grind yeah man writes I get the grind but it's still I did only gonna worse el canto but they want the bragging rights of public land but they'll definitely take a public land limited entry draw tag yeah which is essentially like being on a private land yes nobody can hunt there no and that's what like back home it's the winnow hot unit they give twenty tax 20 20 and it's a higher state huge huge area this is one area it's a people apply for it as well yeah that I I don't think they get Oregon's terrible for out-of-state for non-residents but I know residents get 20 so huge area 20 tags that's not that much different than paying a landowner to have this area for yourself right so I put in for winnow ha if I you know if I draw it I'm hunting there it's it's kind of the same thing I I understand where people are coming from and whenever someone's got something that you can't afford you get that must be honest yeah yeah yeah I I just the the problem that I have with it is that the animals when they're pressured they're not acting natural and you're dealing with too many people it definitely gives you better bragging rights right if you should Alliant Bowl on public land it's like wow that's another level of accomplishment that's a big deal you know that's that's the real grind like what we're doing is what I'm doing first of all is the easiest way to the to the to the road because I've got some of my best friends are the best hunters on earth I mean having you as a great friend and Dudley and being able to take instruction from you guys and learning how to had a bow hunting like just having you that day with me first of all what a wake up call about endurance Here I am fucking running hills every goddamn day trying to keep up with you is such a fucking bummer man it's still like it's such it's so annoying Jamie he gets to the top of the hill he's not even out of breath I'm soaked with sweat I'm heaving in home and I'm like what if I didn't run like what if I wasn't doing all this goddamn hill running well that that one little burst we had because the wind to get the wind ride and that Bowl coming over I didn't know if the bull is coming that was it kind of was a hustle it was a hustle we had to straight up out of it straight up thank God I do that all the time yeah yeah you gotta yeah and you did and that's that's that's bow hunting is like tomato be able to think you're gonna make an accurate shot after pushing yourself like ass that's rough you very rough that's what I think people need to understand about like the reason why you conditioned yourself and I know you've taken a lot of shit from lazy hunters that think it's unnecessary to what to work out as hard as you do come with us bitch yeah come with us come that day just do what we did that day yeah dammit as much as I run I was still struggling to keep up yeah it's fucking hard it is and then the whole thing is your whether or not you can recover so even though you're heaving and joven you know he even in even in Hoenn before we say heave-ho you're fucking heaving yes you're gasping for air at the top your heart rate drops down if you're in shape yeah even though you've done the sprint within a minute everything's dropping back down and then you're cool again the babies can make the shot the biggest thing I see is not only that recovery but making good decisions yeah because it's still hunting but II still have to outwit so what happens is when people get gassed they take shortcuts you know they get gas from going up the hill hard trying to get this and then they're like god do I really have to circle around and keep the wind right right right maybe I can just get away with here so it's like you take shortcuts and you can't take shortcuts so the more fatigued you are the more inclined you are to take shortcuts the better shape you are you're gonna do it right and you're gonna make make good decisions the first Bowl that we got into in the early morning that bull was that was like 52 yards and I was at full draw and he caught a whiff of us yeah and he was right he was walking right into the path yeah right into the path he would have been broadside I mean that would have been 17 yards closer than the boys shot or close to it yeah and he just fucked this pure one who's gone yeah yeah that wind will get you their sense of smell and their their their understanding of their environment is so humbling yeah it's so amazing to watch them like peek their head up and catch your wind for a second then just start running oh I know and you see I thought I don't know you see him and they like kind of they'll put their nose up don't be like what is that yeah yeah smoke alone spice yeah I did want to say one thing about the whole must be nice type thing is I don't a big pet peeve of mine is not so much the public and private and and all that but it's just like hunters are small group anyway why the hell are we trying to rip each other apart judge cannibalize the small group which we're fighting for our space in this world anyway right come on I mean like when I say you know I was defending at one time you and jock oh I think maybe is on Andy's page but whatever most Bruno's yeah it's like guys they're fucking out hunting celebrating our lifestyle because they'll be like well I don't have problem with you because you you've been doing it for 30 years I'm like who cares they're hunters they're talking about it they're doing it this is a win a win what are we doing I mean cuz you cuz they haven't been out there for 30 years and couldn't afford an elk tag it's they shouldn't do it they I mean come on yes people get short-sighted and selfish yeah that's it that's but that's in comedy that's in everything man that's in everything there's always gonna be people to think that way but comedy is not something that that the public can vote out the publican wrote out hunting right so we start cannibalizing ourselves that's not true I mean you know we could I'm not gonna say we got some momentum going now but we could lose it yeah it's possible there's enough people that are ignorant to what hunting really is yeah and enough people that actually eat meat that are ignorant to what help exactly I mean it's like 96% of people ready meat but I think if we explain what how hunting were sand and but we have to have all hunters on that same page supporting each other my wife was at dinner was with some friends and one of her friends husbands was asking where what I do and she said well he's actually on an elk hunt right now and the guy was eating a steak and he goes well that's abhorrent he's eating a stea and she's laughing at him because you're eating a steak yeah do you understand that you're eating a steak it's crazy and he you know he's from England then this can all like over there they don't hunt was they get super confused and Ricky no I was a Ricky with your face it's not Ricky has no problem with people hunting for food yeah he has a problem with trophy hunting yeah and I think it also has a distorted understanding what that is but people also lump it all on together yes they do so especially over in Europe I mean in you know under whatever but it's a psyche so that's where I say let's just first of all list for all hunters be on the same team we should certainly should be yes and then get that message out correctly that's all I've tried to do but one of the things that I try to do as much as possible is put those images of my cooking yeah you know like look look at that fucking wild dark meat that I'm cooking and I'm eating all the time all the goddamn time well and what I also try to do too and I put one up today and I think and I think you could even speak to this because we shared that emotion with your bull but there is you know I've said it before and maybe some hunters think I'm full of shit or or I don't know I don't know overemphasizing but the feeling of I'm not happy when I kill I mean the killing of the animal is not in like fun so I know an animals dying I've worked very hard to make that shot like you made the shot but then when we got to the animal and there were some he was done but it takes a while for the life together he was still moving a little bit and I shot him a second time while he was I mean he was dead he was but he was gasping for air and the correct thing to do is to give him another shot but that moment was heavy yeah it's heavy it's heavy it's heavy and you know at the end we all took our hats off and we we all like we praised him and we said like a little prayer when all the hunters got together we all said you know thank you thank you to the elk we all took our hats off and bowed our heads and the guides took some of the grasses that these elk eat and they've been doing this as a tradition they rolled it up into like a bundle like a meal and they placed it on the remnants of the carcass mmm sort of like let the Bulls last me yeah like thank you a sign of that and yeah but even before that when we just approached your bull it was I mean it it was intense and real and it wasn't I mean it wasn't happy something up it was like it's happy when you make the shot it is but people don't understand that that's because it's a relief because it's so it's there's so much tension and it's so different worked so hard to do that yeah to make that we talked about what it takes to make that shot I would like two people to experience that because it's so hard to put into words to be into that moment and to be that person that draws that bow back and makes that shot yeah it's so hard to put that into words no I don't even think the video does it justice it's so hard for a person on the outside to get it I know you'll you do have to be there and you have to watch an animal die and it's I don't know I mean it's a heavy moment but so when I put up that like me with my bowl and my hand on it that's not contrived that's real that's real I'm I feel real emotion and I respect and honor and love the journey of that hunt and the fact I took the animal's life is part of it but that doesn't it's not lost on the fact that I know I took it and it means it's that's a big deal yeah yeah I mean we did that to the elk as he was passing to say anything mm-hmm and I think about it every time I eat it yeah you know and that's I think that's the special bond hunters have with their food their meat I mean specifically you know that that the guy who is aberrant yes cuz I'm morons for it yeah boring hole yeah it's like what are you talking about well he's a fool yes I was literally carving into a steak while I was saying that right so hunters have that connection and I saw this video today this is what drives me crazy and I know I don't want to go back rehash everything we've ever talked about but I saw this video today who had it up anyway these vegans were set up in front of this I guess we get hamburgers oh that big guy big on the line yeah yeah so when do hunters ever like get confrontational and violent with people who don't want to eat meat right when does that happen well they think somehow another by blocking this burger stand that they're changing the world they're just trying to be activists you know they're trying to get a message out and most of them were quit their kind of quit veganism they're gonna start eating meat again because their health yes that's the truth it's some ridiculous number google this what number I think they said the number of vegans and vegetarians that eat meat when they're drunk is something outrageous but a close to ninety percent yeah but how many how many vegans wind up quitting and eating meat well if they've ever done a study on that this is like a big thing as you know there's been a movement as sort of a movement and people have different success rates with being a vegan but Cam Newton who is a quarterback of the Carolina Panthers big dude six six 250 260 he went vegan and he cannot get healthy he cannot he's been injured he's I mean the face of the franchise probably a hundred million dollar contract I mean made it to the Super Bowl but since just been on a decline and it's like almost hand-in-hand with this change into vegan well you know that guy dr. Shaun Baker he's yeah yeah yeah marks all these people that were in originally in that game-changers documentary that James Cameron put out yeah a shit ton of them quit before the movie came out and they had to pull him out of the movie because they were vegan and because of health reasons they had to quit it's an indoctrination movie and it's also it's extremely biased and it's not focusing on all of the various problems that people have it's only focused on the positive aspects of it and distorting the reality of those positive messages particularly the strong man who's on a fuckload of steroids yeah they forget that I forget that part yeah and then all these other athletes like these you're not talking and even the strongmen he's not like an elite strongman you're not talking about some like when I had Robert Oberst in here right he's like everybody eats the same shit he's like meat and rice like they meet yeah all those strongmen eat the same thing the real strongmen the ones who actually win the competitions what do you got Jamie it's a very controversial research that came out but it's a very repeated number of 84 % of vegans and vegetarians end up going back to eating meat of at some level yeah right right before they die folks we're omnivores we're omnivores we we exist better we are more healthy on an animal and vegetable diet yeah and if you don't want to kill animals please eat eggs eat oysters eat shrimp and lobsters they're fucking heartless sold us little monsters that live at the bottom of the ocean right but if you want to be healthy just eating only vegetables is a fucking hard road it's a hard road and this idea that you're gonna save the world listen large scare at large-scale agriculture is fucking terrible for the environment it's terrible you want it like they all of our agricultural lands when they talk about greenhouse gases we talked about this the other day 9% of all of all greenhouse gases is because of agriculture less than half of that is because of meat less than half of that is because of beef elk yeah how much is that oh man it's fucking zero you have way if you just eat out you have way less impact on the greenhouse gases than you do if you're a vegetarian and there's a fact right if you're eating grain not only that you're eating green man you're responsible for a fuckload of death whether you like it or not sure those masters combines yeah discriminate deer fawns mice forget about any thirds yeah and then the pesticides displacement of wildlife you're not supposed to have enormous fields filled with fucking corn right and grain wheat and all that shit that's not normal yeah it's not healthy there's definitely animals dying from that which I you know but for us to live animals are gonna die you know no matter how you want to look at it at some point whether it was to build your house or build the road you use to get to work or if or the fields that you eat your your salad and corn and and wheat from animals dying for us to live that's just that that's just how it works you cannot live on this earth and not have animals died because of that and I like that these people that are vegans are doing this and they think this way because they care because they don't want suffering they want these animals to live mm-hmm I look I don't want factory farming I think it's terrible it doesn't none of that it peels to me at all when I see chickens stuffed into cages like that anyone have anything to do with that I don't wanna I want a boycott every step of the way when I see pigs stuffed into those cages to next to each other sitting on the floor I don't want to have any part of that I want to boycott all of that with same thing with beef same thing with anything that's factory farm yeah but that's not what we're doing no no and I there are some good cattle ranchers that have good operations it's not the factory farm they're doing it right and it's like more people are more in tune with that like one of my son's work sat at a meat shop at a grocery store and he said people ask all the time where's this meat from how was it raised so people are getting yes and it's like supporting ethical cattle ranching I'm all for that me too that's awesome that's one of the great things about one of my sponsors is butcher box and butcher box has a total commitment to humanely raised animals 100% grass-fed grass-finished beef no antibiotics no hormones ever so they have these relationships with cattle ranchers and they use sustainable ranching and sustainable farming so when you're buying meat from a good source like that you're cutting out all the stuff that I hate about about farming well about factory farming yeah they're good outfit one thing I do I did also see is because I killed three bulls this year and and it's like it's weird because people will say well there's no way you could eat all that so I said well how good are you at math so I go through I got five people my family average average person he's 220 pounds of meat a year my family eats more than that but just say for that so that's 1,100 pounds of meat as we know say a big bull elk might you might get 300 pounds so if I kill three that's 900 pounds of meat that's still less than I'm going to eat so it's like people would be like it'd be better if you killed maybe just one Bowl and if you bought the rest then I wouldn't have a problem with it it doesn't that's the it doesn't make any sense they also don't understand you have freezers you keep everything I also share it with friends yeah every time I kill a bull I have a ton of friends lined up there's nothing I love more than giving I love it it's like what we said is a hunter we are providers that's how it's always been so there's a certain sense of satisfaction and and I don't know if it's honoring the animal I don't know what it feels like but it feels like to me it feels right yeah to give me and have somebody say man that elk you gave me that was the best meat I've ever had I just bought a ton of freezer bags so I can give away to friends you know I get elk sausage made and when in Utah that the butcher that handles the meat out there makes great jerky yes I get a bunch of jerky and that out to people it's awesome I love it it makes me happy when I get text message we will do we made elk meatballs and look at the roast I made like you know my friend Tom papa he makes bread and he makes his own handmade sourdough bread it's amazing it's delicious and he brings bread I give him meat and perfect yeah we share pictures and shit and it's it makes me really happy one of my friend sends me a meal and I know that they're there eating an animal that I harvested myself oh man it's awesome yeah it's amazing and it's high octane it almost shouldn't it might screw up you're sober October because it's it's it's so powerful you know Ian Edwards is gonna eat elk is he yeah who's been a vegan forever he said it's late he's fall asleep if you just look at him funny falls asleep but he said that he he'll eat a piece of my elk cuz I killed it myself so we're trying to figure out a time we can come over the house I want to put cook it perfectly oh yeah I have it all set up in Rakas world I'm gonna film it - yeah it'd be the first meat he's eight and then well you said that you did that with your pastor yeah but you have to make sure you don't give him too much right right right yeah he came over he'd been at a vegan for about thirteen years and yeah heat I mean eight I don't know how he felt the next day but it's like giving if you gave your dog to I mean you can't mix up the food like have it us I don't know uh it can be too rich yeah basically because people aren't used to that that much richness in their meat so right seaton carrots it's gonna be like the the polar opposite yeah I want to put in a kitchen here I want to figure out how to put a kitchen in here and then cook for people yeah you know I mean I think like have something where I have a trigger set up with some sort of a pipe that goes through the roof yes small can go down the roof perfect fuck yeah I would I would love to do that have like a stove top where I could see r/c your steaks just like so people cook for people decide let them know it this is what it's like yeah they'll be they'll be going down shooting a bow before yeah it's a long road though what's interesting it's like the road from you know you coming over my house are you coming into the studio the first time yeah many many years ago getting me that Hoyt yeah and then show me how to shoot and then you know taking me bear hunting and taking me elk hunting and all these you know reps and years and years and years of practice that leads to like two weeks ago yeah that's what's crazy about it yeah and and you had a shortened journey oh yes a shortened because you had like you said you had so many encounters like you had almost a lifetime of encounters in one hunt well and also particularly lanai okay when I helps you a lot does it does because you're shooting at these little ninja their fascist shit that's just so delicious and they must know it so fast and they're so pressured they're the most pressured animals on earth and you get so many stalks and so many hunts in and they're there yeah I mean those hunts that we do every year in lanai that to me I feel like that's my my like training camp yeah for sure tightens up yeah sure it's still I mean tell me what you thought about like when your elk hunting because they're still like when do you move fast when do you slow down what you can get away with that's still lanai helps that but it's almost like I've noticed each species is different as far as what you can get away with yeah an elk are they're noisy so you can make a little bit of noise there they're big animals to herd animals so it's it's almost like each species has its own yeah specialty yeah lanai you can't get away with shit no you can't hear shit most of what me and Dudley did before I shot my deer this year is crawl yeah it took forever to get to where we were going I took like an hour and a half or just crawling yeah just slowly crawling creeping and crawling because those animals evolved around Tigers yeah so they're all just like completely white and then you add on top of that the fact they're incredibly pressured because they have to hunt them there's they think there's as close close to thirty thousand of them on that island which is just bananas so they've got people it's great for the people that live there because they get fresh delicious organic wild meat all the time I mean everybody on that island is eaten access to your left and right me must be some of that fucking healthiest people on earth even the four season serves it yes those burgers man those access to your burgers are sensational those do we're the sliders oh good god the where else on earth can you hunt in this incredible tropical paradise and then stay at the Four Seasons and run a mountain yeah and run the mountain right oh yeah you ran more than you bargained right well yeah that was that was far I mean I asked the guys there I said hey how far is it if I go from here to here and they're like oh seven miles no it was like 15 it was a grind and humid oh my yeah well luckily you're accustomed to that yeah I was good I was talking to a friend of mine you know and they'll in and I was saying well you know cam when he first started running he had a hard time running a mile and they're like what yeah like yeah that's how it works yeah it was uh yeah you know and I was when I first started I mean I was okay in high school you know because I did all the sports and we do maybe a 10k during the summer so but then after high school then I was just like I thought it was really cool I could buy beer so I was like 21 I'd swing by a river view market on the way home and buy a six-pack of tall boys and you know I thought that was cool I could pound some you know Coors Light and I'm like oh I'm a stud now and I started you know to get fat and I'm like I didn't nobody cared it was like I didn't have I wasn't living up to these expectations I was actually living down to expectations and so I went through a phase there where I was just like not healthy I was still hunting but no real sense of I don't know I didn't have I wasn't accountable for anything or to anybody didn't have any high expectations so Mike whatever and I remember I I signed up for the beaut beaut 10k and I got there to 5th Street public mark just about 5 miles I had another mile left and I quit and I'm just like this sucks and so that was I think from there I'm like nobody feels good you know you don't feel good when you're enough in that place so I'm it was a slow grind but I got to where I just kept doing more and more and more and then I did my first marathon like in 2002 when you quit the next day how shitty did you feel I felt shitty all the time so it wasn't like I mean it wasn't you know I was living with four guys and we would just drink beer all the time and you know remembers one guy got DUI like two duis in three weeks I think both in my truck at least I wasn't right I would never dry you know I mean I I never never got caught but it was just like just stupid so it was just like another disappointment it wasn't didn't stand out because it was just there was no success no no it was just I don't know I didn't have anything going it's like that's where my life was so it's just like what changed I don't know something must have changed because now you're running 240 miles you're probably the most successful bowhunter on the planet earth I mean that's that's a giant I mean you have 800,000 Instagram followers something fucking changed like what changed how did it go from you being this guy who quit after five miles and you drinking beer all the time and you're hanging out with a bunch of Nair do wells yeah and then all sudden you are an inspiration to millions of people like how does what's the shift I think having kids you know so got married and then canner was born in 93 and then it's like man it's not cool being a loser dad no that's not that that it's it's one thing being a loser being a loser dad okay kid now I'm affecting other people's lives and so I'm like I thought I got a I got to be an example you know I got it I want my kids every parent wants her kids to to have more than they had and had a better life than they had and so you know my dad wasn't around and you know I always remember wanting him around and just you know wanting to see him so I'm like maybe that and then it was I I think I wanted my kids I wanted to challenge them so I remember my first marathon I also made tanner he was seven and yes it was 2002 I think or he would have been no must yeah I don't know anyway he was young I think he just turned eight actually and I'm him do the half-marathon so I ran the marathon he did the half marathon at eight at eight she did good got like 202 which is a good half marathon for especially for an eight-year-old so then I started introducing my kids to these challenges because I'm like you know I remember my life growing up and it it wasn't comfortable but not not a positive way and I'm like well I think these kids if they don't have challenges introduced they're gonna be soft they're gonna have it too easy so I would you know that's why they've they've run marathons and they've done these things is because that's kind of how they grew up so I think it was kind of a combination of being a parent wanting my kids to to have a successful path and then just saying I didn't want to be a loser dad so just kind of evolved from there didn't true it run a hundred miles with you Randall would he get to 80 85 90 Jesus Christ yeah hasn't he blew up no no his will broke yeah a knee issue probably I mean but yeah I mean all sorts of shit happens I mean you heard but no he God it was like that was just this past summer and you know cuz running a hundred miles in 24 hours is that's something I mean I could never do that at at he's 22 I think there's no way I could have done that then I mean it takes mental you usually don't have that mental strength until you're older you've been through life and you've been beat down and disappointed and and had your heart broke and that's when you get like hey this pain is just temporary this is for one day I can get through anything for a day well when you're 20 - it's like point of reference you know it's great it's been gravy the whole time but to run a hundred miles in 24 hours is you can tell that to anybody and be like god dang congratulations you know cryin so he wanted to do that that was his goal so I said all right I go if you get to 60 miles in 12 hours you can grind out for D in the second 12 and I said that would be good so he got 260 miles in 12 hours on on pace everything was good and it just - painful is like I think he got 31 miles maybe they are almost 31 I think there's 90 points something just you know he ended up take trying to take a couple naps was in the truck for a while and I remember I would be like so what are we doing I'd go by the truck because I never stopped right and so it's of course it's a loop 1.1 mile loop oh my god he did a hundred times right do it for 24 hours and so I'd come by and I'd be I give him a little bit a little while to chill out and uh but then I bit what are we doing here and whatever for whatever reason he got ninety which is still 90 miles is a long-ass way it's a long under feet right that's like San Diego but it's not a hundred no I'm like so we joke around too cuz I am you know I'm supportive but also I mean I am how I am so I'm like I go God you couldn't have got 10 more miles ten more miles and you would have been in the hundred mile club because he I got this little wood chip it's like the it's like the smallest little token you could get it's not even like Goggins coin right here but it's half the size of wood chip and it says 100 miles I'm like hey you got it you have a chip like - oh no no no you only got 90 they don't make 90 mile chips and so at like we said it's like God the the worst part about that is to get those last ten you got to get the first 90 and that right so I think he's gonna hit his big goal was to get a hundred miles and tour our 24 hours if she didn't get and then also qualify for Boston which he did so I think we're gonna woody have to do to qualify for Boston for his age age group he had to run under three hours in a marathon so he ran the Jean marathon in 257 Wow so he qualified that's amazing yeah that's a good fast yeah shaking his head yeah now he ran that would have bent that's like 644 that's fast miles 426 that's fucking fast yeah so the world record they're trying to get under - right under - yeah they using like special shoes and shit and those guys are amazing yeah they're so I bought these Souls these insoles they're supposed to feel like springy insoles you know those things I don't think they do a goddamn thing I really don't I tried them and I took them out and make these fucking things they're just hard yeah they're just hard it's are they supposed to do anything springy inside on the end of the day you have to run you got a grace got to keep going this you got to grind it out especially when you're going up hills I don't think they do a goddamn thing cuz you're on you're on your toes on your toes the whole way anyway yeah it's uh yeah I don't know I did the what I found is nothing really helps you I mean it running oh is just running I mean the better shape you're in probably the more enjoyable it is the born if you can I usually 99% time I'm by myself so I'm it's like it's I heard you talking with red band about yoga and it's it's sort of like that so meditation it's like you're out and it's just like I feel I feel good I feel healthy I feel centered if I can run with somebody like Kourtney then that's just a like Christmas you know you're also running out there when you run mount pick so you're you're running up there and the clean air and the beautiful view oh yeah yeah it's just it's healthy dose of nature yeah it's healthy all the way around and it's a um so I just look at it as like hey I'm doing this if I get to run with anybody else and it's it's a distraction that's just kind of you know the exception rather than the rule how many days a week you run in these days every day every day Sunday - every every day every day Jesus Christ yeah I always say rest days are for pussies the thing is you doing the same thing every day - you don't even mix it up yeah I mix it up yeah you know I call do kickboxing one day yoga the next day I for me I have to mix it up if I don't mix it up I just yeah crazy I the way I found it because I used to bike I used to do all these things but nothing nothing compares to running if you just want to get not only just just for fitness but discipline mmm running yeah running sucks for everyone so it's like just to be able to get out there and get in a groove that's discipline you know and that's I've used that discipline for the rest of my life so but it's you know the building block is and it makes shooting a bow so we talked about shooting a bow is discipline that's fun yeah if you can't get out and shoot a bow it's like come on yeah it's it's way more fun than running yeah right so that's that's why I look at it's like you know because I I always say run left shoot lifting you get a good pump whatever you got some music going you can get kind of jacked up shooting is just fun it's running that's the key to the discipline so yeah it's you're doing something to your mind you're forcing your mind to this it strengthens that ability to get in that groove and yeah yeah you know I sometimes I hear my breath when I'm running and you know when I'm really pushing it when I'm going up a hill and it's it's so satisfying that you could keep up the pace yeah you know there's something about keeping up that pace that's so satisfying and me I was running with the dog you know so it's like I got my buddy he comes running back to me I'm so happy he's so fucking happy man I had a film how he jumps out of the truck because when I bring him to the trail and it jumps out of the truck his whole body shaking boom and then I opened the gate he just jumps he leaves you could have that energy oh my god that would be that's how my that's how cash is - it's like no matter where you go he wants to if you're going outside he must be first outside if you're going inside he wants to be first back inside how happy is he yeah when you see this dog I know Oh marshal ISM I mean I tried I told you I tried to take his stuff animal and he's like yeah go ahead just let me know when you're done he's just like sitting there with his mouth clothes just looking at me I had in my mouth like my dog would brood on your mouth that disgusting subtle it's just it's just not just my teeth a disease from Marshall that's how they say don't they say a dog's mouth how can a dog with that person yeah they lick their balls I don't know how that works it doesn't know that's Cameron right see that little thing Marshall is so nice but yeah I'm taking him to work with me because otherwise you know when we run we run in the morning and then he's just bored all day waiting for everybody to come home so he comes here and hangs out oh he said but yeah so I took that thing from him and he's like no concessive no I'm like yeah just let me know and you're done I never had a daughter with him before no he's so so nice I'm so used to pitbulls and I had Mastiff smells big scary ass dogs yeah he's just a different thing man he said I have to remind myself yeah he's he's a he's a sweetie a special dog I don't know if all are all retrievers like that supposedly Golden's are all like that yeah just like commander David flavor who was on the other day yeah he said he's had five golden she said that wouldn't get another dog they're the best dogs just loves him I mean I get it now I mean I never have dog like him he's so nice to everybody everybody is his best friend now just runs from one person to the next so the only thing he does that I don't like is he jumps on people still I'm trying to get him to stop doing that but it's just because he loves him yeah yeah he's not it's not malicious right yeah but yeah I've always thought that if I could have the same attitude as my dog running yes I mean yeah I mean he's so happy he gets tired after maybe five or six and then he'll be like lagging back but up until then it's like ma'am he's loving it he trots with you for about five or six miles and then he's like this motherfuckers ya hick Ulis yeah yeah yeah dad when are we going home right he doesn't have the did dirt I mean you get him water do you bring water with him I think no but we go to the river oh yeah yeah now buff is it is it clean the other stomachs are not like our sign no obviously yeah licking their balls and shit when Martian live runs sometimes we run in the heat like sometimes you know that's tacky it's hot as fuck so I have one of those collapsible dog bowls and I just put it in the backpack and I'll bring a hydro flask in 64 ounce hydro flask and a couple times during the run I'll pull out that collapsible dog bowl and pour him some water and he'll drink it and you know that makes a big difference and then I pour some on his head to rub it on this head to cool mom's cool it out yeah yeah cuz we'll run it's 100 degrees outside oh he's got a lot of hair oh god I'm so thick yeah you could get him shaved like a lion yeah like a poodle does like I do it poodles yeah when I brush them it's ridiculous I have well I have a brush that I brush them with what I also have these gloves they're like brush oh yeah and you're petting them and then it's just like you have hair mitts you know this comes off it was up to me I'd have fucking 100 dogs yeah I love them me too so not and that's another thing that anti-hunters don't understand right they say well how come you don't kill kill your dog Mike it's my fucking dog yeah I'm talking about my dog's a squirrel murderer by the way that sweet Marshall he'll murk a squirrel really fucking heartbeat yeah we had to keep him from Merkin my daughter's rabbit he's he's got real issues yeah look at that hunting instinct as lovable as Marshall is is that the one that says everyday I have to calm the demons within what is it what is it the it's the circle of life yeah but there's another one go to the there's another one he's lying back behind him yeah did you do that on purpose no no that's a it's a painting up on Utah I know but like Sid that's a hard like different levels of hunting keep that one right there click on that one scroll down so you could see the the caption every day I must tame the demon within me he looks so guilty for his lies please just open up the door or his name is this fucking stupid rabbit yeah oh my god that's a cute I mean but what's interesting is like those retrievers they have what they call soft mouths yeah they don't tear things apart right they hold things gently and bring him yeah yeah like even squirrels but he's killed a squirrel who bring me a squirrel so I haven't fucked up really yeah yeah now that's their genetics I mean like Johnny Cash my Mastiff when he was alive hmm he got into my chicken coop one day he tore a hole through the chicken coop so the you know the chicken wire fence yeah tore it apart so he get his body then went in there and he marked eight chickens eight or nine by the time I got to him Wow my wife is screaming why is Johnny in the chicken coop and my Johnny's in the chicken can that's not good he tore a hole through the chicken coop so that was a totally different experience yeah there was no soft mouth going on there I was just carnage like barrel time killing chickens oh Jesus across mouth you reminded me what is this asshole doing he's playing with his tiger oh it's his tiger and it doesn't it looks like it's about to fuck him up in it yeah oh so where is this at I don't know I just some gift I start going around I guess if you are nice to these things and train them you can get away with this for a little bit yeah but what happens is then that lion will probably kill that guy I'm on today that's what always had cause they're still these just like Marshall yeah they still out I don't know maybe not maybe he's whatever but you always hear this that they had this pet whatever and well Marshall with a rabbit for sure yeah that's how that lion is like if I'm like let Marshall play with the rabbit Oh Marshall yeah rabbits your friend then I go and take a shit you come back to see blood and rabbit hair then that guilty look got Marshall I could take yeah he was taunting me genetics yeah it's uh I don't know why people think it's cute to wrestle with lions and do all that crazy shit it seems so silly to me I mean they're kind of cool I mean that would be fun I guess I mean it would it's like animals are amazing but don't be surprised when it I can rips your juggle around well when we were in Thailand you can go to these Tiger sanctuaries and you can pet these Tigers and what's interesting is you would go there and we would pet the little baby ones and they would be like really and and tame and playful you know because they're little babies but they're super energetic but they don't they're not trying to hurt you they're just they're just playing with each other and rolling around and they're like kittens but then you go to the ones that are just a little older like maybe a year old and they're a little sketchy yeah just looking around and and then there's a guy with a stick and they're there keeping you at a distance with them I don't want you getting too close to them they worry about they might jack you and when you get to the older lines like or the the older Tigers the full-grown Tigers they're all drugged yeah and it's a real bummer man yeah they're all lying there like people take pictures with them and these things are on fucking heroin man they just lying there completely 100% drugged there's no if ands or buts about it they barely keep their head up and people are smiling and put their hands on it and take it self I don't like that it's weird man I don't like that it's weird I like I like Adam wild out to be wild yeah me too that's I mean that's that's what's cool about and look I mean we've we both experienced bears in the wild and I've never seen a mount line in the wild but I did see one in Montecito and Santa Santa Barbara I saw one on the street but I mean if I did see one I would think it's fucking cool to be in the woods like hunting and like Dudley was 20 yards away from one yeah stumble across one it's cool that they're out there yeah you know I love the fact that they're a real thing but I don't want to pet them yeah now you got a respect don't I don't want to have nothing to do and those things are in kill Ryan man those things are killers do you see that picture we have outside now with the Hollywood sign I yeah I did so I motherfuckers live in in Griffith Park yeah big-ass cat with giant forearms see his forearms things are killing machine yeah and he's just out there keeping keeping the Coyotes in check yeah marking all those Disha few have died recently because a rat poison yeah Lyons yeah yeah mountain lion yeah it's a bummer man there's a lot of lions here in California a lot they get a hold of the rat poison because people poison the rats and then they eat the rats or the Coyotes eat the rats and then they eat the Coyotes and they get that rat poison in them and they want to dying and another one got killed recently trying to cross the street he was trying to cross the highway and they think he might have been getting chased by another cat and the cat chased him right into traffic and bam they're territorial that's what that's what that's why they have to keep spreading out so much because they won't overlap mmm those males will get a certain territory and then the younger ones have to go usually further into town do you hear what happened about the woman who had a farm she has a an alpaca farm in in Malibu and a mountain lion just decided to start marking her alpacas and killed a shitload of them really and yeah I killed like eight of them or something crazy like that and a goat killed a goat too didn't even eat him just oh yeah why don't I kill and spray thens gonna eat a goat's are terrible Arlie really yeah I tried that one time back in the early 90s Ted Nugent was playing in Eugene and he was with the Damn Yankees and we're like we had this place I had these feral goats down by Roseburg and so we're like they wanted him killed and so we asked Wayne asked Ted somehow got ahold of him oh no he's gonna come to the bow rack cuz he's been following him forever it's like hey you want to go bow hunting goats with us so long story short we went down there killed a bunch of goats he had a concert that night but I had a truck full of dead goats a little Toyota two-wheel-drive little blue thunder we called it and I tried to use those goats this is before 94 so you could bear bass Dylan or again try to use them as bear bait the Bears were like we're not eating that shit bears didn't want to go who would not eat the goat what no no so goats yeah it doesn't surprise me that lion won't eat the goats either so goat meat not the best but they say that goats like some some cultures love goat yeah I think so yeah that's probably the ones that won't eat cows I don't know just cook it they have ways of cooking it yeah you know I've never had why I know I've had goat before at a Mexican restaurant I had like go tacos yeah it was good really yeah yeah but I think if you braise it yeah hello cook it with slices yeah Trager it like you know put it on like 165 degrees for eight hours or something like that the right spices yeah you can make anything tastes pretty damn good that's what Jen she cooked something up in bear camp this year it was bear I think it was loin maybe I don't know but it would anyway cooked it for 12 or 20 hours something crazy mm-hmm God it was so good no follow a bang ham maybe oh yeah that's right I remember that yes oh good yes yeah she marinated it people say Isis I'd like to see people who say well do you eat bear have a plate of Jenna if it's bear meat my god no no one what Rinella was talking about on his podcast when the Pioneers came out west they were shooting deers for their skins and bears for the meat really yeah oh I didn't know that yeah they were shooting bears for me black bears yeah that they preferred black bears for their meat it's a delicious animal don't know no they don't know and they think you're lying for some reason then you can t bear you don't want to eat bear like you don't know what you're talking about if Jen Rivet cooks you some bear I defy you I defy you if you like to eat meat her stir-fry you dare stir-fry yeah that is fantastic you'd have to be a path of Electrical liar to say it wasn't good if you don't like meat maybe you won't like it but if you do like me you'd be like wow this is good do I say it tastes like like a it's almost like a cow fucked up deer mm-hmm it's like a combination of like venison and yeah yeah it's yeah I mean the way she cooks it is you know I think there's a typical taste of bear or does like people always say who haven't had a like that they say it's greasy because it's more like pork ish you kind of you know is some fat in it it's like it's just different but the way she does it in the trailer or stir fry it's incredible it's incredible yeah yeah it's a really delicious animal that speaking of that hunt that's what I want to get Goggins on his first hunt just like I took you in all right uh-huh so that's that's that's we can take him to yon gents play yeah yeah that'd be perfect try to get a bear yeah good good first bow kill house he shot a bow at all yeah I got him a bow I've been shooting I don't know if he had he shot when he came and worked out with me he's got the best fucking Instagram stories ever those he got those videos I know I love it never gets done by being a bitch he said I was I was reading one of his text messages he sent me yesterday he just sends the most I do lunch you showed me the one you showed me one like not too long and goes every couple months I got new ones yeah yeah I love it I love it they wake you up two men finally wake me up I start doing chin-ups as soon as I get those messages I'd love his attitude there's a few people who I love the most people like you know just they're good people just hard-working but I'm in love with their spirit it's like his spirit chakra spirit cortney's spirit their spirit it's like it's it's amazing yes it's and he's like one of those guys that it's never gonna waver well you know what you're gonna get you get inspiration from it I do I get fuel from yeah yeah yeah I just thought even having the chance to train with them it's like man just feel lucky to see him in action and see him change from David to Goggins right and it right and it becomes the Hulk oh my god it happened it and it's like I thought well maybe this is just kind of like a whatever maybe just a thing but it was real it's like when when shit got hard he got into this different zone and it was like he got better he got better got me out for ya he did it is like so would you guys do you ran like 30 miles yeah 35 35 miles yeah and then you went back and lifted yeah and we shot bows too but all of that same day but during that race it was kind of cold and snowy I think of spitting snow but raining it was soaking wet and he I remember like a mile 22 he something was happening with his feet and he had to take his shoes off and untie his shoes and it's like normally that's not a good sign I mean people are messing with their shoes 22 miles into 30 it's like god this is not you know because you know your feet are gonna get torn out right so it's like you just kind of your feet if they could be bleeding torn ups like yeah this is what happens just kinky and he's done a lot so so I'm like man I don't know I said well I thought I'm just gonna kind of keep keep chugging along and you know get it figured out and and catch up and we'll go from there and I thought man there's a chance that maybe I won't see him again but no sure a shit here he comes he catches back up me and my brother were up there and he he went from 22 he got in this different groove and then I actually my calf on this race kind of locked up and it's like going up this last grade would do one more summit and I couldn't run it and I'm like he took off I was just kind of power hiking it and I get up there and had a cameraman up there and David was like he was in his Goggins mode by that time this is towards the end of the race but like two miles I was like 33 miles in and he I asked a cameraman up there I'm like hey I said how did Goggins look and he's like well he had a shirt off and he was in it was colder and he's had a shirt off and he was saying did you fucking know me I'm like who's he he's like they don't they don't know me son and doing saying all this stuff I said who is he saying that to and he's like he's nobody up here imaginary enemies yeah he's fighting and that's but that's that's real and so he did and he got better and he frickin just crushed the second half of that race and same thing happened lifting he like the more reps we did the better he got and like at the end when we had done so many reps and we did this one last thing of doing yeah we did like 95 reps of or no a hundred reps of right there on that incline bench is only 95 pounds but we had done 600 reps before he ended up on the last set did more that he did in the first set that's insane yeah and that's when he's saying he starts yelling right here somewhere volume carry the boots you're gonna this is at international fitness just a regular gym and people were like what the hell what is this guy he got into the that zone and it's like so whatever he says about his David that he was Goggins when he gets to Goggins dude look out it's like a whole it's a different person that's unstoppable that's right oh yes it's real it's real I saw it and he's like it's amazing well that's how he broke the world chin-up record yeah I mean I have to be a complete psychopath to be able to do chin-ups for 24 hours a day and then so we went we went after that and we went and watched UFC got pizza and and it was getting late by that time so we'd run 35 miles we shot bows we lifted weights pretty full day ate pizza had a cup of chocolate chip cookies watch UFC pretty good night and then so he's like yeah he goes I had to get get back to my hotel I got still got a stretch a couple hours of stretch and uh in my wife goes oh you're stretching just you can miss stretching tonight it's like what are you talking about they have David Goggins miss stretching where that's like you know taking the night off well so does some hardcore stretching and he does for hours and then that's just kind of his routine and then he got up the next day and from his hotel ran 15 miles so people can say whatever they want the dude is as real as they get and a complete savage a hundred percent it's not it's like you can say whatever you want cuz on the Instagram you never know if what you see is what you get it's he's amazing yeah he's real there's no way he could be doing it as long as he's doing it without he someone would expose him yeah he would expose himself yeah well that's the real deal and that's why it's so special that's why it's so inspirational yeah is because like that's all mental strength and he's all super honest about how he used to be yeah my brain was soft I was soft it's helped me because I've thought that I'm like when I get tired I mean I take inspiration from a lot of people but it's like I I'm like god I need to have that little piece of Goggins you know to be to get in that is it's got to be mental it's like it's he just puts himself there and he struggles but then gets to this next level and it's like how it's just he just makes himself go there he also spit out now how to maintain his body which is very important yeah no he that's why he's into that stretching because he's had some like pretty significant muscles yeah that passes so awesome alright I clocked up on him yeah now he realizes like there's you know there's a maintenance involved - yeah yeah you got to treat that thing like a vehicle right I gotta take care of that vehicle yeah he does and he's I mean it was like I'll never forget sharing that day with him never I mean it's it changed my life I swear to God I mean he's you know I mean David Goggin just like people follow him and they're just like I feel I feel like it's it's like another blessing I don't really deserve just to be able to you know who wouldn't want to we always talk like that it drives me crazy all this yeah I don't deserve shit I don't this is one thing I hate about you drives me nuts I don't you always say like like we were been talking about that like you always feel like you don't even deserve to be like that that these camps with all these great hunters I think I always say I think somebody eventually is gonna say what the fuck what is it this guy doing here and I'll be like well they figured it out was it it was a good run that is called impostor syndrome I don't know I just don't feel like I'm a I see you guys I see you you Goggins Jocko and I see those in the that's who everybody you know it's like you can change people's lives and I feel like pretty soon they're gonna go why is this guy here yeah yeah but that's how I feel about everything but I just don't I don't express it you don't hate yourself for that no I hate myself for that but you hate me well you say too much drives me nuts because I admire what you do so it drives me crazy because you've taught me so much haunting much I feel the same I used to feel the same about everything like it's called impostor syndrome what's that mean and it when people have very high standards mm-hmm people work hard and they have very high standards and then they become successful they feel like an impostor if you like there's no way because you're always wanting better and more and like as I've become famous and become friends with other famous people like when I meet them like I was out at a restaurant the other night and me and my wife were having dinner and Jamie Foxx came in and he comes up to me and gives me a big hug and I'm always like why did you like me that's supposed to like me yeah it weirds me out that even knows who I am yeah you gotta meet my friend he's huge fan ears I'm like what you know any fans like what are you talking about yeah you're Jamie Foxx like this is nuts just talking to you yeah you know and then he brings me over to his friend I always feel like an impostor I know I feel like an impostor when like when we did that show in Portland when you came to the show yeah about to go onstage this fucking sold-out arena people names you still feel like an imposter as they're bringing me up I'm like this is so crazy amazing okay so you get it I get it yeah but it's just because I have a very high standard and I work really hard and I am never satisfied yeah so even though I know that I can do it I do it every night yeah stand up every night right I know I know I practice hard I work hard I write hard I tell ya I constantly do sets even though I still am I quiet and the fuck is this yeah this is ridiculous still to this day well you know I I get it I come all that I mean just today people send me a text hey I sent this to so Joe must have change his number can you see it as I did give me on the vodka and it's just like so I hear like that and I hear like what's Joe like so what's what's it like to do and it's like I don't know however I don't know how other famous people are about how you are is like all I ever say is like he's the most generous supportive person I've ever met so however you're doing it you've been a good it's just somebody good to emulate I think well I would say the same about you man it means a lot to me to be a friend and to learn bowhunting from you spend to me it's like you know there's if you want to learn something you know you want to learn something what you want to learn is from someone who really understands it and really has it mastered it and spent a lifetime doing it so for me like you've cut probably decades off my learning curve of learning bow hunting and be able to learn I mean all those different things that we did to get close to those different bowls was all because of your years and years of experience and of course Colton helped us as well he's a great guide and very knowledgeable hunter but you know even he defers to you because you've had so much experience so to me that it's it's just to have a guy like you out there that's such a great role model that does it all the right way and work so hard mean to learn from you has been gigantic there's no you go out to that wall out there and see all those elk heads that's all because of you man I mean it would have never happened I would have never been able to do it I definitely wouldn't have been able to be this successful this early you know well yeah I mean you've been whatever position you've been put in you've made the most of it that's what I say so a lot of people have been in put in fortuitous situations that screw it up or don't make the most but because of your work work ethic you've made that 67-yard shot which isn't easy for anybody in crunch time you made that to perfection so that's that's you I mean getting there maybe whatever could have played a role in that but executing god it was so beautiful that was like it's like seeing you kill that bowl was definitely better like when I kill I'm just like well did what I do that did what I do there's what I'm supposed to do so I'm like you have to be controlled and like you were even pretty controlled I wasn't controlled from that moment I was so happy and so it just caught up in the moment it was it was beautiful to see I said it was and one of the most beautiful shots I've ever seen and that's true but it's just like just to see that and and have you be successful it's like God it means everything it means everything to me to man it does and to be able to do it with you but like I said in the video it does it means the world to me that I could do that you know with being your your student and being able to learn from you and then to be able to execute like that in crunch time was perfect yeah I mean and now we fucked up and a lot of people gonna be in the woods bow hunting now it's a get something out of it man I really I really hope people yeah feel what we feel and get that expand then when you're eating it you'll you'll get that feeling that it's doesn't it's not it's completely incomparable this is nothing like it in terms of like eating a meal eating a meal from an animal that you track down and and hunt it yourself it shot yourself there's nothing like it yeah no it's amazing hey did you uh mmm you were at the comedy store last night yeah are you there tonight yep yeah you are yeah yeah I get to go yeah hell yeah yeah I set up a show it's just because I know you're gonna be here I thought I saw you there last I saw those you were there last night I'm like oh shit I wonder if don't see oh no no no I'm there multiple nights but I was there too I had two shows there last night and then I had a show The Improv - oh nice so yeah edible thing about being in LA

amazing like LA for for comedy it's like the the Deseret of comedy was was Chris and Callen there last night well it's encounter at the they were at the store I left them when I went over to the improv and then I see a problem yo Ian Edwards yeah yeah yeah ridiculous Callen was roaring like a dragon yes oh so silly it was hilarious yeah it's hilarious the comi story you've never been right no never Mecca you're gonna come to Mecca tonight oh I can't wait that's comedy Mecca there's no place like it on earth and it's not it'll be mobbed Joey Diaz will probably be down there tonight it would be it would be incredible this this day has been like I figure if I can die after today I'm good because it's like everything has happened and I get to go to the store it's like now what is this GQ thing you did today it was just so they had me breaking down like archery and movies so I did Hunger Games they fail my reaction and and got me like talking about if it's realistic so I did Jeremy Renner I did Robert De Niro he was in got some terrible movie and I I don't even think you I was kind of surprised he was actually hunting with a bow in the movie what movie was that I was at a movie with him and John Travolta yes yes and they had a fight yeah John Travolta played like a Russian yeah and he shot John Travolta shot an arrow at him so Robert De Niro is in a tree stand John Travolta shot and is stuck in the tree Robert De Niro jump fell out of the tree and broke his bow and so then he like started crawling towards John Travolta for summer anyway they had me but Robert De Niro actually had a pretty good anchor I mean he looked pretty good with the boat really he had a whisker biscuit on there which wasn't good for for the rest but he was gonna shoot this bowl like this five-point Bowl came out and he couldn't do it he like I don't know what happened he like had he hesitated then Johnny felt bad it's something like that I don't know what how many see this Jamie do you have it killing season yes it's pretty intense bad no that's no no that's not it I don't let that grip he had a compound bow yeah oh it's a different one yeah right there huh yes hey he looks like look at him I know yeah so he's wearing flannel - he went old-school his radio went off and has spooked the bull but he jumped out and broke that bow yeah so I I did that when John Travolta was shooting arrows at each other yeah how dumb was the movie it's terrible apparently the new Rambo is unbelievably bad yeah we did Rambo too because I said I go we have to do Rambo I want to talk about when he do you remember when he had the exploding tip and shot that guy yes yes that was awesome you get caught in a trap oh yeah John Travolta's beard oh Jesus it's he's Russian yeah how bad is his axe I don't know Oh atrocious I'm sure killing seasoned what is it again a rotten tomatoes co derived tomatoes wine I want to see a 3 what does it get please tell me it's like 13 10 that's impressive that's pretty low that's that's pretty high well yeah a lot lower than that okay what happened Oh Oh No shop can we get up he's trying to get up was he doing oh oh he hurt his ankle I took one to the calf oh did he yeah looks I arrow I think I don't know it's hilarious yeah yeah there's very few movies that depict bow hunting correctly yeah I didn't see any what is this he's holding him he's got the arrow there yeah you attack him before he draws just shoot me just shoot me come on you hear the listen to the Russia should the sheets Oh hold this stop that right now I'm not I cannot I can't do this that's uh no no no no that the best form I saw in any the movie that I that I reviewed for him today was I think it's called brave it was an animated movie oh yeah the redheaded girl yeah there it not bad she actually had perfect form really yeah I'll let me see that is there a movie though where someone Bo hunts correctly I mean is there one moving right here I'm see right watch her form when she well here they're teaching her how to shoot yeah I think so yeah but you'll see her she steps up the innocent convincing confidence the confidence the confidence so you know she's gonna put put it on the X yeah he watches watch his confidence and the attitude see that she's pretty bossy my kids did not like this movie they watch it for some reason weird movie from how we would read it's her she needs that her dress is too tight see that uh-huh back son watches on the move it was pretty good I never watch this last one hmm this one's uh-huh yeah right here don'tdon't um look at this watch this form and this is with a broad head with distractions she's so focused the feather cut her face a little for some reason oh I like how the arrow and look a real arrow I know but watch this whoa whoa look at this oh she Robin Hoods it I know pretty damn impressive see that come that's so that's what I say the all the ones that I reviewed today that's the best that's the best yeah looking here her I know let's see that follow-through yeah Fowler was excellent very sweet but there's no movie where bow hunting now accurately depicted I don't know movie mm-hmm now I'm thinking I'm trying to think of a movie that even involves bow hunting can you think of one no not not hunt not bow hunting no I mean there's deliverance where one's up hunting people remember yeah I wanted to do that one bow but they didn't have that today they had walking dad they had ridiculous that they call that a bow that's a shitty gun that's what I said I said I know I'm not down with the crossbow and and you got a rotten a rotten corpse head and it's stopping an arrow it's not a pastor excuse me yeah that's outrage Dick's in their head I don't know how we missed this but Samuel Jackson plays in a movie called big game where I think he might have been Secret Service protecting the president either way the plane crashes or something ends up with a kid and learning how to bow hunt to survive oh really really yeah I came out three or four years ago oh this ship must went straight to yeah it doesn't look never heard of it I want the bow hunt to survive I mean on this now he's getting in a fight yeah I typed them bow hunting movies and this was the most recent one I thought oh that's hilarious it jumps on a helicopter I mean I just wanna stop stop that before I get brain damage yeah isn't it interesting like you would think that there would be a way to make a movie that involves bow hunting that would be interesting you think so yeah like the movie like there's only a couple good pool movies is that yeah hustler with Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason and then the color money with Paul Newman and Tom Cruise those are the big ones yeah the the color money changed pool like when that movie came out in 1986 it just literally pool exploded the same is in the 1960s when the hustler came out cool exploded yeah so pool had to like giant explosions where people really started going to pool halls they wanted to learn how to play pool good and then with the Hunger Games apparently a lot of people got into archery because of Jennifer Lawrence we got a beautiful woman janab oh that's what I said I go you looking like a badass you yeah yeah the confidence is a key you know and she's hot she's hot and then she's got a bow it's like 10 times hotter both those things are good yeah so yeah she and she what was good with her was she could go from having the bow to grabbing an arrow to put it on the string to shooting in like half a second yeah and just over why I go that's not easy to do well she must have had some serious training just to be able to pull that off on film yeah I think she'd and I think she shot a hoy and I think she took lessons from a high shooter and same thing with even Rambo's old bow I believe was a Hawaii really yeah that's hilarious I know but yeah he he had the exploding tip and the guy the bad guy who was shooting ran out of bullets with his gun threw down pulled his pistol out and a shooting a Rambo and Rambo just stood up there just like you're not gonna hit oh here she is oh shoot right I thought her I guess that's her coach teaching the reporter oh oh so this is the woman who coached Jennifer Lawrence yeah okay I want to see Jennifer Lawrence so I don't even know this chick I thought if I got here with this yeah but it's that did get a lot of people involved adesh girls especially yeah yeah young girls apparently what is her name Geena Davis yeah Davis is a big-time Archer she loved shoots yeah she's she's playing that competitions right doesn't she I think so yeah yeah doubt some target competitions yeah and Ivanka Trump does she I saw her with a bow before well obviously Donald Jr is the biggest one in the family yeah Donald Jr is a legit bow hunter yeah he uh he shot a giant bull in Colorado this year did he yeah oh I didn't even know that yeah yeah he said it's a dud Lee sent a picture of it to Doug's me on his phone really big-ass bowl yeah god I didn't see that yeah it's great bull yeah Wow huh yeah he's a legit bow hunter I mean that guy loves bow hunting he hunts a lot ya know he's he's definitely avid outdoorsman I mean he's always putting up stuff and he's learned a lot there's ugly too did he yeah Dudley taught him quite a bit mmm came quite a bit of training yeah yeah but there's not as a single movie where someone goes hunting like that that could be mean that could be a good movie the Olympic team oh shit oh she's shooting a Olympic recurve yeah she tried out that for the Olympic team finished 24th out of 300 women not bad yeah those in the in the Olympics you know it's no compound its bows just like that Wow that's seven I think it's 70 meters they put him in there Wow but you didn't find any getter so looks fucking super legit look at her form I know a grip hand everything yeah they're such good shooters it's amazing how good they get yeah with tabs I mean that's crazy like you're shooting off your fingers yeah and you're shooting really accurately is she still doing it that's all I was looking up they made a video with her I'm funnier don't see that video archery tricks is this it it's joke you said I don't know how much of it is real funnier dices I don't know what that context was a couple years old she's got a gun - mm-hmm you know so it's just so you don't actually get to see okay being silly so you'll either form there's a form yeah look at that that uh we never saw Jennifer Lawrence practicing there that's why that's that video I should practice in hiding I know I want to see it yeah I mean she obviously has got to have a lot of training the way she executes yeah it seems because like you know when you see Keanu Reeves in John wick like okay that guy had some fuck yeah shooting a hundred percent yeah no doubt about it yeah you know a guy just started doing that recently mm-hmm at the same place where he learned oh right it's fucking hard as shit on that it's hard man really yeah it's another thing that you're gonna get obsessed with because it's just so technical there's so much technique involved in it was that part of your sober October yeah we're doing a bunch of different classes all sorts sorts a different shit that's cool it's fun man what it's speaking of famous people hunting how about Scott Eastwood on his bowl how about Scott Eastwood first first ever bull I know yeah I know like first day in camp who's the first got to kill ya know made a hell of a shot he'll be five yards a great guy yeah I know I mean when we did that podcast with him we got to and he said just a sweetheart of a guy that's how he is all the time yeah super friendly guy yeah boy was he beaming he came back to camp first guy to kill big smile on his face that's the days he was at Camp you just smile and I know he's still happy I know is bullying a nice Bowl - oh heck yeah that's a big bowl yeah that was awesome I mean we've hunted with Chris Pratt Jocko it's dumped I mean we've had our edible we've had some great times I can't in in Andy's Bowl you see that video yeah came in mazing three or four yards or whatever and then luckily they got to stop at 19 or 20 whatever it was but you know another crunch time my coming through and crunched last day I know and now I had very few opportunities he just you know bow hunting is hard I mean I always have the last three years I've scheduled to bow hunts a year yeah because to elk hunts a year because I keep thinking I'm not gonna be successful yeah I'm gonna it's not I'm gonna come up short odds are I'll gets at least get maybe I'll have two opportunities for the second hunt and I'll be able to get a second ball yeah yeah well so it's lucky shit I know now you got one next week yeah I'm very excited yeah I mean it's it's a it's an interesting thing the camaraderie in camp too because like those kind of camps like we had two weeks ago in Utah it's like we got a group of some of the best people I know and everyone's hanging out and just some of the nicest friendliest people and especially early in the week everybody's on the grind I know everybody's on the bronze all business yeah it's serious serious second business yeah you know I had to leave I had to leave an out cut to come there that's why I still got it is like is like it was so fun I'm like there's no way I'm gonna miss this camp it was cool to meet Levi Morgan - yeah yeah really nice guy and I watched his television show before and he's another one an elite world champion karcher yeah it's yeah it's just like any time I always feel lucky to be able to rub elbows with people like that at that level and just feel like I don't know just talk with them just like and I was amazing to be able to show Levi Morgan that shot that you filmed that was fucking beautiful - yeah that was fun it's just so cool to be in that camp because you know it's everybody in that group is they all get it everybody's obsessed with the same thing everybody's except obsessed with success in bowhunting and here we are the one week that everybody looks forward to most on earth yeah all year long you look forward to this one week on earth this is the rot in Utah during elk season when there there was no moon so they're going off this couldn't have been better they were fucking and Dudley's into that moon shit man he'll tell you about moon phases and this and then he writes articles about it yes he was like this week is gonna be amazing and it was oh my god oh my god those Bulls went crazy I was watching that clip the other day like I said I watched and Colton pulled out that tender limb but I also watched that first I thought the bull was gonna be dead 55 yards were under that spruce tree yeah and that was a big bowl Center out there I was so close close so close when I drew back he was looking right at me yeah yeah fuck this I know I just but reliving those moments so thankful we have the phones and the video and it's like easy how good the video is - I know just amazing phone this fricking phone filming your kill shot yeah and it's like clear as day click crystal-clear 4k perfect yeah yeah it's almost watch it too much I could almost watch it too much I mean I got to stay in the moment yeah you know no it's a it's a pretty special bill to see it though yeah well that one we did for you for under armour yeah watch that video at least a hundred times have you oh fuck yeah yeah is that shot through the trees great video yeah this one this one I like just because you can actually see that arrow kind of tracking for it comes in and it tracks and just hits money yeah no that's better for sure yes better the other one was like I was shooting through a hole and yeah I had a I don't like thread the needle yeah and punch it through that hole in the tree did yeah being able to execute during crunch time it's so fucking satisfying that's what it gets me up and makes me practice hours and hours and it's just like you feel you did what you're supposed to do and it's just like there's pressure because there's pressure like you're like carrying this pressure and then it's gone it's gone it's gone for a second for a second and then the pressure has you got to be able to do it again though so you can't rest on your laurels it never gets easier oh never gets easier it's like you know successes is fleeting you got to keep grinding and keep and it's like one failure seemingly wipes out years of success you know you screw up one time and you're just like oh my god mm-hmm it's devastating you know like I said it's like it can be soul-crushing well you're only as good as your last execution of whatever you're trying to do whether it's your last comedy show your last bowhunt Neil asked you last arrow you released you're only as good as that if you release a bad arrow and you hit a deer in the ass you're like fuck yeah and then your head is like that's what I do I shoot deers in the ass yeah and then they run away and you forget everything yeah you can't you it's but that's also what makes me practice so much yeah I don't ever want to feel that it's like one of those things you have to be obsessed yeah you're gonna you're gonna be mediocre unless you're obsessed yeah I think bow hunting is a very strange thing because it's not just hunting it's it's an athletic pursuit it's a discipline and it requires so much like you know when I was at Teheran tactical the other day I was shooting rifles and I didn't miss one so it's like clink yeah clink clink it's just you know I'm on a bench just trigger discipline pull pull pull little surprise release go off right it's you you hunting like that is difficult but it's it's not comparable there's nothing like bow hunting it's the most difficult but also the most satisfying yeah and it's a it's I hate to use the term because it's such an overused term but it's a spiritual pursuit it is there's something very spiritual about bow hunting and it's when you when that shot landed and that's one of the things that happens like our spirits are uplifted like yeah we did it like a grind is over for this one day for this one moment we did it and it always feels the same thing to me after it's over and after the animals down and you know after we're thankful to never feels real so is this real did this really happen yeah sure this thing never feels real it always feels like that last year when I shot that giant wanted to hone ranch same thing didn't feel real I stand over the things like this real it doesn't feel real yeah just feel strange is that what I wonder why that is I'm crazy probably that's like I just I don't ever like it even when things go well for me there's a part of my brain and I think this is because I've been obsessed with so many different things and I've kind of I kind of understand my own pitfalls and the only traps that I can fall into so anytime anything happens that's great even if it's fucking amazing like yeah it feels good for a little bit and then almost immediately afterwards I think you better get back to work bitch better get back to work yeah because you can't start thinking you're awesome they're right yeah you can't get confused right you know I mean that's why I always say like you know what someone's someone asked me once like what's the secret to your success they're one of the big secrets is I'm not a fan of me right I'm not like I don't think I'm awesome yeah I I'm not that impressed with me right so I know what I need to do to be successful and then I'm the guy who's telling me get out get up go go go do it do it do it so anytime anything happens it's great and like settle down pitch that's exactly how I feel I think you have to feel like there how I feel Alexander Gustafsson was talking about that once and he was talking about the mindset that you have to be to be an elite professional athlete like you can there you're never satisfied there's no way yeah and I think anything that's difficult difficult pursuits whether it's stand-up comedy or whether it's bow hunting or even ultramarathon running it's like you no matter what you do that's hard to do once it's over you better not enjoy it for too long now I'm gonna get back to work back to work you have that horse I know you're gonna always feel that good feeling if you think about it at all like I always have that video I always feel that good feeling if I want to feel good i watch that shot yeah but don't think about it too much now you better get back to work yeah no that's exactly how I feel it's like it's it's so it's so hard to get and it's just then it's gone yeah cuz you can I mean you got to prove it every time but the real the real fun is in the struggle and that's yes hard for people to get their head around it's the struggle but then then then not winning but succeed succeed yeah and that's what you can that's what you see in that video yeah because the struggle has been is so evident and then the success and it's just like oh my god this feels like almost surreal and yeah and just amazing but then it's like god I want to feel that again yep but I gotta earn it you gotta earn it yeah never it doesn't give a fuck who you are I mean it's one of the things that I love about archery is the same thing I like about pool it's the same thing I like about a lot of things they're absolute like when pool the ball either goes in the hole or it doesn't that ball doesn't give a fuck who you are it doesn't give a shit it's an animal arrows being released if you don't you don't hit it right yeah you don't release it right you don't aim perfectly be the best in the world and funk up you screw up a shot fuck yeah yeah yeah and the animals don't they're not there's no they're not cutting anybody a break right it's it they're wild animals in the mounds and you just got to I mean it's tough but it is when you mention spiritual endeavor I remember when I was in San Carlos this year this is you know native land and it's it's very special for me to hunt there with with its Apache Tribe there and I remember I was standing on top of this Ridge and the wind was coming through there and it in a felt like I told the told the guys are this - that it felt like there the wind was moaning like there's so much I don't know if it's emotion I don't know if there's life in there but it felt different and it's like when are you ever gonna be in a situation where you're gonna be so in tune where feels like that and that's that's what the bow and I don't know I think something about San Carlos to when you know that this is Indian land it's kind of like a special like a special feeling connected to it for me did yeah it was like and I'd come to find out that in that Canyon there there's there's these caves down there that there's a mummified body in there apparently and it's there's three different levels to the cave there's arrows in there there's to this day right now right yeah that was the story about a mile down for more I said it felt like it sounded like the wind was moaning why don't you go there apparently they have a bard up now because there's people who steal artifacts how getting in there so I want to look at know amazing me but the history of that land so I've seen an old arrow you find an era now brought hit on the ground from hundreds of years ago it wouldn't that be a that'd be incredible fuck it being I found a broad head a little Flint broad head in sobota yeah but I've I mean I don't know if anybody's ever found one with an arrow yeah that's apparently there's 25 or 27 arrows in there whoa I know incredible so it's like take a picture there is a there is definitely a connection and then it just feels different to me there and it's like and it's like I feel so much I feel honored to hunt there with the Apache the guys from the reservation that's also a place where very few people get to be so you know that when you're there you're sharing the land with very few people so you you kind of feel like super lucky I do yeah I never I never thought I'd ever be I mean everybody knows their giant Bulls there what how could I ever be the guy who guys aren't there it's like never never thought that would happen but it's a Posey shot there this year is insane yeah they're so big it's big old bull like the hardest part with that hunt is like you could go there you could kill a able if you just wanted to kill a bull it would you could make it happen but killing a big old bull is hard that's the heart that's hard anymore but but there it's uh and then that if you're killing an old bull there it's gonna be giant I mean they're just special animals incredible now this is because they're supposed to be two different kinds of elk right that there was a Rocky Mountain Elk and he Yellowstone elk that's just I've heard it's a gentlemen's name that he hunts at the Deseret and he also hunts down there Oh Steve Johnson yes yeah he was explaining this to me yeah that there is the the Yellowstone elk was a larger breed of elk it makes sense there are larger antlers and you see them in the Gila you see them in New Mexico and that that area in particular in San Carlos yeah has a bunch of those elk yeah well I also think that that's what's in to hone ranch oh really yeah that's why they're so big well those are giant - yeah it's also you know they don't have a winter like they do yeah and in the mountains of like Utah Colorado right yeah where they got to survive the winter months I'm gonna take my wife and kids next year I want them just experience the rut I want the whole come with to hear the bowls just to hear just because it's soaked and just see them look like I don't know I mean maybe I'll take them with me to Utah and I'll take a day off hunting yeah and just just have a star go with me yeah come with me I just want you guys to experience it it's like when we were heading into that timber like where that first bull was in the shade and the shadows I mean those Sat I'd swear it to the video it sounded like monsters down demons yeah we're saying imagine being the pioneers and you know you you well you got there maybe in fuckin June or something like that yeah and everything's quiet yeah then all sudden a couple months later here yeah you would know what the fuck is that yeah must have taken a while before they realized it was the elk that were doing that it must it was I mean in a sound of like they were so loud we sound like we should have seen them way before we did Bryan do you remember that huh they were so far away it sounds like they're right there but it's just because it's so loud in the echo through the canyon oh god it was so fun I would give anything to see what it must have been like to have crossed America back in the Lewis and Clark days when it was totally undeveloped and you know you just run into the the tribes of Native Americans I would just love to see what it was actually like with when the wildlife was undisturbed and you know you'd have these massive herds a buffalo and deer where everywhere and elk were everywhere they said when those expeditions came across America they just they could hunt anything yeah think animals everywhere it was just of just a plethora then the market hunting is what killed that yeah crazy yeah that's all we've come back from now and now as they say there's more big-game animals now than there was a hundred years ago which would be after that yeah yeah it's just it would have been amazing to see what it looked like though yeah yeah I mean that's kind of what we're that's why you go over the next ridge yeah every time yeah let's let's keep going I made that morning early oh no it's the morning I killed but yeah it's like over the next ridge kept us going kept us going it sounded like there's Bulls going crazy over the next ridge fine with that shot that you guys got to of that bull coming up to you yeah coming screaming up the hill that big ole ole man yeah ten yards that's so crazy dump them that close is such an enormous animal - yeah ya know and that was that that was Rianna did a great job filming that she did yeah I'm dead and then her video that she showed us of that giant oval she shot and that was a public land bull yeah yeah big bull night no big old giant yeah and his footage which she's on her knees and this thing is like coming by her like looked like it was like 15 16 yards it was really close right yeah yeah and she shot mid bugle yeah yeah it's just so so happy for her because like I told her there's not many women I know of that have went on public land and killed Bulls like that with a bow I mean that just doesn't happen right I mean is a made amazing accomplishment yeah it's like another degree harder than it is for men because just the physical difficulty you the strength that you have to have to be able to maneuver your way through the woods like that especially Iraq with I mean she packed it out too so she's got a hundred pounds on her back a lot of guys can't do that yeah she's and then she's worked up to Bill to shoot 60 pounds with her bow that's very impressive for a girl yeah yeah she's she's strong she works hard she's got a great attitude and man I love seeing her be successful ya know she's it's cool to see someone who's legitimately dedicated to it because you know we've talked about this before there's things that are happening right now where people are getting into certain activities when you're a woman because it gets you a lot of attention because if you're a hot woman and you shoot a gun in a bikini yeah out of people gonna pay attention to you if you're a hot woman and you go bow hunting a lot of people gonna pay attention to you yeah but it doesn't mean that they're not legit and in her case she's 100% legit yeah it's cool to see I know it's nice to see it be all real no I know I told her she makes these cooking videos I'm like God if you just want some view just do that in a bikini do the same thing it's like what are you trying to do here she's like no I'm gonna do it the right way yeah I give her a bad time at I totally respect her why she because if I was a girl I'd be a whore I would have like a fucking glittery bikini on everywhere you've been walking around camp and your panties 100% I'm doing my toes at the table with everybody I'd be a ho if I was a girl yeah camp full of a hundred dudes boy yeah boys time to get some attention yeah all right you know for women because like they they want a certain amount of attention but you got to be careful on how you get it yeah is that people don't respect you I know and that's does a great job with that yeah it's a different game though than with men I know no men don't have that let struggle the balance struggle of people respecting you but also being attracted to you it's like four girls like they have to they even have to be careful with how they dress you know you dress a certain way you look great certainly you look hot more over the edge now you're a whore yeah no no it's like no got this like a cutoff we're yeah it's a sweet spot there's a sweet spot with ladies that's hard to find that sweet spot man yeah Tony killed a good bowl there here - yes she did or we got that yeah yeah and a good luck yeah he's another one the Tiffany Lee they're great people yeah it's also cool to have met them you know - I feel just really fortunate to be able to be friends with all these people that I know are these like really world-renowned experienced hunters you know you I can learn so much like I said it's like just being friends with you and Dudley it's cut down my learning curve by decades you know just it's there's no I mean if the comparison would be like learning basketball from Michael Jordan or something like that yeah if you wanted to learn like he's not gonna show you how to play basketball the beautiful thing about hunting is and one of the coolest things about you guys is everyone's so open about information yeah it's not no it's not thought of as a competitions everybody's looking to get and hunters are so maligned and sort of like misunderstood by society that a lot of people that are hunters are really excited for any new person to get into it yeah and look at it correct no it's huge it's big I mean I used to not tell anybody anything like that like even my buddy used to say he'd give me a bad time because I wouldn't tell anybody were hunted I wouldn't I was like so protective he'd be like he called me Mac because he's like you don't even want to go by your real name it's your name backwards is her code name and so he'd call me Mac because I was so secretive on everything so I've been where I'm not helping nobody help me I'm not helping anyone that's I've been there so it's like it but it's it feels good like I said when you see new successful as everything that's an interesting thing with a lot of public land hunters right they don't want to tell anybody their spots no because you work hard to find those and you work hard to find em in a psyche it can take y'all cunning there's not good elk hunting spots everywhere I mean you got a bust your ass to find good al kind and then when you find it you're like I'm not gonna screw this up because you tell one person and nobody just keeps something to themselves so you know then they say well do you mind if I go there now you can go there then be like well I went there but then my brother had to count or my buddy had to come well then they couldn't go by themselves so then next time they and it pretty soon there's you know if you have a good spot like in the wilderness it can be ruined by two other guys yep they need all two people and so on and so it's like it's it's really hard public land is it's it's you won't got to protect it I love that show the Western hunter with Nate's AIDS yeah and this one of the things that he documents on the show all the time is the grind of public land huh yeah he's always getting he's always running into guys on horseback that run off the animals yeah and he deep deep deep into the backcountry still find guys the wall tent like fuck it's a grind he's a great hunter he's a he's a he's a very first person to fill me in the wilderness oh wow Nate was it's like he had never he wanted hunter wilderness had never done it he knew I had done it actually no maybe it was che a man who felt first but then I can't remember maybe Nate was first they were both right around 2002 but I Nate I saw him at the bow rack and he's like man I've always wanted the wilderness and I'm like well do you want to film me yeah I'd love to so he didn't know how to run a camera but his sister was getting married on a Friday opening day with Saturday I said if you go to the wedding you drive to the trailhead after the reception you get to the trailhead at 1:00 in the morning you walk all night 12 miles you can be in there by first light SATA opening day and I'll tell you where to go and it's like on these maps and all this you know I thought there's no way this kids ever gonna make it so this was how many 17 years ago he's not old now so 17 years ago so he's probably like 20 back then early 20s and I got up opening morning and I went up to the saddle way deep in the wilderness and I'm like looking where I told Nate to come from first light comes and I look over there and here's this guy walk in and it's him and he made it all the way in there drove all night packed in all in the dark made it in there and film me it took day six day six I killed a buck he filmed a great job day seven I killed a bull and he that was his first ever with a camera and now you see what he's doing on Western hunter just amazing work but one of the best shows that it really depicts he gets it yes he gets it and he gets the the grind as he said and the emotion tied to it and he I think his first bowl with the bow is when he's 13 Wow and all he's ever done is bow hunt Wow his whole life so that he's one of the most I mean I respect him as much as anybody he's just and it was just I saw 17 years ago he had it he had a thin and he wanted to learn and he wanted to experience it and then he's went from there to making one bestially such a great lesson in that that there's the opportunity it's not easy you're going to a wedding at 1:00 in the morning you're gonna have to hike in yeah it's a 12 mile hike it should take you about five or six hours but if you want to do it yeah there it is a lot of people like Fogg know all sorts of excuses not welcome in I'll be there you know that night Saturday night ya know I said I need you there opening morning that's a giant part of life is those opportunities capitalizing on those opportunities cuz a person could easily have blown that off give me another time maybe I'll hunt with you next year yeah maybe you'll hunt with you and then nothing ever happens and then you don't get that momentum who knows and then maybe there's no Western hunter yeah yeah who knows I mean be this it's but as a human being those opportunities like that's how you build you build on the capitalizing on those opportunities and making it happen and then you keep going that's the whole thing it's like these uncomfortable moments pushing through them having discipline and drive getting it done when you don't want to yeah and then go oh I know how to do that I can do that I can grind through this yeah I can get through it and then that's how you build in life you just step by step by step you keep doing it and that's when when that happens I mean it's happened to me in my life where I've decided to do something and it was really difficult but when I got through it I go I can do it I can push through things I think things happen it's such an important lesson and there's probably one of the most lessons taking advantage it did did you see the he did a show on ROI on like a tribute did you ever see I don't see that May did is it on the Western hunter he did it was yeah yeah I don't see that I find it because he went with Wayne to were released to hunt on Kodiak Island for deer and but at the beginning of the show he had he made he filmed one of the coolest things is Roy and I went to the backcountry 100 brown bear on snow off snow machines and Roy had a cabin back there and Nate went back there and filmed it oh you told me that story crazy I'm doing backcountry fixes on busted snow yeah yeah yeah so Nate was there for that that whole thing and he said he's never felt like he was gonna die more times than he did I mean it was so much was good but it's just like a normal backcountry in Alaska it's like it's different up there than it is here because there's some meat you can die so easily and down here it's pretty tame you know in comparison but he anyway he got it on film so I have that whole film and he took he took clips of that and made a tribute to Roy and it was pretty special that's why should look it up that's awesome I will cam let's wrap this up yeah it's great to see you brother as always thank you so much and I'm bringing to the comedy store tonight I can't create a comedy Mecca I can't wait alright that's it everybody thank you thanks brother I thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
